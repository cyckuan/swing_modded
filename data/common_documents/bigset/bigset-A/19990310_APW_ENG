<HEADLINE>  Buser Leads Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McGRATH, Alaska (AP) -- Three-time champion Martin Buser usually  
likes to keep an eye on other mushers in the Iditarod Trail Sled 
Dog Race. This year, he insists he doesn't care what anyone else 
does on the trail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing it differently this year,'' he said while eating a  
plate of shepherd's pie in McGrath late Tuesday. ``I'm not looking 
at the other competition -- I'm just looking at myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buser, from Big Lake, was first into the McGrath checkpoint,  
arriving behind a team of 10 dogs at 10:45 p.m. Alaska time. 
McGrath is about 365 miles into the 1,100-mile race across the 
Alaska wilderness from Anchorage to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	An enthusiastic crowd knew Buser was coming, and waited outside  
in temperatures of 15 below zero, for him to drive his team off the 
Kuskokwim River. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser blasted through Nikolai, 48 miles from McGrath, at 5:20  
p.m., while other lead mushers were still resting their teams. He 
covered the distance from Nikolai to McGrath in about 5 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch Seavey left Nikolai about two hours after Buser, and he  
was followed in short order by Charlie Boulding, Doug Swingley, Dee 
Dee Jonrowe, and defending champion Jeff King. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser started the race Sunday with 16 dogs, and while he  
typically drops six or more during the race, to have only 10 this 
early is unusual. But he said having fewer dogs won't change his 
race strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't worry about the dogs you drop because you know you  
dropped them for the right reasons,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley led the front pack into Nikolai, a tiny Athabaskan  
Indian village, at 1:38 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the lead pack hunkered down on the snowy tundra  
outside Nikolai, waiting for the warmest part of the day to pass 
before starting to move again. 
</P>
<P>
	``For my dogs, this is cold weather,'' said Swingley, of  
Lincoln, Mont. He's the only non-Alaskan to win the Iditarod. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, who broke a main stanchion on his sled on the south  
side of the Alaska Range, said the Farewell Burn was in good shape 
compared to previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bumpy, but it's got snow on it,'' he said while rubbing  
salve into his dogs' paws. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley patched his sled with a thick strut of willow held in  
place by hose clamps. He said that would be good enough to get him 
to Takotna, 70 miles up the trail from Nikolai. There, he has a 
spare sled waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	King of Denali Park arrived in Nikolai about a half-hour after  
Swingley. He was limping and in obvious pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I twisted my knee and it hurts like hell,'' said King. ``I  
almost lost my team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King fell off his sled Tuesday between Rohn and Nikolai. He said  
that while his right knee was painful, he would be able to stand on 
it ``as long as I don't have to do any fancy dancing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jonrowe, of Willow, last year's runner-up, was third into  
Nikolai, followed by Norwegian Harald Tunheim and veteran musher 
John Barron of Big Lake.

<HEADLINE> Navy Pilot Crash Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITING FIELD, Fla. (AP) -- Two Navy pilots killed in a collision  
were participating in an unauthorized five plane formation and at 
one point lost sight of other planes, according to a naval 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Cmdr. Joseph Linehan, a flight instructor, failed to brief  
the group adequately on the maneuver and showed poor judgment in 
participating in an unauthorized formation, according to the Navy's 
review of the accident released this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also concluded that a communication breakdown and  
Linehan losing sight of the other planes also contributed to the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Linehan, 35, of New York City, was killed in the June 11 crash  
along with Marine 2nd Lt. Lara Vincent, 23, of Mystic, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommended that instructor pilots receive approval  
before deviating from training exercises and for formations 
involving more than three planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened while squadron members were en route to  
Key West Naval Air Station. Once they got in their places, Linehan 
told the group via radio that the sun was in his eyes and he moved 
about 100 feet to the right of the formation to take photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Linehan, then, moved out of the others' sight but tried to  
rejoin the formation and reappeared near another plane, clipping 
its underside. The tail of his plane was severed by the other 
plane's propeller. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Vincent, a Marine Corps student pilot in Linehan's plane,  
freed herself but her parachute didn't deploy fully and she became 
tangled in the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	The single-engine, turboprop T-34C Turbo Mentor went down in  
about two feet of water in Tavernier, in the upper Florida Keys.

<HEADLINE> Carreras Sings Premiere of Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jose Carreras of Three Tenors fame is coming  
out of 12 years' absence from the American opera scene to take the 
title role tonight in ``Sly,'' a 72-year-old opera based on 
Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
	The opera, by Ernanno Wolf-Ferrari, has never been produced  
commercially in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish tenor, who has struggled with leukemia, continues to  
sing concerts that are less strenuous than major operatic roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sly'' is directed by Marta Domingo, wife of another of the  
Three Tenors -- Placido Domingo, the artistic director and singing 
star of the Washington Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	The title character -- Christopher Sly -- is a beggar in the  
first, framework scene of a Shakespeare play, sleeping off a binge 
outside a tavern. A passing nobleman hauls him off to his castle on 
a cruel whim, dresses him in fine clothes and tries to convince him 
that he is a nobleman, suffering from amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone then sees a performance by a visiting troupe of  
Shakespeare's ``The Taming of the Shrew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Sly nor the nobleman has anything to do with  
Shakespeare's main plot, and directors often leave this episode out 
of ``Shrew'' performances. But the Italian Giovacchino Forzano 
turned it into a tragic story, making Sly a poor poet who romances 
the nobleman's mistress and kills himself in the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-Italian composer Wolf-Ferrari made it into an opera,  
first performed in 1927 in Milan and later elsewhere in Europe, but 
never in North America. The composer is best known for lighter 
work, the operas ``Secrets of Suzanne'' and ``Jewels of the 
Madonna.'' Some critics consider ``Sly'' his best serious opera. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Opera has scheduled eight performances at the  
Kennedy Center this month, sung in Italian with English surtitles.

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us Earns Fall 18 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) -- Toys R Us Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings  
fell 18 percent from a year ago as the nation's largest toy 
retailer lost business to discount chains like Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramus, N.J.-based Toys R Us also struggled amid weakness in  
the toy industry worldwide, with a lack of blockbuster toys -- 
except for Furby and a few others -- driving consumers to stores. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fourth-quarter ended Jan. 30, Toys R Us earned $310  
million, or $1.23 a diluted share, compared with earnings of $378 
million, or $1.32 a share, during the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a $13 million charge, the company earned $323 million,  
or $1.28 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge is related to an agreement to settle third-party  
claims in legal actions relating to allegations in 1996 that Toys R 
Us pressured its suppliers, including Hasbro and Mattel, not to 
ship its most popular toys to discount clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $4.94 billion, down from $4.98  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the decline in earnings, Toys R Us' results topped  
Wall Street analysts' estimates. Its stock closed down 56 1/4 cents at 
$17.37 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive officer Robert Nakasone attributed the weak  
results to strong comparisons a year ago, when there was lots of 
buying of virtual pets, action figures and video systems and games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the retailer also faces growing competition from discount  
stores like Wal-Mart and Target, which offer many of the same 
products at cheaper prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us closed 90 stores and cut 3,000 jobs last year and  
decided to revamp its store format to make it easier to navigate 
and to add more bargain items, electronics and children's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The `C-3' design will be implemented in 200 new stores in 1999  
and 325 more stores in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Toys R Us lost $132 million, or 50 cents a share,  
compared with earnings of $490 million, or $1.70 a share, a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results include a restructuring charge of $508 million.  
Excluding the charges, net income was $376 million, or $1.41 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $11.17 billion, up slightly from $11.04 billion in  
1997.

<HEADLINE> Final Four Is Maryland's Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Len Elmore and Len Bias never made it.  
Neither did Buck Williams or Walt Williams. Joe Smith and John 
Lucas fell short, too. 
</P>
<P>
	All-America players at Maryland, all of them. And there's one  
other link -- none of them played in a Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's Steve Francis' turn to try to take the Terrapins to a  
place they've never reached. Expected to go far in the NCAAs, they 
begin their bid Thursday in the first round of the South Regional 
against last year's tournament darling, Valparaiso. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no added pressure,'' Francis said before practice  
Wednesday. ``We're not here for a vacation, we're here to play 
basketball. Hopefully, we have six games to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The explosive guard sparked No. 5 Maryland the whole season,  
averaging 17.2 points in his first year since transferring from a 
junior college. The Terrapins are seeded second, but many predict 
they will emerge from the South, not top seed Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there were times when expectations were so high that it  
was tough on our players. Hopefully, we learned from that,'' coach 
Gary Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, we were always the team that would sneak up on  
somebody,'' he said. ``This year, we usually had the higher ranking 
when we played good teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland and Valparaiso play in the first of four games at the  
Orlando Arena, followed by Louisville vs. Creighton. At night, St. 
John's takes on Samford and then Indiana plays George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Maryland and Valparaiso have never met, the Terps know  
all about their 15th-seeded opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the whole basketball world learned about Valpo in last  
year's tournament. In a play epitomizing March Madness, the 
Crusaders stunned favored Mississippi when Bryce Drew -- son of 
coach Homer Drew -- hit a buzzer-beating 3-pointer for a 70-69 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone heard the story. Coach Drew and his son, the  
Cinderella story of last year's tournament,'' Maryland senior Laron 
Profit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Valpo went on to reach the round of 16, beating Florida State  
before losing to Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``We received a lot of attention for that,'' coach Drew said.  
``People now know we're 50 miles from Chicago. Most people now know 
how to pronounce Valparaiso, with a long `a,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryce now plays in the NBA for the Houston Rockets and last  
year's last-second play -- called ``Pacer'' -- has been replaced by a 
new one, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a different play this year,'' Homer said. ``It's called  
`Houston.' I think you can see why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A team looking to become this year's Valpo is 14th-seeded  
Samford, making its first NCAA appearance. Billing themselves as 
``Southern-Fried Princeton,'' the Bulldogs run the same kind of 
deliberate offense as their Ivy League idols. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Tillette has patterned his style after Princeton,  
talking to its coaches and watching game films. Last week, he even 
traveled to New Jersey to watch the Tigers play Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Samford will face a tough test in much more athletic St.  
John's. The Red Storm led the Big East in scoring in their first 
year under coach Mike Jarvis, but have not won an NCAA tournament 
game since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana also is looking for some redemption as coach Bob  
Knight's team has lost five of its last six tournament games. The 
Hoosiers are coming off last week's 16-point loss to Illinois in 
their first Big Ten tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	George Washington is led by 5-foot-4 Shawnta Rogers, the  
Atlantic 10 player of the year. The Colonials already have had a 
tough time -- because of bad weather, their plane was delayed 
several hours out of the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	Creighton is 8-1 against teams in this year's tournament.  
Louisville, however, last month beat a more formidable force -- for 
the first time ever, the NCAA overturned a postseason ban and let 
the Cardinals play. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalized for a recruiting violation, coach Denny Crum's team  
was freed because of a procedural error. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we found out we were going to play, the kids have been  
pretty focused,'' Crum said.

<HEADLINE> Mo., Va. Execute Convicted Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A prisoner whose case inspired a Vatican plea  
that his life be spared was put to death early today for killing a 
prison guard during a 1983 riot. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Roberts, 46, was executed by injection at Potosi  
Correctional Center, muttering ``you're killing an innocent man'' 
before he died at 12:07 a.m. His fate was sealed after Gov. Mel 
Carnahan rejected a clemency request. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier, George Quesinberry Jr., 37, was executed by  
injection in Jarratt, Va., for killing company owner Thomas Haynes 
during a botched burglary at Tri-City Electrical Supply Co. in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want my family to know I love them,'' Quesinberry said.  
``And to the victim's family, I am sorry for what I've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks ago, Carnahan commuted convicted killer Darrell  
Mease's death sentence to life in prison after a personal request 
from Pope John Paul II, who visited St. Louis in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor last month refused to halt the execution of  
convicted killer James Rodden. The Vatican did not intercede on his 
behalf, but did write to Carnahan last week seeking mercy for 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said he was nowhere near Tom Jackson, 62, when the guard  
was stabbed to death by inmates at the Moberly Training Center for 
Men. Other guards say Roberts held Jackson while two inmates 
stabbed him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys questioned why eyewitnesses didn't initially  
name Roberts, who they say had no blood on him after the stabbing.

<HEADLINE> Washington Digs Out From Snowfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many of the 270,000 federal workers in the  
capital stayed home Wednesday and schools and many businesses were 
closed as the city dug out from its biggest snowfall in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Washingtonians shoveled and salted their way out from under more  
than 8 inches of snow that fell downtown. Up to a foot fell in some 
suburbs -- the most since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wish I had gotten a Jeep,'' said John Smithson as he  
dug his sports car out of a high drift caused by snowplows early 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The snowfall was a political, as well as a physical, challenge  
for commuters. The city's new mayor, Anthony Williams, had pledged 
to improve inefficient city services -- such as snow removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams pronounced the city's response a success Wednesday,  
even though hundreds of secondary city streets were untreated and 
unplowed. Main streets through downtown were generally clear by the 
morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to look at how fast we're getting to the residential  
streets,'' Williams said when asked why 196 contract trucks that 
could have supplemented municipal efforts were never requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Public Works Department mobilized 280 workers and 103 trucks  
in the first hours of the snowfall Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal workers were allowed to take a day of leave because of  
the snow, and many other businesses closed or kept short hours 
Wednesday. Schools across the region were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Health and Human Services Department, which administers  
federal child care programs, spokesman Campbell Gardett said many 
workers who made it to the office apparently could not get a sitter 
for their school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see a lot of children here with their parents -- perhaps a  
real world view of child care,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Want To Make Most of NCAA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Coach Denny Crum and Louisville had to beat  
an undefeated opponent just to get a chance to play in the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The seventh-seeded Cardinals, who face Creighton on Thursday  
afternoon in the first round, last month became the first team ever 
to have the NCAA overturn a postseason ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was justified,'' Crum said. ``It was easy to  
envision us winning the appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An NCAA appeals committee cited ``procedural error'' in the case  
of recruiting violations by former Louisville assistant Scooter 
McCray. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said Louisville and McCray were not adequately  
warned about the severity of the violations, and that may have 
altered their defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling made the Cardinals eligible for postseason play just  
four weeks before the start of the Conference USA tournament. 
Louisville, given a second chance by the committee, rattled off 
eight victories in its next 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we found out, the kids became focused,'' Crum said.  
``They came out and worked hard every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How far Louisville (19-10) can advance in the tournament will  
depend on Crum's ability to get his players on the same page. Crum 
has done it before, with his 42 tournament victories ranking him 
third in tournament history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played some pretty good basketball,'' Crum said. ``Our  
biggest problem is that we need everyone to play well on the same 
night.''

<P>
	Fifth-year senior Cameron Murray was glad to get a chance to  
play at least one more game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling to have everything behind us,'' Murray  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals feature an up-tempo offense similar to Creighton.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're really balanced and all five of their guys have the  
potential for big games,'' Creighton coach Dana Altman said. ``We 
don't want to run up and down with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creighton (21-8), which last was in the NCAAs in 1991, takes a  
six-game winning streak into the game. The Bluejays earned an 
automatic bid by winning the Missouri Valley Conference tournament 
last week in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is overlooking us,'' said Creighton's Rodney Buford,  
one of 12 players in the 92-year history of the MVC to score 2,000 
points. ``They don't know what kind of program we have and what 
kind of athletes we have. We have a lot of hard-working guys, and 
you can't take that for granted.''

<HEADLINE> Nevada Court OKs Action Vs. Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Boxer Mike Tyson lost a round in a  
court battle involving refund demands from up to 2 million people 
who paid $49.95 to watch the pay-for-view television fight between 
Tyson and heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Supreme Court ruled that a number of suits filed  
against Tyson and promoter Don King could go forward as a 
nationwide class-action suit in Clark County District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in a brief order Tuesday, refused to overturn the  
order of District Judge Gene Porter that the suits could be 
considered a class action for Nevada residents and those in other 
states. Court records say this could include up to 2 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, now serving time in a Maryland jail for assault, was  
disqualified in the third round of the June 28, 1997 bout after 
twice biting Holyfield. More than 30 suits were filed across the 
nation by disgruntled viewers who, according to court documents, 
suggest Tyson threw the fight. They want their money back on 
grounds that he was guilty of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the suits were consolidated into a nationwide  
class-action suit in New York. In late 1997, Porter agreed to 
certify the case as a nationwide class action. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Tyson and King appealed to the Supreme Court,  
arguing that Porter abused his discretion by certifying a duplicate 
suit in Nevada as a class action when one existed in New York. The 
same issues were raised in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the unhappy fight fans said Tyson and King failed to  
demonstrate ``any irreparable damage they will suffer or identify 
any abuse of discretion'' by Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice T. Charles Ramos of the New York Supreme Court on Oct.  
22, 1998 dismissed the complaint in that state and denied the TV 
viewers any right to discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Colby Williams, Las Vegas lawyer for the class action in  
Nevada, said Ramos' ruling is being appealed in New York, where the 
Supreme Court is the lowest of three court levels. He said lawyers 
have agreed to put a hold on the Nevada action until the issue is 
resolved in New York.

<HEADLINE> '20 Dates' Born From Rejection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The idea for ``20 Dates'' was born out of  
rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	Not rejection by women, although that came later.  
</P>
<P>
	We're talking about rejection by directors, producers and anyone  
else it takes to get a part in a movie or to sell a script. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the motivation for Myles Berkowitz, whose  
documentary-style film, ``20 Dates,'' is being released by Fox 
Searchlight. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a dream come true, although he is wary.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've just gone through 15 years of rejection, and the only way  
I survived them was to try not to get too depressed, try not to 
commit too much to any single 'no,''' Berkowitz says. ``So now that 
I'm getting 'yeses,' I've got to keep an even keel or else 
everything will go out of whack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a cold, rainy day in Manhattan. Berkowitz lives in Los  
Angeles, but he feels right at home. He was born and raised in New 
York. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied 
political science and marketing. After graduation, he studied 
acting with John Strasberg and appeared in several off-Broadway 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, he moved to Los Angeles ``to break into the movies.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I didn't want to make movies,'' says Berkowitz.  
``Sometimes I feel like I was bitten by a vampire at night. I can 
only tell you that when I was in college, one night I went to a 
midnight screening of 'The Graduate,' and I said, 'this is the 
greatest thing that I have ever seen. I want to make a movie like 
that.' And that's what got me into the movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The years rolled by. Hollywood scarcely noticed him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I woke up one day in L.A. and I realized, 'Wow, I've been here  
for 12 years and I'm failing,''' says Berkowitz, 36. ``And it was 
the crossroad of my life, really, in that it seemed very clear to 
me that I actually may not get my dream, it may not come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's when he decided to make his own film.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent all this time trying to get into other people's  
movies or trying to sell a script so that other people could make 
the movie, and I thought, 'You know what? If I fail, I fail. But at 
least I want to go down fighting, I want to go down actually making 
a movie, and then if nothing happens with it, at least I'd know I 
gave it my best shot and I'd be able to move on with my life.' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I didn't think I'd be able to move on unless I made a  
movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berkowitz had been married -- briefly -- and was recently  
divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	He reasoned: Why not pursue two goals at once? He put together  
$60,000 to make the film and started going out on dates. 
Specifically, ``20 Dates'' -- which proved a sticking point when he 
met Ms. Right and she wanted him to wrap things up. (His major 
financial backer also grew restless.) 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the prospect of losing Ms. Right, Berkowitz plunged  
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you see a film called '17 Dates'?'' he asks, with a  
touch of disbelief in his voice. ``If you were to ask me back then 
when I started, what was more important, the girl or the movie, I 
would say the movie. Absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the film, he demonstrates his lack of dating skills  
as he tries almost anything to meet -- and impress -- women. 
</P>
<P>
	This includes bungee jumping (``the worst thing I've done in my  
entire life''); posing as a photographer at a wedding (``I used to 
crash weddings all the time in Los Angeles -- this was nothing new 
to me''); and borrowing a small child to attract women on the beach 
(it was his agent's son). 
</P>
<P>
	Then he met Elisabeth Wagner, who sold linens in a shopping mall  
and studied at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	The two clicked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the project got away from me,'' Berkowitz says with  
a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Still determined to remain faithful to his project, Berkowitz  
continued to date other women. 
</P>
<P>
	``A date is a very emotional experience,'' he says. ``It's a  
very intense three to four hours with a beginning, a middle, an 
end. It's got humor, it's got tragedy, it's got tension. It's got 
anything you can ask for in a drama or a comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's also got a lot of raw emotions.''  
</P>
<P>
	That might explain why several of his dates were unhappy when he  
told them a hidden camera had taped their evening together. (We're 
talking lawsuits and personal injury here.) 
</P>
<P>
	Berkowitz made it through ``20 Dates'' -- the last three under  
Wagner's watchful eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he spent a year editing more than 130 hours of video for  
the 88-minute film. 
</P>
<P>
	And what started out as ``a mean, little vicious comedy about  
dating'' became a romantic comedy with a happy Hollywood ending. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkowitz proposed marriage -- and Wagner accepted.

<HEADLINE> GM Launches Web Site To Sell Autos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- You can't kick the tires, but you can take a  
virtual tour of a General Motors Corp. showroom on the automaker's 
new Web site, which was launched Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospective buyers can go on line to get details about every GM  
make and model, independent third party competitive comparisons and 
access to the new vehicle inventories of nearly 6,000 dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers also can apply online for financing, send electronic  
messages to a dealer to get the best purchase price on the exact 
vehicle they want, and schedule a test drive. 
</P>
<P>
	GM introduced its GM BuyPower service in October 1997 in  
California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho and expanded it to the 
entire country Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``GM BuyPower puts consumers in control of the car buying  
process. It was obvious to us this one-of-a-kind service should be 
made available to all consumers searching for a more convenient way 
to shop and buy at their own pace,'' said Ann Noel Blakney, 
BuyPower's national director. 
</P>
<P>
	Several rival automakers, including Ford Motor Co., BMW and  
Nissan, already quote car prices on their Web pages.

<HEADLINE> Snow Storm Blankets East, Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Marian Andersen was just about to move the last of her red and  
yellow snow shovels at Guse Hardware from a display wall into the 
store's basement when the storm hit. 
</P>
<P>
	With Minneapolis blanketed under 16 inches of snow, Andersen's  
shovels were in demand once again. ``That's what we're here for,'' 
she said with a smile Tuesday as she watched a customer walk out 
with a new shovel. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Plains to the East Coast, a lot of people were reaching  
for shovels today. The storms that began in the Midwest snarled 
traffic, knocked out power and shut down airports and businesses as 
they churned to the east Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts in Virginia and Maryland were closed again  
today as light snow continued to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first major snowstorm of the season for Washington,  
D.C., leading the House to postpone Tuesday's floor votes, delaying 
flights in and out of Dulles and Ronald Reagan National airports, 
and delaying a memorial service for the late Supreme Court Justice 
Harry A. Blackmun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beautiful, but it does make extra work,'' said Ruth  
Burkholder as she shoveled the red brick sidewalk outside her baked 
goods store in Sharpsburg, Md., which received about 5 inches of 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my mother February was so nice, now we're making up for  
it in March,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a foot of snow fell in Iowa, while parts of Indiana,  
Ohio and Maryland had more than 10 inches and northern Georgia 
labored under a layer of ice 2 inches thick. Traffic-related deaths 
were blamed on the storm in at least six states. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow tapered off in the most areas by Tuesday afternoon, but  
a foot of snow possible by tonight in the West Virginia mountains 
and other areas, including Baltimore, were getting a fresh coat of 
snow this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're reloading the salt trucks and sending them back out,''  
said Rose Mulhausen, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Highway 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve-year-old Daniel Warden avoided a science test when his  
Dayton, Ohio, school was closed Tuesday. Instead, he went sledding 
with his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a big science test today and I wanted to get it over  
with, but there's always tomorrow,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only scattered snow was predicted today in Ohio, to the relief  
of many. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice at certain times -- white, clean, pure,'' Russell  
Carson said as he took a break from clearing his driveway in the 
Dayton suburb of Moraine. ``But ... right now, we're looking 
forward to spring -- nice warm weather.''

<HEADLINE> Lake Placid Lands Goodwill Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Turner Sports has announced the first Winter  
Goodwill Games will take be held at Lake Placid, N.Y., next Feb. 
17-20. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be competition in seven sports -- bobsled, figure  
skating, luge, skiing, ski jumping, snowboarding and short track 
speedskating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited about expanding the Goodwill Games into a  
winter sports franchise,'' said Harvey Schiller, president of 
Turner Sports. ``The Winter Goodwill Games are a great addition to 
TNT's sports lineup, and they will allow another group of athletes 
a chance to compete for Goodwill Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lake Placid, which hosted the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics,  
beat out Lillehammer, Norway, for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous Summer Goodwill Games have been televised on TBS, but  
Turner's other network, TNT, will carry 16 hours of Winter Goodwill 
Games programming. 
</P>
<P>
	A $20 million renovation project has already begun to rebuild  
the Lake Placid bobsled and luge tracks, which have fallen apart 
since the 1980 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goodwill Games were the idea of media mogul Ted Turner, who  
began the event in 1986 in response to the Cold War boycotts of the 
1980 and 1984 Olympic Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2001 Summer Goodwill Games are scheduled for 12 days in the  
fall in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It will involve 12 sports 
-- basketball, swimming, beach volleyball, track cycling, boxing, 
track and field, diving, triathlon, figure skating, weightlifting, 
gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics and surf lifesaving.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Kamieniecki Makes Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Scott Kamieniecki doesn't have much  
to show for his 1998 season -- two wins and a scar on his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a long year,'' he said Wednesday. ``A very long year.''  
</P>
<P>
	After Kamieniecki started 30 games and went 10-6 in 1997, the  
Baltimore Orioles rewarded the right-hander a $6.1 million, 
two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamieniecki didn't provide much of an initial return on their  
investment, pitching in only 12 games last year and taking three 
trips to the disabled list during a horrid, injury-plagued season 
in which he went 2-6 with a 6.75 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't pitch after Aug. 21 and underwent surgery to repair a  
herniated disk in his neck in September, an operation that ended 
his season and left him with a two-inch scar. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Kamieniecki is healthy again and projected to be  
the fourth starter in the Orioles' rotation. His bid to return to 
the form he exhibited in 1997 began in earnest Wednesday when he 
pitched two innings against the Boston Red Sox -- his first 
appearance against outside competition in seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers looked good -- two innings, no runs, two hits and two  
walks. But Kamieniecki was critical of virtually every facet of his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have thrown 35 or 40 pitches; maybe four or five where  
I wanted to,'' he said. ``I was expecting a little better than 
that. I don't how I didn't give up any runs, as bad as I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When someone suggested that the poor showing could be attributed  
to the fact that he hadn't pitched competitively in months, 
Kamieniecki dismissed the notion with a wave of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any physical problems. There are no aches or  
pains and everything has gone pretty well,'' he said. ``Hopefully I 
just had a bad day. This is the worst, by far, the last four to six 
weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles manager Ray Miller was looking for three innings but  
pulled the plug after two. After a discussion with Kamieniecki 
outside the Baltimore dugout, he sent the pitcher to the bullpen to 
take a few more throws. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Miller, Kamieniecki will be treated carefully until  
he proves he's completely healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly going to conscious of pitch-counts with a guy  
who had neck surgery,'' Miller said. ``If he progresses, he'll 
probably start the season as a six-inning pitcher because of the 
problems he had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, unlike Kamieniecki, liked what he saw Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, Kammy is angry every day he pitches,'' Miller  
said. ``I saw some first-pitch breaking balls, some 2-0 fastballs 
... If he continues to pitch and get people out, he'll have a spot 
in the rotation.''

<HEADLINE>  A's, Rookie of Year OK New Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- AL Rookie of the Year Ben Grieve agreed Wednesday  
to a $300,000, one-year contract with the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	A's general manager Billy Beane met Tuesday with Grieve's agent,  
Alan Hendricks. The team hopes to get a multiyear contract 
completed later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've preserved that opportunity. We still haven't  
accomplished what we set out to do,'' Beane said. ``This just takes 
the focus off the player's contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The A's had hoped for a multiyear contract before the start of  
the season. But Todd Helton's $12 million, four-year contract with 
Colorado last week upped Grieve's price, according to Beane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a much better chance a week or 10 days ago,'' Beane  
said. ``The Todd Helton contract torpedoed a lot of multiyear deals 
that were being discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grieve, who hit .288 with 18 homers and 89 RBIs last season,  
said he wasn't too concerned with getting a long-term deal before 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to if it is the right deal,'' he said. ``I  
wouldn't want to if it wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grieve, the A's first-round draft pick in 1994, was the minor  
league player of the year in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Emmylou, Dolly and Linda Are Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt  
can't explain why they sound so good singing together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad we do,'' Parton says. ``We do love to sing. Your  
whole life you wait to find those compatible voices. It's like 
making love. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get off on it. I do. I get so thrilled. When it buzzes, it  
is good. It's just like sex in that way. Don't fight it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their new CD, ``Trio II,'' was recently released, debuting in  
the No. 4 spot on Billboard's country album charts. 
</P>
<P>
	The CD was recorded in 1994. But they were too busy to promote  
it, so the album went on a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Asylum Records contacted Ronstadt at her home in Arizona.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a contract with them,'' Ronstadt, 52, explains.  
``I'm sitting in Tucson where I no longer apply makeup. I'm a 
servant for two children. They sent someone to my house to ask, 
`What do you intend to do with the future of your recording 
career?' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Well, we have this great record still in the can.'''  
</P>
<P>
	To her surprise, Asylum agreed to release ``Trio II.''  
</P>
<P>
	When Ronstadt phoned Parton, her response was ``Praise the  
Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronstadt didn't have a copy of the finished record. But all the  
tracks were located and the CD was assembled without having to 
rerecord any of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pictures on the CD's cover show the three singers when they  
were little girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows what we look like now,'' Harris says. ``It's  
intriguing to see what people look like as children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three singers met in the early 1970s. Several years later,  
almost by chance, they discovered their voices blended sweetly: 
Parton visited Harris in Los Angeles, Harris invited Ronstadt over, 
and they sang a little country harmony. They sang on Parton's TV 
show in 1976.

<P>
	``Trio,'' which sold 1.8 million copies, was released in 1987.  
The album produced four Top 10 hits, including the No. 1 ``To Know 
Him Is to Love Him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all so very proud of the first 'Trio' record and this  
one,'' Parton says. ``It's my two favorite things I've ever 
participated in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a gift,'' says Harris. ``I think it's a very  
special, healing record, the songs and the sound of our voices. 
I've been listening to it a lot. I'm quite moved by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parton, 53, is hoping the second album will be as popular as the  
first, and would like to record another CD if ``Trio II'' does 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronstadt and Harris are less interested in album sales.  
</P>
<P>
	``As little or as much as it sells, I think it should be out  
there for people to have an opportunity to have it,'' Harris says. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Ronstadt, ``I'd just like to get a chance to sing  
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronstadt is producing a record for Sony Classical on the history  
of glass music, including a glass instrument built by Benjamin 
Franklin. She and Harris, who will be 52 on April 2, are working on 
a record to be released in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to write for my next solo record,'' says Harris,  
this year's Grammy winner for ``Same Old Train'' with Clint Black, 
Joe Diffie, Merle Haggard, Alison Krauss, Patty Loveless, Earl 
Scruggs, Ricky Skaggs, Marty Stuart, Pam Tillis, Randy Travis, 
Travis Tritt and Dwight Yoakam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been trying to take a year off since last January,''  
Harris says. ``That hasn't worked out exactly. I have managed to 
get some writing done. I pretty much let my band go. I left my 
record company. I wanted to clean out my closet, so to speak, and 
put all my energy into writing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parton has a gospel special on TNN on April 1, and her East  
Tennessee theme park Dollywood will open for the 1999 season in 
April.

<HEADLINE> What To Name After Joltin' Joe? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- San Franciscans want to name something  
after Joe DiMaggio, who grew up in the city and became one of 
baseball's greatest players. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is, what?  
</P>
<P>
	Some say a street. Some prefer a school or playground. What  
about a park or a square? How about the new stadium being built for 
the San Francisco Giants? 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been so many wonderful ideas,'' said city  
Supervisor Gavin Newsom, a fourth-generation San Franciscan born 
too late to see DiMaggio play. He suggested a committee be formed 
to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Conso agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to give it a while. Give it a couple of weeks at  
least,'' said Conso, a waiter at the Gold Spike Restaurant in North 
Beach, the district where DiMaggio was raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``He grew up in North Beach,'' said Russ Gumina, executive  
director of the Salesian Boys and Girls Club, ``That was his home. 
He played in some of the leagues the club ran at the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio died this week at 84 after a five-month battle with  
lung cancer. His funeral is scheduled for Thursday at Sts. Peter 
and Paul's Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Just down the street is the North Beach Playground. DiMaggio  
played baseball there when he was a skinny kid. A lot of people 
think the park should bear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could almost see his house from the playground,'' Al  
Lacoco said. ``This is where he played -- right here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lois Tiano grew up in North Beach, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``My brother played with him,'' she said. ``We used to live up  
the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps, she thought, they could rename Washington Square, the  
hub of North Beach. ``That's an idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many remember the squabble when an attempt was made to  
rename Washington Square after former Mayor Joseph Alioto. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want consensus, not controversy,'' Newsom said. ``We want  
something that's appropriate and supported by the community. We 
want to do it in a way that's respectful of his memory.''

<HEADLINE> Stephen F. Austin Haunted by Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	More losses than the team would care to relive marred Stephen F.  
Austin's path to the NCAA women's basketball tournament. None was 
more devastating than the one that occurred on Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after an 85-84 loss to Northwestern State left the  
Ladyjacks an uncharacteristic 7-7, they received horrifying news: 
</P>
<P>
	Katrina Price, the star of last season's team and a revered  
figure at the school, was dead -- the victim of an apparently 
self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
	Price's death stunned the campus and put a team that already was  
struggling into an even deeper funk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had already lost a couple of basketball games. We were  
already low, so that was a hard hit to take,'' senior forward 
Anitra Davis said. ``It took us a while to rebound. Who's to say we 
completely rebounded?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But rebound they did. Stephen F. Austin has won 10 of its last  
12 games, including a 90-77 victory over Northwestern State in the 
finals of the Southland Conference tournament to earn a berth in 
the NCAA field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Jacks, seeded 15th in the Midwest Regional, play at  
second-seeded Texas Tech on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were questioning do they have the character and the  
heart to come back and get it done,'' coach Royce Chadwick said. 
``Well, they played great. For them to turn it around the way they 
have, I've never coached a team I'm more proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick said this loss was so difficult, and his players had no  
one to turn to for solace. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a player that loses a family member, usually  
they're gone for a while and when they come back, the others pull 
together and help them get through the tough times,'' he said. ``In 
our case, we all lost a family member and there was nobody on the 
team to help pull everybody through. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like forever,'' Chadwick said. ``We had counselors, we  
rescheduled a couple of games, we reorganized the majority of our 
schedule for two weeks to give ourselves an opportunity to recover. 
It was the toughest thing I've ever been through as a coach of a 
basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Have they recovered?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we'll ever be 100 percent over it,'' Chadwick  
said. ``But it doesn't possess us like it did at one time. You lay 
down at night and you can't sleep and when you finally do get over 
it, you wake up and before you get out from the covers, you're 
thinking about it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Price's death, this would not have been a typical  
season for Stephen F. Austin. The Ladyjacks have appeared regularly 
in the Top 25 through the years but never once this season. They 
went 25-4 a year ago but are 17-11 now, and their 12-6 Southland 
Conference record was their worst since joining the league 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not expected to lose here,'' said Davis, the team's  
leading scorer (19.8) and rebounder (9.1). ``This was a winning 
program. We probably lost more games this year than any other team. 
That's very disappointing, almost embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the past is past,'' she said, ``and we have to move on and  
start today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game at Texas Tech sends Chadwick back to his roots, He's  
from Floydada, Texas, which is 50 miles northeast of Lubbock. He 
knows the Tech coaches and most of the players and cheers for the 
Lady Raiders when he's not playing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick also knows how hard it is to win at Tech, but he's not  
going to complain about being sent there, not after the kind of 
season his team just endured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have gone to Saskatchewan,'' he said. ``It wouldn't  
have mattered. We just wanted an opportunity to play again.''

<HEADLINE> Torre Cancer Dampens Straw's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry sat in the New York  
Yankees dugout Wednesday, surrounded by a throng of reporters, 
quietly talking about his return from colon cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	This was supposed to be Strawberry's day, the afternoon the  
popular Yankee, whose illness inspired his team last October, made 
his return to the lineup earlier than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	But less than 25 feet away from Strawberry sat Joe Girardi,  
explaining the reaction he and his teammates had to the news that 
manager Joe Torre has prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest thing to understand is why,'' Girardi said about  
30 minutes after he broke the news to his teammates playing a 
split-squad game against the Boston Red Sox. ``The first thing that 
went through my mind is, `What's next?' You see Darryl coming back, 
and then you hear Joe has cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Girardi said Torre told him, Paul O'Neill and David Cone the  
news in the same way he manages the club: businesslike and 
unemotional. For the most part, Torre's players handled the news 
the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I understand, it is a good cancer to have,'' Derek  
Jeter said. ``There's no good cancer, but it is the best to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have grown all too accustomed to dealing with death  
and illness in recent years. David Cone's aneurysm and the death of 
Torre's brother Rocco and heart transplant for his brother Frank 
colored the 1996 championship season. 
</P>
<P>
	The past few months have been filled with stories of  
Strawberry's cancer, Joe DiMaggio's battle with lung cancer that 
ended in his death Monday, Catfish Hunter's fight with Lou Gehrig's 
Disease and former farmhand Mike Lowell's diagnosis with testicular 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cancer is a terrible word,'' O'Neill said in Bradenton, where  
the other half of the Yankees played. ``It's a scary thing for 
everybody. The main concern is to take care of this as soon as 
possible. Hopefully, he'll have a full recovery. This is life, not 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news was particularly difficult for Strawberry, who only one  
day earlier spoke of his excitement of convincing Torre to let him 
return to the lineup one week early. Strawberry went 1-for-4 in his 
debut, but his mind was clearly on his manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really couldn't get as motivated as I would have been,''  
Strawberry said. ``It is truly devastating when it happens. You ask 
how much can a person take. We as players are dedicated to our 
manager. We just have to go out and dedicate the season to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Yankees didn't learn of Torre's illness until  
Wednesday, Strawberry said he sensed his manager wasn't feeling 
right in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't as upbeat as he has been,'' Strawberry said. ``He  
was acting kind of different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre spent the day at his spring home in Tampa. There was no  
immediate word on what his course of treatment would be. But owner 
George Steinbrenner said he expected Torre back early next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe will be able to handle it,'' Steinbrenner said. ``He is a  
very courageous man. He should be back in 30 days, thanks to the 
miracles of modern-day medicine.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Targets Gun Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress are preparing to jump into  
both sides of the nascent legal battle some cities have launched 
against the gun industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., the point man in Congress for the National  
Rifle Association, led a bipartisan group of two dozen lawmakers 
who introduced legislation Tuesday to block cities and states from 
filing lawsuits to hold gun makers and distributors accountable for 
firearm violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a national issue and it cries out for a national  
remedy,'' said Barr, arguing that the lawsuits would destroy the 
constitutional right to bear arms while undermining the integrity 
of the nation's legal and free enterprise systems. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she intends to introduce  
legislation to guarantee cities the right to sue gun manufacturers 
and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government sends billions of dollars to local  
communities to fight crime,'' she said. ``If local governments 
believe the fight against crime is being hampered because of a mass 
proliferation of guns, I believe it is in the national interest to 
allow them to take action in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the successful state lawsuits against tobacco  
companies, Atlanta, New Orleans, Chicago, Miami and Bridgeport, 
Conn., filed lawsuits seeking to force the gun industry to take 
steps to ensure that guns are used properly and are not distributed 
to criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia General Assembly reacted to the Atlanta suit last  
month by enacting legislation to prohibit local governments from 
suing gun manufacturers and distributors. At least a dozen other 
states are considering similar legislation, said the NRA's Chuck 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell plans to pursue the lawsuit  
anyway, and that, Barr said, shows that Congress must step in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clearly a national problem and it is not going to go  
away,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr said the cities' lawsuits are based on a ``new, novel and  
abusive theory of law'' that, if upheld by the courts, could make 
any number of manufacturers liable for the misuse or criminal use 
of their products. 
</P>
<P>
	But gun control advocates said Barr's legislation would give the  
gun industry a special legal protection to which it's not entitled. 
</P>
<P>
	``This amounts to political obstruction of justice,'' said Bob  
Walker, president of Handgun Control. ``Barr is trying to use 
political means to stop lawsuits. If the cases are so frivolous, 
let the courts throw then out.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs ATM Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The spirit of bipartisanship is starting to  
fray within the House Banking Committee as it labors to draft 
legislation to knock down Depression-era barriers separating the 
financial services industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the conciliatory mood shifted Wednesday, the panel  
managed to overwhelmingly approve a compromise provision requiring 
ATM surcharges to be clearly disclosed at the teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-1 vote attached the surcharge measure to sweeping  
legislation that would allow banks, securities firms and insurance 
companies to merge and get more deeply into each other's 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But several hours later, some lawmakers started pushing divisive  
proposals. Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the committee's senior 
Democrat, angrily warned Republicans that ``the chances for passage 
of this bill will come to an end'' if they tried to choke off 
debate on amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee was to try again today, after adjourning its  
second all-day drafting session Wednesday without completing work 
on the bill -- for which the Clinton administration has indicated 
its strong support. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATM surcharge measure, sponsored by LaFalce, Committee  
Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., 
was a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier attempt to ban the surcharges outright, pushed by  
Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, the House's lone independent, gave 
way to the milder disclosure measure. 
</P>
<P>
	It would require clear disclosure of the surcharges, which come  
on top of charges by customers' own banks for using a machine 
operated by another bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically:  
</P>
<P>
	--The fact that double charges are imposed on people who aren't  
customers of that bank would have to be posted in a sign on the 
teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
	--The surcharge amount would have to be specified on the screen  
after consumers log in. Consumers would have to be given the chance 
to terminate their transaction before paying the surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
	--When issuing ATM cards to customers, banks would have to  
provide a warning that surcharges may be assessed by other banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks currently do at least some of those things  
voluntarily at the ATMs they operate. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole dissenting vote came from Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill.,  
who said she believed the banks could sufficiently police 
themselves in operating automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's Antitrust Division last year started  
looking into whether the nation's largest ATM networks are 
illegally preventing small banks from eliminating the double 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups oppose the surcharges, which have been banned by  
Connecticut and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee voted along party  
lines to approve and send to the full Senate a bill to overhaul the 
financial services laws proposed by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and 
opposed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In its current form, it would face a White House veto because  
Clinton believes the bill fails to protect consumers and would hurt 
community lending laws.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Still Strong After Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost daily Western attacks on Iraqi military  
targets haven't hurt President Saddam Hussein, critics of the 
Clinton administration contended at a congressional hearing 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British warplane strikes that began hitting Iraq's air  
defense system in December offer only temporary military victories 
and are doing nothing to weaken Saddam's dictatorial regime, said 
the critics, including former CIA Director James Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps the administration, in order to stay focused, needs to  
post a sign on the wall of the White House Situation Room that 
says, `It's the regime, stupid,''' Woolsey told the House Armed 
Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hillen, a political-military expert with the Center for  
Strategic and International Studies who served in the 1991 Gulf 
War, said the ``low-grade war against Iraq'' adds up to only 
short-term success. 
</P>
<P>
	``The daily military actions, in and of themselves, are  
important tactical victories, but do they add up to a comprehensive 
policy?'' he asked. ``American and British pilots are busy in the 
skies over Iraq, but little work has been done in the White 
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For his part, Saddam appears to be counting on the fact that  
an administration with only 22 months left in office will be mostly 
interested in running out the clock,'' Hillen added. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, who on Wednesday ended a tour  
of the Gulf region, has defended President Clinton's containment 
policy, a continuation of President Bush's strategy at the end of 
the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saddam has been contained since the end of the Gulf War,''  
Cohen said during a visit to Qatar on Tuesday. He also pledged to 
keep striking Iraqi military targets if Saddam's forces keep 
violating no-fly zones over southern and northern parts of Iraq and 
keep trying to shoot down Western patrol planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to target Iraq's air-attack network as long  
as it continues to threaten our planes,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, of the more than one dozen senior officials Cohen visited  
over five days in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab 
Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait, none publicly expressed support for 
U.S. strikes on Iraq. And Qatar Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin 
Jassim Al-Thani criticized the attacks, saying, ``We do not wish to 
see Iraq being bombed daily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The no-fly zones, where Iraqi planes are prohibited, were set up  
primarily by the United States and Britain in 1991 and 1992 
following the Gulf War to protect Kurdish and Shiite rebels from 
Iraqi attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi planes have violated the no-fly zones more than 100 times  
since the four-day, mid-December U.S. and British attack against 
Iraq to punish Saddam for not cooperating with U.N. weapons 
inspections. In response, U.S. and British forces have hit some 200 
Iraqi targets with precision-guided bombs and missiles, mostly 
anti-aircraft and radar sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services  
Committee, said he called two days of hearings on Iraq because of 
what he sees as ``the lack of a clear and consistent Iraq policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of us are deeply troubled by the course of U.S. policy  
and the pattern of U.S. military operations in the Persian Gulf,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey, CIA director from 1993 to 1995 at the start of the  
Clinton administration, suggested the president needs to be more 
aggressive in carrying out his stated policy of working to see a 
new Iraqi regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey suggested that no-fly zones be extended across Iraq,  
that the United States recognize an Iraqi government in exile to 
oppose Saddam and that U.S. airstrikes be used to hit not just air 
defense sites but also Saddam's power sources such as his 
Republican Guard and security and intelligence facilities.

<HEADLINE> Ag Dept Faces Discrimination Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black managers working for the Agriculture  
Department are moving forward with a complaint that accuses the 
agency of denying them promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has scheduled an  
April 12 hearing on the class action complaint, which alleges that 
more than 300 black managers at the department's Farm Service 
Agency were discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Service Agency, which administers loans and credit,  
also had been cited by black farmers in a lawsuit that resulted in 
a multimillion-dollar settlement -- currently under review by a 
federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not surprising that the Farm Service Agency was  
discriminating against the black farmers when they have for years 
systematically excluded African-Americans from policy-making 
positions in the upper levels of agency management,'' said lead 
attorney Joseph D. Gebhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, which was filed in February 1997, requests a  
promotion for each member of the class along with appropriate back 
pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Amontree, a spokesman for Agriculture Secretary Dan  
Glickman, said the agency has been ``aggressively dealing with the 
backlog of employee civil rights complaints.'' In the past two 
years, the agency has resolved three-fourths of such outstanding 
complaints, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Glickman will not tolerate acts of discrimination at  
this department,'' Amontree said. ``Anyone found doing so will be 
dealt with appropriately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The action before the EEOC is just one of two under way by black  
department employees. Another group is meeting with attorneys to 
pursue a complaint on behalf of all black employees within the 
agency, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the only thing the department is going to respond to  
is across-the-board action,'' said Lawrence Lucas, president of the 
USDA Coalition of Minority Employees and an organizer of the 
effort. ``Employees who have been in the system and seen the 
discrimination have decided the only way they can get to the 
systemic nature and the culture of racism is through a class 
action.''

<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Gov. Jane Hull was in the hospital Wednesday with  
a kidney infection she first noticed on a weekend trip to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is uncomfortable, but alert and working,'' spokeswoman  
Francie Noyes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull, 63, checked into Good Samaritan Regional Medical  
Center on Tuesday evening, Noyes said. The governor and her 
husband, a doctor, became concerned because she was so nauseous she 
couldn't take antibiotic pills without vomiting, Noyes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors put Mrs. Hull on intravenous antibiotics and fluids at  
the hospital, and she should be released within a day or two, Noyes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's dealing with state business over the phone, but we're  
trying to get her some rest so she can recuperate,'' Noyes said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Groups Lobby on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As President Clinton and Republicans lay out  
their plans to overhaul Social Security, interest groups are 
hardening their positions and increasing political pressure by 
aiming big-money campaigns at American workplaces and living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's lots of activity. It's going to continue, it's going  
to grow,'' said Roger Hickey of the Institute for America's Future, 
who is working with a $500,000 budget to coordinate the lobbying 
efforts of groups opposed to major changes in the retirement 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the labor, civil rights and women's groups involved, the  
AFL-CIO is in the midst of a 50-city tour of rallies, dropping 
leaflets at workplaces around the country and considering a 
national advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, workers may soon find handouts in their  
in-boxes or stuck on bulletin boards from chief executives involved 
in a competing campaign. They want to promote legislation that 
would divert some of the Social Security taxes now deducted from 
paychecks into personal retirement accounts that people could 
invest in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance of business and conservative groups, led by the  
National Association of Manufacturers, is planning to make the 
handouts available on the Internet. Television and radio ads are 
also in the works, and the business alliance's budget to reach out 
beyond Washington will surpass the $500,000 or so it plans to spend 
lobbying lawmakers directly. 
</P>
<P>
	Such activity by interest groups could play a positive role,  
helping to educate people about different options, said Carolyn 
Lukensmeyer, director of Americans Discuss Social Security, a 
nonpartisan project to encourage national debate. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a presidential election next year, large-scale  
advertising and grassroots campaigns also have the potential to 
threaten chances for any bipartisan compromise on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the idea is to use sound bites to frighten people, it's  
destructive,'' said Lukensmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has suggested a complicated plan that would  
use federal budget surpluses to help the economy grow so that in 
the future, the nation can afford to pay the Social Security 
benefits promised to baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders also want to use surpluses to  
shore up Social Security, but would prefer to use them to finance 
the transition to a new, partially privatized retirement system 
they say will ultimately be less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides say they are willing to negotiate a compromise.  
</P>
<P>
	But interest groups opposed to big changes have been emboldened  
by the support for the White House plan shown in public opinion 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does give them an upper hand in bargaining,'' said John  
Rother, public policy director for AARP. The organization of older 
people supports the concept of using general revenues for Social 
Security, also an element of Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions and other traditional Democratic supporters thus are  
in less of a mood to compromise, seeing a chance to win back 
Congress in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare,  
an advocacy group on retirement and other senior citizen issues, 
recently released an inch-thick report, based on a sophisticated 
computer simulation, seeking to show that most Americans would get 
lower retirement benefits under a private accounts system. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, the Securities Industry Association,  
representing Wall Street investment firms, recently sent letters to 
lawmakers offering help in designing a private accounts system. And 
other supporters of a partially privatized system are trying to 
match the formidable grassroots power their adversaries boast. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a site on the Internet, the conservative group Economic  
Security 2000 is seeking out supporters for private accounts, and 
has already forwarded tens of thousands of e-mail messages to 
Capitol Hill and the White House in a campaign dubbed ``The 
Billion-Byte March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the group is following up to see if the same people want to  
get involved in more traditional activities, such as visiting 
lawmakers' offices or writing letters to local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that our side has been too complacent on the  
grassroots side thus far,'' said spokeswoman Hillary Beard.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota To Investigate Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- On the eve of Minnesota's first game in the  
NCAA tournament, a published report Wednesday raised allegations of 
academic fraud by at least 20 players. 
</P>
<P>
	A former university employee said she wrote papers, helped with  
take-home exams and did other course work for players from 1993 to 
1998, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported Wednesday in a 
copyright story. 
</P>
<P>
	Four former players confirmed to the newspaper that work was  
prepared for them in possible violation of the student code of 
conduct and NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches knew. Everybody knew,'' former player Russ  
Archambault said. ``We used to make jokes about it. ... I would go 
over there some nights and get like four papers done. The coaches 
would be laughing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University officials promised a swift investigation. President  
Mark Yudof cut short a trip to Florida to return to the Twin Cities 
because of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disturbed by the allegations,'' Yudof said upon his  
return Wednesday evening. ``My reaction was a great deal of sadness 
and worry, but I also have a lot of respect for (coach) Clem 
Haskins and for our program and I think we shouldn't jump to 
conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins said Wednesday in Seattle that he planned to discuss the  
allegations ``when the season's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage we're here to play basketball,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The other three former players who confirmed work was done for  
them are Courtney James, Kevin Loge and Darrell Whaley. Another 
former player, Trevor Winter, who now plays for the Minnesota 
Timberwolves, said he was aware of the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 20 players are four current Golden Gophers -- Kevin  
Clark, Miles Tarver, Antoine Broxsie and Jason Stanford -- and the 
allegations threatened to overshadow Minnesota's game Thursday 
against Gonzaga in the NCAA West Regional in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Gardebring, the university's vice president of  
institutional relations, said Wednesday that those players' 
eligibility was in question, and the university was consulting the 
NCAA. It's possible the players could be ruled ineligible but be 
reinstated pending the outcome of an investigation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university scheduled a news conference for Thursday morning  
to discuss the players' eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski would not comment on the  
players' eligibility or possible penalties if the allegations are 
proven. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pioneer Press spent three months investigating the academic  
counseling program after the university self-reported a violation 
to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Gangelhoff, a former office manager in the academic  
counseling office, estimated she did more than 400 pieces of work 
for players, including some starters on the 1996-97 Final Four 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They bring in these high-risk kids, and they know that  
everything they did in high school was done for them,'' Gangelhoff 
said. ``It's got to stop somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She provided the Pioneer Press with computer files containing  
more than 225 examples of course work for players that she says she 
wrote and players turned in. Gangelhoff said she kept only about 
half her files. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff also provided printed copies of five pieces of course  
work that she said had been turned in by students. Some of the 
papers had grades and instructor's comments written on them. All 
five pieces also appeared in Gangelhoff's computer files. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff said she never was asked by a member of the coaching  
staff to do work for players, although she said Haskins once paid 
her $3,000 in cash to tutor a player. University President Mark 
Yudof said Haskins denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff said she was taken on two of the team's road trips,  
including one to Hawaii, and considered it compensation for the 
work she was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark and Tarver refused comment when questioned by the Pioneer  
Press at their Seattle hotel Tuesday night. The newspaper could not 
reach Broxsie or Stanford for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other players, Jermaine Stanford and Ryan Wolf denied  
that Gangelhoff did their course work. Micah Watkins, Voshon Lenard 
and Hosea Crittenden refused comment. Bobby Jackson, who now plays 
for the Minnesota Timberwolves, said Gangelhoff mostly just typed 
his papers. That also is a possible NCAA violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other former players could not be reached for comment, the  
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elayne Donahue, the retired head of the academic counseling  
unit, said she was unaware of fraud. But she said she warned 
athletic department administrators that the office manager was 
tutoring players in violation of department policy and was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley Boston, the vice president of student development and  
athletics, questioned the credibility of Gangelhoff's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of her current allegations seem to be inconsistent with  
statements she made in the past,'' Boston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston said one potential NCAA violation involving Gangelhoff  
has been self-reported by the school. He refused to detail the 
possible violation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 26, athletic director Mark Dienhart sent Gangelhoff a  
letter disassociating her from the program even though she had left 
the school the previous summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff said when she left the university she never intended  
to reveal that she did course work for players. But the letter of 
disassociation angered her, she says, because she never was asked 
to give her side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardebring said the university's investigation may be done by  
its own attorneys or with the help of outside investigators, 
including possibly the Big Ten Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the university was trying to locate Gangelhoff on  
Wednesday to talk about the allegations.

<HEADLINE> NBA Trade Deadline Closing in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The long-rumored Glen Rice deal finally went down Wednesday with  
just one day left before the NBA trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	And the rumor mill heated up as other teams weighed whether to  
make major changes so early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, a three-time All-Star and one of the league's best  
shooters, was traded from the Charlotte Hornets to the Los Angeles 
Lakers in a five-player deal that sent Elden Campbell and Eddie 
Jones to Charlotte. The Lakers also get B.J. Armstrong and J.R. 
Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this takes us one step closer to our ultimate goal of  
having an NBA championship team,'' Lakers vice president Jerry West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With other teams also feeling like legitimate championship  
contenders in this first season of the post-Michael Jordan era, 
there was plenty of trade talk going around. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the discussions centered on Milwaukee point guard  
Terrell Brandon, who will be a free agent at the end of the season 
and has refused to sign an extension with the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're just dealing the cards. The bidding is not in  
yet,'' Bucks coach George Karl said Tuesday night 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday night, the bidding was getting interesting.  
</P>
<P>
	One source close to the talks said a number of multiple-team  
trades -- perhaps even a four-team swap -- were being discussed 
involving Brandon, although none of those proposed deals could 
immediately be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the names popping up in rumors were Jermaine O'Neal and  
Kelvin Cato of Portland, Derek Anderson of Cleveland, Terry 
Cummings of Golden State, Tyrone Hill of the Bucks and Kendall Gill 
and Chris Gatling of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Several teams were interested in acquiring one of the Los  
Angeles Clippers' players whose contract expires at the end of the 
season, such as Lorenzen Wright, Lamond Murray or Eric Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal and Cato have been mentioned in numerous trade rumors for  
the past several weeks, and Gatling has gone so far as to demand a 
trade. The Bucks were one of the teams looking to add a player like 
Gatling to their front line. 
</P>
<P>
	But as always, it was likely there would be much more talk than  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league is conservative and this season is too crazy and  
too short to make major personnel decisions,'' Karl said. ``I think 
you're going to see everybody wait, except for maybe little 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks have been gauging the market for the past few weeks  
trying to decide what to do with Brandon, who has said he'll hold 
to his plans to test the free agent market even if he is traded 
before the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless I get an offer that absolutely knocks my socks off, I'm  
not going to trade him,'' Bucks general manager Bob Weinhauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blockbuster Lakers-Hornets deal, rumored for over a month,  
came as the Lakers were on an eight-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very difficult thing to trade such good players, and  
especially so when they are such quality people,'' West said. ``But 
in Glen Rice, we feel we've acquired the best shooter in the NBA 
and also one of the league's best players. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25 percent turnover of their roster followed by two weeks  
the firing of coach Del Harris and hiring of Kurt Rambis as his 
successor, as well as the signing of forward Dennis Rodman, the 
NBA's leading rebounder for the last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, 31, hasn't played this season following surgery to remove  
loose particles from his right (shooting) elbow in late January. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 forward has averaged 20.8 points and 4.8 rebounds  
in nine NBA seasons, six with Miami and the last three with 
Charlotte. He averaged 22.3 points last season to rank sixth in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	He figures to step in at small forward for the Lakers, with Kobe  
Bryant moving from that spot to shooting guard, replacing Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade comes three days after the resignation of Hornets  
coach Dave Cowens, who was unhappy with his salary. Charlotte won 
over 50 games each of the last two seasons and made the playoffs, 
but was just 5-11 this year entering Wednesday night's game at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all of our injuries this season, this trade really gives  
our team two quality starters and a chance to compete for a playoff 
spot,'' general manager Bob Bass said. ``It has greatly improved 
our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' name came up in several trade rumors the last couple of  
years, and he wasn't shy about saying how sick he became because of 
the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, after scoring 16 points in a 103-99 victory over the  
Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night, he said, ``If it (a trade) 
doesn't happen, it (speculation) will just start up again on July 1 
(the first day of the free-agent signing period). ... It's been 
mentally draining, the whole thing.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Can Give Wrong Answers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service telephone help  
lines are open around the clock for taxpayers who need answers to 
difficult tax questions. Trouble is, even the IRS is wrong 15 
percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS officials say they're trying to close that gap, but it isn't  
easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should be able to rely on the information they get from  
us,'' said Marilyn Soulsburg, acting IRS commissioner for customer 
service. But for sticky problems, she added, ``oftentimes the 
taxpayers' best bet is to seek professional advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A little more than half of American taxpayers had their returns  
professionally prepared last year, according to the IRS. Others are 
increasingly turning to computer tax software programs, which are 
modified each year to reflect changes in the tax code and ``ask'' 
people detailed questions about their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS estimates that only 1 percent of returns done  
electronically contain errors, compared with 20 percent of those 
prepared on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	But millions of Americans still do their taxes with nothing more  
than a pencil, a calculator and a pot of coffee. If they get 
stumped, the IRS offers a variety of toll-free telephone lines to 
get answers. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS employs about 7,000 people in its toll-free telephone  
program, which expanded its 15,000 lines for the first time this 
year to seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Last year, almost 70 
million callers phoned the IRS for tax advice or to inquire about 
their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Medick, national director of the IRS telephone service,  
said the agency's monitoring of calls indicates that last year's 
answers were accurate 85 percent of the time regarding tax law. For 
questions about individual taxpayer accounts, the accuracy rate was 
90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as 1995, the accuracy rate for both types of  
questions was placed at about 90 percent, but IRS recently switched 
to a centralized call monitoring system to replace the spot test 
calls made in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are always working to improve,'' Medick said. ``We have  
instant replay, so to speak, in the areas where we have the most 
difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That ``replay'' includes bulletins sent to the 25 IRS phone  
service locations detailing areas of tax law where errors are more 
frequent. The IRS also has redoubled its training, but the 
expansion to a 24-hour system without additional staff has put a 
strain on the quality of its advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the same group of people working more hours, so we  
don't have the same skill base,'' Soulsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IRS isn't too sympathetic toward people who claim they  
made a mistake because of bad advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, the responsibility still lies with the  
taxpayer to file an accurate return,'' Soulsburg said. ``That's why 
there's a bigger burden on us to make sure our quality is as high 
as it can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, although the taxpayer is ultimately responsible for all  
taxes, the IRS will forgive penalties if the problem is caused by 
the agency's advice. Taxpayers who believe they were given bad 
guidance should contact the IRS to have any penalty deleted. It's a 
good idea for the questioner to record the name of the person 
providing the advice and the time and date of the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem IRS has been working to overcome is the number  
of times taxpayers simply can't get through at all. A recent 
General Accounting Office report found that only about 51 percent 
of all calls were answered in 1997, and that was up 20 percent from 
the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the agency expanded from typical business hours to 16  
hours a day, seven days a week, and this year calls are answered 
round-the-clock all week during tax-filing season, from the 
beginning of January through mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've given people more opportunities to get through at  
different times,'' Soulsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another free option for taxpayers with computers is the IRS site  
on the Internet -- www.irs.ustreas.gov -- that includes thousands of 
pages of tax publications and forms. The site, visited more than 
340 million times in fiscal 1998, provides answers to frequently 
asked questions and features alerts to any widespread tax problems. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other alternatives. IRS tax help, including  
face-to-face contact, is available at 400 agency offices around the 
country, with 250 open Monday through Saturday through April 10. 
Taxpayers should call the IRS for more information.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Shuffling Fullbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jerome Bettis would be ``a very disgruntled  
employee'' if the Pittsburgh Steelers don't re-sign fullback Tim 
Lester, his blocking back and best friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Right about now, Bettis is not a very happy Steeler.  
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers chose not to re-sign Lester and instead reached  
terms with his backup, Jon Witman, on a $3.2 million, three-year 
contract. The deal includes a $500,000 signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Witman began the 1998 season as the Steelers' starting fullback,  
but gave way to Lester six weeks into the season after Lester 
returned from a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelers director of football operations Tom Donahoe said Witman  
was the more ``signable'' of the two fullbacks. The deal all but 
assures that Lester will not return to the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is trying to say it is one versus the other,''  
Donahoe said. ``We don't look at it that way. We try to sign as 
many of our guys as we can. Some are easier to sign than others. 
Some are more willing to sign than others. We talked to Tim's guy 
(agent Lamont Smith) early, and he didn't act like he wanted to 
talk. We were talking to Jon and it worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donahoe said Witman, of Penn State, ``has a lot of potential,  
and we signed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis has not yet said what he thinks, but his reaction is  
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's not happy,'' said Peter Schaffer, the agent for  
Bettis and Lester. ``Jerome feels Tim is the best blocking fullback 
in the NFL, not to take anything away from Witman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 15, Bettis said he felt strongly that the Steelers  
should re-sign Lester, who first blocked for him when the two 
played together for the Los Angeles and St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terrified at the thought of losing Tim Lester,'' Bettis  
said. ``He's the No. 1 run-blocker in terms of fullbacks in the 
league. For us to lose him, we lose a lot of our tenacity on 
offense in terms of running the football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lester started seven games last season to Witman's nine. Lester,  
30, might be the better blocker, but the Steelers consider Witman, 
26, better at running and receiving. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the two of them, they ran the ball once last season,  
with Witman gaining two yards. Lester caught nine passes and Witman 
13. 
</P>
<P>
	Witman's style of play may better suit the offense that new  
coordinator Kevin Gilbride is installing. The Steelers have used 
Witman not only at fullback, but also on the wing near the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Witman will get annual salaries of $700,000, $900,000 and $1.1  
million. His salary cap number for this year is $866,667, reducing 
the Steelers' available room under the cap to $584,333. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt the money wasn't as important as making Pittsburgh his  
home,'' said Witman's agent, Mark Bartelstein. ``You hear that all 
the time, that it's not the money. But this is one case that it's 
truly the case.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler, Nissan End Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG and Nissan Motor Co. announced  
today that they had broken off talks over DaimlerChrysler's 
possible acquisition of a stake in Nissan Motor Co. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We discussed our options of a potential partnership very  
openly and in a very friendly atmosphere, but finally decided not 
to pursue a participation,'' DaimlerChrysler co-Chairman Juergen 
Schrempp said in a statement issued from Tokyo after he met with 
Nissan President Yoshikazu Hanawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks broke down regarding DaimlerChrysler buying an equity  
stake in all of Nissan as well as an outright purchase of its 
commercial truck subsidiary, DaimlerChrysler spokesman Steve Rossi 
said at the Geneva International Motor Show. 
</P>
<P>
	``A possible relationship would not be as quick to realize as we  
would have hoped,'' Rossi said. ``We'd like to maintain and pursue 
our ongoing integration of DaimlerChrysler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talks will continue between Nissan and Renault SA, Renault chief  
executive Louis Schweitzer said at the Geneva show. He said there 
was no deal yet and referred to Renault's statement of March 1, in 
which the French automaker said Nissan would offer a good strategic 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, which was just formed in November with the  
merger of Daimler-Benz AG of Germany and Chrysler Corp. of the 
United States, had been in intense discussions with Nissan for the 
past three months. Schrempp made no secret of his desire to acquire 
a controlling interest in the big Japanese automaker to complete 
its global footprint. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nissan is staggering under an estimated $22 billion to $37  
billion in debt, and DaimlerChrysler apparently was unwilling to 
saddle itself with a portion of that red ink while it remains in 
the midst of combining its vast worldwide operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have emphasized that the integration of Daimler and  
Chrysler has utmost priority in our current business activities,'' 
Schrempp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The DaimlerChrysler statement said both parties agreed to  
continue pursuing exiting joint ventures between DaimlerChrysler 
and Nissan Diesel in commercial trucks and light trucks.

<HEADLINE> Dole Announcement Focuses GOP Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, taking a first, formal  
step toward a possible run for president, says it's high time that 
the nation's leaders restore voters' faith in their government -- to 
``call America to her better nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was among the themes the former U.S. labor and  
transportation secretary touted in a TV ad that was to accompany 
her announcement that she was forming an exploratory committee for 
the 2000 GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement at a rally here moves Mrs. Dole to the  
first tier of potential Republican contenders. Most polls have 
shown her and Texas Gov. George W. Bush far ahead of lesser-known 
potential Republican rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	In making her announcement, Mrs. Dole pointed to her experiences  
serving under five presidents but maintained a distance between 
herself and any rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a politician and, frankly, today that may be a plus,''  
Mrs. Dole said in her television ad, which was to air in Iowa and 
New Hampshire. Aides said the ad would flesh out the themes of a 
Dole campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics and the politics of governing have become so  
negative, so paralyzed by special interests, that as a people we're 
beginning to lose faith in our own institutions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her opening pitch took a not-too-subtle poke at President  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I run, this will be why: I believe our people are looking  
for leaders who will call America to her better nature,'' Mrs. Dole 
said. ``Yes, we've been let down, and by people we should have been 
able to look up to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the resume Mrs. Dole brings to a field of GOP contenders  
that could reach double digits: A very prominent and widely 
recognized name, extensive government experience and decades of 
campaigning as a surrogate for her husband, 1996 GOP presidential 
nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen many presidential campaigns up close,'' Mrs. Dole  
said in her 15-minute ad. ``I know what they entail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to bring a grace and a dignity to the race,'' said  
Ralph Reed, a consultant and former head of the Christian Coalition 
who is offering advice to Bush. ``I'm glad she's running. This 
nominating campaign is shaping into an embarrassment of riches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After today's announcement, Mrs. Dole's opening campaign swing  
takes her to Arizona, then to New Hampshire, before she heads back 
to her home in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's precinct caucuses mark the initial test of the  
presidential nominating season next February, while New Hampshire 
holds the first primary shortly after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has headed the Federal Trade Commission, served as  
secretaries of labor and transportation and been president of the 
American Red Cross. Some strategists argue that her Red Cross 
background insulates her from charges often hurled at Republicans 
that the party lacks compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	She hammered that experience in her TV pitch to voters.  
</P>
<P>
	``In my eight years at the American Red Cross, I saw things that  
will haunt me the rest of my life,'' she said. ``But I also saw the 
power of the human heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole said her early travels left her ``buoyed by the  
goodness of our citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Which is why I am ready to take the next step,'' Mrs. Dole  
said. ``This week, I have filed papers to form an exploratory 
committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among benefits Mrs. Dole brings to the campaign is her gender,  
some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gender plays into it to the extent that having a very visible  
and viable female candidate causes women voters to pay closer 
attention to the Republican primaries,'' said Ed Gillespie, a 
consultant allied with Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a likely 
presidential candidate in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has certainly gotten the attention of potential rivals  
like Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've long since passed the time when Americans are  
uncomfortable with women in any position of leadership,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reed argued that Bush has laid claim to the pillars of the  
Republican establishment, pointing to a broad range of prominent 
Republicans who joined the Texas governor last Sunday as he 
announced his exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Bush exploratory committee, you had the full range of  
the diversity of the Republican Party,'' said Reed. ``Bush has 
probably raised the bar for all subsequent contenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others suggested that front-runners like Mrs. Dole and Bush will  
stumble when they begin to face contentious issues that divide 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of soft underbelly when it comes to an issues  
campaign for this establishment candidate,'' said Greg Mueller, a 
consultant allied with publisher Steve Forbes and former 
communications director for conservative 1996 candidate Pat 
Buchanan.

<HEADLINE> Panel Stumped on Medicare Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Is restructuring Medicare enough, or will more  
money be needed to provide adequate health care for growing numbers 
of elderly Americans? 
</P>
<P>
	A commission that is supposed to recommend Medicare changes has  
so far been unable to resolve that question and other serious 
differences delaying its report to Congress and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not in agreement yet and it remains quite doubtful that  
we will be,'' said commission member Stuart Altman, a health policy 
professor at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Republican congressional leaders and the president have  
said they'd prefer not to resort to tax increases to bolster 
Medicare. But Clinton has suggested using federal budget surpluses 
that are expected in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee was scheduled to review Clinton's  
plan at a hearing today, but Republican leaders have so far 
declined to endorse it. 
</P>
<P>
	To help resolve the issue, lawmakers have been hoping for a  
solid consensus from the National Bipartisan Commission on the 
Future of Medicare. But the panel of private experts, former 
government officials and members of Congress has been equally 
plagued by the program's complexity and political sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission missed its March 1 reporting deadline, and on  
Tuesday said it would not hold its final meeting this week as had 
been hoped. A spokeswoman for the panel's chairman, Sen. John 
Breaux, D-La., said informal negotiations among commission members 
are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a work in progress. There are a lot of moving  
pieces,'' said the spokeswoman, Bette Phelan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-member commission is just one or two votes shy of the 11  
it needs to recommend a plan that would make the nation's health 
insurance program for the elderly and disabled more like the health 
benefits that many companies and the federal government offer to 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that plan, pushed by Breaux and others, retirees would  
choose from a menu of health-insurance policies and get a Medicare 
subsidy to help cover the enrollment fee or premium. The 
government-run system that most retirees now use to get reimbursed 
for each medical bill would compete with private health plans, 
which would have to offer similar coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies by government analysts say such competition could save  
Medicare hundreds of billions of dollars in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	But Altman, a Clinton appointee, and other Democrats on the  
panel who hold deciding votes want the commission's report to make 
clear that despite the cost controls, Medicare is still likely to 
need more money. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission Democrats also are holding out for a recommendation  
that Medicare help beneficiaries pay for prescription drugs, which 
the program does not now cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican commission members say the cash-strapped program  
can't afford drug coverage for everyone, and Breaux has suggested a 
compromise that would help mainly those with the lowest incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also is still considering whether to recommend  
raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, and whether 
wealthier senior citizens should be required to pay more for 
Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Without some action, Medicare is expected to run short of cash  
in about a decade -- just before the first of the huge baby boom 
generation begins to retire.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Torre Has Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees manager Joe Torre left  
the World Series champions Wednesday for treatment of prostate 
cancer, another blow to a team shadowed by death and disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre discovered he had the cancer from a test the Yankees  
required at spring training in response to Darryl Strawberry's 
colon-cancer diagnosis in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The team believes doctors caught the disease in its early  
stages, and owner George Steinbrenner said Wednesday's test results 
were encouraging. Steinbrenner said Torre could be back in three 
weeks -- in time for the season opener April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine, and I am looking forward to taking care of this  
problem and getting back to work,'' said the 58-year-old manager, 
who spent the day at his spring home in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what his course of treatment will  
be or where he will be treated. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Torre's condition came two days after Yankees great Joe  
DiMaggio died of complications from lung-cancer surgery and on the 
same day Strawberry returned to the lineup for the first time in 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a very tough week for the Yankees but we'll be able  
to handle it,'' said Steinbrenner, who visited Torre and found him 
in good spirits. ``We have a great capacity of being able to deal 
with adversity. Time after time after time, we've done it 
throughout this franchise's history. It's built into being a 
Yankee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, former Yankees star Catfish Hunter appeared at  
the team's camp too weak to shake hands because of Lou Gehrig's 
Disease. In 1996, when Torre became the Yankees' manager, his 
brother Rocco died, and his brother Frank had a heart transplant 
during the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said the team was ``devastated'' by the news of  
Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to see someone else face this particular  
battle,'' Strawberry said. ``It is a difficult battle for anybody. 
We all have to realize that until there is a cure for cancer there 
are no guarantees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees will rotate managers while Torre is out. Hitting  
coach Chris Chambliss managed the split squad game Wednesday in 
Fort Myers against the Red Sox and Stump Merrill, who managed the 
Yankees in 1990-91 and is now a special assistant to general 
manager Brian Cashman, handled the team's other game in Bradenton 
against the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-base coach Willie Randolph and pitching coach Mel  
Stottlemyre also will share the managing duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre met with his coaches and then individually with veterans  
Joe Girardi, Paul O'Neill and David Cone on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Girardi informed the Yankees who went to Fort Myers in a brief  
closed-door meeting two hours before the game. O'Neill told the 
group of players in Bradenton, while Cone told those who stayed in 
Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to be upbeat. But it is hard when you see two people  
in the prime of their lives go through this,'' Girardi said of 
Strawberry and Torre. ``The best thing we can do for Joe right now 
is to play the way Joe wants us to play. Joe's going to want to 
fight this and he's going to want us to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is second only to lung cancer among cancer  
killers of American men, taking about 40,000 lives annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Most prostate cancer happens sporadically; patients have no  
particular family history of the disease. However, about 1 in 10 
cases seems to be clearly inherited, because many men in the same 
family have it. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre is the third prominent person in baseball to be diagnosed  
with cancer this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga was diagnosed with a  
cancerous tumor in his lower back and is undergoing chemotherapy. 
He will miss the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell, a former Yankees  
prospect, was diagnosed last month with testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Marv Levy, the former coach of the Buffalo Bills, underwent  
surgery for prostate cancer during the 1995 NFL season and, at 70, 
was back coaching within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is taking the correct steps,'' Levy said. ``It is a  
disease that, when diagnosed early and treated aggressively, is 
highly curable. My prayers and best wishes for a swift recovery are 
certainly with Joe Torre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre has a 302-184 record and has won two World Series  
championships in his first three years as Yankees manager. Last 
year, Torre led the Yankees to an AL-record 114 wins and swept the 
San Diego Padres in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He means everything to our club,'' Tino Martinez said. ``He  
helps keep us together day in and day out. It's just shocking. 
After what Darryl went through last year, we just have to be ready 
for something like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who signed a two-year contract extension last month,  
joined Casey Stengel and Ralph Houk as the only managers to lead 
the Yankees to the postseason in their first three years at the 
helm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees trip to the World Series in 1996 was Torre's first  
as a player or manager after 4,268 games in the majors.

<HEADLINE> Decision Due on Italy Court-Martial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps is nearing a decision on  
whether to go ahead with the court-martial of a second Marine 
aviator in the fatal and politically charged Italian Alps ski 
gondola accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision is for Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine  
Forces Atlantic, and could come as early as today, senior Marine 
officers said in interviews Tuesday. Pace's decision comes on the 
heels of the acquittal by a military jury last Thursday of Marine 
Capt. Richard J. Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., who was the 
pilot of the EA-6B Prowler involved in the accident Feb. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prowler was flying too low and too fast when it sliced a  
cable holding the ski gondola, sending the 20 people inside to 
their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ashby acquittal triggered immediate speculation that the  
case would be dropped against his navigator, Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., who has the same charges lodged 
against him. Jury selection in the Schweitzer court-martial is 
scheduled to begin March 18 at Camp Lejeune, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine officials said Tuesday a possibility remains that Pace  
will decide to proceed with the case against Schweitzer. 
</P>
<P>
	One alternative, the officers said, speaking on condition they  
not be identified, would be to drop the criminal case and go 
directly to administrative action that could include removing 
Schweitzer and Ashby from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines felt stung by criticism from the Italian government  
and victims' relatives who insist that Ashby's acquittal means he 
and the rest of his crew have escaped accountability. The Marines 
are intent on ensuring that the two be held responsible, if not 
criminally culpable. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Pace decides not to proceed with a court-martial of  
Schweitzer and drop an obstruction of justice charge remaining 
against Ashby, both men would be likely to face nonjudicial 
punishment that probably would end their flying careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both, for example, will face a Field Flight Performance Board  
inquiry to evaluate their performance in light of the gondola 
incident and possibly recommend they not fly again.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Get Glen Rice From Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Glen Rice was traded from the Charlotte  
Hornets today in a five-player deal that gives the streaking Los 
Angeles Lakers one of the NBA's best shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte also dealt forward J.R. Reid and reserve point guard  
B.J. Armstrong to the Lakers. Los Angeles sent guard Eddie Jones 
and forward Elden Campbell to the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice has not played this season because of elbow surgery Jan.  
22, but he is expected to be ready soon. He joins a team that has 
won seven straight under new coach Kurt Rambis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very difficult thing to trade such good players, and  
especially so when they are such quality people,'' said Jerry West, 
the Lakers' executive vice president for basketball operations. 
``But in Glen Rice we feel we've acquired the best shooter in the 
NBA and also one of the league's best players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this takes us one step closer to our ultimate goal of  
having an NBA championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on their rosters, the Lakers waived reserve forward  
Corie Blount and Charlotte waived forward Joe Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice was the Hornets' top scorer, and his high salary prompted  
the deal, which came the day before the NBA's trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets general manager Bob Bass pointed to the team's injuries  
in making the move. Rice is one of three starters either out for 
the year or sidelined for significant stretches because of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all of our injuries this season this trade really gives  
our team two quality starters and a chance to compete for a playoff 
spot,'' Bass said. ``It has greatly improved our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This marked the third time in four years Charlotte has refused  
to pay an eight-figure salary to one of its best players. The 
others to leave were Alonzo Mourning and Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade comes three days after the resignation of Hornets  
coach Dave Cowens, who was unhappy with his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure of Rice represents another major loss for an  
organization plagued by weak leadership, injuries and falling 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner George Shinn is the target of a sexual misconduct lawsuit  
and is being called on by fans to sell the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rice-to-Los Angeles deal had been widely reported for  
several weeks but was held up because the 6-foot-8 forward had 
loose particles removed from his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers reportedly did not want to execute the trade until  
they could hear other possible offers and were sure Rice was close 
to being ready to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, who joined the Hornets in the deal that sent Mourning to  
Miami, is to be paid $5.4 million this season. The Hornets had an 
option to retain him next season for $7.1 million. Rice asked the 
team for a contract extension this past offseason but was rejected. 
He wanted to be paid at least $10 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers reportedly were willing to give Rice a new contract,  
although terms were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets traded Mourning to Miami in November 1995 after  
refusing his demands for a new contract that would pay him about 
$11 million per season. Charlotte also elected to let Divac leave 
through free agency this past offseason after he sought a deal in 
the $12 million-per-year range. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time NBA All-Star, Rice has made 1,216 3-pointers,  
third-best in league history. He is 101 points short of reaching 
the 15,000-point mark for his nine-year pro career.

	The 6-6 Jones, in his fifth NBA season, has established himself  
as one of the league's better 3-point shooters and defenders. He 
led the Lakers in steals in each of his first four seasons and 
ranked seventh in the NBA in 3-pointers made last year, when he 
also was placed on the league's all-defensive second team.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Identify Obesity Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers have identified the first gene known to suppress  
obesity and regulate the burning of calories, a key step that may 
help in developing a drug that keeps people trim. 
</P>
<P>
	The gene, known as Mahogany or the MG gene, was discovered in  
mice. It is the sixth gene found to be implicated in obesity, but 
researchers said it is the first discovered to regulate metabolism 
and the expenditure of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of two studies published in today's issue of the journal  
Nature, scientists at Millennium Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, 
Mass., tested groups of mice with normal and mutated MG genes. They 
fed the mice diets with varying percentages of fat. 
</P>
<P>
	Mice with a mutated MG gene did not gain weight whether they ate  
a high-fat diet or a low-fat one. Mice with the normal gene gained 
weight on the high-fat diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said they were optimistic that the gene would play  
the same role in humans, but cautioned that it has been 
demonstrated only in mice (Mahogany refers to the animals' brown 
fur). 
</P>
<P>
	And though the findings suggest the gene plays an important role  
in diet-related obesity -- which afflicts most of the 54 percent of 
American adults who are too hefty -- obesity is thought to more than 
a matter of genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obesity is a complex problem for which diet, exercise and  
biology all are important,'' said geneticist Craig Warden of the 
University of California at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one reason why it could be several years before the  
researchers can transform their discovery into a fat-busting drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pessimistic that we'll ever get that pill that allows us  
to remain sedentary, eat high-fat diets and stay lean,'' said 
University of Colorado obesity researcher James Hill. ``But that's 
what Americans want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molecular biologist Karen Moore, who directed the MG study for  
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, said the findings could show 
researchers how to develop a drug to control obesity by mimicking 
the activity of the mutated gene. 
</P>
<P>
	The process of how such a drug could enter a cell is described  
in the second study in Nature, by Stanford University researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other obesity researchers said the MG studies provide key  
information in understanding how the body warehouses fuel when 
people eat more than necessary.

<HEADLINE> Sea-Based Missile Defense Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It would be far cheaper and quicker to deploy  
a sea-based national missile defense system than to build one on 
land as envisioned by the Clinton administration, a group of 
conservative defense analysts said in a report Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to act now,'' declared Henry Cooper Jr., chairman of  
the Heritage Foundation study and former director of Pentagon 
anti-missile programs during the Bush administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper listed the growing ballistic missile threat from  
countries such as North Korea and Iran as a reason for ``urgency'' 
on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heritage Commission on Missile Defense, which included 14  
retired officers and defense and political officials who served 
mostly in Republican administrations, accused the current White 
House of failing to make missile defense a national priority. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, however, is seeking a major increase in  
spending for national missile defense, urging Congress to approve 
$6.6 billion over the next five years for program development. 
</P>
<P>
	A land-based national missile defense system, under study by the  
Clinton administration, would cost an estimated $10.5 billion to 
build and, if approved, wouldn't be deployed until 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-page Heritage report concluded that a sea-based system to  
defend U.S. cities and shores from enemy missiles would cost less 
than $8 billion and take only about four years to deploy. 
</P>
<P>
	The system would include 650 missile interceptors on the Navy's  
22 Aegis cruisers and destroyers now on patrol around the world as 
well as space-based sensors to detect incoming missiles and relay 
tracking data. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pentagon report, however, has estimated it would cost $19  
billion to expand the Navy's Aegis fleet to become roving missile 
defense systems to protect the 50 U.S. states as well as American 
troops overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, said the  
Defense Department had no comment on the Heritage Foundation 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy already has spent $1 billion developing a so-called  
theater missile defense system to protect ships and troops from 
regional threats, mostly from short- and medium-range missiles. But 
it could take up to 10 years to perfect a system for shooting a 
missile out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, major technological hurdles have prevented the Navy,  
the Air Force and the Army from actually building a system that can 
defend against anything but short-range and slow-moving cruise 
missiles. It could take years before scientists and the defense 
industry build a system capable of striking a high-altitude, 
intercontinental missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national  
missile defense system, partly because it would violate the 
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the ABM treaty is no longer valid because it was  
negotiated between the United States and the former Soviet Union, 
not Russia.

<HEADLINE> Stylist Thanked on Oscar Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On Oscars day, a star arises. She reads the trades, pencils in  
an upcoming lunch with that new agent. Dresses faaab-ulous. Takes 
limo to red carpet. Feels grateful for waterproof mascara while 
making teary-eyed acceptance speech. Thanks the Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	And thanks the stylist.  
</P>
<P>
	Who?  
</P>
<P>
	The celebrity stylist. The latest breed of power player, he  
shops for and dresses Tinseltown's A-list for awards galas and 
other outings peppered with paparazzi. 
</P>
<P>
	The stylist is also the fashion darling of the moment provided  
that, among the racks of Armanis, Versaces, Halstons and Diors, he 
sniffs out the ideal show-stopping gown for his client. When such 
perfection is attained, the public is destined to see that actress 
in that dress, in well-placed photos, endless and everywhere, from 
People to Vogue and around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	While the public may not be aware of the stylist's influence,  
fashion designers court them with front-row seats at their shows. 
TV appearances adorn their resumes. And a book deal, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
	``We can take a designer who doesn't have a name and sort of  
build them, so we're the perfect product placement,'' says Phillip 
Bloch, megastylist and author of ``Elements of Style: From the 
Portfolio of Hollywood's Premier Stylist'' (Warner Books 1998, 
$22). 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch's list of clients includes Sandra Bullock, Salma Hayek,  
Jim Carrey, Lara Flynn Boyle, John Travolta, Jada Pinkett Smith, 
Will Smith, Lauren Holly, Lisa Rinna, Fran Drescher and Faye 
Dunaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to hang out, have fun with my clients,'' says Bloch.  
``I'm not, 'Dahling, it's got to be Gucci.' I don't hang with 
celebs. And when I do, we hang out in jeans and we lay on the 
floor. It's not like I hang out with Sandy. Well, I do but ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all runs smoothly, there should be no anxiety for a stylist's  
clients on Oscars day. 
</P>
<P>
	``She should have nothing to do but slip into the dress, because  
by having the stylist, you're all prepared. That's the whole 
point,'' says Bloch, who is based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``My client might call me to ask what color nail polish the  
manicurist should use. And I'll say, 'I'm just rounding the corner, 
I'll be right there.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody gets there one by one, the makeup artist, the hair  
stylist, the best friend, the manicurist, and I come with the 
dress,'' Bloch says. ``We might joke and gossip about what's in 
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all this sounds like a big production -- it is.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Oscars are the worst, because it's the biggest of all the  
events,'' says eveningwear designer Donald Deal. ``The pressure 
that people put on themselves over a dress! You're going to have a 
nervous breakdown over a dress you wear to the Academy Awards?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not easy for the stylist, either. Beautifying  
already-beautiful people may sound like a cinch, but the 
competition is fierce. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny, but it's incredibly stressful for these stylists  
to make their stars look perfect,'' says fashion publicist Jill 
Eisenstadt. ``What you wear to the Oscars doesn't affect the 
outcome, but there still is only one best dress. Two people can't 
wear it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the lucky designer whose label is chosen, the best dress  
means success. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1998 Oscars, a much-ballyhooed dress was a full-length  
garnet gown worn by Minnie Driver, via stylist Jessica Paster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dress really went on for a year,'' says Randolph Duke, who  
designed Driver's gown for Halston. 
</P>
<P>
	On another occasion, Paster ``literally helped put my client on  
the map,'' says Eisenstadt, who dressed Kim Basinger in a black 
Amsale dress for an awards gala. Eisenstadt is a fashion publicist 
at Loving &AMP;Weintraub in New York. She travels to Los Angeles to 
show stylists the collections of her designer clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kim Basinger was in People magazine in that same black dress  
three times in two months,'' she says. ``That kind of entertainment 
publicity whirlwind is really what helps the designer into their 
own stardom. Within a couple of months, Amsale became a regular on 
the celebrity dressing scene. By the time the Academy Awards rolled 
around, we were well in the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, who now designs his own collection, characterizes a  
designer's relationship with a stylist as a ``love-hate 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be completely blunt about it. If they are  
dressing the star, you have to go through them. You cannot cut 
corners, whether the particular stylist was assigned by the 
actress, studio or agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discovering new designers is only part of the search.  
</P>
<P>
	``As stylists we preview the collections (in New York, Paris and  
Milan),'' says Arianne Phillips, a Los Angeles-based stylist who 
has dressed Madonna, Courtney Love and Natalie Imbruglia. ``A lot 
of the clothes come from designers' showrooms in Europe and hardly 
ever even hit the retail level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creativity is highly valued.  
</P>
<P>
	``My work is usually a combination of designer shows, plus flea  
market and thrift store shopping, whatever it takes to pull it 
together,'' Phillips says. 
</P>
<P>
	For stylists who barter in celebrity glamour, dresses that look  
like a million are the hot commodity -- even if not a penny trades 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows it's all borrowed,'' says Bloch, referring to  
gowns worn at the Oscars. ``But there's something glamorous about 
the idea of it being on loan. For a designer to give you a dress to 
wear; that concept is terribly chic.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Hears Divergent Cuba Views </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defenders of the four-decade-old U.S. embargo  
against Cuba said Wednesday it has helped decimate the 
once-powerful Cuban military and forced economic reforms that 
otherwise would not been undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said at a Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee hearing that the weakening of the Cuban 
military one of several ``real, lasting and tangible benefits'' of 
the economic embargo in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, a Cuban exile who heads a Miami-based  
anti-embargo group, testified that 40 years of isolation of the 
Cuban regime has brought misery to the Cuban people and served only 
to please ``discredited'' Florida exile groups opposed to President 
Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	With committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., seated a few feet  
away, Menoyo said Helms' embargo-tightening legislation of 1996 is 
``an insult to Cubans, offends the world'' and serves to perpetuate 
the Castro government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Constructive rapprochement,'' he said, ``was yesterday, is  
today and will be tomorrow the best way out of conflicts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms rejected that argument, declaring that the Canadian  
government's policy of reaching out to Cuba ``has served to prop up 
the Castro regime but has done nothing to advance human rights or 
democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., deplored a recent crackdown on  
dissidents in Cuba but said the U.S. response should not be to try 
to isolate the regime further. 
</P>
<P>
	Menoyo was one of three Cuban exiles who testified -- and the  
only one who advocated an attempt by the United States to establish 
normal relations with Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Zuniga, president of the Foundation for Human Rights in  
Cuba, said the embargo had minimal effect on Cuba before 1991 
because the Caribbean island was able to count on generous 
subsidies from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he said, Cuba has cut its military budget by 48  
percent and eliminated its navy altogether. He also said the steep 
economic decline in Cuba after the collapse of the Soviet Union 
forced the government to legalize the dollar, one of several 
economic liberalizations it has approved. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1980s, as a result of Soviet assistance, Cuba boasted  
perhaps the most formidable military establishment in Latin 
America. It maintained tens of thousands of troops in Angola in 
support of the leftist government there and provided military 
backing to leftist forces in Central America. When the economic 
crisis struck early in the decade, Castro renounced Cuban 
involvement in overseas conflicts. These days, many armed services 
personnel do farm labor. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing, Frank Calzon, executive director of the Center  
for a Free Cuba, called on the Clinton administration to reaffirm 
its determination to stay the course on its Cuba policy until there 
is substantive political reform on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of reform, he said, is illustrated by what he called  
the ``discouraging'' aftermath of the January 1998 visit to Cuba of 
Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the recent sedition trial of four dissidents: Marta  
Beatriz Roque, an economist; Rene Gomez Manzano, an attorney; 
Vladimiro Roca, an economist and son of a prominent leader of 
Cuba's Communist Party; and Feliz Bonne, a teacher and engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	They were charged with promoting aggressive U.S. policies toward  
the communist nation and trying to harm the economy by discouraging 
foreign investment. Verdicts in the trial are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The four were arrested in July 1997 after publication of a  
pamphlet titled ``The Fatherland Belongs to All.'' A large picture 
of the four was on display in the hearing room.

<HEADLINE> Another Delay in Ending IOC Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The conclusion of an IOC investigation into the  
Salt Lake City scandal has been delayed again. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, a member of the IOC's inquiry commission, said  
today the panel's report was still being finalized and might not be 
released until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will recommend expulsions, warnings or exonerations  
for 19 IOC members still under investigation for alleged misconduct 
stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission had planned to complete its report by the end of  
last week, but then said its recommendations would be released by 
the middle of this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the panel held a conference call Tuesday night and  
plans to hold another tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we will finalize everything,'' he said by telephone  
from Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the report, which he described as lengthy, will then  
have to be translated from English into French before being sent to 
the IOC executive board for action. 
</P>
<P>
	While the board had been expected to hold a conference call this  
week, Rogge said those plans could be scrapped for ``practical 
reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the board might not deal with the panel's  
recommendations until its formal meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, 
Monday and Tuesday on the eve of the two-day IOC general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said some executive board members will be traveling to  
Switzerland in the next few days and president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch might not be able to reach them by phone before the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge denied the delays indicated the commission was divided or  
undecided on some of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolute consensus,'' he said. ``The only issue has  
been that we've received more and more (written) material as a 
result of our requests to members and the Salt Lake organizing 
committee. We only received some of the documents in the last few 
days. You need to look at those materials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the inquiry panel, IOC vice president Dick Pound,  
said Monday that one member's case remain to be resolved. He 
declined to identify the member. 
</P>
<P>
	The most sensitive case is that of South Korea's Kim Un-Yong,  
the IOC executive member and highest-ranking official implicated in 
the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has been accused of using his influence to get lucrative  
jobs in television and entertainment for his children. He has 
vigorously denied any wrongdoing, hired a New York law firm to 
defend him and suggested he is the victim of an internal plot to 
undermine his chances of becoming IOC president. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members resigned or were ousted in the first phase of  
the Salt Lake inquiry that was completed in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The current probe involves three members -- including Kim -- who  
remained under investigation after the first phase, plus 16 others 
who were cited in a Salt Lake ethics report released last month.

<HEADLINE> Port of Boston Shows New Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Joe Picard has loaded and unloaded cargo from  
ships in the Port of Boston for 22 years, and lately he's had 
enough work to wear out the soles of his tar-stained boots. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly closing in 1997, the oldest working port in the  
Western Hemisphere is making a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year's picking up. I hope we work every day,'' Picard  
said over the roar of a towering blue crane unloading containers 
onto trucks every 90 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures released Wednesday show 1,832 vessels passed through the  
Massachusetts Port Authority terminals and privately owned 
petroleum and liquid natural gas terminals in 1998. That's up from 
1,741 vessels the previous year and 1,463 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures don't include cruise ships, ferries, water taxis,  
small sailboats and racing yachts now plying the once-filthy waters 
of Boston Harbor, cleaned up since the construction of a treatment 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rebound of commercial shipping is the real success story  
here, where only two container ships used to visit the port each 
week. The port had rivaled New York and Philadelphia until its long 
decline began after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	Massport's executive director, Peter Blute, overcame the  
objections of longshoremen and reconfigured the port's two main 
facilities a year ago. The Moran Terminal was dedicated exclusively 
to automobiles while the Conley Container Terminal was improved for 
container shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	There, Massport dredged the berths, put in four 120-foot cranes,  
built a state-of-the-art gate facility and established a computer 
tracking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Business picked up, especially last summer after a major  
shipper, the Mediterranean Shipping Company, began stopping in 
Boston three times a week instead of twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The popular new Volkswagen Beetle has led the surge of imported  
cars at the Autoport, which is expected to process 75,000 cars this 
year, three times its volume in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Harris, Massport's marine manager, surveyed the busy  
operation and reflected on its varied cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've sent out scrap gold. We've taken in fireworks for  
Disneyworld. We've handled racing yachts for World Cup races. We 
send scrap cars to Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most disturbing in the home of the Boston Red Sox  
baseball team: ``I've seen New York Yankee baseball caps come off 
in Boston.''

<HEADLINE> Venator Earnings Disappoint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Woolworth Corp. shed its name and five-and-dime  
image, and built itself into a sporting goods giant. But the New 
York-based retailer is still struggling to get its business back on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	Now known as Venator Group Inc., its stock is down almost 83  
percent in the past year, and its sales and profits continue to 
sink amid a slowdown in athletic footwear and clothing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts are even beginning to speculate about the  
company's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a hard ship to turn around,'' said Kurt Barnard, a  
retail consultant who runs Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper 
Montclair, N.J. ``Venator doesn't seem to have a clue what to do 
with itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough few years for Venator, which has attempted to  
boost profits by reducing costs and closing more than 4,000 stores 
-- including the entire chain of Woolworth five-and-dimes and all of 
its Kinney Shoe stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Its sporting goods chains now include Foot Locker, Lady Foot  
Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports and Colorado. It also 
operates Afterthoughts, an accessories stores, and San Francisco 
Music Box, which sells music boxes and giftware. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its efforts to revive the business, Venator continues to  
struggle. Last month, Standard &AMP; Poor's dropped the company's 
credit rating to ``junk'' status, and on Wednesday, Venator 
reported disappointing fourth-quarter and year-end earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter ended Jan. 30, Venator's net income fell 67  
percent to $37 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $115 
million, or 85 cents a share a year ago. Sales also fell, dropping 
6 percent to $1.33 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, it lost $113 million, or $1 a share, compared with  
a loss of $10 million, or 7 cents a share, the year before. Sales 
fell to $4.56 billion, from $4.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Venator's tough times can be attributed to a number of factors --  
some of which are out of its control. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, the sneaker business remains under pressure, as  
consumers prefer ``brown'' hiking shoes to another pair of Nike's. 
Sales of athletic footwear dropped 6 percent in 1998, according to 
the Athletic Footwear Association, a North Palm Peach, Fla.-based 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, young people today opt to spend their money at  
stores like Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and Old Navy, buying up fleece 
sweatshirts rather than jerseys with Michael Jordan's number on the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Lastly, the National Basketball Association strike, which lasted  
through January, tempered sales of team-related merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of Venator's problems are a result of the problems  
around them,'' said Walter Loeb, who runs the retail consulting 
firm Loeb Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Venator also struggles to hold its share in the crowded  
sporting goods marketplace. Venator has been slow at remodeling its 
stores, which has given competitors such as Just for Feet and 
Finish Line an advantage with their trendier store formats. 
</P>
<P>
	As its sales sag, Venator has been forced to slash prices --  
sometimes by as much as 50 percent. While the markdowns help move 
out excess inventory, they also eat away at profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts question what is ahead for Venator. The company, which  
did not return calls for comment, has said that it is committed to 
getting itself back on track and said in its earnings report that 
it ``ended the year in sound financial condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venator plans to increase the amount of moderately priced goods  
that it sells at its stores and hopes to negotiate more exclusive 
agreements with manufacturers like Nike Inc., analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	There also have been rumors on Wall Street that Venator may be a  
takeover target, especially since its stock price is so affordable 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also speculation that unless its business is revived  
soon, Venator could be headed to Bankruptcy Court to seek 
protection from its creditors as it attempts a reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not about to file for bankruptcy now. I haven't heard  
that they aren't paying their bills,'' Barnard said. ``But if the 
situation continues to deteriorate, they may be at the point that 
they have no other option.''

	U.S. Failed To Stop China Spying  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It took top national security officials almost  
a year to determine there were ``serious problems'' requiring 
security changes at nuclear weapons labs after receiving a 1996 
briefing about possible espionage. National Security Adviser Sandy 
Berger said he received a ``very preliminary'' briefing in 1996 
that China may have obtained critical nuclear warhead information 
from the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. But only after a more 
detailed briefing in July 1997 were the problems involving China 
and the labs brought into sharp focus, he said today.

	ROME (AP) -- Italy's premier today said NATO bases were necessary  
for national security but that the alliance's agreement will have 
to be reviewed if no one is punished for the ski cable car tragedy. 
Premier Massimo D'Alema, who has called Capt. Richard Ashby's 
acquittal last week on 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter 
``unacceptable,'' said he expects Ashby's superiors to be held 
responsible. ``The real problem is not to eliminate the bases, but 
to better define their roles,'' D'Alema said. Some Italian 
politicians have demanded the bases be closed.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal audit found inadequate safeguards  
for secured areas at the five of nation's biggest airports, 
prompting the Federal Aviation Administration to launch a security 
crackdown. A Transportation Department official briefed the House 
Appropriations Committee today, reporting that undercover personnel 
could enter restricted areas through emergency exits and penetrate 
air cargo facilities. Some were even able to board planes. FAA 
officials will look into compliance by the nation's 78 largest 
commercial airports and their airlines for controlling secured 
areas and their ability to keep out unauthorized personnel.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged  
Congress to delay votes on Kosovo until peace talks are completed, 
suggesting the warring sides would interpret a lack of U.S. resolve 
as ``a green light to resume fighting.'' But House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert rejected her appeal and scheduled a debate for tomorrow on 
a resolution on the possible deployment of U.S. troops. Peace talks 
between the ethnic Albanians and Serbs resume Monday. However, 
prospects for success seemed to dim today when U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke failed to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic

During the annual session of the national legislature, People's 
Bank of China Gov. Dai Xianglong told reporters that there are no 
plans to allow the value of the yuan to decline in 1999. Dai was 
rebutting a report in Thursday's Financial Times that cited a

<HEADLINE> Laborers' Boss Cleared of Mob Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government agreed to let the Laborers'  
union police itself after allegations of underworld ties, but 
federal prosecutors say they're disappointed an internal probe 
found no links between organized crime and the union's general 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leader Arthur Coia was cleared Tuesday by an independent  
hearing officer of charges he had ties to organized crime, but he 
was fined on a separate ethics violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearing officer Peter Vaira, hired by the union with the  
approval of the Justice Department in a 1995 agreement, made the 
ruling after an internal investigation of corruption within the 
Laborers' ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Coia was found liable for violating the union's ethical  
practices code in purchasing a personal car in a joint arrangement 
with a dealer who leased cars to the union. Coia was fined 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer from Providence, R.I., who has been fervent political  
supporter of President Clinton, Coia became the union's president 
in 1993 after rising through its staff ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	With its major strength in the Midwest, the union represents  
employees in construction, service and public jobs such as digging 
tunnels, pouring cement and loading mail. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s President Reagan's Commission on Organized Crime  
accused the Laborers of having mob ties. To avoid federal 
racketeering charges, the union signed the 1995 agreement with the 
Justice Department to sweep its ranks of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's general counsel, Michael Bearse, said Vaira's  
decision ``speaks well of our investigatory and disciplinary 
process.'' It was significant that all the allegations of organized 
crime involvement were dismissed, Bearse said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials, however, said they were ``disappointed with  
the decision'' but did not criticize the investigation leading up 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Lassar, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of  
Illinois, and James K. Robinson, head of the Justice Department's 
criminal division, said in a joint statement they ``believe the 
opinion contains serious factual and legal errors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charge against Coia was brought by Robert Luskin, a former  
Justice Department organized crime prosecutor who was hired by the 
union to head its internal cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassar and Robinson said they would discuss Vaira's opinion with  
lawyers for the union and encourage Luskin to appeal it. The 
internal union appellate officer is W. Neil Eggleston, a former 
chief appellate attorney in the U.S. Attorney's office of the 
Southern District of New York. Vaira was a former federal 
prosecutor in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department retained the right under the 1995  
agreement to prosecute union officers and seize control of the 
union if the government is dissatisfied with the internal cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Luskin said he would talk with federal officials about the case  
and their request that he appeal. But he said he doesn't believe 
the Tuesday decision would jeopardize the union's arrangement with 
the federal government to police itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we promised the government was not any particular result,  
but a fair, credible, aggressive and thorough process,'' Luskin 
said. He noted the union has removed about 200 officials and 
members during the internal sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Coia released a statement noting that the union's investigation  
has spared no one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now my focus is on the future, not on the past,'' he said. ``I  
remain totally committed to our reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coia's lawyer, Howard Gutman, said the evidence was convincing  
that Coia was not involved with organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence demonstrated overwhelmingly that Coia has never  
been controlled by the mob,'' Gutman said, ``and in fact the mob 
despises Arthur.''

<HEADLINE> Do You Have Too Much Company Stock? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Senior management has long been rewarded with  
company stock or stock options. Now it's commonplace for employers, 
particularly in high-tech industries, to reward many, if not all, 
of their employees with company stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there are risks in loading up on company stock, particularly  
in retirement plans, warns an expert on the subject at the College 
for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It often makes a lot of sense at the time to obtain the  
stock,'' says Bryan Schmitt, an academic associate at the College. 
``But if you accumulate a large amount of company stock, it can 
become a disproportionate share of your net worth, and that can 
create risks, particularly after you retire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obtaining company stock is attractive to many employees, Schmitt  
concedes. For example, it's common for companies to use their own 
stock instead of cash to match employee contributions to 401 (k) 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, according to Hewitt Associates, company stock accounts  
for one-third of the total value of assets in 401(k) plans that 
offer it. Employees also can typically buy the stock in a purchase 
plan or be awarded stock options at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the benefits of tax deferral and acquiring stock or  
options at discounts, many employees like obtaining company stock 
because it is stock they are familiar with, Schmitt says. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are downsides.  
</P>
<P>
	``The risk with obtaining a lot of company stock is that you  
have a lot riding on a single investment in a single industry,'' 
Schmitt says. If the company falters, it means not only your job 
may be at risk, so might your nest egg. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt says the risk is even worse for retirees who may still  
own a lot of their former employer's stock. Their pot of gold is 
tied up in that one stock. ``They don't have the option of changing 
jobs if the stock falters,'' Schmitt says. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it's easy to point to people who have made small or  
large fortunes owning their company stock. However, for every 
Microsoft or Intel, there are companies like Boston Market whose 
stock drops in value. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the big gains made by the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index  
and the Nasdaq in 1998 were generated by a relatively small number 
of companies. Most of the other companies made only modest gains or 
even lost value. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt recommends that retirees and employees, particularly  
those approaching retirement, systematically sell off some of their 
company stock and buy other investments in order to diversify their 
portfolio and lower their overall risk. Because holders of company 
stock typically track their stock closely, they often know about 
good times to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	You may have to work around potential selling restrictions.  
Companies often don't allow you to dispose of the stock for a 
certain period of time, particularly in the case of stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	If you can't sell some of the stock for a while, be sure the  
rest of your investments are not too similar to your company's 
stock, Schmitt suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxes may be another concern. It's not a worry if the stock is  
still inside a retirement plan where its sale won't incur taxes. 
But even taxable stock will probably receive favorable capital 
gains rates if you have held the stock at least a year, Schmitt 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt cautions that if you sell company stock it's best to use  
the proceeds to buy an asset that's not related to the industry 
you're in, Selling Microsoft and buying Intel doesn't help your 
diversification much. 
</P>
<P>
	If you are ready to retire and you have a lot of company stock  
in your retirement plan, don't automatically roll the plan proceeds 
into an individual retirement account, Schmitt says. 
</P>
<P>
	You have the option of taking the stock out as part of a lump  
sum. You'll pay regular income taxes on the stock, but only on the 
value of the stock at the time it was put into your account. 
</P>
<P>
	Any appreciation in the value of the stock since then is not  
taxed until you sell it, and then it will be taxed only at the 
capital gains rate. If you keep the stock until your death, it will 
pass to your heirs at its current market value, avoiding capital 
gains taxes entirely (though not necessarily estate taxes). If you 
roll the stock into an IRA instead, you'll pay regular income taxes 
on it when you withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk with this strategy is that you remain heavily invested  
in a single stock. So before taking this approach, you'll want to 
consult with your financial planner.

<HEADLINE> Airline Passengers Gripe to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bolstered by passenger tales of alleged  
mistreatment by airline companies, the administration and Congress 
are moving to improve protections of air travelers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were the victims and we were being shamed for not having  
the proper attitude,'' Barbara Plecas of Walled Lake, Mich., told 
lawmakers Wednesday, recounting how she and fellow Northwest 
Airlines passengers -- just arrived from Tampa, Fla. -- were stuck on 
a Detroit Metropolitan Airport tarmac for seven hours during a 
snowstorm last January. 
</P>
<P>
	Another passenger, Patricia Shank of Frederick, Md., told the  
House Transportation Committee of being confined for nine hours 
last January on a Virgin Atlantic plane that never took off from 
Washington's Dulles International Airport for London. When she 
declined to take another plane the next day, the airline refused to 
return her luggage, which was flown to London. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have struck a raw nerve here,'' committee Chairman Bud  
Shuster, R-Pa., told a packed hearing room. ``I can't walk through 
the halls here without members and constituents telling me their 
horror stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster has introduced a bill -- one of several ``passenger bill  
of rights'' measures now working their way through Congress -- that 
would require airlines to pay compensation to passengers kept 
waiting on a runway more than two hours, provide explanations for 
delays and cancellations and give refunds for flights canceled for 
economic reasons, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and Transportation Secretary Rodney  
Slater, meanwhile, introduced on Wednesday the administration's 
plans for legislative and regulatory action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Fair Treatment Initiative ... empowers passengers with all  
the information they need to make good decisions,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's proposed legislation would require airlines  
to: 
</P>
<P>
	--Disclose publicly their flight delay and cancellation policies;  
</P>
<P>
	--Provide food and restroom facilities during delays;  
</P>
<P>
	--Draw up evacuation procedures for extended delays and bumping;  
</P>
<P>
	--Provide notices on lower-priced ticket outlets;  
</P>
<P>
	--Double the maximum compensation for mishandled baggage to  
$2,500, and for being bumped from a flight to $800; 
</P>
<P>
	--Tell the Transportation Department monthly about complaints  
about their service. 
</P>
<P>
	In regulations that became effective Wednesday, airlines must  
inform passengers of code-sharing arrangements in which one airline 
books flights for another, and tell passengers when they buy 
tickets whether the flight involves changing planes. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, criticized the  
administration's proposals as ``a one-way ticket to higher air 
fares.'' He added, ``The last time I checked, federal bureaucrats 
aren't experts at finding lost bags or speeding up flight delays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those testifying spoke of long delays and airlines'  
failures to keep them informed and comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Pearlman of Columbia, Md., described a Christmas Eve TWA  
flight to San Francisco in which he was delayed in Baltimore and 
sat on the ground in St. Louis for two hours without food or drink 
even though the weather was fine and there was no apparent 
mechanical problem. Two days later, the airline issued a press 
release of an employee ``sick-out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another witness, Tami Rourke of New Berry, Mich., spoke in a  
halting voice of how her son, then 6 years old, got stuck in 
Minneapolis in 1996 when traveling alone on a Northwest flight from 
Tucson, Ariz., to Michigan. He was part of the industry's 
unaccompanied minor program, in which youngsters traveling alone 
are supposed to be supervised at all times, yet he was put in a 
hotel room with a 15-year-old boy who sexually molested him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time we make the airlines be held accountable for their  
obvious lack of true care and concern for more than mishandled 
baggage,'' said Rourke, who said she had reached an out-of-court 
settlement with Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest outside counsel Donald Mark, Jr., said in a letter  
Wednesday that Northwest transports 125,000 unaccompanied minors 
annually and there has never been another child molestation 
complaint. He said local police closed the investigation without 
filing charges after extensively interviewing the 15-year-old, who 
denied the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Transport Association President Carol Hallett, in testimony  
she is to deliver to a Senate hearing Thursday, says the airlines 
are taking steps to provide timely information about flight delays, 
quote passengers the lowest fare available and make sure that 
unaccompanied minors have appropriate supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand the frustrations passengers experience from time  
to time with weather and other factors,'' she says. ``The airlines 
share some of those same frustrations.''

 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Spike Lee  
</P>
<P>
	 *Image:* Thanks to the raw power of his movies, Spike Lee helped  
spark the urban film boom and has established himself as one of 
Hollywood's most influential filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* He was born Shelton Jackson Lee on March 20,  
1957 in Atlanta, the oldest of the five children reared by a jazz 
musician-father and schoolteacher-mother. His mother nicknamed him 
Spike when he was a toddler -- and the name stuck. ``I guess she 
thought I was a tough baby,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The family lived briefly in Chicago before moving to New York in  
1959 and settling in Brooklyn's Fort Greene neighborhood, where Lee 
has established his own production company, 40 Acres and a Mule 
Filmworks. 
</P>
<P>
	He graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta, then studied at  
New York University's film school for his master's. His student 
film, ``Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads,'' won a Student 
Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Breakout:* ``She's Gotta Have It,'' Lee's first major film, was  
a spirited and sexy romantic comedy. His father Bill Lee wrote the 
musical score. The film won an award at the Cannes Film Festival, 
and set Lee at the forefront of the black wave in American cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his career, Lee has focused on dramatizing race  
relations in films like ``School Daze,'' ``Do the Right Thing,'' 
``Jungle Fever'' and ``Malcolm X.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the agenda that I stir up controversy,'' he says.  
``When 99 percent of the films that come out of Hollywood are 
mindless entertainment, I guess it will be controversial to do 
something that has substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His most recent films include ``He Got Game,'' ``Get on the  
Bus'' and the documentary, ``4 Little Girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a longtime New York Knicks fan, has written a book, ``Best  
Seat in the House,'' about his courtside courtship with the game. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote:* ``I count my blessings every day because I'm making a  
living doing what makes me happy. Ninety-five percent of the people 
in this world go to their graves never getting to do what makes 
them happy.''

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Exec Joining MasterCard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citibank, which is switching its allegiance from  
Visa USA to MasterCard, is getting a seat on the new, smaller board 
of directors of MasterCard International. 
</P>
<P>
	While MasterCard said Wednesday it was slashing the size of its  
board nearly in half, the credit card association also nominated 
two new directors, including a Citigroup executive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the shake-up, the MasterCard board will be cut to 17 members  
from 31. The new members will be Robert B. Willumstad, head of 
global consumer lending for Citigroup, and Hiroshi Arai, president 
and chairman of Orient Corp. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, Citigroup's two representatives on the Visa  
board resigned in a dispute over Citigroup's plans to build up its 
own credit card brand image at the expense of Visa's. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup wanted to issue credit cards with the ``Citi'' name on  
the front and the Visa logo on the back. While Visa balked, 
MasterCard, which has been losing market share, swept in and made a 
deal with Citigroup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the way MasterCard is restructuring its board is  
going to be more aligned with our strategic thinking,'' said Susan 
Weeks, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect, over time, to issue a larger proportion of  
MasterCards in the United States than we have in the past, but we 
will continue to issue Visa cards,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	While MasterCard is expected to let Citigroup move the logo to  
the back of the card, Weeks said, ``Any decision (about the logo) 
would have to go before the MasterCard board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MasterCard said its decision to cut 14 board seats was part of a  
wider effort within the association to increase its flexibility and 
allow it to respond quickly to the fast-changing economic 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The change in the structure of our board, together with the  
recent realignment of our internal resources, is a strong 
demonstration of MasterCard's leadership, flexibility and intense 
focus on serving our most important customers,'' Robert W. 
Selander, president and chief executive of MasterCard, said in a 
statement.

<HEADLINE> Army Pilots On Trial for Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- A dubious report and clashing eyewitnesses  
are the weak foundation for claims that reckless flying by two Army 
helicopter pilots led to a crash that killed their wives, a defense 
lawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Doug Andrews said Tuesday that the Army based its case  
on shaky evidence, and blamed mechanical problems for the accident 
in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots, Chief Warrant Officer David Guido and Chief Warrant  
Officer Daniel Riddell, are charged with 27 military crimes, 
including negligent homicide, stemming from the crash July 6 on 
Grand Exuma Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Their wives, Pam Guido and Rebecca Riddell, died when the UH-60  
Blackhawk helicopter crashed into a dense forest. They were not 
authorized to be aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Six witnesses testified Tuesday at an Article 32 hearing, which  
is similar to a civilian grand jury and will determine whether 
there is sufficient evidence to warrant a court martial. 
</P>
<P>
	One witness said the helicopter technically should have been  
grounded because it was seven months overdue for a routine weight 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	But Andrews, Riddell's lawyer, said the craft had just been  
repaired. He said the prosecution was based on a questionable 
preliminary report and testimony of two people who initially didn't 
even agree on the direction the aircraft was flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Warrant Officer Lee Stryker, a maintenance pilot from Fort  
Bragg, N.C., also said investigators could find no mechanical 
problems that could have contributed to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Lt. Col. William Bryson, who helped investigate the  
crash, testified that he believed the accident was caused by a 
``pitch-back attack,'' a maneuver that causes the helicopter to 
abruptly change directions by spinning the tail around 180 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitch-back attacks are used in combat to return quickly to a  
target or to get behind and shoot an enemy aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not authorized for the UH-60 in that environment,''  
Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A third soldier, Sgt. William Westgate, a mechanic aboard the  
helicopter, claims he suffered brain damage in the crash. His case 
would be heard separately if Army doctors decide he is competent to 
participate in his own defense.

<HEADLINE> A Lifetime of Poking Pays Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio (AP) -- Over the past 32 years, Suzanne Bosl  
has been pierced with large-bore needles, held her breath in an 
underwater tank, spit into test tubes and even endured ice-cold 
cakes of glycerin on her skin. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bosl says any discomfort was worth being part of the ``Fels  
family,'' a group of test subjects for perhaps the largest and 
longest-running study of human growth, body composition and risk 
factors or heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fels Longitudinal Study began in 1929 in this southwest Ohio  
village. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was initially funded by Samuel Fels of the Fels soap  
company in Philadelphia at the request of his friend Arthur Morgan, 
then president of Antioch College in Yellow Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, about 1,200 people are in the study, most of them still  
living in southwest Ohio. Studied from birth, the first 
participants turn 70 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosl's husband was a test subject, and she became one when she  
married him because the researchers are interested in genetic 
factors. The couple's seven children and two grandchildren are also 
part of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosl's children were examined every six months, even if  
researchers had to arrange to pick them up at their homes or pay 
air fare. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are so interested in keeping that constant data,'' said  
Bosl, 57, of Spring Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Such studies may take on increasing importance as the U.S.  
population ages. Dan Perry, executive director of Alliance for 
Aging Research in Washington, said there is a real advantage to 
having a study that goes back 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen percent of Americans are currently over 65, and that is  
expected to hit 20 percent in 30 years. There are 60,000 Americans 
100 years or older, a group that has been doubling in size every 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our society has never experienced such a large proportion of  
our people in the upper age ranges,'' Perry said. ``I think it's 
enormously important to be measuring changes in human beings as 
they age, in a systematic and scientific way. We're in uncharted 
territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fels study is funded primarily by the federal government. A  
recent $5.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health 
will allow the research to continue for at least another five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The study initially researched the growth and development of  
children and then followed them into adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a healthy population of individuals who were identified  
at birth and studied since then,'' said Roger Siervogel, director 
of Wright State University medical school's division of human 
biology, which now conducts the study. ``It is probably the unique 
aspect. They were not selected for any specific diseases or 
anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 researchers and support staff do their work inside a  
one-story, red brick building that features state-of-the-art 
treadmills, X-ray tables that scan bones and tissue, an underwater 
tank that measures fat content and the ``Bod Pod,'' a futuristic 
cocoon that uses air pressure to check body composition. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's findings have been cited in hundreds of scientific  
journals. They have been used to: 
</P>
<P>
	-- establish growth charts used throughout the United States and  
recommended by the World Health Organization for children up to 3 
years old; 
</P>
<P>
	-- gauge the effects of smoking on pregnant women;  
</P>
<P>
	-- conclude that high cholesterol and blood pressure in children  
are likely to follow them into middle age; 
</P>
<P>
	-- develop a method to evaluate the growth of premature babies;  
</P>
<P>
	-- confirm the accuracy of using the body mass index in children  
to predict the risk of obesity later in life. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosl said she is kept informed of the study's findings through  
newsletters. She said she feels part of an important research 
effort and plans to stay in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Bosl is examined by the researchers every two years. She is  
usually paid $50 for the four-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never felt as though I was a guinea pig or anything  
other than a respected participant,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siervogel said researchers treat the test subjects well and that  
few have dropped out of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cost millions of dollars just to get the data from one  
person throughout their life,'' said Siervogel. ``We don't want to 
do anything that would make them think twice about coming in the 
next time. If we lose a person, we've lost a lifetime's worth of 
data. It's not like you can go down to the supermarket and get 
somebody else to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Harvard Expels Student for Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Harvard University faculty voted to  
dismiss a student who admitted to sexually assaulting a classmate, 
as debate flared over whether the school treated a date rape case 
seriously enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred students protested outside the building where  
faculty members voted to dismiss D. Drew Douglas, a decision 
reached Tuesday evening after professors rejected a lesser 
punishment of withdrawal that would have allowed him to petition 
for readmission. 
</P>
<P>
	One demonstrator held aloft a sign that read ``Harvard coddles  
rapists but won't hold survivors' hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy it was dismissal and not withdrawal,'' said  
student Anna Baldwin, 20. ``But Harvard still has a long way to go 
in dealing with sexual violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas and the woman were friends when they spent a night  
together. The woman later complained to the college's 
administrative board, which investigated and found the 
then-sophomore had committed an act of rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas and the woman agreed that he assaulted her while she  
slept, according to The Boston Globe, which cited unidentified 
faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas pleaded guilty in a criminal court last year to battery  
and indecent assault, or improper sexual touching. Douglas was 
sentenced to five years probation, including 18 months under house 
arrest at home in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas lawyer James Sultan said his client's life already has  
been devastated. ``His career at Harvard is over,'' Sultan said. 
``His name is now being dragged through the mud by people 
furthering a political agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 250 of the 650 Arts and Sciences faculty members  
voted and chose dismissal by a wide margin, said Sally Baker, a 
school spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas could be readmitted only with another vote by faculty  
and if new evidence emerged, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students accused Harvard of failing to act swiftly in the  
case, pointing out that academic dishonesty brings dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	But several professors said considering withdrawal was  
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rape ... ranges from date rape to brutal assaults to gang  
rapes,'' said psychology professor Daniel Gilbert, one of five 
faculty members who proposed withdrawal. ``They are all heinous, 
but there are differences.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Pump Mogul Gets Life Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An immigrant who made a fortune with a chain of  
gas stations was sentenced to life in prison for ordering the 
killings of two men who knew too much about his mob-style business 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury voted Tuesday to spare Gurmeet Singh Dhinsa the  
death penalty but he will not be eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Dhinsa, 36, was convicted by the same jury last week on multiple  
racketeering charges, including rigging gas pumps to cheat 
customers, evading taxes and using deadly force to silence fellow 
Sikhs who threatened to expose him. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Shargel, Dhinsa's attorney, said he will appeal the  
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Until his arrest in 1997, Dhinsa appeared to be living an  
American success story. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived in the United States in 1982 from India's  
impoverished Punjab region and took a job pumping gas. He saved 
enough money to lease that station, and then he began opening 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, his City Gas chain employed 300 people at 51  
stations in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. Annual 
revenue topped $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the city repeatedly cited Dhinsa for overcharging customers.  
In 1990, he was arrested in the kidnap-torture of one of his 
attendants. He served 90 days in jail on lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, another City Gas employee vanished. When the employee's  
brother confronted Dhinsa, the businessman allegedly paid a 
criminal to kill the brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Dhinsa struck again in 1997, ordering the  
killing of a cab driver who was cooperating in an FBI investigation 
of City Gas.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Clippers Keep On Losing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Even Billy Crystal, their most famous  
fan, is having a rough time with this. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been exceptionally hard the last couple of years,'' the  
actor said from his courtside seat at the Sports Arena. ``The guys 
are great guys, I know a few of them. After a while, how much of 
this can you take?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows? The Los Angeles Clippers just keep on losing, with no  
end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	They were 0-16 and on Wednesday night against the Los Angeles  
Lakers at the Forum were in position to match the worst start to a 
season in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	If they lose to the Lakers, they will have the futility record  
all to themselves on Thursday night by losing to the much-improved 
Sacramento Kings at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rooting for them, I want them to win at least one game,''  
said Eileen Foster, who works in one of the Sports Arena's souvenir 
shops. ``I feel sorry for them. I can't believe they're so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, the Clippers were at home and lost to the  
Lakers 103-99. And most of the announced crowd of 13,380 seemed to 
be pulling for the Lakers. No great surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have made the playoffs just three times since the  
1975-76 season, and have had just one winning season in the last 19 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering this season, they were 416-814 since moving to Los  
Angeles from San Diego in 1984. That's just a little more than one 
win in every three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dudas has been a season ticket-holder since 1989, and he's  
seen a lot of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans aren't rational,'' he said. ``There are a few of us,  
4,000 or 5,000 dedicated Clipper fans. They have to be dedicated to 
cheer for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-year Clippers coach Chris Ford has tried to stay upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's my job to stay positive,'' Ford said. ``It's not easy.  
Winning's easy, losing's tough at any level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Darrick Martin said that for the franchise to change, the  
change must start at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got guys who don't know what's going on, who don't feel  
appreciated here,'' Martin said. ``Everyone wants to feel 
appreciated. I've talked to different guys on other teams who say 
when things are going bad, the general manager, the owner, come and 
talk to you. It hasn't happened here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does get frustrating at times. I don't like to lose. I've  
lost a lot of sleep over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he thinks Ford has handled things admirably.  
</P>
<P>
	``Me, I'd probably be throwing chairs right now if I coached the  
team,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Taylor, a second-year forward who scored 24 points  
Tuesday night, recalled the Phoenix Suns of two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phoenix started 0-13 and made the playoffs,'' he said. ``I  
don't give up, not on anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Lawler, the Clippers' play-by-play radio announcer, thinks  
the team will be helped by the move next fall to the new Staples 
Center, where the Lakers and NHL's Los Angeles Kings will also 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be easier to attract free agents, and the team  
will be well under the salary cap after this season,'' Lawler said. 
``It's absolutely there for the team this summer. I think it's 
going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does 20-year-old Lakers star Kobe Bryant -- at least at some  
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my 20-year career here, I'm sure they're going to have some  
pretty good teams,'' Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why the Clippers have been down for so long, Bryant  
needed some time to come up with an answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad luck,'' he said. ``A lot of bad luck.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Torre Has Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- The last five months prepared the New  
York Yankees for the jolting news that Joe Torre has prostate 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre delivered that report Wednesday before leaving the  
Yankees, a team that has been shadowed by death and disease since 
he took over as manager three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're Yankees. We can deal with this better than anyone  
else,'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said. ``We have with Joe 
DiMaggio's passing, Darryl Strawberry's cancer and we will now. Joe 
Torre will come out of this as a champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team believes doctors caught the disease in its early  
stages, and Steinbrenner said Wednesday's test results are 
encouraging. He said Torre could be back in three weeks -- in time 
for the season opener April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Torre's condition came two days after DiMaggio died of  
complications from lung-cancer surgery and on the same day 
Strawberry returned to the lineup for the first time since 
undergoing colon cancer surgery in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``After what Darryl went through last year, we just have to be  
ready for something like this,'' Tino Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, former Yankees star Catfish Hunter appeared at  
the team's camp too weak to shake hands because of Lou Gehrig's 
Disease. In 1996, when Torre became the Yankees' manager, his 
brother Rocco died, and his brother Frank had a heart transplant 
during the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what Torre's course of treatment  
will be or where he will be treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine, and I am looking forward to taking care of this  
problem and getting back to work,'' said the 58-year-old manager, 
who spent the day at his spring home in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees will rotate managers while Torre is out. Hitting  
coach Chris Chambliss managed the split squad game Wednesday in 
Fort Myers against the Red Sox, and Stump Merrill, who managed the 
Yankees in 1990-91 and is now a special assistant to general 
manager Brian Cashman, handled the team's game in Bradenton against 
the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-base coach Willie Randolph and pitching coach Mel  
Stottlemyre also will share the managing duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is upbeat,'' Stottlemyre said after visiting Torre.  
``Naturally I'm very concerned. He's our leader. He's a manager as 
well as a very good friend. Any time a friend has a problem, you're 
really concerned. I've got my fingers crossed and everything else 
crossed that everything will be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who convinced Torre to let him return Wednesday -- a  
week earlier than expected -- said the team was ``devastated'' by 
the news, which dampened his return to the Yankees lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really couldn't get as motivated as I would have been,''  
Strawberry said after going 1-for-4 against the Red Sox. ``No one 
wants to see someone else face this particular battle. It is a 
difficult battle for anybody. We all have to realize that until 
there is a cure for cancer there are no guarantees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre met with his coaches and then individually with veterans  
Joe Girardi, Paul O'Neill and David Cone on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Girardi informed the Yankees who went to Fort Myers in a brief  
closed-door meeting two hours before the game. O'Neill told the 
group of players in Bradenton, while Cone told those who stayed in 
Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest thing to understand is why,'' Girardi said. ``The  
first thing that went through my mind is what's next. You see 
Darryl coming back and then you hear Joe has cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is second only to lung cancer among cancer  
killers of American men, taking about 40,000 lives annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Most prostate cancer happens sporadically; patients have no  
particular family history of the disease. However, about one in 10 
cases seems to be clearly inherited, because many men in the same 
family have it. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre is the third prominent person in baseball to be diagnosed  
with cancer this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga was diagnosed with a  
cancerous tumor in his lower back and is undergoing chemotherapy. 
He will miss the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell, a former Yankees  
prospect, was diagnosed last month with testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``As players, we're not immune to what everyone else has to  
face,'' said Scott Brosius, whose father was diagnosed with colon 
cancer last year. ``A lot of people go through this. It definitely 
gets you when it hits this close to home. Our thoughts and prayers 
are with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marv Levy, the former coach of the Buffalo Bills, underwent  
surgery for prostate cancer during the 1995 NFL season and, at 70, 
was back coaching within a month.

	``Joe is taking the correct steps,'' Levy said. ``It is a  
disease that, when diagnosed early and treated aggressively, is 
highly curable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre has a 302-184 record and has won two World Series  
championships in his first three years as Yankees manager. Last 
year, Torre led the Yankees to an AL-record 114 wins and swept San 
Diego in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who signed a two-year contract extension last month,  
joined Casey Stengel and Ralph Houk as the only managers to lead

<HEADLINE> Feds Check Out Exxon-Mobil Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission will closely  
examine the Exxon-Mobil oil merger, especially how it will affect 
competition in the Northeast, Gulf Coast region and California, a 
senior commission official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exxon and Mobil face each other at just about every level of  
the industry ... in many parts of the country,'' especially in 
those regions, William Baer, director of competition at the FTC, 
told a congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously a transaction of this size alone merits our close  
attention,'' said Baer. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon agreed in December to acquire Fairfax, Va.-based Mobil for  
$73.7 billion in stock, combining the biggest U.S. oil companies 
and reuniting two of the biggest pieces left by the 1911 government 
breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still awaits government approval, and federal  
regulatory agencies -- the FTC as well as the Securities and 
Exchange Commission -- testified Wednesday before the House Commerce 
energy and power subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the oil industry is rapidly consolidating, Rep. Tom  
Bliley, R-Va., the Commerce panel chairman, said, ``It is important 
that we take a look at these mergers -- what is driving them and how 
they will impact consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee was scheduled to hear from the chairmen of both  
Exxon and Mobil on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baer said that the FTC's investigation ``is still at an early  
stage'' and no conclusions have been reached on the effects of the 
merger on competition or whether it would violate any antitrust 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the focus of potential competitive problems will be  
in the Northeast, the Gulf Coast and California where the two 
companies go head-to-head in refining and retail sales at gasoline 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Hakes, head of the federal Energy Information  
Administration, told the subcommittee that the two oil giants 
overlap in marketing and refinery operations, especially in the 
Gulf Coast region. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Exxon and Mobil account for less than 12 percent of U.S.  
(refining) capacity, they control 18 percent of the Gulf Coast 
capacity,'' said Hakes. That's comparable to the BP-Amoco refining 
capacity in the Midwest, a merger that has been approved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In retail marketing, the two companies ``have the largest  
overlap in ... the Northeast,'' said Hakes. The two companies 
control more than 15 percent of the branded retail gasoline 
stations in Northeastern states, he said.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks Minor Leaguer Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- An Arizona Diamondbacks minor league  
pitcher was indicted Wednesday on a manslaughter charge in 
connection with a drunken driving accident that killed a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	Pima County authorities said John Rosengren could face 7 to 21  
years in prison if convicted for ``recklessly causing the death'' 
of former major league pitcher Ken Robinson, who was a passenger in 
Rosengren's car that overturned Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 29, was declared dead at the scene.  
</P>
<P>
	Rosengren, 26, is scheduled to be arraigned Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Tests showed Rosengren had a blood-alcohol level of 0.162 -- well  
above Arizona's legal limit of 0.10 -- after the early-morning 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	He was originally charged with second-degree murder but released  
on $75,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	A relief pitcher for Toronto in 1995 and 1997 and for Kansas  
City in 1996, Robinson was coming off surgery last season -- as was 
Rosengren. They both were in Tucson to await the start of the 
Diamondbacks' minor league spring training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was buried in his Diamondbacks uniform Friday in  
Jacksonville, Fla.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Urges Flight Recorder Upgrades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board is  
recommending that airplanes be retrofitted in 2005 with new cockpit 
voice recorders that can capture two hours of audio. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board also wants airlines retrofitted with an  
independent power source that can continue operating recording 
devices for 10 minutes after power to the plane is lost. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Tuesday to the Federal Aviation Administration, NTSB  
chairman Jim Hall suggested several steps the FAA should take to 
prevent the loss of valuable in-flight data. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall cited several major accidents in which investigations have  
been hampered by recorders shutting off and missing crucial 
segments of information. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the FAA should require airplanes manufactured after Jan.  
1, 2003, that have a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data 
recorder to have two combinations of these systems. One of the 
recording systems would be located as close as possible to the 
cockpit, the other as far back in the plane as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Both systems should be able to cover the flight data for the  
previous 25 hours of operation and all cockpit audio information 
for the last 2 hours of operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The two systems should be powered from separate generator buses.  
The system closer to the cockpit should also have an independent 
power source that would automatically start up and run the 
recorders for 10 minutes if the planes were to lose power, the NTSB 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said it would give serious consideration to the  
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always review board recommendations carefully,'' said FAA  
spokesman Eliot Brenner. He noted that in mid-1997, the FAA ordered 
all airlines to upgrade their flight data recorders to more modern 
versions that can record additional data. Airlines have until the 
middle of 2001 to meet this requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Current regulations call for a cockpit voice recorder with a  
minimum 30-minute duration. In recommending extending this time, 
Hall pointed to the case of Swissair Flight 111. Crucial data on 
the last six minutes of the flight is missing from its so-called 
black boxes, complicating the investigation into the Sept. 2 
tragedy that killed 229 people off the waters of Nova Scotia, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots reported smoke in the cockpit about an hour into the  
flight from New York to Geneva. The plane crashed into the sea 16 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crew conversations and cockpit sounds prior to the beginning  
of the 30-minute recording might have provided insight into any 
initiating or precursory events that led to the accident,'' Hall 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that in 52 accidents and incidents since 1983,  
information from either the cockpit or the flight data recorders 
was lost because of a shutdown of electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also recommended that the aviation industry prewire  
aircraft and develop recording systems flexible enough to 
incorporate new technology, such as video, when it is introduced.

<HEADLINE> NASA To Fix Hubble Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *NASA to launch emergency repair trip to telescope    	
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA will launch an emergency repair  
mission this fall to the Hubble Space Telescope, which is in danger 
of shutting down. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA decided Wednesday to move up the next regularly scheduled  
Hubble visit to October so that spacewalking astronauts can fix the 
telescope's deteriorating pointing system. The mission had been set 
for June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Hubble's six gyroscopes, needed for pointing and  
stability, have failed since astronauts' last service call, in 
1997. And a third gyroscope is partly broken and is considered 
unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers need at least three perfect gyroscopes to conduct  
observations throughout the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are one failure away from losing science,'' said Ed Weiler,  
head of NASA's space science program. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the $2 billion telescope would be safe in orbit without  
any working gyroscopes, NASA does not want to risk losing any 
valuable science time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a so-called spacecraft emergency where we're in  
danger of losing the entire mission or the entire spacecraft,'' 
Weiler said. ``You can think of it more as a science emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the original 2000 mission will be divided into  
two parts: the first will be launched around mid-October aboard 
Discovery and the second in late 2000 or early 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides replacing all six gyroscopes in October, spacewalking  
astronauts will install a new computer, radio transmitter, guidance 
sensor and data recorder, and fix peeling insulation. 
</P>
<P>
	During their second visit, the same astronauts will equip Hubble  
with new solar panels, an advanced camera and a newfangled cooling 
unit for an infrared camera that has run out of the frozen nitrogen 
needed for observations. 
</P>
<P>
	The four astronauts who will do the repairs have been training  
since last summer and can easily accommodate the early flight, NASA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra mission will cost NASA $75 million more than what's  
been budgeted for Hubble. But Weiler called it ``a rather good 
insurance policy'' considering the science that might be lost if 
NASA were to wait until next summer to make the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubble was launched in 1990 with a misshapen mirror.  
Spacewalking astronauts corrected the telescope's vision in 1993, 
restoring Hubble to a world-class instrument able to see to the 
fringes of the universe, and returned in 1997 to add or replace 11 
major parts. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA will have to rearrange the shuttle flight schedule to  
squeeze in the Hubble mission. Those details have yet to be worked 
out.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Wants China Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHENZHEN, China (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. moved to step up its  
presence in China's fast-growing Internet market with a unique deal 
to get Chinese consumers onto the Web and another to help the 
government go online. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals underscore Microsoft's determination to crack one of  
the world's most restricted but potentially lucrative markets for 
Internet products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a small fraction of the nation's 1.2 billion people own  
personal computers, let alone have Web access, and Internet use is 
tightly regulated by government authorities. The proposals unveiled 
by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates Wednesday would make it easier and 
cheaper for Chinese consumers to log on to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	One Microsoft venture, dubbed ``Venus,'' would let Chinese  
consumers view the Internet through their television sets, similar 
to Microsoft's Web TV product in the United States. TV sets are far 
more widespread in China than PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese consumers would need to buy a small, low-cost device,  
possibly a set-top box, that uses a version of Microsoft's Windows 
CE operating system, which runs the basic functions of gadgets 
other than personal computers. Users would also need a keyboard, 
joystick or mouse, but wouldn't need to shell out for a PC. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will really open up Internet usage in a dramatic way,''  
Gates told reporters at a signing ceremony in the booming southern 
border city of Shenzhen. 
</P>
<P>
	The devices are expected to go on sale later this year, said  
Phil Holden, a group product manager for Redmond, Wash.-based 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is part of a two-fold Microsoft strategy to eventually  
sell more Internet software in China. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second deal, Microsoft donated Internet software to China  
Telecom, the state telephone monopoly, and the State Economic and 
Trade Commission to help put their operations online. Microsoft 
officials did not disclose a value on the donated software. 
</P>
<P>
	The ventures come at a time when the Chinese government has been  
seeking to control the Internet and other new forms of 
telecommunications and multimedia services both for the sake of 
profit and to block the use of such services for political dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	China has passed laws to keep pornography -- and material that  
the government views as subversive -- off the Internet. Special 
computer crime squads have been set up. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the government in Beijing has encouraged the rapid  
spread of Internet use in China -- assuming service providers follow 
the rules, such as registering customers with the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet use in China has soared. Users topped 2.1 million in  
1998, a fourfold growth in a year, and another 1.5 million accounts 
are expected to be opened this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later, technology will find a way to circumvent  
restrictions,'' said Charle Peza, a telecommunications analyst at 
the Hong Kong office of investment bank Salomon Smith Barney. ``The 
policy direction in China seems to be one of opening up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft announced another deal in Shanghai last year which  
involved offering Internet services over small, handheld computers. 
Those devices were developed using entirely Western technology. But 
in the new venture, Microsoft says it is using technology jointly 
developed by Western and Chinese experts at its research facility 
in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Two Charged in Arms Export Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A federal grand jury indicted two men on charges  
they tried to illegally export missile-guidance equipment to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Collin Xu, 33, also known as Collin Shu, a naturalized Canadian  
citizen who lives in Montreal, is accused of violating the Arms 
Export Control Act, conspiracy and money laundering. He faces up to 
65 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Yi Yao, 33, of Beijing, is also accused of violating the export  
act. He could face up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men, indicted Tuesday, allegedly conspired to buy  
military fiberoptic gyroscopes from a Massachusetts manufacturer 
and ship them to a Beijing firm by way of Xu's Canadian company, 
Lion Photonics Canada of Montreal, without notifying the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Xu's firm, along with Lion Photonics Inc. of Beijing, owned by  
Yao, also are charged with export violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts firm was unaware of the scheme and faces no  
charges, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gyroscopes can be used in navigational systems for missiles and  
aircraft guidance systems.

<HEADLINE> Student Found Dead on NYC Sidewalk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A graduate student from Kansas who was working  
with battered women was found dead on a Brooklyn sidewalk with a 
kitchen knife in her back. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe robbery was the motive for the Monday night  
attack on Amy Watkins, 26, who was studying for her masters in 
social work while working with victims of domestic violence in the 
Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amy was very dedicated to social justice and believed in  
everyone,'' said Megan Nolan of the New Settlement Community 
Center. ``She always had a big smile on her face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Watkins was returning from the Bronx, where she had  
organized a meeting for parents about their children's reading 
scores. She got off at a subway station in the Prospect Heights 
section of Brooklyn, bought a few items at a grocery store and was 
walking home when stabbed once in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor said he heard her scream.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was such a noise,'' said the man, who declined to give his  
name. ``I didn't hear a call for help. She must've been 
surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post reported today that a witness chased the male  
attacker before he vanished with her wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Watkins was born in Illinois and raised in Lawrence, Kan.,  
where she graduated from the University of Kansas. She was a 
second-year graduate student at Hunter College's School of Social 
Work. 
</P>
<P>
	``This terrible event occurred at the outset of what would have  
been a brilliant career of public service,'' college president 
David A. Caputo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father, Lawrence Watkins, a teacher at a private school in  
Manhattan, said he was ``heartbroken'' and ``devastated.''

<HEADLINE> Plant Heirlooms for New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Try growing some heirlooms in your  
garden in this last year of the millennium. How better to salute 
the past than to savor a Brandywine tomato, hailed by many as the 
tastiest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Or plant some old-fashioned petunias, pansies and violas and  
enjoy the looks and fragrances that delighted our forebears. 
</P>
<P>
	Heirloom plants, to be sure, have been making a comeback in the  
past decade. Gardeners have increasingly been willing to put up 
with the faults of old plants in order to enjoy their merits. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the Brandywine tomato. This Amish family heirloom dating  
back to around 1885 has poor disease resistance and is likely to 
develop cracks and off-shapes. It's not a cosmetic winner for the 
supermarket produce shelf. But many of us gardeners don't care 
about that. It's the flavor that counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Itself an heirloom, the venerable seedhouse of W. Atlee Burpee &AMP;  
Co of Warminster, Pa., has issued a special, beautifully 
illustrated 1999 catalog dedicated exclusively to old vegetables 
and flowers. You can order it at 800-888-1447 or see it on the Web 
at www.burpee.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Burpee is offering heirlooms not only by the seed packet but  
also in a selection of 61 potted flower and vegetable plants ready 
to go into the garden. 
</P>
<P>
	There are tomatoes here you may never have heard of, like  
Watermelon Beefsteak that get to weigh two pounds and more. Fifty 
seeds come at $2.95 per packet while six plants sell for $14.95. 
Brandywine prices: 50 seeds $2.45, six plants $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tomato called Mortgage Lifter is a huge, tasty beefsteak  
developed in the 1930s by a gardener who is said to have paid off 
his mortgage in six years by selling 1,000 plants a year at $1 
apiece. (That's a $70,000 mortgage in today's dollars.) Fifty seeds 
$2.95, six plants $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Burpee first marketed a sweet pepper called Chinese Giant in  
1900 and here it is again. It's described as twice as big as the 
largest bell pepper of that time and is still remarkable today at 
four inches across and four inches long. The cost: $2.95 for 100 
seeds, $12.95 for six plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Among eggplants, Burpee has the near-centenarian Black Beauty,  
of course, but also the lesser-known Rosa Bianca, an old Italian 
variety bearing medium-sized white fruits heavily blushed and 
streaked with rosy purple. Thirty seeds $2.25, six plants $12.95. 
</P>
<P>
	In the razzle-dazzle that has characterized corn in the last 10  
years, the accent being on ``sweet sweet,'' you may have forgotten 
some old varieties that had more of a corn flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	Burpee has revived Golden Bantam and Country Gentleman, both  
$2.95 for 200 seeds. The first, an early-maturing variety 
introduced in 1902, made yellow corn popular. Country Gentleman, 
also known as Shoe Peg, dates from around 1890 and features 
irregularly arranged white kernels, very deep and narrow. In 
fertile soil, it can yield three ears to a stalk. 
</P>
<P>
	The catalog also features old varieties of beans, carrots,  
beets, Brussels sprouts, cucumbers, leeks, lettuce, okra, onions, 
peas, melons, pumpkins, squash, radishes, spinach and turnips. 
</P>
<P>
	In flowers, there are many to catch the eye, like an amaranth  
called Joseph's Coat (A. splendens), described as the most 
boldly-colored of all amaranths -- brilliant gold and scarlet. Its 
older foliage is green at the base and splashed with red and yellow 
at the tips. Two hundred seeds $1.95, 12 plants $16.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Among others whose picture attracted me is a chrysanthemum  
called Tricolor Daisy (C. carinatum). Known as a painted daisy, it 
was introduced from Morocco 200 years ago. Its 2-feet tall plants 
produce bright daisies with purple centers surrounded by rings of 
yellow and red at the base of pure white petals. One hundred seeds 
cost $2.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Burpee hasn't stopped with vegetables and flowers to mark the  
century's passing. It is offering prints of old Burpee catalog 
illustrations suitable for framing at $6.95 apiece and $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
	One, dating from 1887, shows the ``painted daisy''  
chrysanthemum, a poppy and more. Another, from 1926, shows a 
lovely, partly husked ear of Golden Bantam corn. The catalog art 
also decorates metal serving trays offered at $9.99 apiece with a 
packet of seeds thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
	In another century, perhaps, this unusual catalog will also be  
an heirloom.

	Dow Gains 79, Hits New High  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes shot to record highs today as oil  
stocks rose with oil prices, but concerns about earnings at 
technology companies limited the advances in Nasdaq trading. The 
Dow Jones industrial average gained 79.08 to close at 9,772.84,

The Nasdaq added 13.07 to finish at 2,406.01, still shy of its

reports that a Saudi official said the world's oil producers are 
close to an agreement to cut production to shore up prices. Stocks 
got another boost as Ralph Acampora, director of technical research 
at Prudential Securities and a well-known market bull, told a group 
of Belgian traders that U.S. equities, especially blue-chip Dow 
components, are in the ``early stages of another bull market.''

	FTC To Examine Exxon-Mobil Deal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission will closely  
examine the Exxon-Mobil oil merger, especially how it will affect 
competition in the Northeast, Gulf Coast region and California, a 
senior commission official said today. ``Exxon and Mobil face each 
other at just about every level of the industry ... in many parts 
of the country,'' especially in those regions, William Baer, 
director of competition at the FTC, told a congressional hearing. 
Exxon agreed in December to acquire Mobil for $73.7 billion in 
stock, combining the biggest U.S. oil companies.

	Takeover Bid Shakes Up French Banks

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Banque Nationale de Paris' surprise $37.2 billion  
bid for two rival French banks faces serious hurdles including the 
politically sensitive issue of layoffs in a country with high 
unemployment and possible clashes in management styles. The move in 
an unprecedented three-way merger comes as European banks are 
joining forces to better compete in a market transformed by a new 
common currency, the euro. The $1 trillion in combined assets under 
the merger proposal would easily exceed the size of what was going 
to be the world's biggest bank -- the $800 billion institution that 
would be created by the acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp. by 
Deutsche Bank AG.

	Winter storms that blanketed the mid-Atlantic states with up to  
a foot of snow eased today as the low pressure that brought the 
system moved into the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was lingering this morning from the Ohio Valley to the  
mid-Atlantic states, adding another inch or two to the thick 
blanket already on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as a foot of snow fell Tuesday in parts of West Virginia

</P>
<P>
	Snow showers and flurries were still possible over the eastern  
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, with only minor accumulations. Farther 
west, a weak disturbance was expected to spread snow into the 
northern Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	An inch or so of light snow had already fallen this morning in  
South Dakota and Nebraska, while clouds collected near the Canadian

<HEADLINE> China Has No Plans for Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's central bank governor on Thursday doused  
renewed speculation about a possible devaluation of the Chinese 
currency, saying Beijing has no plans to allow the value of the 
yuan to decline in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a ``fundamental basis'' for maintaining the stability  
of the country's currency and there are no plans to explore a 
possible devaluation of the yuan, People's Bank of China Gov. Dai 
Xianglong told reporters at a press conference during the annual 
session of the national legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai noted that China maintains a favorable balance of payments  
and steady export flows. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese yuan, which isn't freely convertible, is backed by  
China's approximate $149 billion in foreign exchange reserves, the 
second highest in the world behind Japan. China also recorded a 
trade surplus of $43.6 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai rebutted a report in Thursday's edition of the Financial  
Times that cited a senior government official saying decisions to 
devalue the yuan would depend on whether China can maintain 
acceptable levels of economic growth and social stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Chinese authorities have long denied any devaluation is  
imminent, the caveats added to the nation's no devaluation pledge 
give the authorities more room to move, the Financial Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Chinese leaders have repeatedly stressed their belief  
that a devaluation would do more harm than good. A devaluation 
could prompt competitive devaluations elsewhere in Asia by 
countries trying to boost their export competitiveness by making 
the dollar value of their products cheaper.

	WATERTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- A farmer who apparently was overwhelmed  
by financial problems is charged with neglecting his cows, leading 
to the deaths of 47 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	John D. Garvin, 31, of Rutland, was arrested Sunday, one day  
after state police discovered the animals had died, apparently from 
starvation. Another 33 in poor condition were turned over to 
another dairy farmer for care, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garvin is charged with 80 counts of torturing, injuring or  
overdriving animals, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Trooper John Poggi said state police found ``an awful scene'' at  
Garvin's farm 75 miles north of Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Some dead cows had half-born calves, and many of the dead  
animals -- as well as a couple of live ones -- were frozen into two 
or three feet of manure that covered the barn floor.

<HEADLINE> Frozen Embryos at Kansas Beef Expo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Cattle auction.  
</P>
<P>
	The very words conjure up images of clanging gates as cowboys  
drive wild-eyed cattle into the sale ring moments before the 
fast-talking auctioneer starts the bidding. It is a tradition as 
old as the American West. 
</P>
<P>
	But the future is gaining a foothold at the Kansas Beef Expo  
this week. For among the 300 consigned cattle -- representing 11 
beef breeds -- will be 10 frozen embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angus embryos, just seven days old, will be offered in two  
lots of five embryos each. Frozen in liquid nitrogen, the live 
embryos can be implanted in the buyer's recipient cow immediately -- 
or 20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sire is dead, so there is limited semen -- hopefully that  
should make them more intriguing to somebody,'' said Galen Fink, 
owner of Fink Beef Genetics of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, breeders have flushed out several fertilized eggs  
from more expensive donor cows and transplanted them into 
commercial-grade cows. As many as 25 percent of Kansas purebred 
cattle producers use embryo transplants to some degree, Fink said. 
</P>
<P>
	But most such sales are usually made directly, and only more  
recently have embryos been showing up at production sales around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is something new, the beef industry is changing. We are  
auctioning off an unborn calf, and they are selling a mating 
between a certain cow and a certain bull,'' said Todd Johnson, 
executive secretary of the Kansas Livestock Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good way to get some of the best genetics available in  
a short amount of time,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not the first time embryos have been sold at the Beef  
Expo, but they are still uncommon here. And the embryos are not the 
only unusual item that will hit the beef sale ring this Friday 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	Also up for bidding will be three straws of semen from a  
Simmental bull. Those sale proceeds will benefit the Kansas Junior 
Simmental Association, which is hosting the national classic show 
in Hutchinson in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nice thing is you don't have to buy the bull or the cow,  
which might be very valuable,'' Johnson said. ``This way you can 
propagate these animals without the expense of purchasing the 
mother or father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, embryos sell for between $300 and $1,000, while a  
yearling calf from the same parentage can sell for between $2,000 
and $10,000, Fink said. A semen straw from a prized bull can sell 
for as much as $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, half of the calf embryos are successfully implanted,  
Fink said. 
</P>

	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Even though Texas sweet onions  
were planted late this year, the crop is rapidly growing to make up 
for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the wettest falls in history delayed the planting of  
spring onion, according to Joe Pena of the Texas Agricultural 
Extension Service in Uvalde. 
</P>
<P>
	``This delayed the planting of the onions,'' Pena said, ``and  
they did not have time to grow in the fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pena said the mild winter has allowed the onions to grow faster,  
and dry conditions have benefited onions because high humidity 
causes disease problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dry conditions mean less need to use fungicide,'' Pena said,  
``but it also means the crop needs to be irrigated more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are distinct markets in the onion industry and people know  
when to look for Texas onions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The onions in the store now are from Mexico,'' Pena said. ``By  
the time the Mexican onions are sold out, the onions in the Rio 
Grande Valley are just being harvested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the current estimate for acres for harvest in Texas is  
12,400 acres, which is about 1,000 acres more than last year. State 
production for this year is forecast at 347.2 million pounds, an 
increase of 20 percent from last year. Pena said thats enough 
onions to make about 26 billion onion rings.

<HEADLINE> Seminoles Extend Coaches' Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Steve Robinson's .500 record as  
basketball coach at Florida State the last two seasons netted him a 
two-year contract extension Wednesday, athletic director Dave Hart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart also extended the contract of women's basketball coach Sue  
Semrau, who was 16-38 in her first two seasons. Both coaches are 
now under 5-year agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision represents an acknowledgment of the substantial  
rebuilding jobs both coaches have undertaken and an appreciation 
for the manner in which they have gone about their respective 
tasks,'' Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was paid $415,891 last year, and Semrau $120,800.  
</P>
<P>
	Robinson went 18-14 in his first season at Florida State and  
reached the NCAA tournament with a team made up largely of players 
recruited by previous coach Pat Kennedy, who is now at DePaul. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles slipped to 13-17 this year, winning just two games  
in the final six weeks of the season. They are 12-23 in Atlantic 
Coach Conference play under Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's team is 7-27 in ACC play since Semrau replaced Chris  
Gobrecht, who broke her 5-year contract with the school and left 
after just one season to become coach at her alma mater, Southern 
California. Florida State sued Gobrecht and the parties reached an 
out-of-court settlement.

<P>
	Jurgensen, 50, joined the newspaper at its founding in 1982. She

special projects, managing editor for cover stories and editor of 
the Life section. She began her journalism career at the Charlotte

career with Gannett's Westchester Rockland newspaper group in 1971. 
He is a former managing editor of the Gannett News Service.

<HEADLINE> Bill May Help Nursing Home Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nursing homes would be barred from evicting  
residents solely because they rely on Medicaid under legislation 
approved Wednesday by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed 398-12, was prompted by an attempt by a major  
nursing home operator last year to remove residents who paid 
through Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the 
poor. Medicaid payment rates are generally lower than those of 
private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is unfair and flat out wrong that our most  
vulnerable and frail citizens and their families must worry about 
being evicted from their nursing homes in favor of people who can 
pay higher rates,'' said Rep. Jim Davis, D-Fla., who sponsored the 
bill with Rep. Mike Bilirakis, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would prohibit nursing homes from expelling or  
transferring residents because of their payment status or the 
home's decision to withdraw from the Medicaid program. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and major senior citizen groups support the  
legislation, which has been approved by the Senate Finance 
Committee and is awaiting Senate floor action. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the measure, nursing homes could still choose to leave the  
Medicaid program. However, they would be required to make clear to 
incoming residents that Medicaid payments were no longer acceptable 
and the facility could transfer new residents who initially pay 
with private funds but later become dependent on Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of elderly nursing home patients rely on Medicaid to  
help pay for their care, and with nursing home costs averaging 
$40,000 a year, about half of residents who begin by paying with 
their own money and health insurance must turn to Medicaid within 
three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees  
Medicaid, estimates that 58 nursing homes a year are withdrawing 
from the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem came to public attention when a nursing home in  
Davis' hometown of Tampa tried to evict 54 residents last year. A 
judge halted the evictions and the home subsequently told the 
residents they could stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers expressed concern that unless additional steps are  
taken to increase Medicaid payments, more homes in the future will 
reserve space only for wealthier private payers, sending the poor 
to more cheaply run homes. ``State payments might be inadequate for 
what we are requiring in this law,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, 
D-Calif.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Eyes Racial Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's No. 2 official  
assured black and Hispanic leaders from New Jersey on Tuesday that 
his agency is serious about investigating whether state troopers 
stop motorists on the basis of skin color. 
</P>
<P>
	Emphasizing the importance he gives the issue, Deputy Attorney  
General Eric Holder told the group he believes New Jersey troopers 
stopped him two decades ago because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey is one of several states where police have been  
accused of using ``racial profiling'' to determine which cars to 
stop. Similar accusations have popped up in Florida, Maryland, 
Connecticut and elsewhere along the Interstate 95 corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder spent more than an hour behind closed doors with members  
of the New Jersey congressional delegation, the Black Ministers 
Council of New Jersey and the state Legislature's Black and Latino 
Legislative Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey officials praised Holder but said they believe  
the Justice Department is taking too long with its inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The answers that we wanted are still somewhat begging, because  
too much time has elapsed,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. 
``The first time that the Department of Justice was aware of this, 
definitely aware, was way back in 1996. We are now in 1999 and we 
are still waiting for some action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Reginald Jackson, director of the Black Ministers  
Council, said Holder promised at least a preliminary response ``in 
a matter of months, which is encouraging to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These things take time, and we want to make sure that we're  
being fair to both sides,'' Holder told reporters as he left the 
meeting. ``We go into this with an open mind. We don't presume 
there is in fact a problem. We're going to look at the data we 
have, talk to people who are involved in this, and then try to come 
up with an appropriate course of action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the private meeting, Holder told of being pulled over by  
State Police in New Jersey when he was a Columbia University 
student in the 1970s, traveling between New York and Atlantic City 
and sporting an Afro hair style. 
</P>
<P>
	Police stopped him, he told reporters, even though ``I didn't  
think I was doing anything wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Democratic Rep. Donald Payne, New Jersey's only black  
congressman, said he too has encountered racial profiling by his 
state's troopers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fit the profile -- driving a new car, coming up from the  
South. I was stopped,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Racial profiling is part of a larger question of how police  
treat minorities, Payne said, adding that it has become ``the 
number one topic of discussion'' among Congressional Black Caucus 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police officials and Gov. Christie Whitman insist racial  
profiling is not an accepted practice among New Jersey troopers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Whitman fired State Police Superintendent Carl Williams  
on March 1 following published remarks in which he said minorities 
were responsible for most of the cocaine and marijuana traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	At a subcommittee hearing earlier Tuesday, Lautenberg urged  
Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint a task force on racial 
profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said her department ``is actively pursuing a review of the  
New Jersey State Police and this issue. ... We want to do a 
thorough review and complete it as soon as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Saddam Still Strong After Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost daily Western attacks on Iraqi military  
targets haven't hurt President Saddam Hussein, critics of the 
Clinton administration contended at a congressional hearing 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British warplane strikes that began hitting Iraq's air  
defense system in December offer only temporary military victories 
and are doing nothing to weaken Saddam's dictatorial regime, said 
the critics, including former CIA Director James Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps the administration, in order to stay focused, needs to  
post a sign on the wall of the White House Situation Room that 
says, `It's the regime, stupid,''' Woolsey told the House Armed 
Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hillen, a political-military expert with the Center for  
Strategic and International Studies who served in the 1991 Gulf 
War, said the ``low-grade war against Iraq'' adds up to only 
short-term success. 
</P>
<P>
	``The daily military actions, in and of themselves, are  
important tactical victories, but do they add up to a comprehensive 
policy?'' he asked. ``American and British pilots are busy in the 
skies over Iraq, but little work has been done in the White 
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For his part, Saddam appears to be counting on the fact that  
an administration with only 22 months left in office will be mostly 
interested in running out the clock,'' Hillen added. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, who on Wednesday ended a tour  
of the Gulf region, has defended President Clinton's containment 
policy, a continuation of President Bush's strategy at the end of 
the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saddam has been contained since the end of the Gulf War,''  
Cohen said during a visit to Qatar on Tuesday. He also pledged to 
keep striking Iraqi military targets if Saddam's forces keep 
violating no-fly zones over southern and northern parts of Iraq and 
keep trying to shoot down Western patrol planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to target Iraq's air-attack network as long  
as it continues to threaten our planes,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, of the more than one dozen senior officials Cohen visited  
over five days in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab 
Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait, none publicly expressed support for 
U.S. strikes on Iraq. And Qatar Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin 
Jassim Al-Thani criticized the attacks, saying, ``We do not wish to 
see Iraq being bombed daily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The no-fly zones, where Iraqi planes are prohibited, were set up  
primarily by the United States and Britain in 1991 and 1992 
following the Gulf War to protect Kurdish and Shiite rebels from 
Iraqi attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi planes have violated the no-fly zones more than 100 times  
since the four-day, mid-December U.S. and British attack against 
Iraq to punish Saddam for not cooperating with U.N. weapons 
inspections. In response, U.S. and British forces have hit some 200 
Iraqi targets with precision-guided bombs and missiles, mostly 
anti-aircraft and radar sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services  
Committee, said he called two days of hearings on Iraq because of 
what he sees as ``the lack of a clear and consistent Iraq policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of us are deeply troubled by the course of U.S. policy  
and the pattern of U.S. military operations in the Persian Gulf,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey, CIA director from 1993 to 1995 at the start of the  
Clinton administration, suggested the president needs to be more 
aggressive in carrying out his stated policy of working to see a 
new Iraqi regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey suggested that no-fly zones be extended across Iraq,  
that the United States recognize an Iraqi government in exile to 
oppose Saddam and that U.S. airstrikes be used to hit not just air 
defense sites but also Saddam's power sources such as his 
Republican Guard and security and intelligence facilities.

<HEADLINE> Lamar Alexander Jumps In GOP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- He's left the plaid shirt in the closet  
this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander launched his second bid  
for the Republican presidential nomination with a speech Tuesday 
before a few hundred supporters at the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``I invite you to join me in a campaign to expand American  
freedom, renew its pioneer spirit and bring out the best in 
America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander was to visit Washington today to pick up endorsements  
from Tennessee's two senators, Bill Frist and Fred Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it's on to New Hampshire and Iowa, the states most crucial  
to his candidacy because of their early primary and caucus. He'll 
also visit New York and Los Angeles before returning to his 
hometown of Maryville on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander sought the GOP nomination in 1996, but dropped out  
after the early primaries. He's been gunning for the 2000 election 
ever since, maintaining his campaign organization and fund-raising 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he hasn't done well in public opinion polls and is likely  
to have plenty of competition, including Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
son of former President Bush. Elizabeth Dole, former American Red 
Cross president and Bob Dole's wife, planned to form an exploratory 
committee today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan and New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith have already  
announced their candidacies. The 58-year-old Alexander said he's 
the most qualified, experienced candidate and has the best-defined 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who announced his candidacy last time wearing a  
bright plaid shirt, wore a business suit this year. He has said 
that talk about his shirt interfered with his message in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The former U.S. education secretary and University of Tennessee  
president said he wants to let states decide how to spend federal 
education money, give more autonomy to teachers and principals and 
let parents decide where their children should attend classes. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd like to create a $1,500 scholarship for kindergarten  
through high school students similar to the HOPE program in 
Georgia, which provides poor and middle-class college students with 
financial help. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also said he wants a missile defense system to target  
terrorists and a new branch of the armed services to stem the flow 
of drugs from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	He said inheritance and capital gains taxes should be cut,  
married couples should get more of a tax break, the deduction for a 
child should be tripled and the tax code shouldn't discriminate 
against parents who stay home with their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also took several digs at President Clinton, whom he  
called ``the Wizard'' and Vice President Al Gore, a fellow 
Tennessean likely to be the Democratic presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look behind the screen of their magic show and see what has  
really happened in the last six years,'' Alexander said. ``Twelve 
more countries have jumped over us in high school graduation rates, 
our taxes are higher, our military defense is weaker, it is harder 
than ever for parents to raise children, ... and our standards of 
right and wrong have sunk to a new low.''

<TEXT>
<P>
 *That Was the Week That Was    	
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment highlights during the week of March 14-20:  
</P>
<P>
	65 years ago: Walt Disney accepted an Oscar for ``The Three  
Little Pigs.'' The film won for best cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
	60 years ago: Principal filming was finished on the film, ``The  
Wizard of Oz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	40 years ago: With six years left on her contract, Diane Varsi  
told 20th Century Fox that she was quitting the movie business. She 
described acting as ``destructive'' and said it was making her 
miserable. 
</P>
<P>
	25 years ago: Jefferson Airplane officially became Jefferson  
Starship. 
</P>
<P>
	10 years ago: Comic Relief III, which featured the talents of  
Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams, collected $3.6 
million in pledges to help the homeless. The amount was nearly $1 
million more than the previous year's donations. 
</P>
<P>
	And the songwriting-production team of Stock, Aitken and  
Waterman had three singles in the top four places on the British 
chart: Jason Donovan's ``Too Many Broken Hearts,'' Bananarama's 
``Help'' and Donna Summer's ``This Time I Know It's for Real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Whitney Houston was celebrated as entertainer of  
the year at the eighth annual Soul Train Music Awards. Toni Braxton 
took top honors for best single and best album. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: More than 20 years after hanging up his guitar,  
the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens surfaced to promote an 
album he helped record for victims of the conflict in Bosnia. 
Stevens, also known as Yusuf Islam, wrote two songs on the charity 
album but sang only one -- ``The Little Ones.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Spoken 10 years ago:  
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a sense of perspective at all, which is a sense of  
humor, you've got to have a dark side. You can't be all light or 
you would have no balance. ... You gotta have a little hate in 
you.'' -- Comedian Chevy Chase. 

</P>
<P>
	Spoken one year ago:  
</P>
<P>
	``I personally don't want to pick up a guitar again. I don't  
feel like it. I'm much more of a poet.'' -- Yusuf Islam, the 
singer-musician formerly known as Cat Stevens.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces New Medicine Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No more squinting in despair at drugstore  
remedies, wondering which cough syrup will stop your hacking, or 
where in all the fine print it says to take one allergy tablet or 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore planned to announce new regulations  
Thursday requiring that all over-the-counter medicines have 
easier-to-read labels so consumers can tell at a glance how to use 
the drug safely. 
</P>
<P>
	``For parents, the elderly and for all Americans, being able to  
read and understand over-the-counter drug labels is essential to 
their health,'' Gore said. More consumer-friendly labels ``will 
give Americans the information they need to prevent tens of 
thousands of unnecessary hospitalizations that occur each year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration rule replaces today's labels --  
which often bury crucial information in tiny type and baffling 
medical jargon -- with instructions in larger print and in a special 
format highlighting proper dosages and safety warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	It is similar to the simplified nutrition label the FDA put on  
foods in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency proposed the new labels in 1997, but the regulation  
did not become final until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials expect most drugs to carry the  
new label within another two years; a few manufacturers have until 
2004 to phase in the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The change comes as Americans are turning to over-the-counter  
remedies four times as often as they consult a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100,000 drugs, from cough medicines and itch creams to  
highly potent pain relievers and heartburn medicines, are sold 
without a prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	Although over-the-counter drugs largely are safe, studies  
suggest their misuse causes over 170,000 hospitalizations a year, 
half of which could be prevented by better consumer education. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many over-the-counter drugs bear hard-to-read instructions.  
The print is tiny, particularly difficult for the elderly to read. 
Safety information can be buried in lines of fine print. 
</P>
<P>
	How many patients know, for example, that aspirin and ibuprofen  
sometimes cause stomach bleeding -- a risk exacerbated if you drink 
alcohol while taking them? Or that if you have hypertension, you 
should ask your doctor before taking a decongestant containing 
pseudoephedrine, because that medicine can raise blood pressure? 
</P>
<P>
	Or that if you are going to buy Tagamet or Zantac for heartburn,  
you must cut out caffeine, alcohol and other stomach-irritating 
foods for a while so the medicine can help your stomach heal? 
</P>
<P>
	Even reading and measuring out the right dosage can be a  
challenge. Studies show parents have a hard time dosing small 
children; some drugs even require cutting tablets in half for kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The new labels aim to ease confusion.  
</P>
<P>
	In larger print, the standardized labels have sections marked  
``Warnings'' and ``Directions,'' so consumers can quickly find the 
precise instructions they need. A ``Do Not Use'' section will 
highlight other medicines that interact dangerously with the 
over-the-counter remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a White House ceremony Thursday, Gore planned to use as an  
example allergy pills containing the antihistamine 
chlorpheniramine. The new label instructs anyone with glaucoma, 
breathing problems like emphysema or an enlarged prostate to ``Ask 
a doctor before using,'' because chlorpheniramine sometimes causes 
problems such patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Warnings'' section says this antihistamine causes  
drowsiness, so be careful if you drive after taking the pills. 
</P>
<P>
	You would have to read through 10 lines of fine print on the old  
label to learn that. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the $29 billion nonprescription drugs industry worked  
closely with FDA to develop the new labels; some medicines already 
have them.

<HEADLINE> Czech Leader's Future in Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- When the Czech Republic joins NATO  
on Friday, a dream will come true for President Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
	The longtime advocate of NATO's eastward expansion says he  
considers the alliance's embrace of the Czech Republic, which 
enters along with Hungary and Poland, his main achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	But with that quest now behind him, the once-beloved Havel may  
be in danger of becoming an icon time left behind -- his popularity 
sinking, his health in question, his wife a target of criticism and 
his ideas increasingly out of touch with those of ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes when I hear him talking about the new global  
responsibility or about the political climate here in our country, 
I have the feeling he lives on a different planet,'' says Jarmila 
Hlavata, 67, a retired teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts suggest the ``historic mission'' of the dissident  
playwright-turned-president, long a symbol of the fight against 
communism, may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been nearly a decade since Havel was swept into office on a  
wave of adulation during the Velvet Revolution. After more than 
four decades of communism, Czechs united behind their first 
democratically elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	They adored Havel for his moral authority and rejoiced that his  
fame abroad boosted their country's image. 
</P>
<P>
	Today he remains highly respected abroad. But at home, where the  
people's revolutionary enthusiasm is long gone, his role is 
diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's popularity among Czechs, once at 82 percent,  
dropped below 50 percent for the first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting his nation into the alliance hasn't done a thing to help  
his standing -- only half of Czechs support NATO membership. 
Opponents include diehard communists as well as people who question 
the need to join another military alliance after the collapse of 
the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say NATO isn't the reason for Havel's drop in  
support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Times have changed,'' Ivan Jemelka wrote in Lidove Noviny, the  
country's prominent daily. ``Citizens have started to rely more on 
themselves and they have less need for a leader, even in the good 
sense of the word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Havel's special historical mission is probably over,'' he  
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Havel acknowledges the change.  
</P>
<P>
	``I headed the country so long, and I was revered for such a  
long time, that it had to end one day,'' he told the French daily 
Le Figaro last month. 
</P>
<P>
	But the challenge of what to do for the rest of his term, which  
ends in January 2003, may be difficult. Havel has repeatedly said 
he has no intention of becoming a ``mere wreath-layer.'' Attaining 
Czech membership in the European Union may be his next goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The constitution gives him only very limited powers, but Havel  
still is trying to implement his visions in Czech policy. Results 
are debatable. 
</P>
<P>
	His recent attempt at organizing a roundtable of parliamentary  
parties to settle political squabbles has met only partial success: 
The country's second-strongest party, the Civic Democratic Party of 
former Premier Vaclav Klaus, has not signed on. 
</P>
<P>
	Media criticism, once unthinkable, is now steady. Serious  
newspapers question his political visions; tabloids and television 
focus mainly on his private life and his wife of two years, Dagmar. 
</P>
<P>
	Havel accuses sensationalist journalists of unfair attacks on  
him and his family. But it seems the whole nation has an aversion 
to Dagmar, who he married in January 1997 -- less than a year after 
his first wife Olga died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	While Olga kept a low profile and didn't even talk about her  
charity work, outspoken Dagmar is always visible -- and audible. She 
has even tried, unsuccessfully, to have first lady made an official 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, she shocked Czechs by whistling with her fingers -- a  
particularly rude action here -- in response to an ultranationalist 
lawmaker's remarks during a nationally televised program. Her 
husband defended her, but many complained that Dagmar was no lady. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's mainly Havel's own ideas that make Czechs wonder what  
he can offer them. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledges his failure to improve the nation's political  
and moral climate -- his main goal after winning reelection a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this sphere, the situation did not improve, it's rather  
worse,'' Havel conceded last month.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Postpone Kosovo Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged  
Congress today to put off votes on Kosovo policy during this time 
of ultra-delicate negotiations, saying it would ``complicate our 
efforts'' to broker a peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``A vote at any time to oppose an authorization would be taken  
by both sides as a green light to resume fighting,'' Albright told 
a House Appropriations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has scheduled a full floor debate for Thursday on  
whether U.S. troops should be sent to Kosovo. A Senate vote on the 
same issue could come as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said there couldn't be a worse time for Congress to  
begin debating the issue of U.S. troops -- with U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke in Belgrade meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic and President Clinton and most of his national security 
team out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger were in  
Central America, with Albright scheduled to join them later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen was traveling in the Middle  
East. 
</P>
<P>
	A House Republican official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said that Albright's request for a postponement was being weighed 
but that no decisions had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am aware that the House is considering a vote on whether to  
authorize such a mission. My request this morning is that such a 
vote not be taken while we are at this critical time in our 
negotiations and in our attempts to secure a settlement,'' Albright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said that he is ready to commit 4,000 U.S.  
troops to be part of a 28,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force in the 
Serbian province of Kosovo if a peace accord can be reached between 
Kosovo's ethnic Serbs and ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	There is considerable skepticism in Congress about committing  
U.S. troops, with many members concerned that it would lead to 
another open-ended commitment like that in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Albright said, ``a congressional debate now, I can  
assure you, will complicate our efforts to get the Serbs and the 
Kosovar Albanians on board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And the idea that this debate goes on while the president and  
I and Secretary Cohen are out of the country...and I might add that 
a vote at this time sends a totally wrong signal to Milosevic and 
to our NATO allies,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified before the subcommittee which oversees the State  
Department budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., voiced  
skepticism toward any U.S. mission in Kosovo, asking her what was 
the U.S. interest in being there -- and whether the administration 
would set an exit deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know instability in the Balkans harms U.S. interests,'' she  
said, suggesting the conflict could easily spread to other parts of 
the region. ``It's easier to put out a campfire rather than a 
forest fire,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also cited ``a compelling humanitarian reason'' to end the  
bloodshed. As to exit strategy, Albright said that one of the 
lessons of Bosnia was ``not to set an artificial deadline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the House prepared to debate the Kosovo matter, Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., indicated the Senate will vote 
soon, too, on whether to set conditions on any deployment of U.S. 
troops to Kosovo, including how many would go, for how long and how 
much it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's legitimate that we have this debate now,'' Lott  
told reporters on Tuesday. ``I don't think we should wait until the 
president presumes without congressional approval to put troops on 
the ground again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott signaled that the Senate would vote on a series of  
amendments proposed by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, that 
would block funds for such an operation unless the administration 
met certain conditions, including providing ``the expected schedule 
for accomplishing the mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amendments will be debated when the Senate takes up an  
emergency $1.9 billion spending bill, perhaps as early as next 
week. The bill would provide aid for struggling U.S. farmers, the 
American steel industry, Jordan and the Central Americans 
struggling to recover from Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is important that Congress weighs in when we are  
talking about going into a sovereign nation. That is a very 
different situation from any we have dealt with in the recent 
past,'' Hutchison said.

<HEADLINE> MacLeod Resigns As Notre Dame Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- The question dogged John MacLeod for  
several years: When's your time going to be up? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer came Tuesday when the Notre Dame basketball coach  
resigned after just three winning seasons during his eight years at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everything is in place for Notre Dame to make a  
positive move,'' MacLeod said. ``I appreciated the opportunity to 
work here at Notre Dame, and I wish the best for the young men who 
are part of the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement wasn't entirely unexpected after the Irish  
dropped five of their last seven to finish 14-16 overall and eighth 
in the Big East with an 8-10 record. They were picked by conference 
coaches to finish 12th in the 13-team league. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman David Graves, at home in Lexington, Ky., on spring  
break, said he hadn't expected the announcement and wasn't sure 
whether MacLeod was forced out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know, because the last couple years it's always  
been, `Is he going to leave? Is he going to stay?''' he said. 
``You're not surprised, but it's kind of a shock when you finally 
hear it. You feel bad for him and his family, but we've still got 
business to take care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Mike Wadsworth made the announcement Tuesday  
night after returning from a trip to Florida to meet with MacLeod. 
He refused to discuss the circumstances surrounding MacLeod's 
departure, insisting the coach requested that Wadsworth limit what 
he said to what was in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But MacLeod, 61, told The Associated Press in an interview  
Friday that he expected to be back as coach despite the team's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes I do. I really do,'' MacLeod said Friday. ``There's  
nothing written in stone. I'm not sitting here thinking I'm not 
going to be here. I'm going on a recruiting trip tomorrow. We've 
been working our tails off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth said he hoped to have a new coach in place by the  
April 7 signing date for basketball recruits and was already 
compiling a list of potential candidates with his staff, but he 
revealed no names. 
</P>
<P>
	He said only that he wanted to find someone who was a good fit  
for Notre Dame's basketball program as well as the university's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notre Dame is a university with a particular culture that  
doesn't suit all people,'' Wadsworth said. ``As a result, we'll be 
looking for a head coach that would be someone that has the 
potential to bring us to the top level nationally, but most 
particularly would be a very good fit for Notre Dame, will come to 
Notre Dame embracing what Notre Dame stands for, and if we can find 
that kind of matchup I think we'll have a good selection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod has often been criticized for poor recruiting, but his  
last class pulled in Big East rookie of the year Troy Murphy and 
Graves, both of whom started most of the season. A third freshmen, 
Harold Swanagan, saw plenty of playing time, and the three are 
expected to be a strong nucleus for next year's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, six players have left the Notre Dame program the last  
three seasons for a variety of reasons, and a seventh missed most 
of the year because of academic problems. That left only one 
scholarship player on the roster from the class of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth said the university hasn't contacted most of the  
players, who are on spring break this week, but the staff would 
complete that this week, as well as calling recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	Graves said it wasn't likely that he would transfer, but he will  
wait for Notre Dame to name a successor before making a final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a commitment, and I'm going to stick to that  
commitment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod's Notre Dame teams had a 106-124 mark, and his only  
winning years were 18-15 in 1991-92, his first at the school, 15-12 
in 1994-95 and 16-14 in 1996-97. MacLeod had the Fighting Irish in 
the NIT in 1992 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only coach in school history to lead the team at least  
five seasons and still register an overall losing record. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod arrived at Notre Dame in 1991 after 18 seasons in the  
NBA with Phoenix, Dallas and the New York Knicks. His combined 
record in the NBA was 707-657 and his teams went to the playoffs 11 
times, four reaching the conference finals. He was coach at 
Oklahoma before moving to the NBA, finishing with a 90-69 mark in 
six seasons there. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame moved into the Big East for the 1995-96 season, and  
the Fighting Irish have never had a winning season in the league, 
with an overall conference mark of 27-45 and an 0-4 record in the 
Big East tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod was selected as Big East coach of the year in 1997 and  
had players honored by the league the last two seasons, Pat Garrity 
as player of the year in 1998 and Murphy as newcomer of the year 
this season.

<HEADLINE> Reno Chided Over Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With crime down significantly nationwide,  
Attorney General Janet Reno says state and local law enforcement 
agencies do not need as much help from the federal government to 
fight lawlessness. 
</P>
<P>
	But key members of Congress think otherwise and accused the  
Clinton administration Tuesday of trying to pressure them with 
proposals to cut more than $1.4 billion from community law 
enforcement programs next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., chairman of the Senate Appropriations  
subcommittee that funds the Justice Department, contended the cuts 
were made to put the panel in the ``untenable position'' of having 
to find money elsewhere to pay for the programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's $21 billion budget request for fiscal 2000  
would eliminate a $250 million juvenile accountability block grant 
and a $523 million local law enforcement block grant, and reduce 
grants for state prisons by nearly $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the department is seeking $600 million to  
expand an existing community policing program to help states hire 
up to 50,000 additional police officers over five years. The 
program, known as COPS, is nearing its original goal of putting 
100,000 police officers on the nation's streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg criticized the proposed cuts in programs that he says  
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to me it was done in order to put us ... in the  
untenable position of having to go out and find the money to put 
back in those programs, because you know we supported those 
programs,'' he said. ``And you've made politically attractive 
choices at the expense of this committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno noted that crime was down significantly nationwide. The  
violent crime rate has declined by more than 20 percent over the 
past six years and the murder rate has reached its lowest level in 
three decades, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the proposed budget still includes funds for community  
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think state and local law enforcement should become  
too dependent on federal law enforcement, and there is a point 
where we draw the line,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the administration would accept a budget passed by  
Congress that included the proposed reductions, Reno signaled that 
it would. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to make a judgment as to how we use precious  
federal resources. And if you approve the president's budget, he'll 
sign it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg said the subcommittee may go along with the administration  
on cutting the programs, but he said it would not recommend 
expanding COPS. Funds intended for new officers would be spent 
elsewhere, such as on border patrols, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, criticized the  
lack of money in the budget for hiring 1,000 Border Patrol agents. 
A 1996 immigration law authorized the hiring of 5,000 border agents 
through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still woefully short of the number of Border Patrol  
agents,'' Hutchison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said recruiting was becoming a problem. A decision also was  
made to delay new hiring because the nearly 9,000-person force is 
largely inexperienced and needs time to develop the necessary 
expertise, she said. As of last month, nearly half of all agents 
will have been on the job for no more than three years, Reno said.

<HEADLINE> GM Eyes Saab Buy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The head of General Motors Corp.'s European  
operations believes the No. 1 automaker's new model offensive will 
result in an increased share of the European market and higher 
profits this year even as overall sales are expected to decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Burns, president of GM-Europe, said in an interview  
with The Associated Press that new Opel models, increased 
availability of diesel engines and an expanded product line of 
U.S.-built vehicles should help GM exceed last year's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the chief executive of Saab Automobile AB said  
Tuesday at the Geneva International Motor Show that GM will begin 
talks on buying the 50 percent of Saab it doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit-based GM acquired half of Saab from the Swedish holding  
company Investor AB for $600 million in 1989 and has an option to 
buy the remaining half during the six months beginning July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires and financial cable  
network CNBC, Saab CEO Robert Hendry said talks would begin in July 
and suggested that Saab may not come cheap, given the automaker's 
recent sales gains and improving balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saab's good performance makes both parties want to keep their  
shares,'' Hendry said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM operates in Europe under the Opel, Vauxhall and Saab brands.  
It had 11.5 percent of the market in Western Europe last year, with 
sales up slightly over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, GM's European operations earned $419 million on sales  
of $25 billion. Burns said he hopes to double earnings this year 
with increased availability of its bestseller, the redesigned Opel 
Astra subcompact, the redesigned Vectra sedan and the spring 
introduction of the new Zafira, a small minivan. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and other automakers have high hopes for the compact minivan  
market, which is about to be flooded with new entries from Asian 
automakers. GM estimates the segment will increase from 2 percent 
of the total European car market to more than 10 percent by the 
middle of the next decade. GM plans to build 200,000 Zafiras in 
2000, its first full year of production. 
</P>
<P>
	Opel also unveiled the Opel Speedster, a concept version of a  
roadster that's expected to go into production within two years. 
Hendry, who is chairman of Adam Opel AG as well as CEO of Saab, 
left open the possibility that the Speedster eventually could be 
exported to North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendry also said Opel was considering adding a flagship luxury  
sedan to its lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	GM, which has had little success with North American exports to  
Europe, keeps trying. In the last few weeks it began rolling out 
the Oldsmobile Alero compact, which is rebranded for the European 
market as the Chevrolet Alero. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker sold only about 13,500 Chevys and Cadillacs in  
Europe last year. While that was up sharply, it still represents a 
fraction of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we've not done as good a job with,'' Burns  
said. ``We're making good progress, but the numbers are fairly 
small. That clearly has a lot of potential if we get the right 
product. It's all about the product.''

<HEADLINE> US Improves Combat Ability in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUWAIT (AP) -- The U.S. military is taking a series of  
low-profile steps to improve its capability for ground combat in 
the Persian Gulf region -- even as the high-profile air battle over 
northern and southern Iraq thunders on. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort gained urgency when, after the U.S. airstrikes on  
Iraq in December, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said he no longer 
recognizes Kuwait's sovereignty. Defense Secretary William Cohen, 
who winds up a six-nation tour of Gulf states today, says America's 
commitment to the region is long term and goes beyond air cover. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing that you can be sure of is that we're going to  
defend Kuwait, and any attack upon Kuwait we're going to consider 
as an attack upon us,'' Cohen told U.S. air crews Tuesday at Al 
Jaber Air Base in the Kuwaiti desert. ``We're here to defend their 
interests and our interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Kuwait for Jordan, Cohen met with Defense  
Minister Sheik Salem al-Sabah and said the United States will 
provide Kuwait early warning of missile launches from Iraq or Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said his talks with the Kuwaiti leadership resulted in  
``several specific steps to make our strong cooperation even 
stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No formal agreements were signed and Cohen did not give details  
of the missile warning help. But he said Kuwait and Washington will 
cooperate on improving ``our abilities to detect and defend against 
chemical and biological weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he said a new telephone line will link his office with  
that of Kuwait's defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
	So far on his trip, Cohen has reached agreement with Saudi  
Arabia to conduct joint military exercises involving ground troops. 
In Qatar, the United States expects by next year to complete the 
pre-positioning of 200 tanks and other armored vehicles, and U.S. 
officials are discussing a proposal by Qatar to expand 
accommodations for U.S. ground troops. In Kuwait, regular field 
exercises involving Marines or Army troops continue with equipment 
from another huge armored vehicle storage center on the outskirts 
of Kuwait City. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials see no immediate sign that Saddam is preparing  
to turn his rhetoric about Kuwait into action. Thus Cohen portrays 
the massive U.S. force presence in the region in terms beyond any 
immediate crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``By being forward deployed, we help to stabilize regions,''  
Cohen said. ``When a region is stable, what happens? Investment 
starts to flow in. Any time you see any instability where there's 
real conflict and turbulence, the money comes out automatically. 
When the money comes out, economies collapse and states are in 
danger of collapsing and you've got chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also took steps to strengthen the militaries of friendly  
Gulf states, another hedge against a worsening of tension in the 
region. He agreed to sell air-to-air missiles to Bahrain and Saudi 
Arabia, proposed an intelligence-sharing system that would warn 
allies of hostile missile launches, and discussed a major sale of 
fighter aircraft to the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the trip, Cohen has been dealing with the political  
sensitivities of the Persian Gulf where even nations that have 
worked with the U.S. military for decades are anxious not to appear 
too closely tied to Washington, lest they anger fundamentalist 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely because of this concern, the United States has no plans  
to reach agreements that would allow for permanent bases. 
Servicemen who met with Cohen on Tuesday asked about this; bases 
would mean whole families could move to the region. As it is, a 
soldier or airman who deploys to the Gulf stays for a few months 
away from family and then cycles back home. It is considered 
hardship duty. 
</P>

	``I think much depends upon what the Kuwaiti people want, what  
the other Gulf states would like to have,'' Cohen said. But whether 
the bases themselves are permanent or temporary, the U.S. military 
has no plans of packing for home soon. Even if tensions with Iraq 
ease, ``we will still want a presence in the region to the extent 
that the host countries want us here. That has always been part of 
our policy. We don't go where we're not wanted.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules on Alabama Senate Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The partisan dispute that has paralyzed  
the Alabama Senate is still stuck in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic judge ruled the Republican lieutenant governor  
broke the law by pushing through new Senate rules to increase his 
power. The issue now goes to the state Supreme Court -- where 
Republicans hold a 5-4 majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Charles Price said Tuesday that Lt. Gov. Steve  
Windom had no right to pass the new Senate rules on a voice vote, 
over the loud objections of 18 Democratic senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom immediately appealed Price's ruling, saying the judge  
violated the separation of powers by weighing in on a legislative 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court agreed to hear arguments on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	That means the Senate standoff could continue at least three  
more days, eating up more than one-third of the 30 meeting days the 
Legislature is allotted each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle began in November, when Windom became the first  
Republican elected lieutenant governor in Alabama this century. 
That also set him up to be presiding officer of the Senate, which 
had been controlled by the Democrats for more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alabama Constitution gives the lieutenant governor only two  
duties: presiding over the Senate and voting in case of a tie. But 
the Senate has traditionally let the lieutenant governor appoint 
Senate committees and decide which committee considers each bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Democrats stripped the incoming Windom of most  
of his power in a session presided over by Gov.-elect Don 
Siegelman, a Democrat who was still lieutenant governor at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom snatched the power back on the Legislature's opening day  
by gaveling through new rules on an unrecorded voice vote while 
ignoring the shouts and shaking fists of Democrats demanding a roll 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Democrats have sued Windom and boycotted the Senate.  
The standoff has prevented the Senate from considering any 
legislation, including the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're reaching the point of no return,'' said Siegelman's  
chief of staff, Paul Hamrick.

of Fahd's sons, she was the youngest sister of the wife of Saudi 
Defense Minister Prince Sultan, a brother of King Fahd. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Anoud's father was from the al-Jelawi tribe, which supported

finest work and was translated into 19 languages. Other works also 
included ``The Dream of Heroes'' in 1954 and ``Diary of the War of 
the Pig,'' a 1969 political satire. 
</P>
<P>

                             *Eric Wolf    	
</P>
<P>
	Irvington, N.Y. (AP) -- Eric Wolf, known as an innovative  
anthropologist who challenged established cultural assumptions, 
died of liver cancer Sunday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf helped set trends for future anthropological work by  
drawing on archaeology, history and other fields to trace diverse 
cultural development, as in his 1959 book on Mexico, ``Sons of the 
Shaking Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through books like his 1964 ``Anthropology'' and  
``Peasants''(1966) Wolf issued challenges to the established 
methods of his field. He explored cultures as they split and 
changed in order to dispel ethnic stereotypes, and studied 
nonconforming elements of given societies. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last book, ``Envisioning Power: Ideologies of Dominance  
and Crisis,'' (1999) Wolf drew parallels between the Nazi and Aztec 
rises to power. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf taught briefly at several universities including Illinois,  
Yale and Virginia, and spent nine years at the University of 
Michigan before joining City University of New York in 1971.

<HEADLINE> Bush Abortion Stance Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans lined up against the potential  
presidential candidacy of George W. Bush are challenging the Texas 
governor's stance on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, who is among those seeking the GOP nomination, said  
Tuesday that Bush is being far too vague. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how a 'compassionate conservative' can be  
ambiguous about protecting unborn children,'' said Bauer. ``Clearly 
the governor hasn't thought this issue through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Monday he would back a constitutional amendment to  
outlaw most abortions if more voters supported it. But he said, 
``America is not ready to ban abortions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As leaders, our role must be to help shape public opinion, not  
simply react to it,'' responded Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., another presidential candidate, said the  
abortion issue will require concrete stances from candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is a moral issue and you can't tiptoe around  
moral issues,'' said smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Kennedy, national political director for Lamar Alexander's  
presidential bid, said Bush's comments illustrate his lack of 
political experience on the national level. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he fumbled this issue indicates why he may not be  
ready to play in the big leagues of national politics,'' Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Opinsky, spokesman for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said  
Bush's vague positions on key issues like abortion have helped keep 
him popular so far in the race.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Soar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures soared on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
Wednesday, a day before key oil producers planned to meet in 
Amsterdam to consider output cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline and heating oil also moved sharply higher. On  
other markets, wheat futures jumped, boosting corn and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third straight day of gains in the crude oil contract  
and the best showing since November. Traders are getting optimistic 
that world oil producers are becoming more serious about slashing 
supplies in an effort to lift prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer, and Iran are the  
catalysts for the latest rally. With prices continuing to hover at 
their lowest in a decade and their budgets tumbling into the red, 
countries that rely on crude exports for cash are trying to build 
momentum for greater output reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the past  
year has moved to cut 2.6 million barrels daily from output, while 
other producers have chipped in to bring that figure to slightly 
more than 3 million barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
	But those moves have had little effect on prices amid cheating  
and slack world demand. Further, analysts have said producers 
needed to cut at least 1 million barrels above the 3 million to 
boost prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said Wednesday that OPEC and  
independent producers will agree on cuts ahead of the cartel's 
meeting next Tuesday in Vienna. Futures market participants later 
went on a buying spree on word some of those involved would meet in 
Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for April delivery rose 84 cents, or 6 percent, to $14.69  
a barrel; April heating oil rose 2.65 cents to 39.66 cents a 
gallon; April unleaded gasoline rose 1.90 cents to 44.80 cents a 
gallon; April natural gas rose 1.3 cents to $1.941 for each 1,000 
cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade,  
boosting corn and soybeans, on talk the U.S. government is 
considering allowing the sale of agricultural commodities to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat rocketed higher amid unconfirmed market talk that U.S.  
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger favors the removal of trade 
barriers on farm products to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States in 1979 embargoed most trade with Iran and has  
repeatedly worked to tighten that noose amid allegations the Middle 
Eastern country sponsors terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department on Tuesday expressed hope Italian officials  
would raise U.S. concerns about terrorism during a visit this week 
of Iran's president. But there have been signs of a thaw during the 
tenure of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate Shiite 
Muslim cleric who is promoting greater social, political and 
cultural freedom among his people. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress and agricultural groups have pressured the  
Clinton administration to lift restrictions, but the government 
remains concerned about several key issues, Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright told a congressional panel on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also was supported after the U.S. Agriculture Department  
sought to buy 711,000 metric tons of wheat for donation to 
economically troubled countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans shrugged off early weakness tied to expectations the  
government would again lower its export estimates for the marketing 
year and raise projections for the size of crops in Brazil and 
Argentina. Corn also moved higher in step with wheat and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery, representing prices after harvesting is  
completed, rose 9 1/4 cents to $2.85 a bushel; May corn rose 2 1/4 cents 
to $2.23 1/2 a bushel; May soybeans rose 4 1/4 cents to $4.76 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Venator Earnings Disappoint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Almost a year ago, Woolworth set out on an  
ambitious mission to shed its name and five-and-dime image, and 
build itself into a giant sporting goods retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	But few are applauding what has happened since. Now known as  
Venator, its stock is down almost 83 percent in the past year, and 
its sales and profits continue to sink amid a slowdown in athletic 
footwear and clothing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts are even beginning to speculate about the  
company's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a hard ship to turn around,'' said Kurt Barnard, a  
retail consultant who runs Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper 
Montclair, N.J. ``Venator doesn't seem to have a clue what to do 
with itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough few years for Venator, which has attempted to  
boost profits by reducing costs and closing more than 4,000 stores 
-- including the entire chain of Woolworth five-and-dimes and all of 
its Kinney Shoe stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Its sporting goods chains now include Foot Locker, Lady Foot  
Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports and Colorado. It also 
operates Afterthoughts, an accessories stores, and San Francisco 
Music Box, which sells music boxes and giftware. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its efforts to revive the business, Venator continues to  
struggle. Last month, Standard &AMP; Poor's dropped the company's 
credit rating to ``junk'' status, and on Wednesday, Venator 
reported disappointing fourth-quarter and year-end earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter ended Jan. 30, Venator's net income fell 67  
percent to $37 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $115 
million, or 85 cents a share a year ago. Sales also fell, dropping 
6 percent to $1.33 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, it lost $113 million, or $1 a share, compared with  
a loss of $10 million, or 7 cents a share, the year before. Sales 
fell to $4.56 billion, from $4.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Venator's stock fell 18 3/4 cents to $4.68 3/4 in trading Wednesday on  
the New York Stock Exchange. It was as high as $27.25 last March. 
</P>
<P>
	Venator's tough times can be attributed to a number of factors --  
some of which are out of its control. 
</P>
<P>
	For one, the sneaker business remains under pressure, as  
consumers prefer ``brown'' hiking shoes to another pair of Nike's. 
Sales of athletic footwear dropped 6 percent in 1998, according to 
the Athletic Footwear Association, a North Palm Peach, Fla.-based 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, young people today opt to spend their money at  
stores like Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and Old Navy, buying up fleece 
sweatshirts rather than jerseys with Michael Jordan's number on the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Lastly, the National Basketball Association strike, which lasted  
through January, tempered sales of team-related merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of Venator's problems are a result of the problems  
around them,'' said Walter Loeb, who runs the retail consulting 
firm Loeb Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Venator also struggles to hold its share in the crowded  
sporting goods marketplace. Venator has been slow at remodeling its 
stores, which has given competitors such as Just for Feet and 
Finish Line an advantage with their trendier store formats. 
</P>
<P>
	As its sales sag, Venator has been forced to slash prices --  
sometimes by as much as 50 percent. While the markdowns help move 
out excess inventory, they also eat away at profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts question what is ahead for Venator. The company, which  
did not return calls for comment, has said that it is committed to 
getting itself back on track and said in its earnings report that 
it ``ended the year in sound financial condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based Venator plans to increase the amount of  
moderately priced goods that it sells at its stores and hopes to 
negotiate more exclusive agreements with manufacturers like Nike, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	There also have been rumors on Wall Street that Venator may be a  
takeover target, especially since its stock price is so affordable 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also speculation that unless its business is revived  
soon, Venator could be headed to Bankruptcy Court to seek 
protection from its creditors as it attempts a reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not about to file for bankruptcy now. I haven't heard  
that they aren't paying their bills,'' Barnard said. ``But if the 
situation continues to deteriorate, they may be at the point that 
they have no other option.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Salad Bar Spawned E. Coli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- An E. coli bacteria outbreak that sickened 10  
people has been traced to a restaurant salad bar, health officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight additional cases may be linked to the Golden  
Corral restaurant in Kearney, 185 miles west of Omaha. Five people, 
including a 79-year-old woman and a 6-year-old boy, were 
hospitalized, although none was critically ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The confirmed cases all involved E. coli O157:H7, state health  
department spokeswoman Marla Augustine said Tuesday. That 
particular strain attacks the digestive tract and, in severe cases, 
can cause kidney failure and death. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspected source was contaminated lettuce in the salad bar,  
said Mike Kutch, president of Tri-Golden Management of Evergreen, 
Colo., which owns the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once (the outbreak) was brought to our attention, we've been  
cooperating with the health department,'' said Kutch. ``It's a bad 
thing to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Epidemiologist Thomas Safranek said all those sickened  
were in the Kearney area during the weekend of Feb. 26-28.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stock Prices Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen on today as Japan's  
key stock index soared to a seven month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell to 120.54 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
1.22 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo, and less than its late New 
York level of 121.00 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 383.30  
points, or 2.54 percent, to 15,480.00, its highest close since 
15,626.42 on August 10. It was the second day of dramatic gains. On 
Tuesday, the index climbed 317.65 points, or 2.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally helped boost demand for the yen, traders said. After  
trading as high as 121.44 yen early today, the dollar sank to as 
low as 120.29 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market doesn't have much appetite for further (dollar)  
buying now,'' said Koichi Kubo, assistant general manager for the 
forex group at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in Tokyo. ``Market sentiment is 
that it is still top heavy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors had been betting recently that the yen could  
weaken if central bankers implemented policies designed to lower 
interest rates at a board meeting on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower Japanese interest rates would reduce the return to  
investors on everything from bank deposits to government bonds and 
could lead many of them to sell yen to move their money to 
countries where rates are higher. 
</P>
<P>
	But by today more investors doubted that the Bank of Japan would  
ease rates further, dealers said, leading the yen to rebound 
against the dollar.

	On the stock market, prices rose as investors welcomed Sony's  
announcement Tuesday that it would undertake aggressive 
restructuring, including cutting 17,000 jobs over four years and 
making three majority owned affiliates into fully owned

<HEADLINE> L.A. Clippers Keep On Losing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Even Billy Crystal, their most famous  
fan, is having a rough time with this. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been exceptionally hard the last couple of years,'' the  
actor said from his courtside seat at the Sports Arena. ``The guys 
are great guys, I know a few of them. After a while, how much of 
this can you take?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows? The Los Angeles Clippers just keep on losing, with no  
end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	They were 0-16 and on Wednesday night against the Los Angeles  
Lakers at the Forum were in position to match the worst start to a 
season in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	If they lose to the Lakers, they will have the futility record  
all to themselves on Thursday night by losing to the much-improved 
Sacramento Kings at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rooting for them, I want them to win at least one game,''  
said Eileen Foster, who works in one of the Sports Arena's souvenir 
shops. ``I feel sorry for them. I can't believe they're so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, the Clippers were at home and lost to the  
Lakers 103-99. And most of the announced crowd of 13,380 seemed to 
be pulling for the Lakers. No great surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have made the playoffs just three times since the  
1975-76 season, and have had just one winning season in the last 19 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering this season, they were 416-814 since moving to Los  
Angeles from San Diego in 1984. That's just a little more than one 
win in every three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dudas has been a season ticket-holder since 1989, and he's  
seen a lot of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans aren't rational,'' he said. ``There are a few of us,  
4,000 or 5,000 dedicated Clipper fans. They have to be dedicated to 
cheer for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-year Clippers coach Chris Ford has tried to stay upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's my job to stay positive,'' Ford said. ``It's not easy.  
Winning's easy, losing's tough at any level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Darrick Martin said that for the franchise to change, the  
change must start at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got guys who don't know what's going on, who don't feel  
appreciated here,'' Martin said. ``Everyone wants to feel 
appreciated. I've talked to different guys on other teams who say 
when things are going bad, the general manager, the owner, come and 
talk to you. It hasn't happened here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does get frustrating at times. I don't like to lose. I've  
lost a lot of sleep over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he thinks Ford has handled things admirably.  
</P>
<P>
	``Me, I'd probably be throwing chairs right now if I coached the  
team,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Taylor, a second-year forward who scored 24 points  
Tuesday night, recalled the Phoenix Suns of two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phoenix started 0-13 and made the playoffs,'' he said. ``I  
don't give up, not on anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Lawler, the Clippers' play-by-play radio announcer, thinks  
the team will be helped by the move next fall to the new Staples 
Center, where the Lakers and NHL's Los Angeles Kings will also 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be easier to attract free agents, and the team  
will be well under the salary cap after this season,'' Lawler said. 
``It's absolutely there for the team this summer. I think it's 
going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does 20-year-old Lakers star Kobe Bryant -- at least at some  
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my 20-year career here, I'm sure they're going to have some  
pretty good teams,'' Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why the Clippers have been down for so long, Bryant  
needed some time to come up with an answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad luck,'' he said. ``A lot of bad luck.''

<HEADLINE> Little Known About Fired Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- In Los Alamos, a town that was born in  
secrecy and is home to hundreds of people who still toil quietly on 
the nation's nuclear arsenal, many have little to say about the 
scientist suspected of sharing secrets with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents said they know Wen Ho Lee as an avid gardener who  
shares the fruits of his labors with neighbors in the middle-class 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't know much else about the Taiwan-born Lee, who was  
fired Monday from his job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee had been under FBI investigation since 1996. He has not been  
arrested or charged. 
</P>
<P>
	At Lee's home Tuesday, blankets were draped across windows and  
no one answered the door. His telephone was disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always come down and ask me if I want some apples or  
cherries,'' Mary Swickard, who didn't work at the lab but knew Lee 
and his wife, Sylvia, said Tuesday. Mrs. Lee often ``will ring the 
bell, tell me to help myself and then, whoosh, she's gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said it isn't unusual for others in the bedroom community of  
scientists and physicists to be tightlipped. They are ``afraid to 
say anything because if you work for the lab, you might be saying 
something you shouldn't,'' Ms. Swickard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not close, socializing with anybody in the  
neighborhood,'' said Bill Partain, a safety analyst who worked with 
Lee's wife at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos was built in the 1940s by the U.S. government under a  
veil of secrecy. It is here that scientists scrambled to design the 
atomic bombs that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, ending 
World War II. It still is a key installation for nuclear research. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence agents are investigating how China apparently  
obtained top-secret design information in the 1980s about warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, who had worked at the lab for more than a dozen years with  
top security clearance, was fired on the recommendation of Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson, who said Lee failed a lie-detector test 
in February and improperly failed to disclose foreign contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	At Los Alamos, Lee wrote and maintained supercomputer codes for  
hydrodynamics -- the mathematical science of predicting movement of 
fluids and gases, the Albuquerque Journal reported Tuesday. Friends 
and co-workers said Lee planned to retire in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think it's in his character that this happened,''  
said Pat Soran, who was Lee's supervisor for two years.

<HEADLINE>  Libyans Convicted in French Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- An anti-terrorism court today convicted Moammar  
Gadhafi's brother-in-law and five other Libyans in absentia and 
sentenced them to life in prison in the 1987 bombing of a French 
passenger jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya had refused to hand over the suspects in the attack that  
killed 170 people, making the French trial largely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
	UTA Flight 772, en route to Paris from Brazzaville, Republic of  
Congo, exploded over Niger, killing all the crew and passengers. 
The debris was scattered over 50 miles of the Tenere Desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The six convicted included Abdallah Senoussi, a brother-in-law  
of the Libyan leader. At the time of the crash, Senoussi was the 
No. 2 man in Libya's intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators who reconstructed the aircraft in Paris concluded  
that a suitcase loaded with explosives blew up in the baggage 
compartment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya to  
try to force the North African nation to surrender suspects in the 
UTA bombing as well as two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a 
Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions limit diplomatic contacts, prohibit arms sales and  
ban flights to and from Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	France's top anti-terrorism judge, Jean-Louis Bruguiere, spent  
about eight years investigating the bombing of the French jet. In 
1996, he traveled to Libya to question Libyan nationals whose names 
had been implicated in the probe, and was given a suitcase similar 
to the one thought to have been used in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The other defendants convicted in absentia were Abdessalam  
Hammouda, Senoussi's top aide, suspected of supervising the attack 
from Tripoli, the Libyan capital; Abdallah Elazragh, a Libyan 
diplomat in Brazzaville suspected of giving the suitcase to a 
passenger; Ibrahim Naeli and Musbah Arbas, two suspected members of 
the Libyan secret service; and Abdessalam Shibani, the alleged 
buyer of detonators in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	While refusing to hand over the suspects, Gadhafi said in 1996  
he had no objection to them being tried in absentia and would be 
willing to pay damages to the victims' families.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Unveils High-Speed Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amtrak's new high-speed Northeast Corridor  
service takes dead aim at airlines flying the lucrative 
Washington-New York-Boston shuttle route, but the two carriers that 
currently feast on that market don't appear concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are different kinds of travelers and they make their  
choices and we hope they choose us,'' Delta Air Lines spokeswoman 
Kay Horner said Tuesday. US Airways officials refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a cheering crowd of over 1,000 employees, Amtrak unveiled  
the name -- ``Acela''(uh-SELL-ah) and marketing components of its $2 
billion, 150-mph train system that will begin operation in November 
or December. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak says the new trains will travel between Boston and New  
York in three hours -- an improvement of 90 minutes over the current 
trip -- and from New York to Washington in as little as 2 1/2 hours, a 
savings of a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak officials hope the Acela service will be a model for  
similar trains in the Great Lakes, the Gulf Coast, California and 
the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have a product here that will absolutely knock the  
socks off the competition,'' Amtrak President George Warrington 
boasted to his workers. ``USAir, Delta, General Motors, Ford, you 
name it, only Amtrak's Acela will provide a very special journey 
for customers who will travel downtown to downtown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to pledging speed, Amtrak promised an unparalleled  
service. Acela's snub-nosed, silver-and-turquoise trains will have 
business-class seats with audio and power jacks, special check-in 
areas and concierge service, plus dining cars with meeting tables, 
upgraded food and beer on tap. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule has not been set, but Amtrak officials said it  
probably would maintain most current stops, including Baltimore, 
Philadelphia, New Haven, Conn., and Providence, R.I. The railroad 
will also retain its slower Northeast Direct service. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-way trip will cost about $130 to $140 each way between New  
York and Boston or Washington, an increase from the current 
Metroliner fare of $114 but still less than the $199 walkup fare 
charged by US Airways and Delta Air Lines. They are the two primary 
airlines offering shuttle service between Washington, New York and 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak projects that Acela will generate $180 million in new  
profits its first full year of service. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of the Amtrak board of  
directors, said he hopes the next stop for high-speed rail will be 
the Midwest. Amtrak has already announced it will spend $25 million 
to work on a high-speed network linking nine Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar projects are being considered between Charlotte, N.C.,  
and Washington, D.C.; Birmingham, Ala., and Houston; and up the 
Pacific coast. Thompson said Acela should generate the necessary 
congressional support. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we kick off the Northeast Corridor, Trent Lott is  
going to say, `Why can't I have it in Mississippi?' and Speaker 
Hastert is going to say, `You know, I think it's what's needed in 
Chicago and the Midwest,''' Thompson said, referring to Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plays Guatemala in Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It may feel like a road game when the United  
States plays Guatemala on Thursday night in the opening game of the 
U.S. Cup '99 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico, traditionally the strongest soccer draw for Southern  
California soccer fans, plays Bolivia in the second game of the 
doubleheader, so the Americans, 2-0-1 this year, may not have a 
majority of the crowd behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Guatemalans will support their team,'' U.S. coach Bruce  
Arena said. ``At times in the game we may feel a little like an 
underdog, but that's still good. We need to be able to play under 
all conditions. I think its a good challenge for our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, which finished last among 32 nations at the World  
Cup last summer, beat Germany 3-0 and Chile 2-1 in exhibition games 
last month following scoreless ties against Bolivia in January and 
Australia in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Defender David Regis, whose naturalization was rushed last year  
so he could play in the World Cup, will play for the national team 
for the first time since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament, which in sponsored by Nike and was downsized  
this year, concludes Saturday when the Americans play Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be interesting to see how we hold up playing two games  
in less than 48 hours,'' Arena said. ``That will be a heck of a 
challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Rules Against Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's bankers had a setback Wednesday  
as a federal judge denied their request to block a new government 
rule allowing more people to join credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington denied  
the American Bankers Association's request for an injunction 
barring the National Credit Union Administration from putting the 
rule into effect. She has yet to rule on the merits of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time the banking industry's largest trade  
group has gone to court over the issue. The first legal action led 
to a 1998 Supreme Court ruling favoring the banks over the credit 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCUA, an independent federal agency, ``continues to pose a  
threat to small financial institutions,'' said Beth Climo, an 
official of the bankers' group. Unless the agency is ``reined in, 
we will see a migration of customers and dollars'' to big credit 
unions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule, adopted by the agency in December, codifies a law  
enacted last summer in a stinging defeat for the banking industry. 
The legislation overrode the Supreme Court ruling by allowing 
federally chartered credit unions to continue to include more than 
one occupational group in their memberships -- as long as each group 
doesn't exceed 3,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	NCUA Chairman Norman D'Amours himself had voted against the  
rule, saying he feared it would hurt smaller credit unions although 
he did not believe it was illegal. The other two board members, 
Yolanda Wheat and Dennis Dollar, voted in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit union industry has said the new rule will allow  
millions of people -- including employees of small businesses -- to 
join lower-cost credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers' group maintained that the rule went beyond the  
bill's intent by promoting big, expansive credit unions with 
multiple membership groups at the expense of small, local ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit unions compete with banks -- especially small community  
banks -- by often providing lower-cost loans and other services at 
more favorable rates for their members. They contend they are the 
best source of help for people of modest means. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry has bitterly protested credit unions'  
exemption from federal taxes, which was retained by the bill.

<HEADLINE> Lab Security Lapse Reported in '96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Briefed in 1996 about possible espionage at  
the Los Alamos laboratory, top White House national security 
officials did not determine until almost a year later there were 
``serious problems'' requiring changes at the nuclear weapons labs, 
officials acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not until early 1998 that the concerns led to a  
presidential directive to raise security and hire more 
counterintelligence experts at the federal labs holding America's 
top nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, on  
Wednesday defended the administration's response to the security 
concerns, saying the actions ``were appropriate ... they were in 
the national interests and I believe we acted swiftly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger, speaking to reporters as he accompanied President  
Clinton in Latin America, said he received a ``very preliminary'' 
briefing in 1996 that China may have obtained critical nuclear 
warhead information from Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	But only after a more detailed briefing in July 1997 from the  
Energy Department were security problems involving China and the 
labs brought into sharp focus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That briefing was troubling and raised serious questions and  
warrant a significant response,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are renewing criticism of lab security after the  
dismissal this week of Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born scientist at Los 
Alamos under investigation the past three years for possible 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has not been charged and an FBI investigation is continuing.  
</P>
<P>
	Berger, deputy national security adviser in the mid-1990s, has  
come under attack from some 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican senators and GOP presidential contenders have  
charged this week that Berger, who was deputy national security 
adviser in the mid-1990s, did not act quickly enough on the 
security problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger scoffed at suggestions by some GOP presidential aspirants  
that he resign. ``I have no intention of resigning,'' he declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who plans to seek the GOP  
presidential nomination, said Berger should be fired if reports 
about the security lapses and investigation delays are true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Berger is the responsible authority here, he ought to explain  
his actions to the country or resign,'' said Patrick Buchanan, 
another GOP presidential hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, decrying ``Republican attack  
politics,'' dismissed such suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials insisted the Los Alamos investigation  
was conducted in a timely manner and changes were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reject the notion there was any dragging of feet,'' Berger  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said that after the 1997 DOE briefing, he asked an NSC  
official, Gary Samore, senior director for nonproliferation issues, 
to have the CIA evaluate what security damage might have occurred. 
Also, an interagency task force review ways to improve lab 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, Clinton imposed new safeguards, including  
tighter security checks on foreign visitors to labs and the hiring 
of more counterintelligence personnel. The Energy Department 
brought in a former FBI agent, Edward J. Curran, to head a new 
counterintelligence office. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration doubled funding for Curran's operation in  
1999 and has asked for a similar increase next year, to $32 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement and security officials said it had been known  
for some time that lab security was lax. 
</P>
<P>
	They note neither Hazel O'Leary nor Federico Pena, the previous  
two energy secretaries, had extensive backgrounds in the agency's 
defense aspects. O'Leary also pressed for more openness at the labs 
and promoted visits by foreign scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bill Richardson, the new secretary, has focused more  
attention on counterintelligence and security issues, congressional 
and law inforcement sources said in interviews Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was quite clear the labs were enormously porous,'' said one  
senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The Los Alamos lab ``was quite open to scientists around the world 
doing nuclear work.''

<HEADLINE>  Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stock Prices Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen on today as Japan's  
key stock index soared to a seven month high. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell to 120.54 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
1.22 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo, and less than its late New 
York level of 121.00 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 383.30  
points, or 2.54 percent, to 15,480.00, its highest close since 
15,626.42 on August 10. It was the second day of dramatic gains. On 
Tuesday, the index climbed 317.65 points, or 2.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally helped boost demand for the yen, traders said. After  
trading as high as 121.44 yen early today, the dollar sank to as 
low as 120.29 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market doesn't have much appetite for further (dollar)  
buying now,'' said Koichi Kubo, assistant general manager for the 
forex group at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in Tokyo. ``Market sentiment is 
that it is still top heavy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors had been betting recently that the yen could  
weaken if central bankers implemented policies designed to lower 
interest rates at a board meeting on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower Japanese interest rates would reduce the return to  
investors on everything from bank deposits to government bonds and 
could lead many of them to sell yen to move their money to 
countries where rates are higher. 
</P>
<P>
	But by today more investors doubted that the Bank of Japan would  
ease rates further, dealers said, leading the yen to rebound 
against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices rose as investors welcomed Sony's  
announcement Tuesday that it would undertake aggressive 
restructuring, including cutting 17,000 jobs over four years and 
making three majority owned affiliates into fully owned 
subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony is seen as a leader among Japanese firms and its move  
fueled optimism that other Japanese companies would also become 
more aggressive about restructuring traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony's stock skyrocketed 910 yen ($7.47), or 8.3 percent to  
11,850 yen, after a rally of 8.9 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall market's sentiment has improved substantially,''  
said Masaru Arai, general manager at Ryoko Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 24.96 points, or 2.15 percent, to 1,187.47. The 
TOPIX rose 14.76 points, or 1.29 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the main section of the Tokyo exchange was estimated  
at 982 million shares, up sharply from 594.94 million shares 
Tuesday, and the highest since 1.251 billion shares traded last 
Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising issues overwhelmed declines 900 to 302, while 112 issues  
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.80 yen, down  
from 132.28 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.680 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.700 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.96 yen from 100.80 yen.

<HEADLINE> Senate Hears Divergent Cuba Views </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defenders of the four-decade-old U.S. embargo  
against Cuba said Wednesday it has helped decimate the 
once-powerful Cuban military and forced economic reforms that 
otherwise would not been undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said at a Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee hearing that the weakening of the Cuban 
military one of several ``real, lasting and tangible benefits'' of 
the economic embargo in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, a Cuban exile who heads a Miami-based  
anti-embargo group, testified that 40 years of isolation of the 
Cuban regime has brought misery to the Cuban people and served only 
to please ``discredited'' Florida exile groups opposed to President 
Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	With committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., seated a few feet  
away, Menoyo said Helms' embargo-tightening legislation of 1996 is 
``an insult to Cubans, offends the world'' and serves to perpetuate 
the Castro government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Constructive rapprochement,'' he said, ``was yesterday, is  
today and will be tomorrow the best way out of conflicts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms rejected that argument, declaring that the Canadian  
government's policy of reaching out to Cuba ``has served to prop up 
the Castro regime but has done nothing to advance human rights or 
democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., deplored a recent crackdown on  
dissidents in Cuba but said the U.S. response should not be to try 
to isolate the regime further. 
</P>
<P>
	Menoyo was one of four Cuban exiles who testified -- and the only  
one who advocated an attempt by the United States to establish 
normal relations with Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Zuniga, president of the Foundation for Human Rights in  
Cuba, said the embargo had minimal effect on Cuba before 1991 
because the Caribbean island was able to count on generous 
subsidies from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he said, Cuba has cut its military budget by 48  
percent and eliminated its navy altogether. He also said the steep 
economic decline in Cuba after the collapse of the Soviet Union 
forced the government to legalize the dollar, one of several 
economic liberalizations it has approved. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1980s, as a result of Soviet assistance, Cuba boasted  
perhaps the most formidable military establishment in Latin 
America. It maintained tens of thousands of troops in Angola in 
support of the leftist government there and provided military 
backing to leftist forces in Central America. When the economic 
crisis struck early in the decade, Castro renounced Cuban 
involvement in overseas conflicts. These days, many armed services 
personnel do farm labor. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing, Frank Calzon, executive director of the Center  
for a Free Cuba, called on the Clinton administration to reaffirm 
its determination to stay the course on its Cuba policy until there 
is substantive political reform on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of reform, he said, is illustrated by what he called  
the ``discouraging'' aftermath of the January 1998 visit to Cuba of 
Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the recent sedition trial of four dissidents: Marta  
Beatriz Roque, an economist; Rene Gomez Manzano, an attorney; 
Vladimiro Roca, an economist and son of a prominent leader of 
Cuba's Communist Party; and Feliz Bonne, a teacher and engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	They were charged with promoting aggressive U.S. policies toward  
the communist nation and trying to harm the economy by discouraging 
foreign investment. Verdicts in the trial are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The four were arrested in July 1997 after publication of a  
pamphlet titled ``The Fatherland Belongs to All.'' A large picture 
of the four was on display in the hearing room.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Get Glen Rice From Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Glen Rice was traded from the Charlotte  
Hornets today in a five-player deal that gives the streaking Los 
Angeles Lakers one of the NBA's best shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte also dealt forward J.R. Reid and reserve point guard  
B.J. Armstrong to the Lakers. Los Angeles sent guard Eddie Jones 
and forward Elden Campbell to the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice has not played this season because of elbow surgery Jan.  
22, but he is expected to be ready soon. He joins a team that has 
won seven straight under new coach Kurt Rambis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very difficult thing to trade such good players, and  
especially so when they are such quality people,'' said Jerry West, 
the Lakers' executive vice president for basketball operations. 
``But in Glen Rice we feel we've acquired the best shooter in the 
NBA and also one of the league's best players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this takes us one step closer to our ultimate goal of  
having an NBA championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on their rosters, the Lakers waived reserve forward  
Corie Blount and Charlotte waived forward Joe Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice was the Hornets' top scorer, and his high salary prompted  
the deal, which came the day before the NBA's trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets general manager Bob Bass pointed to the team's injuries  
in making the move. Rice is one of three starters either out for 
the year or sidelined for significant stretches because of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all of our injuries this season this trade really gives  
our team two quality starters and a chance to compete for a playoff 
spot,'' Bass said. ``It has greatly improved our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This marked the third time in four years Charlotte has refused  
to pay an eight-figure salary to one of its best players. The 
others to leave were Alonzo Mourning and Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade comes three days after the resignation of Hornets  
coach Dave Cowens, who was unhappy with his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure of Rice represents another major loss for an  
organization plagued by weak leadership, injuries and falling 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner George Shinn is the target of a sexual misconduct lawsuit  
and is being called on by fans to sell the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rice-to-Los Angeles deal had been widely reported for  
several weeks but was held up because the 6-foot-8 forward had 
loose particles removed from his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers reportedly did not want to execute the trade until  
they could hear other possible offers and were sure Rice was close 
to being ready to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, who joined the Hornets in the deal that sent Mourning to  
Miami, is to be paid $5.4 million this season. The Hornets had an 
option to retain him next season for $7.1 million. Rice asked the 
team for a contract extension this past offseason but was rejected. 
He wanted to be paid at least $10 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers reportedly were willing to give Rice a new contract,  
although terms were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets traded Mourning to Miami in November 1995 after  
refusing his demands for a new contract that would pay him about 
$11 million per season. Charlotte also elected to let Divac leave 
through free agency this past offseason after he sought a deal in 
the $12 million-per-year range. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time NBA All-Star, Rice has made 1,216 3-pointers,  
third-best in league history. He is 101 points short of reaching 
the 15,000-point mark for his nine-year pro career. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-6 Jones, in his fifth NBA season, has established himself  
as one of the league's better 3-point shooters and defenders. He 
led the Lakers in steals in each of his first four seasons and 
ranked seventh in the NBA in 3-pointers made last year, when he 
also was placed on the league's all-defensive second team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jones is a premier scorer and defender in this league,'' Bass  
said. ``We are excited to get this all-star caliber player.''

<HEADLINE> 'Miracle Makers' a Switching Feat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine racing the Indianapolis 500 and  
switching cars 30 times -- and winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Then imagine the cars as violins -- 30 instruments worth $100  
million, made by two geniuses of sound, Antonio Stradivari and 
Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesu. 
</P>
<P>
	The musical driver is violinist Elmar Oliveira, who recorded the  
same piece on a lineup of these priceless Italian-made instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is three newly released compact discs titled ``The  
Miracle Makers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with a book on the violins, the recording project was  
recently presented at Steinway Hall, the Manhattan headquarters of 
the famed piano maker. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight was three Stradivaris and two Guarneris sitting on  
a white tablecloth under the hall's crystal chandelier. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveira, the first American violinist to win gold at the  
Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow, in 1978, seamlessly pulled off 
the switching trick. 
</P>
<P>
	He alternated among the five fiddles -- as he endearingly calls  
them -- to play pieces by Ottorino Respighi, Ernest Bloch and George 
Gershwin. For the CDs, recorded at Purchase College, just north of 
New York City, he played the same excerpt from the Sibelius Violin 
Concerto on all 30 instruments. Another 15 pieces were each 
recorded first on a Guarneri and then on a Stradivari. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a feat that would make most musicians sweat.  
</P>
<P>
	``Each violin is very individual,'' Oliveira says. ``It responds  
differently, the measurements vary and you have to adjust your hand 
-- in a very physical, analytical way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tiniest error, meaning a finger moved a micromeasurement on  
the fingerboard, translates into out-of-tune music. 
</P>
<P>
	But the reward -- hearing and comparing music on the finest  
violins ever made -- is a thrill, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like meeting about 150 incredible people, each a  
personality that's intriguing,'' he adds. 
</P>
<P>
	The dark brilliance of the Guarneris alternates with the  
Stradivaris' spectacular, bright sound. Both masters crafted their 
instruments more than 200 years ago in Cremona, Italy. No one has 
ever been able to duplicate the seductive quality of their tone, an 
alchemy of construction and the secret varnishes that coat the 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's why the prices of these instruments have risen into  
the millions of dollars. Twenty of the instruments were on display 
in glass cases in the back of Steinway Hall. Each has a special 
name -- like a Stradivari dubbed La Cathedrale for the majesty of 
its tone. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the star violinists of this century have performed in  
concert on either a Stradivari or a Guarneri, including Jascha 
Heifetz, Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern and Midori. And many young, 
rising talents somehow come up with half a million dollars or so -- 
the minimum these days for an instrument by one of the two 
craftsmen. Though Stradivari made more than 500 violins, only a few 
dozen survive as top concert instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	But every instrument still offers only four strings in search of  
a great player's hands. And a great musician playing a mediocre 
violin wins over a bad player with a Stradivari. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, it's a win-win combination.  
</P>
<P>
	The instruments used by Oliveira were assembled from collectors  
and artists on three continents by the Chicago violin experts Bein 
&AMP; Fushi. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveira draws from all of them a lavishly piercing tone that  
vibrates from fingers whose warm, generous touch is powered by 
precision technique. 
</P>
<P>
	If 30 violins aren't enough, one musician at the Steinway  
presentation was involved with the movie ``50 Violins,'' which 
stars Meryl Streep as a violin teacher who inspires schoolchildren 
in East Harlem to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The real teacher, Roberta Tzavaras, accepted an award for her  
contribution. Her students learn to love music on instruments far 
more modest than Stradivari's and Guarneri's jewels of sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Violinist Earl Carlyss, former member of the Juilliard String  
Quartet, once asked, ``Why would a person spend $150,000 for a 
Ferrari when he could get from A to B with a Pinto?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because in music, he said, ``you're dealing with colors, you're  
dealing with sounds, and you're dealing with emotions. A Strad has 
the ability to translate the emotions aurally to perfection -- the 
performer's emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In short, he said, ``A Strad is a Strad.''

<HEADLINE>  Blackmun Praised By Colleague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun took a  
hard job at 61, when many people think about retiring, and kept at 
it for 24 years with compassion, good humor and a scientist's 
curiosity, his successor on the highest court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun helped see the nation through important reckonings with  
First Amendment freedoms, racial equality and the Roe vs. Wade 
abortion decision for which he is best remembered, Justice Stephen 
G. Breyer said at a memorial service Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun died Thursday at 90. First lady Hillary Clinton,  
Supreme Court colleagues and Attorney General Janet Reno also 
attended the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the memorial service, Blackmun's cremated remains were  
taken to Arlington National Cemetery in an unusual hearse. Among 
the black limousines carrying family and friends was a light blue 
Volkswagen Beetle, like the one the justice drove to work for 
years, which carried the cremation urn. 
</P>
<P>
	As unusually heavy snow fell on Washington, a fellow native  
Minnesotan, humorist Garrison Keillor, led mourners in singing the 
Irish lullaby ``Toura Loura, Loura.'' Keillor said it was a 
Blackmun favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer, who succeeded Blackmun on the court, said in Blackmun's  
24-year tenure he ``made a direct, conscious effort to reach out 
and understand those whose life experience was different from his 
own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trained as a mathematician, Blackmun retired from the court in  
1994 at age 85 because, he said, he knew ``what the numbers are,'' 
and it was time to go, Breyer remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun got tens of thousands of letters after he wrote the  
1973 Roe vs. Wade opinion that legalized abortion nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	One very long letter urged Blackmun to resign, Breyer said, and  
the justice's reply was succinct: ``Dear Sir, No. Sincerely, Harry 
A. Blackmun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Koh, a former Blackmun law clerk and now an assistant  
secretary of state, called him ``the people's justice'' who 
``through quiet courage and sheer hard work became the conscience 
of our court in the late 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Months before his retirement, Blackmun repudiated his  
career-long acceptance of capital punishment and declared himself 
opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughter, Nancy Blackmun, said his long hours at work  
limited his time with his family, but she added that for his three 
daughters, ``his were the most comforting hands to hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. William A. Holmes of said Blackmun brought to religion  
and the law ``a creative fidelity marked by humility, and always 
with a twinkle in his eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton sat beside Blackmun's widow, Dorothy, in the front  
row of the Metropolitan Memorial United Methodist Church, where the 
Blackmuns were regular worshipers. Across the aisle were Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist, seven of the eight associate 
justices, and retired Justice Byron R. White -- the only living 
retired justice. Justice Antonin Scalia was out of town due to an 
illness in the family.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Leaving Weak Sports Legacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Amateur sports fans are disappointed in the work  
of a foundation designed to bolster Atlanta's Olympic heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 2 1/2 years since the Olympics ended, the tax-exempt Georgia  
Amateur Athletics Foundation has awarded only two grants totaling 
$20,000 for youth golf programs, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletic legacy for the games has basically been nil, and  
that has really been unfortunate,'' said Dennis Berkholtz, 
president of the national team handball federation, which relocated 
to Atlanta in hopes of benefiting from the city's Olympic legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period, however, the foundation has spent nearly $1  
million to buy the personal Olympics memorabilia of its chairman, 
Billy Payne, who founded the organization more than 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne, who headed the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games,  
said the foundation has ``an admirable record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It has hosted sporting events and given grants for a multiple  
number of years,'' Payne said. ``The process was interrupted when 
the bid was accepted. Now that everybody has got a second wind, we 
are going to pick it back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation, which hired its only staff member, executive  
director Linda Stephenson, in January 1998, is planning to open an 
Olympic museum. It has a collection of memorabilia and archived 
documents that are being held at the Atlanta History Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The two $10,000 grants were made last fall to the East Lake  
Community Foundation for its junior academy and the Friends of John 
A. White Park for First Tee for inner-city kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Both programs were connected to Payne or his board members, the  
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne says the foundation has been occupied with the process of  
examining the memorabilia and records, which will go into the 
museum, when it gets built. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports activists would like to see more done for athletes.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've already got a beautiful (Centennial Olympic) park, and  
I'm glad we've got it,'' said Steve Kearney, president of USA 
Badminton. ``But what is that going to do for the sports? I'd also 
like to have a gym I could play in and teach kids in. The athletes 
are the legacy.''

<HEADLINE> Baerga: Don't Judge My Waistline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Carlos Baerga says people should scrutinize  
his performance, not his waistline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't they say anything to Tony Gwynn?'' says Baerga, who  
signed with the St. Louis Cardinals during the offseason. ``Why 
don't they say anything to Cecil Fielder? Why don't they say 
anything to other players? ``Let's talk about hitting, fielding, 
something like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Because conditioning was among the factors blamed for  
Baerga's decline in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, listed at 5-foot-11 and 215 pounds, was a dominant  
player and a three-time All-Star with the Cleveland Indians in the 
early 1990s. During a four-year stretch from 1992-95, he topped 
.300 each season, twice drove in 100 runs and had 90 RBIs another 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Indians traded him to the New York Mets in 1996, his  
production declined rapidly. The last two seasons, he totaled 16 
homers and 105 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	His earning potential also has swooned. After finishing a $21.4  
million, six-year contract last year, he signed a $1.25 million, 
one-year contract with the Cardinals. Plus, the money is not 
guaranteed if the Cardinals don't like what they see and cut him in 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to see him play a little more,'' general manager  
Walt Jocketty said. ``It looks like he's going to be able to hit, 
we've just got to worry about defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga said nobody needs to worry about anything.  
</P>
<P>
	``I worked hard this winter to come back ready to take a job  
here,'' he said. ``That's why I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga blamed his problems on a succession of minor injuries.  
Baerga, a switch-hitter, hit just .204 last year when batting 
right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things just happened,'' he said. ``It's not bad luck. A lot of  
players go through slumps and injuries, they can take away your 
hitting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he's only 30 and compared his situation to that of Eric  
Davis, another new Cardinals player. Davis retired in 1994 because 
of a herniated disc in his back and in 1998 rebounded from colon 
cancer with a .327 average, 28 homers and 89 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``For two or three years, Eric Davis wasn't the same, and now  
he's back,'' Baerga said. ``People have to realize we're human 
beings and we go through situations. If you're strong, you can go 
up again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Baerga has no doubt he'll make it with the Cardinals,  
the team is playing it safe. There are several stopgap candidates 
in camp, including Pat Kelly, David Howard and Placido Polanco, 
while youngsters such as 1997 first-round pick Adam Kennedy 
continue to develop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing in life is going to be given to you,'' Baerga said.  
``I know I have to work hard to get this job.''

<HEADLINE> Calcavecchia To Defend Honda Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- When Mark Calcavecchia won last  
year's Honda Classic, tears welled in his eyes as his children 
rushed onto the 18th green in jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a memory he would love to relive.  
</P>
<P>
	Calcavecchia will defend his title in the tournament beginning  
Thursday at the TPC at Heron Bay. He likes his chances, even though 
he hasn't played well lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to the Honda,'' Calcavecchia said. ``The  
way the course is set up, it's right up my alley. They've elevated 
some tees, and the fairway bunkers are smaller.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calcavecchia, a West Palm Beach resident who attended the  
University of Florida, hopes to get his game together in his home 
state. He struggled during the PGA Tour's West Coast swing and 
faded after an opening-round 68 to a 4-over 292 at last week's 
Doral-Ryder Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing terrible,'' he said. ``I'm like 160th on the  
tour in putting. The greens are a lot smoother (at Honda). That 
gives me something to look forward to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calcavecchia will be part of a field that includes five of the  
world's top 10 players. Among those competing are Mark O'Meara, 
Colin Montgomerie and Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
	One player who doesn't expect to win this week is 10-time tour  
winner Mark McCumber, who has made just one cut since 1996. But 
McCumber, recovering from a mysterious malady that caused numbness 
in his legs and left hand, was encouraged to win a team event 
Tuesday at TPC at Heron Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	McCumber split $9,000 with teammate Ben Bates.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's my first check in over a year,'' McCumber said with a  
smile. ``I have no expectations of putting it all together this 
week. I'm rusty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calcavecchia sounds more optimistic, partly because of his past  
success at Honda. He also won the event in 1987, then joined golf's 
upper echelon two years later by winning the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, his life changed: People began paying him for  
tournament appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't pay me that much money to show up and play golf,''  
he said then. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 10 years since his British Open title, he has won six  
times. At Honda a year ago, he shot a final-round 65 to finish at 8 
under par. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having my kids run out there last year, that was one of the  
highlights of my career,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calcavecchia stayed hot for the rest of the tour's Florida  
swing, tying for fourth at the Bay Hill Invitational in Orlando and 
taking fourth at The Players Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes this week's tournament can start a similar streak.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have a slight advantage coming in because I know I  
can play the course,'' he said. ``I like the greens, and I've won 
the tournament. But then again, everybody has two or three things 
they can count as advantages.''

<HEADLINE> Contraceptive Sponge Brought Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Today Sponge, the most popular  
over-the-counter contraceptive for women before it was pulled off 
the market in 1995, is headed back to U.S. drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
	A newly founded New Jersey company, Allendale Pharmaceuticals  
Inc., told The Associated Press on Wednesday it has bought the 
Today Sponge from its previous manufacturer and hopes to begin 
selling it again by fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a great need for the sponge,'' said Allendale  
chief executive Gene Detroyer. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to formally announce the Today Sponge's return at a  
contraceptive meeting in San Francisco this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	It was good news for family planning groups.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased and excited that it's coming back,'' said Susan  
Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which says there aren't 
enough contraceptive choices for American women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women need different methods at different points in life. ...  
Certainly it's not for everyone,'' Tew cautioned. ``But those 
contraceptive sponge users loved that method'' before Today 
disappeared in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration said there was never any  
problem with the Today Sponge's safety, a position the agency 
reiterated on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, then-manufacturer Whitehall-Robins Healthcare decided  
it would cost too much to upgrade the old manufacturing plant where 
it made the sponge to meet stringent government safety rules. FDA 
inspectors were concerned about high bacteria rates they discovered 
in air and water at the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite outcry by women's groups, the company quit making the  
sponge rather than upgrade the factory to solve the bacteria 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	No contraceptive sponge has been sold in the United States  
since. Women in France, Canada and a few other countries can buy 
competing sponges made abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the FDA never revoked the Today Sponge's approval,  
getting it back on the market should be a quick process, said 
Allendale co-founder Robert Staab. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products, parent company of Whitehall-Robins,  
confirmed Wednesday that it is notifying the FDA of the change in 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Allendale then must have its own sponge factory, outside  
Philadelphia, inspected for safety in order for the FDA to allow 
sales to resume. Staab said the factory already manufactures 
medicines for large U.S. drug companies in compliance with FDA 
rules, so he expects no problems with approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 116,000 American women were using Today in 1995. That's a  
small proportion of the 38 million women who used some 
contraception that year; sterilization and the pill were the No. 1 
and 2 choices then and now. 
</P>
<P>
	But Today was the most popular choice that did not require a  
doctor's visit. The only other woman-controlled nonprescription 
choices are spermicidal foams or suppositories and the female 
condom. Unlike those options, the sponge can be inserted up to 24 
hours before sex and doesn't require repeat applications for 
repeated intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	With its low risk of side effects, the sponge was attractive to  
women who had problems with prescribed hormonal contraceptives or 
had difficulty with more complex inserted devices. 
</P>
<P>
	But its appeal was limited by a relatively high failure rate,  
about 10 percent in women who had never borne children and somewhat 
higher in women who had gone through childbirth, Tew noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The donut-shaped device, coated in the spermicide nonoxynol-9,  
is simply pushed up the vagina to cover the cervix. It has a loop 
to grasp for removal, and comes with warnings not to leave it in 
for more than 30 hours to avoid a low risk of infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroyer would not reveal how much his private company paid to  
buy the Today Sponge. But he noted that at Today's peak, it brought 
in about $17 million in sales a year, and said he is confident of 
recouping the investment.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 79, Hits New High / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes shot to record highs today as oil  
stocks rose with oil prices, but concerns about earnings at 
technology companies limited the advances in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	At 4 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 79.08 at 9,772.84, surpassing its previous record close of 
9,736.08, set last Friday. The Dow is now up 6.4 percent for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, which lagged the blue chip market for  
most of the day, narrowed the gap late in the session. The Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 index also set a record, adding 7.00 to finish at 
1,286.84, above its previous record close of 1,282.73 set just last 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite ended in positive territory but was  
hampered by ongoing nervousness about technology company earnings. 
The Nasdaq added 13.07 to finish at 2,406.01, still shy of its 
all-time closing high of 2,510.09 on Feb 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were sharply higher, following reports that a Saudi  
official said the world's oil producers are close to an agreement 
to cut production to shore up prices. Oil prices had already been 
rising, pushing oil stocks higher. The Dow components were led 
higher by Chevron, up more than 3 points. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont was another big winner among Dow shares, up more than 4  
points after the company said it would issue separate stock that 
will track the performance of the life-sciences portion of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer-related stocks sank after retailer Computer Associates  
was downgraded by Morgan Stanley, which cited concerns about softer 
near-term demand for computers, increasing competition, and a 
potential peaking of margins. Computer Associates' shares were down 
nearly 6 points near the close. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer fell in leading New York Stock Exchange volume,  
and its competitor, Dell Computer, declined in leading Nasdaq 
volume. Dell dropped even after the computer maker announced that 
it had agreed with Amazon.com to offer linked Web sites and 
customized content. Amazon's shares climbed more than 6 points, 
along with other Internet-related shares.

<P>
	Stocks got another boost as Ralph Acampora, director of  
technical research at Prudential Securities and a well-known market 
bull, told a group of Belgian traders that U.S. equities, 
especially blue-chip Dow components, are in the ``early stages of 
another bull market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acampora said low inflation, low interest rates, the technology  
revolution and a peacetime economy are all supporting stocks, and 
the fact that blue-chip companies are leading the market means 
``the market's telling me that it wants to go up, because it's led 
by quality.'' He predicted that the Dow will climb as high as 
11,500 sometime in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen  
Securities, agreed that technical factors in the market are 
favorable. He said that while investments from Japan are 
temporarily sidelined by the end of Japan's fiscal year at the end 
of this month, there is still ``tremendous'' interest on the part 
of Japanese investors in U.S. stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interest rates in Japan are essentially zero, and there is  
tremendous interest in U.S. securities,'' Pradilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bullish implications of having a lot of cash on the  
sidelines is clashing with some bearish concerns as well, Pradilla 
said, namely, that stocks are very fully priced and analysts don't 
expect earnings this year to be knocked out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have this tug-of-war between very favorable liquidity in  
the background, but nobody can say stocks are undervalued,'' 
Pradilla said. ``And earnings are going to be OK, but you're going 
to get some unpleasant exposure (to earnings declines) as the year 
goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds were lower, with the 30-year Treasury off 13/32 at 5.56  
percent. The higher rates didn't disturb bank stocks, however.

<HEADLINE> RJR Nabisco To Shed Tobacco Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Food and tobacco conglomerate RJR Nabisco  
Holdings Corp. is sending its cigarette business out on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR said Tuesday it will sell its international tobacco business  
to Japan's largest tobacco company and will break off its domestic 
tobacco operations into a separate company owned by RJR 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come amid rising legal challenges to the tobacco  
industry and falling U.S. cigarette sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tobacco industry is in deep trouble,'' said Ahron  
Leichtman, executive director of Citizens for a Tobacco-Free 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	But RJR said the cigarette and food companies will probably fare  
better as separate entities. 
</P>
<P>
	Its tobacco brands include Camel, Winston and Salem cigarettes,  
and the deals will leave it in control of a food business which 
makes Ritz crackers, Oreo cookies, Life Savers candy and Planters 
nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The $17 billion conglomerate has been under pressure for several  
years from major stockholders to separate its food and tobacco 
businesses because the tobacco is considered a drag on RJR's stock. 
Some investors won't put their money in any company that has 
tobacco holdings, out of either opposition to smoking or fear that 
lawsuits will hurt profits. 
</P>
<P>
	John Maxwell, analyst at Davenport &AMP; Co., said RJR got a  
fantastic price for the international business -- $7.8 billion. He 
said RJR will use the proceeds to help reduce its $9.1 billion 
debt, leaving the domestic tobacco company in a better position to 
compete in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Icahn, a onetime corporate raider who holds about 7.7  
percent of RJR stock, had threatened to launch a fight for control 
of the board of directors to force a quick separation. Icahn failed 
to return repeated calls for comment Tuesday. The deadline for 
filing a rival slate is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR is selling its international tobacco business to Japan  
Tobacco Co. which is also assuming $200 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal will allow us to secure a base for future growth  
overseas and establish us as a global player,'' Japan Tobacco said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The RJR international tobacco business is a distant third to  
Philip Morris Cos. and British-American Tobacco PLC, and its 
earnings have fallen amid financial turmoil in its key Russian and 
Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sale, the RJR board plans to spin off its domestic  
tobacco operations, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., to RJR shareholders. 
The tobacco company will keep its name and will retain its 
headquarters in Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the food and tobacco businesses will be best  
able to achieve their full potential under separate ownership 
structures,'' said RJR chairman and chief executive Steven F. 
Goldstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Importantly, the new corporate structure allows people filing  
tobacco suits to continue to make claims against either R.J. 
Reynolds Tobacco Co. or the renamed RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff would leave RJR Nabisco with an 80.6 percent stake  
in Nabisco Holdings Corp., the food division that also makes Oreos, 
Chips Ahoy! and Snackwell's cookies, Premium saltines and A1 steak 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Mulvey, executive director of corporate accountability  
watchdog Infact, said RJR's moves meant ``the corporation 
responsible for Joe Camel would no longer being operating with the 
same influence on the national or international scenes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her Boston-based group has been encouraging consumers to avoid  
buying Nabisco products since 1994 because of the food company's 
ties to cigarette making. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with lower debt after the spinoff, Reynolds Tobacco faces  
challenges. Analysts expect the steady decline in cigarette 
consumption will accelerate due to hefty price hikes that are being 
used to pay for a lawsuit settlement that is costing the industry 
$246 billion over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government is considering a similar suit to recover  
the costs of treating sick smokers. A California jury recently 
ordered Philip Morris to pay $51 million judgment to a smoker. A 
class-action smokers' suit is pending in Florida and several union 
health funds are also suing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had long warned that simply spinning off the food  
division into a separate independent company would face a prolonged 
court challenge because plaintiffs would charge the company with 
putting valuable assets out of their reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Daynard, a tobacco critic who heads the Tobacco Products  
Liability Project, said that plaintiffs may still protest if the 
company uses the proceeds from the sale of the international 
company for a stock buyback or higher dividends.

<HEADLINE> Reliant Energy Buys Dutch Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Texas energy utility Reliant Energy Inc. entered  
the European market on Wednesday by announcing plans to buy one of 
the Netherlands' largest power companies for $2.4 billion over 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliant, formerly Houston Industries Inc., would acquire a 40  
percent stake in NV Energieproduktiebedrijf UNA for $900 million, 
company officials said. Reliant would acquire the remaining 60 
percent of the Dutch company by 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors welcomed news of the deal, pushing Reliant's shares up  
12 1/2 cents to $27.06 1/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``UNA is a leading power generator in the Netherlands and offers  
a unique entry point into Europe,'' said Steve Letbetter, president 
and chief operating officer of Reliant Energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The first stage of the deal, acquiring the 40 percent stake, is  
expected to be completed by June, Reliant spokeswoman Sandy Fruhman 
said. ``We're going to use UNA as our investment vehicle throughout 
Europe,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction is subject to approval from Dutch regulators.  
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Reliant Energy is a diversified international  
energy company with $11.5 billion in annual revenue and assets 
totaling more than $19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the country's largest electric and natural-gas companies,  
with 4 million retail customers, Reliant hopes to position itself 
to compete in the country's evolving electricity markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Amsterdam-based UNA, which supplies nearly 20 percent of  
the Netherlands' power, is own by municipal governments. It is the 
first electric company in that country to be privatized.

<HEADLINE>  Iranian President Visits Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Iran is ready for a new era of East-West friendship,  
President Mohammad Khatami said in a groundbreaking visit to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami arrived in Italy on Tuesday to a warm welcome and the  
tightest security the capital has seen in years. He was to meet 
today with Italy's premier and has an audience with the pope on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami declared he had come to Italy ``to make our relations a  
symbol and pattern for friendship between East and West and Islam 
and Christianity,'' during a state dinner in his honor Tuesday 
hosted by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip signaled a new policy of detente that would see Iran  
building relations with other nations, Khatami said. Khatami 
visited the United Nations in New York last year, but the Italy 
trip marks the first state visit to a Western nation by an Iranian 
leader since the 1979 Islamic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Islamic Republic of Iran has no intention of hostilities  
with any country or anybody,'' he said, according to a text 
released in advance of the banquet, which was closed to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Iran ``demands rational and healthy relations with all  
countries based on mutual respect and noninterference in each 
others' affairs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old cleric has presented himself as a believer in  
increased social and political freedom at home and an advocate of 
dialogue, not confrontation, with the West. His statements on the 
visit have been a far cry from the hard line espoused by his 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami's schedule today has him meeting with Premier Massimo  
D'Alema, followed by a trip to Florence for an address to the 
European University. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington on Tuesday, the State Department expressed hope  
that Italian officials would raise U.S. concerns about terrorism 
and other issues during Khatami's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy, a major trading partner and buyer of Iranian oil, is  
trying hard to encourage Khatami's overtures to the West. It is 
trying just as hard to make sure his visit goes smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of police officers were deployed Tuesday in a massive  
security operation that tangled Rome's traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalfaro gave Khatami a red-carpet welcome complete with honor  
guard and brass band. In the shadow of Rome's Colosseum, thousands 
of Iranian dissidents gathered in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying banners, torches and pictures of executed loved ones,  
they heard a series of speakers, including Italian politicians, who 
share their distrust of Khatami. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them was Marco Taradash, a legislator from the  
conservative Forza Italia party, who accused the center-left 
government of choosing business deals over human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran wants more investment and hopes to renegotiate some of its  
debt. Italy is interested in Iran's huge oil and gas reserves and 
wants to sell it more food, agricultural products and 
pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iranian resistance say Khatami is nothing more than a  
figurehead for a regime that remains oppressive and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``He puts on this smile to show that he's different. But he's  
not,'' said Alireza Jafarzadeh, a member of the resistance's 
foreign relations committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Pope John Paul II should have refused to see Khatami.  
</P>
<P>
	``The ayatollahs want to use this meeting to appear tolerant,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran's chairmanship of the 54-nation Islamic Conference gives  
extra weight to the meeting between leaders of the world's two 
largest religions. Both Islam and the Roman Catholic Church claim 
some 1 billion adherents. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope is expected to press Khatami to allow Iran's small  
Christian minority more rights. Italian leaders say they'll press 
him on Iran's attempts to acquire nuclear weapons, as well as on 
the issues of terrorism and human rights.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Ends Nissan Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- In the end, Nissan Motor Co's. mountain of debt  
apparently was too high for DaimlerChrysler AG to overcome in its 
quest to become a dominant world automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler announced Wednesday it ended talks toward  
acquiring a large stake in Japan's second-largest automaker. 
Although officials did not specify in detail what caused the talks 
to fail, Nissan's debt, estimated to be as high as $37 billion, 
clearly was an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they looked at the situation and were intimidated by  
the amount of debt they had to assume,'' said analyst Nick 
Lobaccaro of Merrill Lynch. ``And the restructuring of Nissan's 
operations would have required a lot of management time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Juergen Schrempp hinted that the  
management issue was a factor. The company formed in November when 
Daimler-Benz AG acquired Chrysler Corp. is still in the process of 
merging its far-flung operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have emphasized that the integration of Daimler and  
Chrysler has utmost priority in our current business activities,'' 
Schrempp said in a statement. ``We discussed our options of a 
potential partnership very openly and in a very friendly 
atmosphere, but finally decided not to pursue a participation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokesman Steve Rossi said at the Geneva  
International Motor Show ``a possible relationship would not be as 
quick to realize as we would have hoped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after Schrempp met in Tokyo with Nissan  
president Yoshikazu Hanawa. DaimlerChrysler said it would neither 
buy an equity stake in Nissan nor pursue an outright purchase of 
Nissan Diesel, its commercial truck subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan released a statement saying it would consider more  
limited cooperative ties with DaimlerChrysler while continuing to 
seek another partner for a broader capital linkup. The companies' 
joint ventures in commercial and light trucks will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief executive of Renault SA, meanwhile, said the French  
automaker was continuing to talk to Nissan about such a linkup. 
Louis Schweitzer said at the Geneva show that there was no deal yet 
and referred to Renault's statement of March 1, in which the 
automaker said Nissan would offer a good strategic fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault primarily serves the European market and is considerably  
smaller than DaimlerChrysler, but has ambitions of becoming a more 
global automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp had made no secret of his desire to acquire an interest  
in the big Japanese automaker to expand its global reach. Analysts 
expect DaimlerChrysler to explore other possible acquisition 
targets, such as Mitsubishi Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has been staggering under an estimated $22 billion to $37  
billion in debt, exacerbated by weak sales in its home market of 
Japan and in the United States. DaimlerChrysler was believed to 
have been seeking between 30 percent and 40 percent of Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd have to be very cautious approaching that situation,''  
Lobaccaro said. ``There has to be some reconciliation with the 
creditors before an investor could see an up side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, the world's fifth-largest automaker, was  
considering Nissan as a way to strengthen its position against the 
larger General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and 
Volkswagen AG, which have broader stakes in Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
	What happens next for Nissan is unclear, said Lincoln C.  
Merrihew, an analyst with DRI/McGraw-Hill. He said there might be 
deals that Nissan turned down while still negotiating with 
DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any potential buyer is going to have to wonder what  
DaimlerChrysler saw that made them not want to go forward,'' he 
said. ``Then their next question is whether DaimlerChrysler's 
interpretation was incorrect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrihew said a Renault merger or buyout would go with  
conventional industry wisdom that good deals happen between 
companies with as little overlap in products and geography as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Renault might make sense geographically,'' he said. ``A lot of  
European brands would like to be in America right now. It's a 
large, stable market, and the only one.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Sends Steel Bill to House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee, under pressure to respond  
to a surge in steel imports, sent a quota bill to the full House on 
Wednesday even though a majority of the panel members opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee reported the bill ``adversely'' on  
a voice vote, meaning a majority of its members opposed the measure 
but agreed to let the House consider it. A vote by the full House 
is expected as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is likely to draw considerable support from  
steel-state Republicans eager to help struggling steelworkers who 
believe import limits are needed to prevent additional U.S. 
layoffs. But the bill faces a troubled future in the Senate and 
with the administration, which threatened a veto Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the move was a win for the steel industry, the  
committee debate -- and its unfavorable recommendation -- highlighted 
rifts within Congress about how best to tackle the increase in 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some Democrats who agreed that the steel industry needed  
legislative help believe the quota measure goes too far and would 
violate international trade agreements, as established under the 
World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot seek to use the WTO to enforce international rules  
of law regarding trade, as we currently are in many cases, while at 
the same time advancing a proposal which is clearly in violation of 
those rules,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., ranking Democrat on 
the Ways and Means trade subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO recently ruled against the European Union regarding U.S.  
complaints involving bananas and beef from cattle that use growth 
hormone. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also argue that quotas could lead to market distortions,  
shortages of certain types of steel and increased prices, hurting 
steel consumers in the automobile, appliance and construction 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Phil English, R-Pa., a supporter of the bill, said  
strong sanctions are needed to ``send a strong message to the 
international community that Congress is not willing to roll over 
and be a patsy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders urged the committee's chairman, Rep. Bill Archer,  
R-Texas, to report the bill out unfavorably because of fears that 
its supporters would use parliamentary tactics to force a vote 
anyhow and disrupt normal procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would limit foreign-made steel imports to their  
pre-July 1997 levels, before worldwide conditions began changing to 
boost imports dramatically. The measure also would set up an import 
notification system to improve tracking of shipments into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of layoffs and bankruptcies at three U.S. steel  
companies have been blamed on the import surge. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is considering steel tariffs of as much as 71  
percent against Japan and Brazil after issuing a preliminary ruling 
in favor of the domestic industry's complaints that those countries 
have dumped steel in U.S. markets at prices below production costs.

<HEADLINE> Vicar Favored for Florida Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Carl Nafzger listened closely as owners,  
trainers and jockeys discussed what it would take for an upset in 
Saturday's Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trainer of Vicar, the 3-1 morning-line favorite for the  
$750,000 race at Gulfstream Park, Nafzger shook his head and 
smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's talking about a surprise,'' Nafzger said at  
Wednesday's post position draw. ``I hope to heck there are no 
surprises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were a few on Wednesday, though, as a larger-than-expected  
field of 11 3-tear-olds were entered in the 1 1-8 mile Florida 
Derby. Among them was the impressive filly Three Ring, who then 
drew an unfavorable outside post and may be withdrawn later in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 10 post position didn't enhance our cause,'' trainer  
Edward Plesa Jr., said a day after declaring his filly would run 
only if she drew an inside post. ``I'm not going to say now that 
we're not going to run. I will consult with the owner, assess the 
field and then decide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No filly has won the Florida Derby. Three Ring, with four wins  
in seven career starts, is coming off a 14 3-4-length romp in the 
Davona Dale on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Other last-minute entries were long shots First American and  
Casanova Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar will be in familiar company Saturday as five of the horses  
he beat in the Fountain of Youth on Feb. 20 are back for another 
shot at the Wild Again colt owned by James Tafel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, who lost by a neck in the Fountain of Youth, leads  
the charge, which includes Certain (third), Grits'N Hard Toast 
(fourth), Casanova Star (eighth) and Aly's Alley (ninth). 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Marquard, breeder and owner of Aly's Alley, expects his  
colt to run much better than he did three weeks ago, especially 
after drawing the No. 11 post . 
</P>
<P>
	``He was too anxious after being off for 3 1/2 months,'' Marquard  
said. ``He seems to do better from the outside, so we hope to give 
you all a pleasant surprise .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aly's Alley left from the No. 13 post when he finished second in  
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	After Vicar rebounded from his fifth-place finish in the Holy  
Bull on Jan. 16 to take the Fountain of Youth, Derby fever gripped 
Nafzger once again. In 1990, he trained Kentucky Derby winner 
Unbridled, who won the Florida Derby leading up to his win at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't be happier with him'' Nafzger said. ``He just  
keeps getting better. I saw what I wanted to see in his last work. 
We wanted him to relax and listen to his rider. He's a pretty happy 
horse right now. I think we have something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Sellers will be aboard Vicar for the third straight race,  
and he's seen a great deal of improvement. In the Holy Bull, Vicar 
was held off the pace and didn't respond well, but he grabbed the 
lead in the Fountain of Youth and held off Cat Thief. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to keep him relaxed,'' Sellers said. ``If he's  
comfortable on the lead, OK. If not, I'd rather be on the outside 
staking a horse or two and being in control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Derby is just one of several Derby preps at three  
tracks this weekend, with trainer Bob Baffert's brigade of horses 
set to run in California and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Baffert sends out current Derby favorite Exploit  
and Prime Timber in the San Felipe at Santa Anita and the filly 
Silverbulletday in the Fair Grounds Oaks; on Sunday, he's got 
Answer Lively -- the 2-year-old champion -- and General Challenge in 
the Louisiana Derby and the filly Excellent Meeting in the Santa 
Anita Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert nearly captured the Triple Crown the last two years,  
winning the Derby and Preakness with Silver Charm in 1997 and with 
Real Quiet in the 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Derby field, from the rail out, with jockeys and  
odds: Valid Trefaire (Jose Santos, 15-1); Cat Thief (Pat Day, 4-1); 
Certain (Kent Desormeaux, 6-1); Adonis (Jorge Chavez, 10-1); Vicar 
(Sellers, 3-1); Casanova Star (Mike Smith, 20-1); Wondertross (8-1, 
Jerry Bailey); Grits'N Hard Toast (Robbie Davis, 8-1); First 
American (Jose Velez, 20-1); Three Ring (John Velasquez, 5-1); and 
Aly's Alley (Edgar Prado, 15-1).

<HEADLINE> Offices Can Be Disabled Minefield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Regina Genwright used to press the start button  
on her office copier and hope for the best. Genwright, who is 
blind, couldn't work the machine's control panel to switch paper 
size or reduce text. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she simply tells her new voice-activated copier, ``Two  
copies. Double Sided. Print Now.'' And it obeys. The product, which 
hits the market Thursday, marks a notable step forward for disabled 
workers at a time when many are still unwelcome around the office. 
</P>
<P>
	The copier, made by Pitney Bowes, includes a Braille keyboard  
and wheelchair-accessible height and was tested at the American 
Foundation for the Blind, where Genwright directs an information 
clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
	It debuts as regulations stemming from a major 1990 civil rights  
law are being tightened to make federal workplaces more accessible 
to disabled people and telecommunications equipment more 
user-friendly for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans with Disabilities Act bars discrimination based on  
disability and orders employers to ``make reasonable 
accommodation'' to qualified disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its passage, 1 million more disabled people have found  
jobs. However, nearly half of the 30 million disabled people of 
working age remain unemployed, although the majority say they'd 
like to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a terrible failure of connection between corporate  
America and this community,'' says Charles Riley, editor-in-chief 
of WE, a magazine for people with disabilities. Companies are 
vastly ``underestimating the contribution that people with 
disabilities can make to companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In part, that's because employers fear that disabled people  
won't be able to carry out the little tasks that make up the fabric 
of office life: copying, e-mail, memo-writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employer feels right up front that he or she is taking a  
risk in employing a blind person,'', says Carl Augusto, president 
of the American Foundation for the Blind. 
</P>
<P>
	People with physical and mental limitations can do many of these  
chores, but less efficiently, since most office equipment isn't 
geared to their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something more is needed. We believe it's ease of use of the  
tools people need to be successful in the workplace,'' said Pitney 
Bowes chief executive officer Michael Critelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology has driven innovations in office equipment for the  
disabled in recent years. But demand has grown slowly, especially 
in the private sector, says Dick Schieck, manager of the Xerox 
division that handles all equipment accommodations for disabled 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were expecting the ADA was going to cause this market to  
explode,'' he said. ``Quite frankly it didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disabled workers will get a boost in 2000 when new regulations  
take effect that force all federal bodies to make office equipment 
accessible to them. In addition, the Federal Communications 
Commission this spring will issue a new rule requiring the 
telecommunications industry to ensure equipment and services, such 
as cellular phones, can be used by everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, designers are hampered by the need to accommodate a wide  
range of disabilities, while -- naturally -- making a profit. ``We're 
not a charity,'' says Schieck. ``I have to look at each investment 
relative to how much good are you going to do out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most products to help disabled people in the workplace involve  
accommodations to existing equipment, such as tilting a copier 
control panel slightly so wheelchair-users can see it better. 
</P>
<P>
	That change, Xerox's most popular for this market, can be made  
by a technician for $500. Other changes to equipment range from $50 
Braille stickers to a $3,700 remote keyboard for a high-end copier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 70 percent of companies, however, spend less than $500 to  
accommodate a disabled worker, according to a survey for the 
President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitney Bowes' new copier effectively links a sophisticated  
``Universal Access'' computer system -- costing a steep $15,995 - 
with a normal office copier, which costs about $8,000. That means 
the Universal Access system alone costs about $9 a day for the five 
years that average copiers last. 
</P>
<P>
	For Regina Genwright, however, the machine provides something  
money can't buy -- more freedom on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, when we had a regular copy machine, I could not do the  
things I'm able to do now,'' she said. ``Now, I don't have to think 
about what I'm going to do if I can't find someone to make copies 
for me, or something goes wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Hepatitis Behind Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The most common form of liver cancer, a type that is nearly  
always fatal, is on the rise in the United States and the increase 
is likely to continue until hepatitis is better controlled, 
researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma increased 71 percent  
from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, according to researchers at 
the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Albuquerque, N.M. 
Hospitalization and death rates for all types of liver cancer were 
also found to be increasing at a similar pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in today's New England Journal of  
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Liver cancer will strike an estimated 14,500 Americans in 1999,  
according to the American Cancer Society. Most will get 
hepatocellular carcinoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 5 percent of people with hepatocellular carcinoma are alive  
five years after diagnosis, because the tumors usually are found 
only after the cancer has spread. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancer is often caused by chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis  
C, viral diseases that lead to liver scarring, known as cirrhosis, 
which in turn can lead to liver cancer. Hepatitis also can cause 
other changes in liver cells that make them cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoholism is another leading cause of cirrhosis and liver  
cancer. But alcoholism is declining and hepatitis B infections are 
slowing because of a vaccine and effective treatments. So 
researchers believe most of the increase in liver cancer is due to 
hepatitis C, a disease discovered a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Americans with hepatitis C got it from transfusions before  
the blood supply was cleaned up by 1992. The virus can also be 
spread between drug users sharing needles, and in rare cases, 
through sex. In half of all cases, doctors do not know how patients 
got it. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 4 million Americans are infected with the hepatitis  
C virus, but no one knows the exact number because it can take up 
to 30 years for symptoms to develop. There is no vaccine and the 
only available treatment does not help the majority of patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists call hepatitis C a hidden epidemic.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people still don't know they have it,'' said Dr. Jack  
Wands, a liver research expert at Brown University. ``I think it 
will continue to rise until we have either a vaccine or an 
effective treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors should test patients with hepatitis-induced cirrhosis  
for liver cancer, because if tumors are caught early enough, 
surgery can be successful, said Dr. Hashem El-Serag, lead author of 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis B is more infectious but is easier to treat. It is  
spread through blood, sex or from mother to child at birth. About 
200,000 Americans are diagnosed each year. The vaccine has been 
available since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis A, a relatively mild form of the virus, is not a risk  
factor for liver cancer. It is spread primarily through 
contaminated food, such as shellfish from tainted water or 
restaurant food that has been touched by infected employees.

<HEADLINE> Scouts Check Out Royals' Appier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAINES CITY, Fla. (AP) -- They're checking out Kevin Appier the  
way a careful buyer studies a used car. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mets were there Wednesday, kicking his tires so to  
speak. So were the Houston Astros, and the Baltimore Orioles, and 
the Boston Red Sox and the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, a dozen major league teams had scouts watching  
Wednesday, paying very close attention to the one-time ace 
right-hander who is coming off shoulder surgery and is very much 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	In his second impressive start of the spring, the 31-year-old  
right-hander allowed one hit in three shutout innings against the 
Los Angeles Dodgers, striking out two and giving every indication 
he's fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of batters did make solid contact. Gary Sheffield sent  
center fielder Carlos Beltran almost to the wall in the first 
inning and Angel Pena hit a pretty good shot to left in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	But all in all, it was a very good audition for Appier, whose  
$4.8 million salary the cash-strapped Royals are eager to unload. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two guys hit balls hard, but I'm a little bit ahead of where  
I'd usually be at this time because instead of just refining my arm 
speed, just getting it back,'' said Appier, a notoriously slow 
starter in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to actually create arm speed this year, so I'm a little  
further along on endurance. I think I'll probably gain some 
velocity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In five innings this spring, Appier has given up just two hits  
and one walk. 
</P>
<P>
	The shoulder, injured during a fall after the 1997 season, is  
pain free. He underwent the surgery almost exactly a year ago and 
made just three appearances with the major league club in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels better than it has in years,'' he said. ``I threw the  
slider for the first time today and it felt pretty good. I was 
keeping the ball down better. I had better control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia, Cleveland, Toronto, Anaheim, Pittsburgh, Oakland  
and the Los Angeles Dodgers were among those who sent scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Appier was Kansas City's opening day starter from 1991-97 and  
ranks among the club's career top 10 with 105 wins, a 3.34 ERA, 247 
starts, 31 complete games and 10 shutouts. His 1,373 strikeouts are 
the club record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'll get traded because all the rumors are out  
there,'' Appier said. ``But there's a possibility of not being 
traded because I've heard things aren't progressing. I've heard a 
lot of different things. I might go. I might stay.''

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Could Be Getting to Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Perhaps Evander Holyfield's insistence that he  
will knock out Lennox Lewis in the third round Saturday night is 
beginning to get to Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps that was Holyfield's purpose.  
</P>
<P>
	``I do look at that as an insult,'' Lewis said. ``For me, he's  
going to wake up and apologize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Holyfield, WBA-IBF champion, and the 33-year-old  
Lewis, WBC champion, will fight Saturday night in a soldout Madison 
Square Garden in what Lewis calls a match ``between the two best 
heavyweights on the planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield was a slight favorite to win the pay-per-view (TVKO)  
fight. At the Caesars Palace Race &AMP; Sports Book in Las Vegas, you 
had to bet $150 on him to win $120. If you liked Lewis, you bet 
$100 to win $120. 
</P>
<P>
	The odds Wednesday on Holyfield winning by a third-round  
knockout were 22-1. It was 30-1 Lewis would win by a third-round 
KO. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is going to say something like that, he'd better try and  
live up to it,'' Lewis said Wednesday at the final pre-fight news 
conference. ``I definitely will be there in the third round. It 
will be something he's said again that he's not going to live up 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The third round is my best round,'' Holyfield said. ``My first  
round and my second round aren't bad either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, a born again Christian, publicly acknowledged in  
September that five of his nine children were born out of wedlock, 
and Lewis has called him a hypocrite. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, a former cruiserweight champion, won the undisputed  
title by knocking out James ``Buster'' Douglas in the third round 
Oct. 25, 1990. He also won his rematch with Tyson in three rounds 
but that's when Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield's ears. 
In 21 fights as a heavyweight, Holyfield's only other win in three 
rounds or less was a second-round knockout of Adilson Rodrigues 
July 15, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Lewis' 34 victories, 15 have been in three rounds or less.  
One of them was a second-round disqualification in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, however, has had problems in the early rounds. He was  
knocked out in the second round by Oliver McCall Sept. 24, 1994, 
and he was serious trouble in the first round, but then stopped 
Shannon Briggs in the fifth round last March 28. He also lost three 
of the first four rounds on two official cards in his seventh-round 
win over Frank Bruno Oct. 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lewis will have to be careful against the aggressive  
Holyfield in the early rounds, there are those who also question 
his stamina. He has been as far as 10 rounds twice and he also has 
gone 12 rounds twice. Holyfield has gone 12 rounds seven times, but 
he lost two of those fights. He went into 11th round to win the WBA 
title from Tyson Nov. 9, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for a tough, brutal fight,'' said Emanuel  
Steward, who trains the 6-foot-5 Lewis and who trained Holyfield 
for his one win in three fights against the 6-5 Riddick Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
	``After five rounds, it will become a battle of wills,'' said  
Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis is expected to weigh-in Thursday at about 245 pounds and  
outweigh the 6-2 1/2 Holyfield by almost 30 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Great: I Have Brain Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster  
said Wednesday that a brain injury suffered during 17 years of 
professional football explained the bizarre recent charge that he 
passed a forged Ritalin prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know how severe the damage was until November of last  
year,'' said Webster, who read from a prepared statement and did 
not take questions during a news conference at a Pittsburgh hotel. 
``I would never intentionally let any of you down or cause you any 
pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webster, a member of four Super Bowl champion teams, looked fit  
but vulnerable in a tie and sports jacket and dabbed at tears as he 
apologized to family, friends, fans and former teammates for any 
embarrassment caused by the Ritalin charge. It was filed last month 
in Beaver County, near his Monaca home just west of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in  
1997, had refused help for recurring financial and health problems 
since retiring from the NFL in 1990. He was homeless for a time in 
the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster, so tough he insisted on short-sleeved jerseys even  
during the bitter cold of winter games in Pittsburgh, said pride 
and arrogance prevented him from recognizing the symptoms of his 
brain injury. He said he now welcomed assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	He showed off his four Super Bowl rings and his Hall of Fame  
ring, joking that they would be for sale soon. Then he said he 
wanted to dispel rumors that he had sold the rings to get out of 
financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster was accompanied by former Steelers teammates Mel Blount,  
Rocky Bleier and Randy Grossman, as well as lawyers and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The repeated head trauma has caused damage to my brain and  
thought processes,'' said Webster, known as Iron Mike during his 
career for his ability to absorb punishment and still play 10 years 
without missing a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do promise you this -- no matter what happens, I will answer  
the charges, I will pay my debt to society, whatever it is claimed 
to be,'' Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Vodvarka of Trinity East and West Hospital in  
Steubenville, Ohio, said Webster has a medical condition that 
required the use of Ritalin. Neither Webster's doctors nor his 
lawyers would explain why Webster sought the drug with 
prescriptions that were allegedly forged. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodvarka declined to name Webster's condition but said it was a  
cognitive dysfunction brought on by repeated blows to the head 
during the center's long career. He said he is treating other 
professional football players from Webster's era who seem to be 
suffering from the same affliction. He declined to name them. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodvarka and another of Webster's doctors, Dr. Fred Krieg of  
Parkersburg and Wheeling in West Virginia, said that the injury 
interferes with Webster's judgment, memory and attention span. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodvarka said Webster would get progressively worse, possibly  
experiencing a type of dementia as time passes. He wouldn't say how 
soon that might happen, but said it could happen quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can pretty well assume it's going to progress in a rapid  
manner,'' Vodvarka said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bleier said Webster probably played some days when he shouldn't  
have, but said other players did too. He emphasized that Webster 
didn't blame football or the Steelers for his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're there, you want to play and there's that iron man  
mentality. You don't want to sit on the bench. You want to strap it 
on and play. Ultimately, that takes its toll,'' Bleier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blount said Steelers from the Super Bowl teams in the 1970s  
always thought of themselves as a family as much as a team, and 
were anxious to help Webster, a man most looked to as their anchor 
during difficult contests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to make sure he gets the best medical treatment he  
can get, but at the same time, show that his teammates support him. 
We love him and want to reach out and help him,'' Blount said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Opposition Group's Aid Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite strong support on Capitol Hill for  
funneling military aid directly to Iraqi opposition groups, the 
Clinton administration still hasn't released any of the $97 million 
Congress provided for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi groups are divided and the administration is  
proceeding cautiously -- too cautiously, critics suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as it is being pulled by the Republican-led Congress to do  
more to punish Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the administration 
is seeing cracks developing among U.S. partners in the region 
concerned that the United States may be doing too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not wish to see Iraq bombed daily,'' the foreign  
minister of Qatar, a moderate ally in the Gulf region, said at a 
joint news conference on Tuesday with Defense Secretary William 
Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Turkey has expressed misgivings about providing  
assistance to the Iraqi opposition because of its own Kurdish 
problem -- fearing it might fuel the fires of independence toward 
creation of a separate Kurdish state in northern Iraq and, 
eventually, southeastern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent reports that the White House was planning to hire Kenneth  
Pollack, a former military analyst at the CIA now at the National 
Defense University in Washington, as an Iraq specialist has further 
annoyed administration critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollack had criticized the plan to remove Saddam from power by  
helping to mount a democratic revolution -- including in an article 
in the January-February issue of Foreign Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's stated very openly ... his questioning of the Iraq  
Liberation Act and whether or not that is a plan that will work,'' 
said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., at a hearing of the Senate Foreign 
Relations subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, 
which he chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	P.J. Crowley, a White House National Security Council spokesman,  
declined to say on Tuesday whether a decision had been made to hire 
Pollack. Crowley did say that none of the $97 million worth of 
military aid authorized by the Iraqi Liberation Act of 1998 ``has 
been exercised at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of that legislation are also distressed that the  
administration continues to allow Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, the 
U.S. military commander in the Persian Gulf, speak out against the 
administration's strategy. Zinni has said the legislation could 
lead to ``another rogue state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program, propounding support for an overthrow of Saddam's  
regime, was first opposed by the administration. But President 
Clinton signed it in late 1998 after it passed Congress with 
overwhelming support. 
</P>
<P>
	It required the president to select organizations that might  
qualify for the aid, mostly surplus U.S. military equipment. But 
after Clinton designated seven such organizations in January, two 
of the groups quickly said they did not want the aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't any clear sense of any groups out there where we  
could get a bang for the buck,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden of 
Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that while he recognizes GOP support for the program is  
high, ``this is still a work in progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said he continues to believe the ``most fertile ground''  
for destabilizing Saddam remains with the regular Army. U.S. 
warplanes have hit some 200 Iraqi targets since mid-December, 
clearly wreaking damage to Saddam Hussein and his army. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration critics claim they're tired of the waiting  
game. ``It seems to me that we are hesitating and stopping and 
doing things that are on the periphery,'' Brownback said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Jones, an assistant secretary of state for Near East  
affairs, told him at Tuesday's hearing that the groups involved, 
including the London-based Iraqi National Congress, still aren't 
ready to get the aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want very much to disperse the equipment ... but need to  
make sure we do it in a responsible way, a way the groups can 
use,'' she said. ``We don't believe they are in a position now to 
receive it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So patience is the watchword?'' Brownback asked her.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, not patience,'' she replied. ``It's a tremendous amount of  
talking, cajoling, meetings, traveling around to make sure we get 
the right people in the meetings, bringing Iraqis together who have 
not talked to each other for quite a long time, bringing Iraqis 
together who haven't worked together, creating a genuine coalition 
among the Iraqis who don't naturally necessarily come together.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Sentenced in Fake Cancer Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HASTINGS, Neb. (AP) -- A woman who lied about having cancer and  
duped the community into donating nearly $10,000 for her treatment 
was sentenced to six months in jail and told to write letters of 
apology. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerri Lobato, 34, and her husband, Tim Lobato, 30, pleaded  
guilty in December to theft by deception. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Stephen Illingworth on Tuesday ordered the couple to pay  
$9,023 in restitution and write letters of apology within 30 days 
to each person who gave them money. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 12, 1997, the Lobatos held a benefit in Hastings,  
saying Mrs. Lobato was about to receive cancer treatment in 
Houston. About 300 people attended. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple was arrested in November 1997 after authorities  
discovered Mrs. Lobato was not actually ill.

<HEADLINE> Cher Being Sued by Ex-Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cher's ex-manager wants a share of her  
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Sammeth filed a lawsuit against the entertainer on Monday,  
alleging that he had a deal with Cher to receive 15 percent of the 
profits of her hit album, ``Believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sammeth says he was a close friend of the star for 22 years  
before he was fired as her personal manager without explanation, 
days before she sang the national anthem at the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cher, like many talented creative people, can be stormy,''  
said Sammeth's lawyer, Henry Gradstein. ``The only problem is that 
he is still entitled to be paid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sammeth is credited as manager and given special thanks on the  
album cover, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cher had no comment on the pending lawsuit, according to  
publicist Toni Howard. It seeks unspecified compensation and legal 
fees.

<HEADLINE> Stylist Thanked on Oscar Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On Oscars day, a star arises. She reads the trades, pencils in  
an upcoming lunch with that new agent. Dresses faaab-ulous. Takes 
limo to red carpet. Feels grateful for waterproof mascara while 
making teary-eyed acceptance speech. Thanks the Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	And thanks the stylist.  
</P>
<P>
	Who?  
</P>
<P>
	The celebrity stylist. The latest breed of power player, he  
shops for and dresses Tinseltown's A-list for awards galas and 
other outings peppered with paparazzi. 
</P>
<P>
	The stylist is also the fashion darling of the moment provided  
that, among the racks of Armanis, Versaces, Halstons and Diors, he 
sniffs out the ideal show-stopping gown for his client. When such 
perfection is attained, the public is destined to see that actress 
in that dress, in well-placed photos, endless and everywhere, from 
People to Vogue and around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	While the public may not be aware of the stylist's influence,  
fashion designers court them with front-row seats at their shows. 
TV appearances adorn their resumes. And a book deal, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
	``We can take a designer who doesn't have a name and sort of  
build them, so we're the perfect product placement,'' says Phillip 
Bloch, megastylist and author of ``Elements of Style: From the 
Portfolio of Hollywood's Premier Stylist'' (Warner Books 1998, 
$22). 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch's list of clients includes Sandra Bullock, Salma Hayek,  
Jim Carrey, Lara Flynn Boyle, John Travolta, Jada Pinkett Smith, 
Will Smith, Lauren Holly, Lisa Rinna, Fran Drescher and Faye 
Dunaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to hang out, have fun with my clients,'' says Bloch.  
``I'm not, 'Dahling, it's got to be Gucci.' I don't hang with 
celebs. And when I do, we hang out in jeans and we lay on the 
floor. It's not like I hang out with Sandy. Well, I do but ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all runs smoothly, there should be no anxiety for a stylist's  
clients on Oscars day. 
</P>
<P>
	``She should have nothing to do but slip into the dress, because  
by having the stylist, you're all prepared. That's the whole 
point,'' says Bloch, who is based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``My client might call me to ask what color nail polish the  
manicurist should use. And I'll say, 'I'm just rounding the corner, 
I'll be right there.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody gets there one by one, the makeup artist, the hair  
stylist, the best friend, the manicurist, and I come with the 
dress,'' Bloch says. ``We might joke and gossip about what's in 
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all this sounds like a big production -- it is.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Oscars are the worst, because it's the biggest of all the  
events,'' says eveningwear designer Donald Deal. ``The pressure 
that people put on themselves over a dress! You're going to have a 
nervous breakdown over a dress you wear to the Academy Awards?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not easy for the stylist, either. Beautifying  
already-beautiful people may sound like a cinch, but the 
competition is fierce. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny, but it's incredibly stressful for these stylists  
to make their stars look perfect,'' says fashion publicist Jill 
Eisenstadt. ``What you wear to the Oscars doesn't affect the 
outcome, but there still is only one best dress. Two people can't 
wear it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the lucky designer whose label is chosen, the best dress  
means success. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1998 Oscars, a much-ballyhooed dress was a full-length  
garnet gown worn by Minnie Driver, via stylist Jessica Paster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dress really went on for a year,'' says Randolph Duke, who  
designed Driver's gown for Halston. 
</P>
<P>
	On another occasion, Paster ``literally helped put my client on  
the map,'' says Eisenstadt, who dressed Kim Basinger in a black 
Amsale dress for an awards gala. Eisenstadt is a fashion publicist 
at Loving &AMP;Weintraub in New York. She travels to Los Angeles to 
show stylists the collections of her designer clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kim Basinger was in People magazine in that same black dress  
three times in two months,'' she says. ``That kind of entertainment 
publicity whirlwind is really what helps the designer into their 
own stardom. Within a couple of months, Amsale became a regular on 
the celebrity dressing scene. By the time the Academy Awards rolled 
around, we were well in the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, who now designs his own collection, characterizes a  
designer's relationship with a stylist as a ``love-hate 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be completely blunt about it. If they are  
dressing the star, you have to go through them. You cannot cut 
corners, whether the particular stylist was assigned by the 
actress, studio or agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discovering new designers is only part of the search.  
</P>
<P>
	``As stylists we preview the collections (in New York, Paris and  
Milan),'' says Arianne Phillips, a Los Angeles-based stylist who 
has dressed Madonna, Courtney Love and Natalie Imbruglia. ``A lot 
of the clothes come from designers' showrooms in Europe and hardly 
ever even hit the retail level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creativity is highly valued.  
</P>
<P>
	``My work is usually a combination of designer shows, plus flea  
market and thrift store shopping, whatever it takes to pull it 
together,'' Phillips says. 
</P>
<P>
	For stylists who barter in celebrity glamour, dresses that look  
like a million are the hot commodity -- even if not a penny trades 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows it's all borrowed,'' says Bloch, referring to  
gowns worn at the Oscars. ``But there's something glamorous about 
the idea of it being on loan. For a designer to give you a dress to 
wear; that concept is terribly chic.''

<HEADLINE>  Slick Floor Delays Suns-Mavs Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas-Phoenix NBA game was delayed 70 minutes  
Tuesday night because of a mysterious substance that made the 
Reunion Arena floor slick. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns and Mavericks players warmed up four times while workers  
feverishly mopped the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mavs public relations director Tony Fay said the floor became  
slick ``because of a solvent dropped on it while it was stored 
after Sunday's Dallas Stars hockey game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a joke,'' said center Chris Anstey of the Mavericks.  
``There was one spot they couldn't get up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mavericks president Terdema Ussery said postponing the game was  
no option. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to play tonight,'' he said. ``There was no date left  
where it could be made up. It's impossible because of the schedule. 
We had to play this game even it was midnight. We just wanted to 
make sure it was safe for the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a film on the floor and it wasn't condensation,''  
Ussery added. ``I walked on the floor and almost fell down. Part of 
the problem is that the players were stepping in the compound and 
tracking it around. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a strange one. We don't know what happened. Believe me  
we are looking into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix players used rubbing alcohol to clean the bottom of  
their shoes. The Mavericks just changed shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ussery added ``there's a possibility we could be fined by the  
league office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced that each fan at the game would be given two  
free tickets for a future contest. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been problems with the Reunion Arena floor before. In  
October, 1984 a Mavs preseason game with Philadelphia was canceled 
because of bad footing.

<HEADLINE> Lake Placid Lands Goodwill Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Turner Sports has announced the first Winter  
Goodwill Games will take be held at Lake Placid, N.Y., next Feb. 
17-20. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be competition in seven sports -- bobsled, figure  
skating, luge, skiing, ski jumping, snowboarding and short track 
speedskating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited about expanding the Goodwill Games into a  
winter sports franchise,'' said Harvey Schiller, president of 
Turner Sports. ``The Winter Goodwill Games are a great addition to 
TNT's sports lineup, and they will allow another group of athletes 
a chance to compete for Goodwill Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lake Placid, which hosted the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics,  
beat out Lillehammer, Norway, for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous Summer Goodwill Games have been televised on TBS, but  
Turner's other network, TNT, will carry 16 hours of Winter Goodwill 
Games programming. 
</P>
<P>
	A $20 million renovation project has already begun to rebuild  
the Lake Placid bobsled and luge tracks, which have fallen apart 
since the 1980 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Goodwill Games were the idea of media mogul Ted Turner, who  
began the event in 1986 in response to the Cold War boycotts of the 
1980 and 1984 Olympic Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2001 Summer Goodwill Games are scheduled for 12 days in the  
fall in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It will involve 12 sports 
-- basketball, swimming, beach volleyball, track cycling, boxing, 
track and field, diving, triathlon, figure skating, weightlifting, 
gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics and surf lifesaving.

<HEADLINE> Justices Defend Clerk Hiring Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Supreme Court justices on Wednesday  
defended the court's record of hiring women and minorities as law 
clerks but added there's room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must stand in defense of my colleagues,'' Justice Clarence  
Thomas, the second black to serve on the nation's highest court, 
told a House Appropriations subcommittee. ``I do believe that they 
would love to see more minorities at the Supreme Court in every 
capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice David H. Souter predicted new pressure at law schools to  
see that more high-achieving minorities and women are among those 
recommended for clerkships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are going to see the fruits of some pushing,'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and Souter appeared before the House Appropriations  
subcommittee on commerce, justice, state and the judiciary to 
outline the high court's budget request for the fiscal year that 
begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also is requesting new money for the current year to  
hire 36 new police officers to staff 13 additional guard posts. 
Souter said the request was ``in response to last summer's 
events,'' apparently referring to the shootings inside the Capitol 
last July, when two police officers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court has been accused in recent months by the NAACP  
and others of hiring too few minorities and women as law clerks. 
Clerks help the justices screen new cases, do research and draft 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., asked, ``Do you see anything wrong  
with it and is there any way we can begin to approach it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Souter and Thomas said the justices rely on recommendations from  
law schools and from lower federal courts, where most young lawyers 
serve as clerks before being hired at the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., suggested the justices may be  
relying too heavily on a limited number of law schools, such as 
those at Harvard, Yale, Stanford and the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor had hired more female  
clerks than her colleagues, saying she ``must have reached out. ... 
She was looking for women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said he likes to hire clerks from ``modest backgrounds''  
and those who perform against the odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in law school I knew nothing about clerkships,'' he  
said. ``I didn't know how they were gotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's work that can be done at every level,'' Thomas said,  
adding that as the composition of the candidates for clerkships 
changes, ``so will our hiring rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Souter outlined a proposed $35.9 million operating budget  
request for the Supreme Court for fiscal 2000, an increase of 12 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the architect of the Capitol is seeking $22.6  
million for upkeep of the court building, a sharp increase over 
last year's $5.4 million. That includes funds to plan a major 
renovation of the building that could cost up to $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee Chairman Harold Rogers, R-Ky., expressed surprise  
at the figure, saying last year's estimate was $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Souter said the figure appeared to be a high-range estimate,  
adding that one reason may be the need to address ``structural 
security issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal includes funds for installation of bullet-resistant  
glass as a demonstration project.

<HEADLINE> Teen Opera Phenom Makes U.S. Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Charlotte Church has sold two million albums in  
the United Kingdom, performed for Prince Charles and the pope and 
is being touted as an opera phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a 13-year-old who didn't start performing  
professionally until two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed this in my wildest dreams,'' she said, her  
long brown hair falling over her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte, who has taken the opera world by storm, made her U.S.  
debut Tuesday at the National Association of Recording 
Merchandisers Annual Convention. Her angelic voice, strong and 
pure, captivated 3,000 audience members and earned her a standing 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Her album, ``Voice of an Angel,'' went double platinum in the  
United Kingdom after just four weeks last year. She's in the 
Guinness Book of World Records as the youngest artist ever to hit 
No. 1 on the U.K. charts. 
</P>
<P>
	The British sensation didn't give much thought to singing until  
a talent show when she was 11. Charlotte was supposed to introduce 
her aunt, a professional singer, but stole the show when she began 
to sing. 
</P>
<P>
	Talent agent Jonathan Shalit heard about the young prodigy and  
wanted to get Charlotte a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one's going to spend $10 million on an 11-year-old opera  
singer,'' Shalit said he thought at the time. ``Everyone in the 
industry told me I was nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Shalit knew a sure thing when he heard it. Charlotte was a  
natural. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, three record companies agreed to meet with Shalit and  
his client. Sony Music signed her last year to a five-album deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it's been ``complete saturation,'' Shalit said, with  
her record climbing up the British charts, constant interviews and 
even a television series planned for the young star. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the media attention and fuss over her voice, Charlotte  
really is just a teen-ager. She likes to play computer games, have 
her friends sleep over and loves ``The Simpsons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes traveling gets a bit boring,'' the eighth-grader  
said, fingering her collection of necklaces. 
</P>
<P>
	She has had to get used to being away from her home in Wales and  
having a stylist pick out her clothes and fix her hair. ``I don't 
have time to shop, which is a shame because I love to shop,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After moving the crowd with Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Pie Jesu,''  
it only took a few minutes for Charlotte to shed her red suit 
jacket backstage and kick off her shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	She giggled as a Sony executive gave her a piggyback ride. When  
Shalit suggested Charlotte put her jacket back on, she trudged off 
into her dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awwww! It doesn't really matter,'' she said, looking for her  
jacket.

<HEADLINE> Feds Check Out Exxon-Mobil Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission will closely  
examine the Exxon-Mobil oil merger, especially how it will affect 
competition in the Northeast, Gulf Coast region and California, a 
senior commission official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exxon and Mobil face each other at just about every level of  
the industry ... in many parts of the country,'' especially in 
those regions, William Baer, director of competition at the FTC, 
told a congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously a transaction of this size alone merits our close  
attention,'' said Baer. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon agreed in December to acquire Fairfax, Va.-based Mobil for  
$73.7 billion in stock, combining the biggest U.S. oil companies 
and reuniting two of the biggest pieces left by the 1911 government 
breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still awaits government approval, and federal  
regulatory agencies -- the FTC as well as the Securities and 
Exchange Commission -- testified Wednesday before the House Commerce 
energy and power subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the oil industry is rapidly consolidating, Rep. Tom  
Bliley, R-Va., the Commerce panel chairman, said, ``It is important 
that we take a look at these mergers -- what is driving them and how 
they will impact consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee was scheduled to hear from the chairmen of both  
Exxon and Mobil on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baer said that the FTC's investigation ``is still at an early  
stage'' and no conclusions have been reached on the effects of the 
merger on competition or whether it would violate any antitrust 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the focus of potential competitive problems will be  
in the Northeast, the Gulf Coast and California where the two 
companies go head-to-head in refining and retail sales at gasoline 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Hakes, head of the federal Energy Information  
Administration, told the subcommittee that the two oil giants 
overlap in marketing and refinery operations, especially in the 
Gulf Coast region. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Exxon and Mobil account for less than 12 percent of U.S.  
(refining) capacity, they control 18 percent of the Gulf Coast 
capacity,'' said Hakes. That's comparable to the BP-Amoco refining 
capacity in the Midwest, a merger that has been approved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In retail marketing, the two companies ``have the largest  
overlap in ... the Northeast,'' said Hakes. The two companies 
control more than 15 percent of the branded retail gasoline 
stations in Northeastern states, he said.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Halfway House Inmates Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Law enforcement officials cannot find about  
180 people who have walked away from halfway houses in the nation's 
capital over the past 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics from the office of the District of Columbia Trustee  
for Court Services and Offender Supervision show about 50 of the 
escapees were convicted criminals ordered to live in halfway houses 
as part of their sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 132 escapees were awaiting trial on various charges  
when they walked away. Many are accused of committing violent 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The district's six halfway houses can accommodate a total of 546  
people at any given time. Five of them are run by private 
companies. District officials operate just one. 
</P>
<P>
	A recently formed task force consisting of Justice Department  
officials and local leaders is studying halfway house escapes in 
the district and trying to come up with solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Chief Judge Eugene Hamilton, appearing before the  
district's city council Wednesday, called the facilities absolutely 
essential'' to the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	``These halfway houses have to be administered and supervised  
and run in an orderly manner,'' he said. ``That just has not been 
the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials insisted that the problem is rooted in the court  
system. More than two-thirds of the escapees had been sent to the 
halfway houses while awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief Calls `Fearful' Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The bosses of the biggest sponsors of the  
Olympics have been getting a sales pitch from the embattled boss of 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, in an unusual move to gain  
support for the scandal-scarred International Olympic Committee, 
has called the chairmen and CEOs of several top-level corporate 
backers to pledge reforms in the wake of the Salt Lake bribery 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``He initiated the call to our vice chairman, John Alden, and we  
expressed our concerns,'' said UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg, 
among the marketing officials who confirmed the exchanges 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she did not know of any similar calls since UPS became  
an Olympic sponsor in the summer of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Another official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said  
Samaranch made the calls ``just to discuss the situation 
tete-a-tete'' with the top decision-makers of $50 million sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was made to allay fears'' that the IOC is not committed to  
changes in its membership and operations, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one more IOC member is expected to be expelled as an  
internal investigation of alleged wrongdoing in Salt Lake City's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games moves slowly toward a 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa, an IOC member since 1987,  
will be ousted under the recommendation of the six-man panel, 
Olympic sources familiar with the case told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said  
that a few of the 19 IOC members still under investigation in the 
Salt Lake City case would be exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallwork, never in a leadership position in the IOC, was named  
in a Utah ethics report last month that said his wife, Julia, 
borrowed $30,000 from Salt Lake City bid chief Tom Welch ``to help 
a friend in a serious situation.'' The report said the money, 
withdrawn by Welch from his children's' trust fund, was repaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected expulsion of Wallwork was reported Wednesday by the  
Chicago Tribune and confirmed by sources to the AP. At least two 
international newsletters that report on the Olympics also said 
Wallwork would be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC commission, headed by vice president Dick Pound of  
Canada, was still working on its report Wednesday, and it was 
uncertain when it would make its recommendations to the ruling 
executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound was unavailable for comment, with telephone messages left  
at his Montreal office not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	But another commission member, Jacques Rogge of Belgium, said  
the report might not come until next Monday, when the executive 
board meets in Lausanne, Switzerland, prior to a special IOC 
general assembly dealing with the Olympics' worst corruption 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pound commission's initial phase ended in January, with nine  
members expelled or resigning and another three under 
investigation, including South Korean executive board member Kim 
Un-yong, the highest ranking IOC delegate implicated so far. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word on whether the commission has decided Kim's  
fate on allegations that he used Olympic connections to help secure 
lucrative jobs for his children in broadcasting and entertainment . 
</P>
<P>
	Another high-profile case, meanwhile, appeared to be headed for  
no more than a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Coles, an IOC member from Australia, was expected to be  
censured for accepting travel to ski resorts and the Super Bowl, 
the Olympic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing officials said Samaranch took the initiative to  
call sponsors over the last two weeks as he prepared for an 
extraordinary IOC general assembly to deal with the scandal, which 
has rocked the world's biggest sports event. 
</P>
<P>
	The calls were upbeat and filled with pledges to clean up the  
corruption and never let it happen again, according to the 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those called was M. Douglas Ivester, chairman and CEO of  
he Coca-Cola Co., one of the IOC's oldest sponsors. Ivester told 
Samaranch that the IOC must ``modernize'' its organization. 
</P>
<P>
	If was not known if Samaranch called John Hancock president  
David D'Alessandro, his most public critic among the leaders of 11 
corporations in The Olympic Program, the highest level of 
sponsorship of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Samaranch's phone calls came as The Wall Street Journal  
reported that some sponsors were making contingency plans in case 
the IOC failed to make major changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said the plans included scaled-backed Olympic ads,  
replacing the Olympics with sponsorship of other sports and 
possible legal action against the IOC.

<HEADLINE>  Slick Floor Delays Suns-Mavs Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas-Phoenix NBA game was delayed 70 minutes  
Tuesday night because of a mysterious substance that made the 
Reunion Arena floor slick. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns and Mavericks players warmed up four times while workers  
feverishly mopped the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mavs public relations director Tony Fay said the floor became  
slick ``because of a solvent dropped on it while it was stored 
after Sunday's Dallas Stars hockey game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a joke,'' said center Chris Anstey of the Mavericks.  
``There was one spot they couldn't get up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mavericks president Terdema Ussery said postponing the game was  
no option. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to play tonight,'' he said. ``There was no date left  
where it could be made up. It's impossible because of the schedule. 
We had to play this game even it was midnight. We just wanted to 
make sure it was safe for the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a film on the floor and it wasn't condensation,''  
Ussery added. ``I walked on the floor and almost fell down. Part of 
the problem is that the players were stepping in the compound and 
tracking it around. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a strange one. We don't know what happened. Believe me  
we are looking into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix players used rubbing alcohol to clean the bottom of  
their shoes. The Mavericks just changed shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ussery added ``there's a possibility we could be fined by the  
league office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced that each fan at the game would be given two  
free tickets for a future contest. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been problems with the Reunion Arena floor before. In  
October, 1984 a Mavs preseason game with Philadelphia was canceled 
because of bad footing.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drug Gives Parkinson's Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Low doses of an anti-schizophrenia drug can relieve psychotic  
symptoms in patients with Parkinson's without worsening the tremors 
or other physical signs of the disease, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1 million Americans have Parkinson's, a neurological  
disorder that causes progressive rigidity, tremors and difficulty 
moving. There is no cure, but drugs can slow the progress of the 
disease and ease symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	However, up to one-fifth of Parkinson's sufferers develop  
hallucinations, delusions and other psychotic symptoms from the 
drugs used to treat the disease. And most anti-psychotic drugs just 
make the tremors and jerky movements worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, doctors had few options, and drug-induced  
psychosis is the chief reason Parkinson's patients are put in 
nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a study in today's New England Journal of Medicine  
found that the anti-psychotic drug clozapine decreased the 
psychotic symptoms and the tremors, and did not worsen other 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Doses of 6 to 50 milligrams -- a fraction of the amount used to  
treat schizophrenia -- helped the patients. At higher doses, 
clozapine can lead to a fatal blood disorder. Even at low doses, 
patients must be carefully monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Dr. Joseph Friedman of Brown University and  
Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island.

<HEADLINE> Book Says Versace Had AIDS Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An author is defending her assertion that fashion  
mogul Gianni Versace had the AIDS virus when he died, a contention 
that has prompted outrage from his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Maureen Orth, a Washington journalist who wrote extensively on  
the Italian designer's killer for Vanity Fair magazine, said she 
learned Versace was HIV-positive from a detective who was involved 
in the manhunt for Andrew Cunanan. 
</P>
<P>
	The information is published in Ms. Orth's book, ``Vulgar  
Favors: Andrew Cunanan, Gianni Versace and the Largest Failed 
Manhunt in U.S. History,'' which was released Tuesday by Delacorte 
Press. She also alleges police bungled the search for Cunanan, who 
was implicated in five slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the book's release, the designer's family angrily  
denounced Ms. Orth's work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Versace family deplores this mercenary invasion of their  
privacy and the scurrilous assault on the reputation of someone who 
was a victim of a horrible crime and is not here now to defend 
himself,'' the family said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Orth defended her work Tuesday, saying she ``began this  
story way before Gianni Versace was killed and I felt compelled to 
try to unravel and untangle the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Versace, 50, was gunned down by Cunanan in front of the  
designer's South Beach mansion on July 15, 1997. A nationwide 
manhunt for Cunanan ended eight days later when he fatally shot 
himself in an empty houseboat 2 1/2 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Orth says she learned of the designer's HIV status from  
detective Paul Scrimshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Police chief Richard Barreto said he was shocked by Ms. Orth's  
assertion that Scrimshaw revealed confidential information 
protected by law. He would not say whether the police knew whether 
Versace had the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Scrimshaw, 53, retired from the force soon after the case was  
closed. Ms. Orth and Barreto said they don't know his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Orth said Versace's medical condition was relevant because  
he took his clothing empire public even though he knew he was ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was asking the American people or whomever to buy shares in  
the company that the entire creative impetus and really the 
money-making function came from him, and yet he had a terminal 
disease,'' Ms. Orth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunanan, 27, did not have the AIDS virus, according to police.  
He killed four other men in Minnesota, Chicago and New Jersey 
before Versace.

<HEADLINE> NFL Might Bring Back Instant Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a season of officiating problems, the NFL  
is set to bring back instant replay at its spring meetings, which 
begin Sunday in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The new format is what the NFL calls a ``two plus two'' system,  
giving coaches two challenges per game and extra challenges in the 
final two minutes of each half. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plan, which has been recommended by the competition  
committee, will combine elements of the replay system that was in 
effect from 1986-91. 
</P>
<P>
	League spokesman Joe Browne said Wednesday he thinks replay has  
the best chance for approval this year since it was removed seven 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Replay was approved 7-1 by the league's competition committee  
this week with Cincinnati's Mike Brown, a longtime dissenter, the 
only ``no'' vote. It still must get 24 votes from the 31 teams to 
be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The new element is the challenge, which will give coaches the  
right to challenge what they think is a bad call. The referee would 
make the final decision from a monitor on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	If the protest is turned down, the team will lose a timeout. If  
it's upheld, it will not. 
</P>
<P>
	The old element will come in the final two minutes, when a  
replay official in the press box can halt play any time he sees a 
questionable call even if a team has used both its challenges. But 
the referee will still make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Replay has been voted down each year since it was voted out in  
1992, in part because the coaches haven't been able to agree on a 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Pittsburgh coach Bill Cowher, a member of the  
competition committee, said he believes it will get the 24 votes 
necessary for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Several teams that have voted against it in the past, including  
the New York Giants -- who have never voted for it -- have said they 
might reconsider their position. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major items likely to come up during the meetings include:  
</P>
<P>
	--A decision on whether to award the 32nd franchise to Houston or  
Los Angeles, two cities which lost teams this decade. The owners 
are believed to be leaning toward Los Angeles, the larger market, 
but are unlikely to award a franchise to either of the two 
competing groups. However, Browne said things are still up in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be one word or two -- `Houston' or `Los Angeles' ``, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	--A decision on whether to approve the $800 million bid for the  
Washington Redskins by real estate mogul Howard Milstein. Browne 
said the major item still to be cleared up is collateral for a $400 
million loan. Milstein wants to use the team as collateral, the 
league's finance committee doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	--An update on the status of Edward DeBartolo Jr., the owner of  
the San Francisco 49ers. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 
January it was unlikely DeBartolo would have a role in the team in 
1999 after pleading guilty to failing to report a felony and fined 
$2 million in connection with a gambling license in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	--A series of other rules changes. The most notable one would  
encourage kickoff returns by placing the ball at the 25-yard line 
instead of the 20. The idea is that strong-legged kickers would put 
the ball in play if the opponent gained five yards if they put the 
ball through the end zone.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices rose Thursday, boosted by a  
surge earlier on Wall Street. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 81.43 points, or 0.53 percent, to  
close the morning session at 15,561.43. On Wednesday, the index 
jumped 383.30 points, or 2.54 percent, jumping to its highest level 
since Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.42 yen at midday, down 1.12 yen from late  
Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its level of 119.88 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices rose on Wall Street's jump to  
a new record and improved market sentiment in Tokyo, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 79.08 points Wednesday, or  
0.8 percent, to 9,772.84, surpassing its previous record close set 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei has gained more than 700 points in the last two  
trading days on hopes for aggressive restructuring steps at 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism was fueled by electronics giant Sony Corp.'s  
announcement of plans to take over three publicly listed 
subsidiaries and eliminate 10 percent of its work force. This 
pushed up the company's shares nearly 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony issues plunged on Thursday, however, as investors took  
profits prompted by the dollar's moderate weakening against the 
yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 9.25 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,196.72. The 
TOPIX rose 24.96 points, or 2.15 percent the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar fell on profit taking by  
Japanese exporters and U.S. funds, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, the head of the International Bureau at  
Japan's Ministry of Finance expressed hope for stability in foreign 
exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters upon arriving at the ministry, Haruhiko  
Kuroda said, ``Stable foreign exchange is desirable.'' He wouldn't 
comment on specific exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.03 yen, below  
131.10 yen in New York late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.755  
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.670 percent, driving its price 
down to 100.35 yen from 101.04 yen.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Ends Nissan Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG has broken off talks about  
buying a stake in debt-hobbled Nissan Motor Co. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We discussed our options of a potential partnership very  
openly and in a very friendly atmosphere, but finally decided not 
to pursue a participation,'' DaimlerChrysler co-Chairman Juergen 
Schrempp said today in a statement issued after meeting in Tokyo 
with Nissan President Yoshikazu Hanawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company revealed details of what caused the talks to  
fail. The automakers' current joint ventures in trucks will 
continue, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo-based Nissan released a statement saying it would consider  
more limited cooperative ties with DaimlerChrysler while continuing 
to seek out another partner for a broader capital linkup. 
</P>
<P>
	An executive of Renault SA, meanwhile, said the French  
automaker's talks about a partnership with Nissan were continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault chief executive Louis Schweitzer said at the Geneva  
International Motor Show there was no deal yet and referred to a 
March 1 statement in which Renault said Nissan would offer a good 
strategic fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault is considerably smaller than DaimlerChrysler, but has  
ambitions of becoming a more global automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler will neither buy an equity stake in Nissan nor  
pursue an outright purchase of its commercial truck subsidiary, 
Nissan Diesel, DaimlerChrysler spokesman Steve Rossi said at the 
Geneva auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	``A possible relationship would not be as quick to realize as we  
would have hoped,'' Rossi said. ``We'd like to maintain and pursue 
our ongoing integration of DaimlerChrysler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler, which was formed in November with the merger of  
Daimler-Benz AG of Germany and Chrysler Corp. of the United States, 
had been in intense discussions with Nissan for the past three 
months. Schrempp made no secret of his desire to acquire a 
controlling interest in the big Japanese automaker to expand its 
global reach. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nissan is staggering under an estimated $22 billion to $37  
billion in debt, and DaimlerChrysler apparently was unwilling to 
saddle itself with a portion of that red ink while it remains in 
the midst of combining its vast worldwide operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have emphasized that the integration of Daimler and  
Chrysler has utmost priority in our current business activities,'' 
Schrempp said in the statement from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The DaimlerChrysler statement said both parties agreed to  
continue pursuing existing joint ventures between DaimlerChrysler 
and Nissan Diesel in commercial trucks and light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler was believed to have been seeking between 30  
percent and 40 percent of Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-Chairman Robert J. Eaton, who was at the Geneva show Tuesday,  
denied reports that his company and Renault had been in a bidding 
war. ``That's absolutely not the case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton rejected overtures by Nissan when he was chairman of the  
former Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	A DaimlerChrysler-Nissan alliance could have positioned  
DaimlerChrysler to better compete against Ford Motor Co., General 
Motors Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG, which have more 
extensive investments in China and other Asian developing markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton also said that he wouldn't be surprised if there are more  
defections of top American executives from DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	The departures have worried some on Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not surprising to see people leave when two companies  
merge,'' said Stephen Girsky, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter. ``What's surprising is a lot of it seems to be on the 
Chrysler side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Eaton said he expected some executives would be lured away  
by rival automakers in the merger's wake. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been recruiters circling the building for a long  
time,'' he said. ``I don't know of anybody who hasn't gotten 
offers. I know of an awful lot of people who have turned them 
down.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Futures Rise Sharply / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures rose sharply Wednesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, boosting corn and soybeans, on talk the 
U.S. government is considering allowing the sale of agricultural 
commodities to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat rocketed higher on unconfirmed market talk that U.S.  
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger favors the removal of trade 
barriers on farm products to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States in 1979 embargoed most trade with Iran and has  
repeatedly worked to tighten that noose amid allegations the Middle 
Eastern country sponsors terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department on Tuesday expressed hope Italian officials  
would raise U.S. concerns about terrorism during a visit this week 
of Iran's president. But there have been signs of a thaw during the 
tenure of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate Shiite 
Muslim cleric who is promoting greater social, political and 
cultural freedom among his people. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress and agricultural groups have pressured the  
Clinton administration to lift restrictions, but the government 
remains concerned about several key issues, Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright told a congressional panel on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also was supported after the U.S. Agriculture Department  
sought to buy 711,000 metric tons of wheat for donation to 
economically troubled countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat's rally ignited a market that had been trading sluggishly  
in advance of the USDA's latest supply and demand report. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans shrugged off early weakness tied to expectations the  
government would again lower its export estimates for the marketing 
year and raise projections for the size of crops in Brazil and 
Argentina. Corn also moved higher in step with wheat and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery, representing prices after harvesting is  
completed, rose 9 1/4 cents to $2.85 a bushel; May corn rose 2 1/4 cents 
to $2.23 1/2 a bushel; May oats rose 2 1/2 cents to $1.09 1/2 a bushel; May 
soybeans rose 4 1/4 cents to $4.76 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures fell, while lean hogs rose on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. Feeder cattle and pork bellies futures were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell .02 cent to 68.50 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .20 cent to 72.47 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
rose .75 cent to 43.30 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell .05 
cent to 51.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Unveils High-Speed Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amtrak's new high-speed Northeast Corridor  
service takes dead aim at airlines flying the lucrative 
Washington-New York-Boston shuttle route, but the two carriers that 
currently feast on that market don't appear concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are different kinds of travelers and they make their  
choices and we hope they choose us,'' Delta Air Lines spokeswoman 
Kay Horner said Tuesday. US Airways officials refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a cheering crowd of over 1,000 employees, Amtrak unveiled  
the name -- ``Acela''(uh-SELL-ah) and marketing components of its $2 
billion, 150-mph train system that will begin operation in November 
or December. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak says the new trains will travel between Boston and New  
York in three hours -- an improvement of 90 minutes over the current 
trip -- and from New York to Washington in as little as 2 1/2 hours, a 
savings of a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak officials hope the Acela service will be a model for  
similar trains in the Great Lakes, the Gulf Coast, California and 
the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have a product here that will absolutely knock the  
socks off the competition,'' Amtrak President George Warrington 
boasted to his workers. ``USAir, Delta, General Motors, Ford, you 
name it, only Amtrak's Acela will provide a very special journey 
for customers who will travel downtown to downtown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to pledging speed, Amtrak promised an unparalleled  
service. Acela's snub-nosed, silver-and-turquoise trains will have 
business-class seats with audio and power jacks, special check-in 
areas and concierge service, plus dining cars with meeting tables, 
upgraded food and beer on tap. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule has not been set, but Amtrak officials said it  
probably would maintain most current stops, including Baltimore, 
Philadelphia, New Haven, Conn., and Providence, R.I. The railroad 
will also retain its slower Northeast Direct service. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-way trip will cost about $130 to $140 each way between New  
York and Boston or Washington, an increase from the current 
Metroliner fare of $114 but still less than the $199 walkup fare 
charged by US Airways and Delta Air Lines. They are the two primary 
airlines offering shuttle service between Washington, New York and 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak projects that Acela will generate $180 million in new  
profits its first full year of service. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of the Amtrak board of  
directors, said he hopes the next stop for high-speed rail will be 
the Midwest. Amtrak has already announced it will spend $25 million 
to work on a high-speed network linking nine Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar projects are being considered between Charlotte, N.C.,  
and Washington, D.C.; Birmingham, Ala., and Houston; and up the 
Pacific coast. Thompson said Acela should generate the necessary 
congressional support. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we kick off the Northeast Corridor, Trent Lott is  
going to say, `Why can't I have it in Mississippi?' and Speaker 
Hastert is going to say, `You know, I think it's what's needed in 
Chicago and the Midwest,''' Thompson said, referring to Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert.

<HEADLINE> Saudis Say OPEC OKs Production Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUB AL KHALY, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Large and small oil producers  
are close to cutting production to shore up oil prices, a Saudi 
official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an agreement'' that will be reached between members  
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC 
members before an OPEC meeting in Vienna on March 23, the official 
said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments came after the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia,  
Kuwait, Oman and Qatar met in the Rub al Khaly desert for the 
official opening of the Shaiba oil field nearly 600 miles southeast 
of the capital Riyadh. 
</P>
<P>
	The official refused to provide details of a proposed production  
agreement. But a statement issued after the ministers' meeting said 
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar will work ``in intensive 
consultation with OPEC members and outside it to take all the 
necessary measures'' to bring about a production cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important measures will be to deal with ``cutting  
production in quantities to be reckoned with, that will ensure the 
withdrawal of excess supply from the market which will lead to a 
rise in prices,'' the statement said. It did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading after the meeting, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil  
for April delivery shot up 90 cents at $12.46 a barrel in trading 
in London. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude 
for April delivery rose 84 cents to $14.69. 
</P>
<P>
	A glut of oil on world markets, a result of overproduction and  
reduced demand in the wake of financial crises around the globe, 
had depressed petroleum prices on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, average retail gasoline prices last month  
were at an all-time low, when adjusted for inflation. Prices edged 
up less than half a cent in the latest Lundberg Survey last week, 
the first increase since September, to nudge back above $1 a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	But while falling prices have helped consumers, the ministers  
said the large supplies of oil and the drop in crude oil prices to 
20-year lows threaten to curb oil development and investment, 
something that could endanger future supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Low world oil prices have taken an especially heavy toll on the  
Gulf countries that depend heavily on petroleum revenues.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Check Security at Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration plans to  
scrutinize access to secured areas at major airports after auditors 
in a survey of five airports found inadequate safeguards for 
keeping out unauthorized personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next six weeks, FAA officials will look into compliance  
by the nation's 78 largest commercial airports and their airlines 
for controlling secured areas. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of that period, the agency will decide if it needs to  
do ``red team testing'' -- such as sending undercover agents to try 
to penetrate security -- to ensure that lapses have been addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it would be worthwhile to look at the issue of  
access to non-public areas of airports on a broader scale,'' FAA 
spokesman Eliot Brenner said Wednesday. Once the larger airports 
are checked, officials will then look at smaller commercial 
airports, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's security crackdown follows tests by federal agents at  
five major airports. Testifying before the House Appropriations 
Committee's panel on transportation and related agencies, the 
auditors reported Wednesday they were able to bypass secured areas 
and even board the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a high percentage of tests involving airport access  
controls, our successful penetration of secure areas almost always 
resulted in our boarding an aircraft,'' said Alexis Stefani, the 
Transportation Department's deputy assistant inspector general for 
aviation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefani told lawmakers many of the problems found in a similar  
audit in 1993 still exist. For example, he said, undercover 
personnel could enter through emergency exits and penetrate air 
cargo facilities by following airport personnel through access 
control points. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of individuals encountered by the agents failed to  
challenge them for unauthorized access and in some cases, airport 
law enforcement officials failed to respond to emergency door 
alarms. At two airports, undercover auditors bypassed passenger 
screening checkpoints and entered the concourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefani attributed the ``human element'' as the primary weakness  
in keeping unauthorized personnel out of secured areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's inspection and testing of airport security also needs  
strengthening, Stefani said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency sets guidelines and establishes procedures for  
security, while airports are responsible for controlling access to 
secured areas within the facility. Airlines oversee passengers and 
cargo. Airports and airlines together have historically been 
responsible for maintaining security equipment and systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to airports, Retired Adm. Cathal Flynn, the  
FAA's associate administrator for civil aviation security, said 
unauthorized personnel sneaking past controlled access is a serious 
security problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allowing intruders to piggy-back through access doors, not  
challenging intruders on the ramp, and intruders being able to get 
aboard aircraft combine to make a significant vulnerability,'' 
Flynn wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that ``redundant measures, such as guarding the  
individual aircraft,'' could be required if the problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News reported in its Wednesday editions that  
federal agents were able to get through security doors 46 times at 
four major airports, walk around on the tarmac and board 51 
airplanes unchallenged.

<HEADLINE> America West Talks To Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Stalled contract negotiations between  
America West Airlines and its flight attendants' union resume next 
week in an effort to avoid a strike when a required cooling-off 
period expires. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,400 flight attendants, without a contract for four years,  
are free to strike beginning at 10:01 p.m. March 19, and their 
leaders have said they plan random stoppages if there still is no 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	America West has said it might halt operations if flight  
attendants strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Mediation Board, which tried unsuccessfully to find  
a compromise earlier, announced the ``supermediation'' talks on 
Tuesday. They will be conducted in Washington, D.C., under the 
supervision of mediation board member Ernest DuBester. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations are to reopen on March 17.  
</P>
<P>
	The combination has travelers seeking bookings with other lines.  
</P>
<P>
	America West and the Association of Flight Attendants Council 66  
are at odds over salary, travel expenses and more than $5 million 
in bonus pay. The AFA also wants flight attendants to be paid for 
actual work time, rather than the scheduled flight time, which does 
not account for delays. 
</P>
<P>
	America West said it has been trying for two weeks to meet with  
the AFA to resolve questions about each side's proposals. The AFA 
said it would present its offer during supermediation. 
</P>
<P>
	America West has proposed in creasing starting pay from $14.28  
per hour to $16.13, and top pay from $24.41, to $34.59. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is trying to increase wages to close to the industry  
average for the top 10 airlines, which would mean $15.11 per hour 
for starting pay and $39.50 for the most experienced flight 
attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFA says its proposal would increase America West's costs  
for flight attendants $74.5 million over the five years of the 
contract. The company values its proposal at $68.7 million, but the 
AFA contests that figure and insists that the two sides are $16.5 
million apart on a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	America West's flight attendants have been seeking their first  
contract since voting for union representation in 1994. They 
rejected a tentative agreement worked out in October 1997.

<HEADLINE> Exhibit Examines Id, Ego of Shoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pinched and pointed. Flat or phat.  
</P>
<P>
	Women who choose plain pumps or techno urban sneakers are doing  
more than just expressing their fashion sense. They're baring their 
souls, or is it soles? 
</P>
<P>
	``Shoes are one indication of your personality and your mood,''  
says Valerie Steele, author and curator of the Fashion Institute of 
Technology's exhibit, ``Shoes: A Lexicon of Style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 160 pairs of designer and name brand shoes gathered by  
Steele and co-curator Laird Borrelli at The Museum at FIT examines 
``the social psychology of women's shoes'' and will amuse any woman 
who has ever squeezed her square feet into pointed pumps or 
teetered on stiletto heels. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoes are ``like music,'' says Steele. ``What you wear creates a  
sort of mood or evokes a specific set of associations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So let us delve into the id and ego of shoes.  

</P>
<P>
	HIGH HEELS: ``They have considerable symbolism as a sign of  
femininity and fashion, of sexiness and status,'' Steele says. 
They're also bunion makers and back breakers, according to 
podiatrists and chiropractors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Borrelli, whose favorites on display are a pair of  
fire-engine red Gucci's with five-inch stiletto heels, says women 
have always suffered in the name of fashion -- and for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``They make our legs look better.'' Besides, the twentysomething  
woman adds, ``If you have a date, you're NOT thinking about 
bunions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stiletto section, which includes fetish shoes with  
seven-inch heels and many, many straps, is particularly 
interesting, says Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're fascinating. On the one hand they're very girlie. I  
mean, they're ultra-feminine,'' Steele says. ``On the other hand 
they're quite fierce looking. After all they're named after a kind 
of dagger.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	BOOTS: or ``power footwear for the fashion commando.''  
</P>
<P>
	``They tend to be identified with images of people who are  
powerful,'' Steele says. Boots are both aggressive and defensive, 
and when designers add accoutrements like four-inch heels and 
zebra-fur, ``women get the added feeling of sexual power.'' Think 
Amazon warrior princess in high-heeled jackboots. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	SANDALS: Strappy or flat, well-heeled or sparkling, sandals have  
been equated with nakedness since the dawn of time. Steele says 
they fell out of favor in prudish medieval times but reappeared in 
the 1920s and became a favorite of groups like the suffragettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then sandals have largely been associated with leftist,  
progressive-thinking types. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are some sandals that give a totally different image,  
like the pair in the exhibit covered in what looks like jagged 
pieces of barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you love them! Aren't they savage looking?'' Steele  
coos. ``But look, it's just plastic!' 
</P>
<P>
	OK .... On to sneakers.  
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	SNEAKERS: Fans tend to fall into three categories.  
</P>
<P>
	Techno urban warriors (i.e. pierced, skateboarding kids) favor  
``big, clunky, outrageous-looking platform sneakers.'' They are 
different from sports people, who have a pump-up-the-sneaker, `what 
have you done for us lately' mindset, Steele says. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have views that differ vastly from the third,  
back-to-basics, group called anti-techs, who live by the motto that 
picking out a sneaker should not be harder than programming a VCR. 
``They're the `I can't take it anymore so I'm going back to my 
plain white Converse or Keds' people,'' Steele says. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SEX AND SHOES: Why say anything more? Oh, all right.  
</P>
<P>
	This group shows how masculine styles like oxfords and loafers  
have pirouetted over the years into women's closets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Steele is quick to point out that many styles we think of as  
being feminine were also once worn by men. Remember the official 
portrait of France's funky Sun King, Louis XIV, wearing his red 
high-heeled shoes? 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Steele, a cultural historian specializing in fashion, believes  
the exhibit will interest any woman with ... feet. ``Studies have 
shown that a majority of women are unusually interested in shoes.'' 
She says the average woman owns 12 pairs of shoes while those on 
the Imelda Marcos end of the shoe horn have anywhere from 100 to 
200 pairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele is the author of several fashion books including a  
companion book, ``Shoes: A Lexicon of Style'' (Rizzoli, $40), 
published to coincide with the exhibit. She claims she's on the 
modest end of the scale with about 50 pairs of designer shoes in 
her closet. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrelli is clearly a shoe enthusiast.  
</P>
<P>
	``Shoes are delightful as objects,'' Borrelli sighs. ``They're  
precious. You only need to pick up a shoe, hold it, try it on. ... 
I mean, we've all gone into Saks and put on stilettos or a pair of 
shoes that we couldn't afford or would never really wear and 
discovered that for five minutes you can be someone else. Right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahem.  
</P>
<P>
	Reminded that not ALL women are slaves to their soles, the shoe  
mavens were offered proof of anti-shoeites among us. 
</P>
<P>
	The first piece of evidence produced was a grubby, olive green  
flat that had been resoled three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my! Oh my! What a sad shoe!' Steele exclaimed, producing an  
audible gasp. Borrelli tried to be kinder. ``It looks like an old 
friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The owner ``must feel safe and secure in them,'' Steele said,  
her hands still clasped in amazement to the sides of her face. 
</P>
<P>
	Next came a pink-and-white striped sneaker with polka dot trim.  
</P>
<P>
	``If this is an adult person, I think she needs help,'' Steele  
clucked. Again, Borrelli tried to rationalize. ``They could work in 
a country garden setting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never, says Steele, vehemently shaking her head. ``It's  
sub-Laura Ashley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly swiveling in her chair, Steele blurted, ``They're not  
yours are they?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit, which is free to the public, runs through April 17.

<HEADLINE> 13-Year-Old Guilty of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW PHILADELPHIA, Ohio (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy who helped  
search for a missing 5-year-old playmate after the girl's mother 
paid him $5 has been convicted of stabbing the child to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Harris was found guilty Wednesday of juvenile charges of  
murder in last summer's slaying of Devan Duniver. Anthony could be 
held until he is 21. No sentencing date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what malevolence has filled your soul when this  
took place,'' Judge Linda Kate said to an expressionless Harris. 
``I sincerely hope that some time you will find some type of 
salvation because if you do not, your life will be an endless 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kate's words brought a sob from Devan's mother, Lori Duniver,  
who later lashed out at the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed absolutely, positively no remorse,'' she said. ``He  
needs the death sentence. He deserves what my daughter got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Tarin Hale said he will ask for probation and  
will appeal the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Devan's body was found June 28 underneath brush in the woods  
near the complex of townhouses where she and Anthony lived in this 
city about 70 miles south of Cleveland. Prosecutors said Anthony 
confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Devan's mother said the boy joined the search for her daughter  
after she gave him $5. He wanted the money so he could go to a 
tractor pull. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution's case relied mostly on Harris' confession and  
testimony from Devan's friends and family members, who said the 
girl was frightened of Harris because he threatened her shortly 
before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys suggested Devan was stabbed elsewhere and that  
the killer then moved her body to the spot where it was found.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Reps. Eye Mack's Senate Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Sen. Connie Mack's decision to  
retire after two terms has triggered an explosion of interest among 
members of the Florida House delegation in both parties, raising 
the prospect of a free-for-all election next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those taking a look at a race for Mack's Senate seat are  
Republican Reps. Bill McCollum, Mark Foley and Joe Scarborough. 
Veteran Rep. Porter Goss hasn't ruled out making a bid. Nor has 
Rep. Charles Canady, who sounds more reluctant than the others, 
even though he had decided to leave the House at the end of the 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Among House Democrats, Reps. Peter Deutsch, Bob Wexler and Jim  
Davis have all expressed interest in running. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Democratic Rep. Bill Nelson, now state insurance  
commissioner, has also been mentioned as a potential contender. 
Among Republicans, Charlie Crist, who lost to Sen. Bob Graham in 
1998, is viewed as a potential contender. 
</P>
<P>
	There's an added dynamic in Florida that could cause the field  
of candidates to swell even further: More than 60 members of the 
Legislature are term-limited and cannot seek re-election in 2000, 
meaning there's a significant population of politicians looking for 
new offices to run for. One of them, state Senate President Toni 
Jennings, has been mentioned as a potential contender for the 
Senate seat Mack is giving up. 
</P>
<P>
	It's likely that the field will be winnowed considerably before  
next year's filing deadline, and some House members will opt for 
relatively easy re-election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a $5 million entry fee for the primary,'' says Foley,  
remarking on the cost of campaigning in a state with more than a 
million primary voters and five or six distinct television markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, says Scarborough, ``it's going to be chaos in Florida.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Mack is the first Republican to announce plans to retire rather  
than run again next year, although two other GOP senators haven't 
yet made their plans known. One is John Chafee, 76, a moderate from 
Rhode Island. If he runs, he'd be a solid bet for re-election. 
Democrats are talking up Secretary of State James Langevin, 34, in 
a wheelchair since a gun accident that occurred when he was a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	If Chafee retires, though, Democrats would have a strong chance  
of picking up a seat in a state with a strong Democratic tradition. 
Langevin aside, second-term Democratic Rep. Bob Weygand is all but 
certain to run if Chafee retires. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bill Roth, R-Del., chairman of the tax-writing Finance  
Committee, has also been quiet about his electoral plans. At 77, 
he's completing a fifth term. Democrats have been courting Gov. Tom 
Carper, a former House member, to run. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Republicans hold a 55-45 majority in the current Senate,  
and must defend 19 of the 33 seats on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats were stunned recently when two veteran senators,  
New Jersey's Frank Lautenberg and Nevada's Richard Bryan, announced 
plans to retire. They quickly contacted other Democratic senators -- 
Virginia's Chuck Robb, New Mexico's Jeff Bingaman and Wisconsin's 
Herb Kohl among them -- to make sure there weren't additional 
surprises in store. All three offered reassurances they intend to 
run for new terms, according to party sources. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats are courting Mark Shriver, a member of the  
Maryland Legislature with an impressive political pedigree, to 
challenge GOP. Rep. Connie Morella in a congressional district in 
suburban Washington, D.C. Shriver's uncle is Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy, D-Mass., and a cousin, Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode 
Island, is chairman of the House Democratic campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Shriver had lunch with his cousin recently at a Capitol Hill  
restaurant and said in a brief interview the two talked ``about 
life and the meaning of life.'' Shriver added he was ``having 
conversations with people but I don't have it (making a 
congressional race) on my agenda right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the lunch, Shriver has met with Democratic  
officials who are hoping to engineer the takeover of the House in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Kennedy said, ``It goes without saying we're very  
interested in having a strong candidate run in that race,'' and 
said he intends to talk with other potential contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes Ralph Neas, a former civil rights lobbyist who  
lost to Morella in 1998 and plans to run again. Kennedy said he 
doesn't intend to unfairly favor his relative in fielding a 
candidate in the district. But other Democrats, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said they believe Shriver is better 
positioned to make a strong challenge to Morella. 
</P>
<P>
	Morella, one of the most moderate Republicans in the House, has  
triumphed by substantial margins since her first relatively narrow 
election in 1986. Her name has come up as a potential contender for 
the Senate in 2000.

<HEADLINE>  NCAA Will Fight Test Score Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sixteen years after Penn State football coach Joe Paterno told  
the NCAA, ``We have raped a generation of black kids,'' a judge 
outlawed the solution Paterno championed, saying it was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	Scrambling to deal with the latest twist in one of the most  
enduring controversies in college sports, the NCAA prepared to 
hurry into court today and ask for a stay of a decision by U.S. 
District Judge Ronald Buckwalter. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter, ruling in favor of four black athletes, on Monday  
stopped the NCAA from using minimum test scores in freshman 
eligibility requirements. If the court does not issue a stay, chaos 
could result from 302 Division I schools setting their own 
standards. The controversy could even extend to the NCAA men's and 
women's basketball tournaments which tip off this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 64 teams in each tournament have athletes who are  
sitting out their freshman years because they failed to reach the 
requirements. As long as Buckwalter's ruling remains the law of the 
land, those players could play in the tournament without fear of 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsa Cole, the NCAA's general counsel, said the NCAA would  
appeal ``the entire ruling,'' while at the same time preparing new 
requirements that would meet the court's requirements and go into 
effect on an emergency basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are encouraged by the court's acknowledgment that the  
initial eligibility standards ... serve a legitimate educational 
goal,'' said Charles Wethington, president at Kentucky and head of 
the NCAA's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, the judge has not precluded use of the SAT or ACT  
as a part of an initial eligibility rule. The challenge for the 
NCAA remains as it has always been: to develop standards to meet 
that goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cole said Tuesday she expects a response on a request for a stay  
``within a day or two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule, known as Proposition 16, required athletes to have a  
minimum score of 820 on the Scholastic Assessment Test regardless 
of their high school grades. The ruling did not rule out some use 
of the tests, which many educators have long said are racially and 
culturally discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Its forerunner, Proposition 48, resulted from a tumultuous NCAA  
convention in 1983 when a group of reform-minded school presidents 
began pushing for toughened academic requirements. Paterno urged 
delegates to adopt the rule, including test scores, to stop schools 
from recruiting athletes they know are not prepared to do college 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Proposition 16, the 302 Division I schools would be on  
their own in determining which freshmen would be academically 
eligible to play sports. Some administrators and officials worried 
that could create chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means that there is no standard to guide the schools,''  
Cole said. ``Each school will have to decide itself whether a 
student can play the first year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter was hailed as courageous by Temple basketball coach  
John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
	The test score requirement, Chaney said, was ``a denial of  
opportunity and access for youngsters and targeted 80 to 90 percent 
black, Hispanic, poor and disadvantaged youngsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If upheld, the ruling might restore a lost year of eligibility  
to athletes like Temple senior guard Rasheed Brokenborough, who sat 
out his freshman year due to the SAT cutoff and ran up $15,000 in 
debt because he could not qualify for a scholarship that year, 
Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who wouldn't like to get another year back?'' said  
Brokenborough, who said that although he is graduating, he would 
use the additional year of eligibility to pursue graduate studies. 
``I only got to play three years of basketball and I'd like to come 
back a fourth year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Philadelphia plaintiffs, Leatrice Shaw, is now  
competing in track for the University of Miami as a junior, said 
her foster father, Robert Massie. 
</P>
<P>
	Though she practiced with the Miami track team as a freshman,  
she wasn't allowed to compete, said Massie, head track coach at 
Simon Gratz High School, where Shaw and fellow plaintiff Tai Kwan 
Cureton were high school stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Cureton was able to compete as a freshman by going to Wheaton  
College in Massachusetts, a Division III school where the SAT 
minimum did not apply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tai Kwan was president of the Student Government Association  
(at Gratz) and president of the senior class, but he didn't have 
the SAT scores,'' Massie said. ``Leatrice was a member of the 
National Honor Society. She took the test three times. She came up 
10 points short.''

<HEADLINE> Swingley Leads Mushers Into Nikolai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McGRATH, Alaska (AP) -- Doug Swingley didn't let a broken sled  
keep him from leading a pack of five mushers dashing from Nikolai 
to Takotna early today in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, of Lincoln, Mont., drove his team into the Takotna  
checkpoint at 2:14 a.m. Five-time Iditarod winner Rick Swenson of 
Two Rivers was second at 3:56 a.m., followed within an hour by 
defending champion Jeff King of Denali Park, DeeDee Jonrowe of 
Willow and John Barron of Big Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The five skipped through the McGrath checkpoint, where  
three-time winner Martin Buser of Big Lake was resting his team, 
and headed out into the rolling, spruce-covered tundra to Takotna, 
23 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser is used to keeping an eye on other mushers in the  
Iditarod, but this year insists he doesn't care what anyone else 
does on the trail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing it differently this year,'' he said while wolfing  
down a plate of shepherd's pie in McGrath late Tuesday. ``I'm not 
looking at the other competition -- I'm just looking at myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buser was first into the McGrath checkpoint, arriving behind his  
team of 10 dogs at 10:45 p.m. while a shimmering aurora borealis 
filled a clear, moonless sky. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath is about 365 miles into the 1,100-mile race across the  
Alaska wilderness from Anchorage to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	An enthusiastic crowd knew Buser was coming and waited in  
temperatures of 15 degrees below zero for him to drive his team off 
the Kuskokwim River and into the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Camera-toting fans hovered down the length of his team while he  
put down straw on the hard-packed snow and then fed and watered his 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser had blasted through Nikolai, 48 miles from McGrath, at  
5:20 p.m. while other top mushers were still resting their teams. 
Buser covered the distance from Nikolai to McGrath in about five 
and a half hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch Seavey of Sterling left Nikolai about two hours after  
Buser, and he was followed in short order by Charlie Boulding of 
Manley, Swingley, Jonrowe, King, Swenson and Barron. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser started the race Sunday with 16 dogs, and while he  
typically drops six or more during the race, to be down to 10 this 
early is unusual. He and other mushers have blamed the rough trail 
conditions for taking a toll on the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said having fewer dogs at this point won't change his  
race strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't worry about the dogs you drop because you know you  
dropped them for the right reason,'' he said. ``Ten dogs or not, 
you've got to do the best you can.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Might Bring Back Instant Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the NFL, two plus two equals instant replay.  
</P>
<P>
	After a season of officiating problems, the NFL appears set to  
bring back the often controversial system next week at its annual 
league meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	It will come in the form of what the league calls ``two plus  
two,'' which give coaches two challenges per game to dispute plays 
and allows extra challenges in the final two minutes of each half. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, recommended by the competition committee, will combine  
elements of the replay system that was in effect from 1986-91. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Browne, the league's chief spokesman, said Wednesday that he  
believes replay has the best chance for approval this year since it 
was taken out seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was approved 7-1 by the league's competition committee  
this week, with Cincinnati's Mike Brown, a longtime dissenter, the 
only ``no'' vote. It still must get 24 votes from the 31 teams to 
be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The new element is the challenge, which will give coaches the  
right to challenge what they think is a bad call. The referee would 
make the final decision from a monitor on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	If the protest is turned down, the team will lose a timeout. If  
it's upheld, it will not. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final two minutes, a replay official in the press box can  
halt play any time he sees a questionable call, even if a team has 
used both its challenges. But the referee will still make the final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The replay official would also question calls in overtime.  
</P>
<P>
	Replay has been voted down each year since it was voted out in  
1992, in part because the coaches haven't been able to agree on a 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Pittsburgh coach Bill Cowher, a member of the  
competition committee, said Wednesday he believes it will get the 
24 votes necessary for approval. Several teams that have voted 
against it in the past, including the New York Giants -- who have 
never voted for it -- have said they might reconsider their 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major items likely to come up during the meetings include:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A decision on whether to award the 32nd franchise to Houston  
or Los Angeles, two cities that lost teams this decade. The owners 
are believed to be leaning toward Los Angeles, the larger market, 
but are unlikely to award a franchise to either of the two 
competing groups. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Browne said things are still up in the air.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be one word or two -- `Houston' or `Los Angeles,'''  
Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A decision on whether to approve the $800 million bid for the  
Washington Redskins by real estate mogul Howard Milstein. Browne 
said the major item still to be cleared up is collateral for a $400 
million loan -- Milstein wants to use the team as collateral, the 
league's finance committee doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An update on the status of Edward DeBartolo Jr., the owner of  
the San Francisco 49ers. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 
January that it was unlikely that DeBartolo would have a role in 
the team in 1999 after pleading guilty to failing to report a 
felony and fined $2 million in connection with a gambling license 
in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A series of other rules changes, the most notable of which  
would encourage kickoff returns by placing the ball at the 25-yard 
line instead of the 20 if a kickoff goes out of the end zone. The 
idea is that strong-legged kickers would put the ball in play if 
the opponent gained five yards if they put the ball through the end 
zone.

	``It means that there is no standard to guide the schools,''  
Cole said. ``Each school will have to decide itself whether a 
student can play the first year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter was hailed as courageous by Temple basketball coach  
John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
	The test score requirement, Chaney said, was ``a denial of  
opportunity and access for youngsters and targeted 80 to 90 percent 
black, Hispanic, poor and disadvantaged youngsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If upheld, the ruling might restore a lost year of eligibility  
to athletes like Temple senior guard Rasheed Brokenborough, who sat 
out his freshman year due to the SAT cutoff and ran up $15,000 in 
debt because he could not qualify for a scholarship that year, 
Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who wouldn't like to get another year back?'' said  
Brokenborough, who said that although he is graduating, he would 
use the additional year of eligibility to pursue graduate studies. 
``I only got to play three years of basketball and I'd like to come 
back a fourth year.''

<P>
	One of the Philadelphia plaintiffs, Leatrice Shaw, is now  
competing in track for the University of Miami as a junior, said 
her foster father, Robert Massie. 
</P>
<P>
	Though she practiced with the Miami track team as a freshman,  
she wasn't allowed to compete, said Massie, head track coach at 
Simon Gratz High School, where Shaw and fellow plaintiff Tai Kwan 
Cureton were high school stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Cureton was able to compete as a freshman by going to Wheaton  
College in Massachusetts, a Division III school where the SAT 
minimum did not apply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tai Kwan was president of the Student Government Association  
(at Gratz) and president of the senior class, but he didn't have 
the SAT scores,'' Massie said. ``Leatrice was a member of the 
National Honor Society. She took the test three times. She came up 
10 points short.''

<HEADLINE> NASA To Fix Hubble Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Astronauts will rush to the Hubble  
Space Telescope this fall -- eight months early -- to fix its 
deteriorating pointing system. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA approved the emergency repair mission on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are one failure away from losing all science on the Hubble  
Space Telescope,'' said Ed Weiler, head of NASA's space science 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	By splitting the originally planned June 2000 mission into two  
parts -- one in October and the other in late 2000 or early 2001 -- 
Hubble's science program hopefully will be preserved and the 
astronauts' chores will be more manageable, Weiler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had waited until June 2000, there is a very reasonable  
chance that we could lose three, four or even more months of 
science,'' Weiler said. ``This is a rather good insurance policy 
we're buying here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The extra mission will cost NASA $75 million more than what's  
already been budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Hubble's six gyroscopes, needed for pointing and  
stability, have failed since astronauts' last service call, in 
1997. And a third gyroscope suffered a partial breakdown a month or 
two ago and is considered unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers need at least three perfect gyroscopes to conduct  
observations throughout the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the $2 billion telescope would be safe in orbit without  
any working gyroscopes, NASA does not want to risk losing any 
valuable science time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a so-called spacecraft emergency where we're in  
danger of losing the entire mission or the entire spacecraft,'' 
Weiler said. ``You can think of it more as a science emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubble -- NASA's so-called crown jewel of observatories -- was  
launched in 1990 with a misshapen mirror. Spacewalking astronauts 
corrected the telescope's vision in 1993, restoring Hubble to a 
world-class instrument able to see to the fringes of the universe, 
and returned in 1997 to add or replace 11 major parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides replacing all six gyroscopes in October, spacewalking  
astronauts will install a new computer, radio transmitter, guidance 
sensor and data recorder, and fix peeling insulation. 
</P>
<P>
	During their second visit, the same astronauts will equip Hubble  
with new solar panels, an advanced camera and a newfangled cooling 
unit for an infrared camera that has run out of the frozen nitrogen 
needed for observations. 
</P>
<P>
	The four astronauts who will do the repairs have been training  
since last summer and can easily accommodate the early flight, 
officials said. One of the four worked on Hubble in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA will have to rearrange the shuttle flight schedule to  
squeeze in the Hubble mission. Those details have yet to be worked 
out.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs ATM Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee, tapping into  
consumer anger, overwhelmingly approved a measure that would 
require ATM surcharges to be disclosed clearly at teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel voted, 48-1 on Wednesday, to attach the measure to  
sweeping legislation it was drafting that would remove 
Depression-era barriers between banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies by letting them merge. 
</P>
<P>
	A consumer activist, meanwhile, criticized a closed-door meeting  
Tuesday between Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, and lobbyists from the three industries. Gramm discussed 
with the industry representatives how they could lobby senators on 
his financial overhaul bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad he doesn't call us in, to get the consumer  
perspective across to him,'' said Mary Griffin, insurance counsel 
for Consumers Union. ``We wish we had that kind of access.'' She 
criticized the bill's lack of a provision that would require banks 
to provide low-cost, ``no frills'' checking accounts for people of 
modest means. 
</P>
<P>
	Christi Harlan, a spokeswoman for Gramm, said, ``He got together  
with the people who care deeply about financial services 
modernization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sole dissenting vote in the House banking panel came from  
Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill., who said banks could police themselves 
sufficiently in operating automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATM surcharge measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Jim  
Leach, R-Iowa, and its senior Democrat, Rep. John LaFalce of New 
York, was a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	It would require clear disclosure of the surcharges, which come  
on top of charges by customers' own banks for using a machine 
operated by another bank. The double charges would have to be 
posted on the ATMs and on the terminal screen after consumers log 
in. Consumers would have to be given the chance to terminate their 
transaction before paying the surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks already do those things voluntarily.  
</P>
<P>
	But surveys by the consumer organization U.S. Public Interest  
Research Group indicate that 10 percent to 15 percent of ATMs 
nationwide do not.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	March 10  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Times, on moviemakers and copycat crimes:  
</P>
<P>
	For 15 years or more, crime victims and their families have  
brought lawsuits seeking to hold filmmakers or television networks 
liable for copycat crimes -- acts of violence possibly inspired by 
violence on the screen. Each of those lawsuits ultimately failed, 
and for good reason. The 1st Amendment's guarantee of free speech 
is properly broad, and the Supreme Court has permitted restrictions 
only when speech is intended to incite or produce lawless action. 
</P>
<P>
	So it is disappointing that the court ruled Monday that a  
lawsuit against director Oliver Stone for his film ``Natural Born 
Killers'' can go forward. Stone, Time Warner and others involved in 
making the 1994 movie were sued by the relatives of Patsy Byers, a 
convenience store clerk in rural Louisiana who was shot and 
seriously wounded in March 1995. She died later of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony at trial brought out that the shooter and her  
accomplice had watched a videotape of Stone's movie time and again 
before shooting Byers. They subsequently committed a killing and 
were convicted. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, personally provocative, is surely a tempting target. His  
movies, including ``Platoon'' and ``Natural Born Killers'' are 
unabashed in their depiction of bloody, senseless violence. ... But 
to hold him and those associated with him legally responsible for 
the acts that others commit makes about as much sense as excusing a 
murder defendant on the ground that his mental capacity was 
diminished because he ate too many Twinkies. 

</P>
<P>
	March 6  
</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on former Justice Harry A. Blackmun:  
</P>
<P>
	``I fear for the future. The signs are evident and very ominous,  
and a chill wind blows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus wrote U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun, then 80  
years old, in dissenting against his colleagues when in 1989 they 
voted 5-to-4 to uphold a Missouri law restricting access to 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision that day did not overturn the landmark  
abortion-rights opinion Blackmun had written 16 years earlier ... 
in fact, the court in 1992 reaffirmed Roe vs. Wade's central 
premise that women have a constitutional right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the words of Justice Blackmun, who died earlier this month  
at the age of 90, are worth noting because of their prescience in 
today's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The ominous winds Blackmun envisioned have indeed blown across  
America, taking the form of ugly rhetoric fueling threats of bombs 
and anthrax. Deaths of doctors have had a nationwide chilling 
effect on women's access to abortion; doctors perform them at great 
personal and political risk. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 5  
</P>
<P>
	The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, on Monica Lewinsky :  
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial ended the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal as a  
legal and constitutional issue, but the sense of absurdity lingers. 
That, perhaps, is why tens of millions of Americans tuned in 
Wednesday evening to watch the president's ex-girlfriend telling 
all to Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>
	It was quite a spectacle. Monica Lewinsky, was by turns  
telegenic and weepy, apologetic and self-justifying. But beyond all 
that, she was a clear product of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, if Ms. Lewinsky hadn't talked so much about her  
parents, you might have thought she had sprung spontaneously from 
the silliest, undercurrents of today's popular culture. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Having shown her undergarment to the leader of the free world  
and described the gesture three years later as ``small'' and 
``subtle,'' Ms. Lewinsky might still need a reality check. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ms. Lewinsky seemed clued-in enough to recognize the  
preposterousness of her own situation. ... 
</P>
<P>
	All the elements of 1990s self-absorption were there:  
self-exploration, self-revelation and self-deprecating humor. Ms. 
Lewinsky's underlying message Wednesday night was, ``Isn't everyone 
fascinated by me?'' And, embarrassingly enough, we are. 
</P>
<P>
	March 8  
</P>
<P>
	Akron Beacon Journal, on Supreme Court and schools:  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court seems to have the same view of public  
schools as the rest of society: If there's a problem, the schools 
should handle it. 
</P>
<P>
	After a while, the costs of such fixes stretch school budgets,  
and needed dollars struggle to reach the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Wednesday's high court ruling increases that strain by  
requiring public schools to pay for specialized, expensive, 
one-on-one nursing care for severely disabled students. 
</P>
<P>
	No one suggests that severely disabled children be kept at home,  
in isolation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if we keep foisting on individual districts the  
responsibility to underwrite all such specialized costs, districts 
could find they must cut education programs in order to make ends 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, all children lose.  

</P>
<P>
	March 8:  
</P>
<P>
	The News-Journal of Daytona Beach, Fla., on land mines:  
</P>
<P>
	As delegations from 133 nations gathered last week in Geneva to  
celebrate the inaugural of the international treaty to ban land 
mines, word arrived that two children were killed and six others 
seriously wounded when a land mine exploded in northern Rwanda. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Conspicuously absent from the Geneva ceremony was a delegation  
from the United States. No American should feel comfortable. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of millions of anti-personnel land mines (are) planted  
worldwide. ... In peacetime they kill and maim far more civilians, 
especially children, than combatants. Land mines were the leading 
cause of U.S. casualties in the Vietnam War. ... During the Korean 
War, more American land-mine casualties were caused by U.S. 
defensive minefields than by the enemy's mines. ... 
</P>
<P>
	If such tragedy is ever to be reduced or eliminated, the effort  
will have to include the leadership of the globe's only remaining 
superpower. 

</P>
<P>
	March 10  
</P>
<P>
	Newsday, Long Island, N.Y., on Medicare:  
</P>
<P>
	With the Washington spotlight on Social Security and tax cuts,  
Medicare is getting all the attention of a bit player who arrives 
at a theater just as Madonna and Leonardo DiCaprio step into a 
swarm of paparazzi. That's too bad. Medicare, like the anonymous 
extra, could use the buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old health insurance program for the elderly will  
dip into the red in 2008, even before it is hit by a tidal wave of 
baby boomer retirements. As the Commission on the Future of 
Medicare works toward a salvage plan, some things are clear: The 
time for reform is now. An accelerated moved into managed care is 
inevitable, but fee-for-service should remain an option for current 
recipients. And a prescription drug benefit is desirable, but it 
could break the bank. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 4  
</P>
<P>
	The Sun, Lowell, Mass., on the 2000 presidential campaign:  
</P>
<P>
	If you take a gander at your calendar, you will find that the  
month is March and the year is 1999, quite a distance from the 
presidential election in November 2000. But there is money to 
raise, there are organizations to put in place, there are crowds to 
excite. ... 
</P>
<P>
	George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, said that, while he would  
shortly announce the official formation of an exploratory 
committee, he would not make a final decision about running until 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hesitancy, virtually everyone assumes he's a  
candidate, and not a few of these people, especially Bush's fellow 
GOP governors, are rallying around him and cheering him on. The 
hope, apparently, is to help him achieve an insurmountable 
advantage now and thus thwart internecine bloodletting later. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a strategy with risks. It's true that Bush has a  
fresh-faced likableness akin to that of President Clinton, that he 
has a famous name, that he seems to have done well administering 
the affairs of Texas and that he scores high in the polls. But, on 
the national scene, he is untested, and the polls of the moment are 
unreliable predictors of the future. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 9  
</P>
<P>
	St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times, on Joe DiMaggio:  
</P>
<P>
	Dying just before the beginning of the 1999 Major League  
Baseball season was Joe DiMaggio's final act of dignity. DiMaggio 
slipped away before the New York Yankees' Opening Day, when he was 
scheduled to throw out the ceremonial first ball. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Known for the grace with which he played the game and lived his  
life, the Yankee Clipper retired from baseball in 1951, saying he 
had slowed and didn't want to deliver less than his best. Through 
decades of retirement, he never showed the world anything less than 
his best. 
</P>
<P>
	You didn't have to be a Yankees' fan to be crazy about Joe  
DiMaggio and the way he played baseball. You didn't even have to 
have seen him play. He was baseball, and you could share the 
legend. As the Yankees' centerfielder, DiMaggio was defined by his 
elegant bearing and his effortless hits and catches as much as by 
his stats. ... 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was a shy, private man who shunned the limelight,  
especially during and after his short marriage to screen legend 
Marilyn Monroe. When she died in 1962, eight years after they 
called it quits, he sent roses to her crypt for years afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	To the very end of his life, he maintained the dignity and quiet  
mystique that defined his years in the limelight. Those are the 
human stats. Combine them with his baseball greatness, and it is 
hard to say so long to Joe DiMaggio. 

</P>
<P>
	March 10  
</P>
<P>
	EL Pais, Madrid, on the restart of Chernobyl's reactor:  
</P>
<P>
	The restart of Chernobyl's reactor, a relic of the Soviet era,  
after not having worked for a couple of months because of failures 
in its different systems is not a decision that only affects the 
Ukraine habitants. It involves the whole world, specially Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of Ukraine justifies the reopening of Chernobyl  
on the country's economical difficulties and also says that nothing 
obliges the government to close the nuclear power plant. 
</P>
<P>
	But everything indicates that Ukraine's aim is to use Chernobyl  
as a blackmail so that the West continues to contribute financially 
and pay for the construction of two other new nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument of the economical problems is real, but something  
as serious as nuclear contamination is no excuse enough to try to 
blackmail the West. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 10  
</P>
<P>
	Le Matin, Lausanne, Switzerland, on French tainted blood trial:  
</P>
<P>
	In the contaminated blood case, the French court of justice has  
given a ruling which is neither one thing nor the other, in other 
words unsatisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
	But it could not have done otherwise, and we knew that before  
the trial began. Why? For many reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, the court itself was open to doubt. This was a  
ULO -- an Unidentified Legal Object -- a hybrid created from 
professional magistrates and parliamentarians, banning the victims 
from taking civil action. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing which is certain is that the three ministers  
concerned never deliberately aimed to kill people. The 
administrative system was never thought of as authorizing the 
contamination of hemophiliacs and those receiving transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	What is unacceptable is the economic logic which put price above  
public health. In this respect, it is close to other scandals such 
as that of Mad Cow Disease. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 9  
</P>
<P>
	Dagens Nyheter, Stockholm, on EU-American trade war:  
</P>
<P>
	Between the EU and the USA a peculiar and silly war about  
bananas is going on. The EU introduced restrictions on the imprt of 
bananas from Latin America. The cause was that France wanted to 
favor banana imports from its formerly colonies in Africa. The 
United States filed a complaint of restraint of trade with the 
World Trade Organization, GATT's successor as world trade's police 
department. The EU has ignored the WTO's judgment. Now the United 
States has introduced 100-percent tariffs on a number of imported 
goods from EU countries. That doesn't appear so dangerous. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The banana war reflects an old and unfortunate protectionist  
tradition on both sides, maybe foremost among some parts of the EU. 
... What's at issue is the WTO's authority. If the EU and the 
United States disregard the WTO's demand to abolish trade 
hindrances, the WTO will find it difficult in the future to 
liberalize trade in agricultural products and mediate an 
international investment agreement. 

</P>
<P>
	March 9  
</P>
<P>
	Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Munich, on Slobodan Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	Slobodan Milosevic has achieved one thing during his more than  
ten years as leader of the Serbian people: He has made Belgrade the 
western capital of evil. The demoralized and impoverished citizenry 
has not deserved this. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond dispute, however, is that the source of all Balkan crises  
in this decade can be traced to Belgrade. The result is that when 
politicians visit Belgrade it is only to threaten. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbians have little room to negotiate. From Belgrade to  
Kosovo and into Bosnia they have adopted a strategy of 
uncompromising refusal. This is dangerous for the region as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
	Few demands have been made of Serbia: They should tolerate NATO  
troops in Kosovo, accept the dismissal of President Poplasen, and 
relinquish their control of Brcko, a strategically important city. 
</P>
<P>
	If Belgrade still does not cooperate, the time of diplomatic  
threat will be over, and the only thing threatening everyone will 
be an emergency. 

</P>

<P>
	La Repubblica, Rome, on Iranian president Khatami's visit to  
Italy: 
</P>
<P>
	Iranian dissidents in exile as well as Italian citizens are  
rallying in Rome to protest human rights violation in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests are not ill-founded, but if the target is Iran's  
President Mohammed Khatami, in Italy on a three-day visit, then 
there is a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Hosting him in Rome, Italy's government officials -- as well as  
the pope -- are not receiving the hangman of repression or the 
champion of an authoritarian ideology, but the man who did his best 
in the last two years to extend civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran's theocracy is still a long way from reaching a standard of  
freedom and democracy which is acceptable for the Western world. 
But Khatami started off in that direction with the support of 
millions of Iranian voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami will hardly finish Iran's liberalization process. But  
thanks to him, it is now possible to start dreaming of a ``spring'' 
of the Iranian revolution. 

</P>

<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on balloon landing:  
</P>
<P>
	Another balloon crashes. Yet again, at some cost to the Japanese  
taxpayer, the emergency helicopters are deployed. This time our 
heroes contrive to ditch in the Pacific. Last time it was some 
Andean peak, and the time before that it was the Irish Sea. What is 
it about these hot air escapades that leaves one's natural 
enthusiasm so -- well -- deflated? It is not that ballooning is 
pointless. So are many great feats of human endeavour. 
</P>
<P>
	No, the problem of the Great Balloon Prang, as a piece of  
theater, is just that it happens too often. Hardly a week passes 
but we are invited to chew our nails as Richard Branson (for it is 
usually he) gives a tense, slitty-eyed commentary into the 
satellite minicam at 10,000 ft, all about how the chemical 
conveniences have failed, or how the wrong kind of ice has formed 
on his titanium cocoon, or how he risks being shot down by Chinese 
MiGs. One has the impression that the ether is pullulating with 
millionaires in their hugely sponsored, ego-sized puffballs, 
alternately ascending like rockets because someone let go of a 
guy-rope, or sinking with vast exhalations into the drink, before 
emerging to give macho, bearded press conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	It is time for the balloonists to realize that the world is not  
as impressed by their derring-do as they seem to think we are. ... 

</P>
<P>
	March 6  
</P>
<P>
	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on China:  
</P>
<P>
	(Prime Minister) Zhu Rongji emphasized that he would continue to  
carry out the `three reforms' of state enterprises, government 
machinery and financial service. But the road ahead is bumpy. 
</P>
<P>
	State enterprises continue to expand their losses. The number of  
the unemployed reached 6.2 million at the end of last year. In 
addition, 6 million workers were temporarily laid off and are still 
jobless. The reorganization of the government will cost another 3 
million people their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Reform creates instability in Chinese society. There were  
reports of farmers and workers taking to the streets in many parts 
of the country. Chinese authorities are wary of the people giving 
vent to their discontent. The government stepped up its crackdown 
on the democracy movement at the end of last year, and Xu Wenli and 
other dissidents who tried to organize the Chinese Democratic Party 
were sentenced to more than 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	It is wrong to suppress human rights. If the people's  
dissatisfaction is repressed, it could eventually explode. Although 
Zhu has a reputation of being an expert in managing the economy and 
of a man who gets things done, it appears he will have a difficult 
time carrying out reforms and maintaining stability at the same 
time.

<HEADLINE> Money for Clinton Museum Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Just days before President Clinton is  
due in his native Hope, Arkansas lawmakers rejected a $500,000 plan 
to make improvements at his boyhood-home-turned-museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sandra Rodgers, D-Hope, rushed from the House chamber after  
the House defeated her bill Tuesday and cried in the Capitol hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want President Clinton to know that they don't support  
him, that's fine with me, I'll try to convey that message for 
him,'' said Ms. Rodgers, her voice breaking. ``I'm just really 
mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many representatives who opposed the bill said it had nothing to  
do with Clinton, but with the source of the money. The project 
would have been funded immediately, instead of having to compete 
later with other projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which needed 75 votes in the 99-member House, was  
defeated 41-8. Most members, not wanting to appear opposed to 
Clinton, either didn't vote or cast a ``present'' vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One representative said he opposed the funding because he  
opposes Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have voted for impeachment, and I think he has  
disgraced our state in a lot of ways,'' said Rep. Jim Bob Duggar, 
R-Springdale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rodgers had hoped to have the funding approved before  
Friday, so she could present Clinton with a copy of the legislation 
when he makes his first visit to his birthplace home. Clinton is 
attending the dedication of the Virginia Clinton Kelly Memorial 
Garden in memory of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum, which opened in June 1997, has received about $1  
million in donations from individuals and corporations. Executive 
Director Becky Moore said the state money would have sped up work 
so that the museum could be part of the national park system. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500,000 would have funded a 40-seat theater, computer room,  
board room, gift shop expansion and relocation of the director's 
office at the tourist center next to Clinton's home. Some of the 
money also could be used to spruce up the grounds.

<HEADLINE> Report Probes Atlanta, Amateur Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A tax-exempt nonprofit foundation supporting  
Atlanta's Olympic legacy has spent only $20,000 to bolster amateur 
sports in the 2 1/2 years since the Atlanta Olympic Games, The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation has given grants of  
$10,000 each to two youth golf programs, but spent almost $1 
million to buy the personal memorabilia of its chairman, Billy 
Payne, who founded the organization more than 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletic legacy for the games has basically been nil, and  
that has really been unfortunate,'' said Dennis Berkholtz, 
president of the national team handball federation, which relocated 
to Atlanta in hopes of benefiting from the city's Olympic legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne, who headed the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games,  
says the foundation has ``an admirable record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It has hosted sporting events and given grants for a multiple  
number of years,'' Payne said. ``The process was interrupted when 
the bid was accepted. Now that everybody has got a second wind, we 
are going to pick it back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation has plans for an Olympic museum. It has a  
collection of memorabilia and archived documents that are being 
held at the Atlanta History Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The two $10,000 grants were made last fall to the East Lake  
Community Foundation for its junior academy and the Friends of John 
A. White Park for First Tee for inner-city kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Both programs were connected to Payne or his board members, the  
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me and a lot of people that their objective is get  
the museum built, and that's a legacy, but that's not a legacy for 
kids and sport,'' Berkholtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne says the foundation has spent much time beginning the  
process of looking into the memorabilia and records. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have spent thousands of hours on the museum feasibility  
study,'' Payne said. ``Those are fundamental and appropriate 
undertakings and ones that we are proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sports activists would like to see more done for athletes.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've already got a beautiful (Centennial Olympic) park, and  
I'm glad we've got it,'' said Steve Kearney, president of USA 
Badminton. ``But what is that going to do for the sports? I'd also 
like to have a gym I could play in and teach kids in. The athletes 
are the legacy.''

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Meets With Yugoslav Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Senior U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke  
began crisis talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
today, pushing for a Kosovo settlement even as Yugoslav forces 
pressed an offensive in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke huddled with fellow Western envoys and ambassadors of  
the six-nation Contact Group before entering the president's palace 
at midday for talks aimed at breaking down Milosevic's resistance 
to a U.S.-drafted peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Holbrooke warned that Milosevic could be on a  
``collision course'' with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are only a few days away from a tragedy of even greater  
dimensions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there has been no hint of a softening in the Yugoslav stance  
in the face of Western threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Army troops and Serb police pushed ahead with an operation to  
establish control of an ethnic Albanian-populated area along 
Kosovo's southern border with Macedonia, and the U.N. refugee 
agency said it had reports of at least four villages burning in the 
hilly areas along the border. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have  
been displaced in a year of fighting between Yugoslav troops and 
ethnic Albanian rebels. Albanians make up 90 percent of the 
population in Kosovo, a province in the Yugoslav republic of 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Kosovo Liberation Army rebels are seriously  
considering signing the peace plan in coming days, the Serb-led 
Yugoslav government opposes it -- especially the provision for a 
deployment of some 28,000 NATO troops to police the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav forces backed by tanks and other heavy weapons have  
been sweeping through villages along the border across from where 
NATO forces are gathering, sending as many as 4,000 more ethnic 
Albanian villagers fleeing, according to the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid workers today were trying to evacuate residents of three  
villages in rocky, remote hills near the border -- afraid to flee 
because of the overwhelming Yugoslav military presence in the area, 
including Serb tanks and armored personnel carriers on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	In the village of Kotlina, surrounded on three sides by Yugoslav  
forces, about 600 people waited tensely today while an estimated 
400 others were in nearby woods. One house had been hit by mortar, 
and aid workers said the Serbs had destroyed seven or eight houses 
near the village the previous day. Several people were reported 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They feel they're essentially trapped in their own village,''  
said UNHCR spokeswoman Paula Ghedini. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the troubled province, there were reports of  
continuing clashes in the northern Podujevo area between Serb 
forces and the rebels, with each side accusing the other of 
provoking the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds more people have been displaced by the fighting between  
Vucitrn and Mitrovica. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is essentially deteriorating rather than  
improving ahead of the resumption of peace talks,'' said UNHCR 
spokesman Kris Janowski in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	Shooting also was reported along the Malisevo-Lapushnik road  
today, and one policeman was wounded, said spokesman Dieter Wulf of 
the international monitoring force run by the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting to the north of Pristina on Tuesday left five Serbian  
policemen dead, ethnic Albanian rebels said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate indication whether the  
Holbrooke-Milosevic talks would run longer than a day, as they did 
last October when he brokered an informal cease-fire agreement and 
substantial withdrawals by Yugoslav forces. 
</P>
<P>
	That agreement, however, has been systematically violated by  
both sides and has all but collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace talks that produced little progress toward a settlement  
last month are set to resume outside Paris on Monday, but envoys 
are trying to win pledges from both sides beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA has indicated it may reluctantly sign the deal that  
gives ethnic Albanians broad autonomy, but not the independence 
they seek. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfgang Petritsch, the European Union mediator for Kosovo, said  
before meeting Holbrooke this morning that the ethnic Albanian 
rebels are ``very, very close to signing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Up to 95 percent is a done deal and they want to make sure  
that their last commander is on board,'' Petritsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	But KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi told the Albanian-language  
newspaper Kosova Sot in remarks published today that chances for 
the rebels to sign are ``50-50.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the KLA signature is still being discussed, and depends  
on an announced visit to Washington by their delegation.

<HEADLINE> Tragedy in Tranquil Chicago Suburb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- In this seemingly perfect American town  
with its seemingly perfect American families, Lois Landgraf was 
puzzled when a neighbor called to say there'd been a horrible crime 
a few doors down. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way,'' Landgraf recalled telling her friend as she made her  
way to the door facing stately Loomis Street in this western 
Chicago suburb. ``There's nothing going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A glance down the street showed her differently. There were  
police cars and yellow crime scene tape at the cranberry-red 
Victorian house a block away. 
</P>
<P>
	When police arrived last Friday, they found the bodies of  
3-year-old Thomas Lemak and his 7-year-old brother, Nicholas, in 
their beds. Their 6-year-old sister, Emily, lay lifeless in her 
parents' room. 
</P>
<P>
	All three children had been drugged and smothered.  
</P>
<P>
	The initial shock was compounded when their mother, Marilyn  
Lemak, was charged with the crime. After the slayings, police said, 
Mrs. Lemak took several pills and cut her arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``She couldn't have done that in her right mind,'' Landgraf  
said. ``Who could? It makes you feel so sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents stopped Tuesday to leave flowers, teddy bears,  
candy canes, dolls, ceramic angels and other mementos near the 
three white crosses erected in the Lemak front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings have jolted this neighborhood of historic homes and  
lush lawns, honored in 1997 as the most kid-friendly city in 
America by Zero Population Growth, a Washington, D.C.-based 
lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Lemak was part of that image, until Friday, prosecutors  
say, when she phoned police to come to her home in the city's 
historic district. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lemak, a brown-haired 41-year-old, was known as a loving  
mother and classy friend, someone who always looked ``put 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and her physician husband, Dr. David Lemak, were in the  
middle of a divorce, though it seemed to be going amicably. 
Neighbor Tom Klingbeil said both parents were attentive and loving 
with their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found a wedding photograph of the Lemaks with a knife  
stuck through David Lemak's chest, as well as a crumpled wedding 
dress on the bathroom floor, the Chicago Tribune reported today, 
citing sources it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Kuhn, a lawyer representing Mrs. Lemak in her divorce,  
said she appeared to be sedated and ``utterly devastated'' when he 
visited her in jail on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuhn said Mrs. Lemak had been having trouble eating in jail  
because some of the food reminded her of her children's favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are overwhelmed and don't know how to react,''  
said neighbor, Edna Steinbock. ``My heart aches for her. I'm 
praying for her and what she's going through -- to have her own 
private hell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not angry; I'm confused. I keep saying `Why?'''  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lemak, who always had a cheerful greeting for a neighbor,  
occasionally worked at Dreyer Medical Clinic in Aurora, filling in 
for nurses who were sick or on vacation, clinic spokeswoman Nancy 
Hopp said. 
</P>
<P>
	She often was seen walking or driving her children to Ellsworth  
Elementary School a couple of blocks from her home. 
</P>
<P>
	A week before the deaths, Mrs. Lemak attended a party where she  
bought $80 worth of gourmet cooking utensils -- a vegetable peeler, 
an apple corer, oven mitts, a kitchen oil spritzer and soap 
dispensers. She was planning her own party, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend, who also attended the get-together, said Mrs. Lemak  
was uncharacteristically disheveled, but otherwise upbeat and 
pleasant despite the fact that her husband had moved out a few 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like nothing was wrong,'' Klingbeil said. ``And that's  
what's so scary.''

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole is expected to announce  
this hour that she is forming an exploratory committee for the 2000 
GOP presidential nomination. Mrs. Dole said earlier that it is high

manager said today, ``and I am looking forward to taking care of 
this problem and getting back to work.'' It was not immediately how

this nation has accomplished since a 1992 peace agreement. Sunday's

<HEADLINE> Wheat Gains, Corn Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures prices advanced early today on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn was mixed and soybeans were 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose mainly in technical buying ahead of the U.S.  
Agriculture Department's latest supply and demand report, due on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans retreated after prices for competing Malaysian palm oil  
declined overnight, suggesting world demand may be weakening once 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn traded both sides, finding strength on continued  
expectations for smaller spring plantings and steady export 
business, but showing weakness amid expectations for bumper South 
America crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.78 1/4 a bushel; May  
corn was unchanged at $22.1 1/4 a bushel; May oats were unchanged at 
$1.07 a bushel; May soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $4.69 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures retreatd on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
live cattle were mixed and feeder cattle retreated.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Julia Sweeney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Five years ago, Julia Sweeney thought her  
life was on the right track. Leaving the cast of ``Saturday Night 
Live,'' she had a new house and a new movie coming out based on her 
SNL character, the androgynous ``Pat.'' Even her divorce was 
amicable. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, as she recalls in her one-woman show, God said, ``Ha!''  
</P>
<P>
	Her brother Mike got terminal cancer and moved into Sweeney's  
house. Their parents moved in as well. Sweeney was barely coping 
with it all when suddenly she had a personal crisis that hit from 
nowhere. Meanwhile, the movie, ``It's Pat,'' bombed. 
</P>
<P>
	A comedian by training, Sweeney dealt with her struggles by  
performing, venting on stage at The Uncabaret club in West 
Hollywood, then constructing a full-length theater performance, 
``God said, 'Ha!''' The show played in 1996 to sold-out houses in 
San Francisco and Los Angeles before a six-week run on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	Funny, poignant and profound, the show was put on film, exactly  
as it was performed on the stage, in the film ``God Said, 'Ha!''' 
now in limited release. It is that rarest of movie forms -- a 
monologue -- just Sweeney and the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Now working on a screenplay and continuing her movie career with  
the upcoming ``Stuart Little,'' Sweeney, 39, discussed Broadway, 
death and her good friend, Quentin Tarantino. (She appeared in his 
``Pulp Fiction.'') 
</P>
<P>
	1. How were you able to maintain the emotional intensity of the  
show night after night? 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney: In L.A., it was a dream. I don't know if I'll ever have  
as positive an experience as I did in L.A. But when I took it to 
Broadway, it was eight shows (a week) instead of six. Plus, I was 
tired of it. Plus, I was older. I was really just performing on 
Broadway. But in L.A., man, I couldn't wait to get to the theater. 
There wasn't one performance I couldn't wait to get to. I just felt 
like I had the story in me I had to tell. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Did you ever make mistakes in the Broadway show?  
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney: I knew the show so well it was getting in my way. I  
could make shopping lists while I was on stage. I would, like, take 
a deep breath and suddenly not know where I was in the show. I had 
to figure it out from where I was standing on the set. It was like 
standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon. It was just this feeling 
of: 'Oh, my God.' But I don't think the audience realized it, thank 
God. 
</P>
<P>
	3. You poke fun at your parents throughout the show. How did  
they deal with it? 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney: They were actually really positive. I almost had a  
coronary before they saw it. They came to San Francisco, and I took 
them to a restaurant and said, 'I'm doing a show. You have to know 
what's going to happen. You just tell me if you're upset to my 
face.' I could handle it to my face. About a quarter of the way 
through (my talk), they're looking at the floor and the ceiling and 
my mom just said, 'Oh, just show it all. We can handle a lot.' I 
thought it was really sweet. They do get redeemed in the end of the 
show. They have a great sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	4. After all this happened, your friend Phil Hartman was killed.  
How did you deal with that? 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney: It's still hitting me. It's so weird. When Mike died,  
you had a whole long time to get used to the idea. With Phil, 
you're talking to him one day and the next day he's dead. It takes 
a really long time to accept it. It just doesn't seem logical that 
someone could be alive and suddenly dead, even if you're me, when 
you've spent a lot of time with people who are dying. 
</P>
<P>
	5. The movie credits list Quentin Tarantino as executive  
producer. What was his role in the project? 
</P>

<HEADLINE> NCAA Ruling Raises Major Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A sign that the apocalypse is upon us turned up this week in  
Overland Park, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice in as many days. The NCAA has been found lacking the same  
thing for which it has smacked many a school. It appears to have 
lost institutional control. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the same thing as misplacing your dentures or  
running over a neighbor's mailbox after a heated argument. Still, 
the two losses combined to make the watchdog of college sports look 
less fearsome, yet just as vindictive as always, not exactly the 
image somebody in the enforcement business wants to be projecting 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a federal judge in Philadelphia ruled the NCAA cannot  
force member schools to use a minimum score of 820 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test as the bottom-line measurement of whether 
incoming freshmen are eligible to play sports. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the men's basketball tournament, its biggest  
moneymaker, the NCAA has a say which teams get in, but not which 
players those teams put on the floor. Can anarchy be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
	``What you have clearly, right now, is no rule,'' spokesman  
Wally Renfro said just before the NCAA asked U.S. District Judge 
Ronald Buckwalter to stay his order. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means you have no consistent, uniform across-the-board  
rule,'' Renfro added. ``That means you have over 500 rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To shake things up further, on Tuesday the NCAA conceded defeat  
in a second lawsuit, agreeing to pay $54.5 million to about 2,000 
Division I assistant coaches whose salaries were capped at $16,000 
for a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
	That litigation dragged on for nearly four years, during which  
the organization stubbornly refused chances to settle for 
considerably less. And yet, in typical NCAA-speak, executive 
committee chairman Charles Wethington described it as a kind of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This association-wide nightmare is over,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the same sense, you might say the NCAA is on a roll -- only  
it's all been downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	Just recently, the organization lost a lawsuit brought by  
students with learning disabilities. Last April, it settled a 
decades-long dispute with lifelong rebel and current Fresno State 
coach Jerry Tarkanian for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Over that time, Tark's lineups included more unsavory characters  
than a year's worth of ``America's Most Wanted.'' But shoddy 
investigative work and suggestions of a vendetta ultimately blew 
the NCAA's case apart. When Tarkanian finally maneuvered the NCAA 
into a Las Vegas court, there was nothing the organization could do 
but throw up its hands and reach for the wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	That could happen again with increasing frequency. Adidas, the  
very powerful athletic shoe and clothing manufacturer, is going 
one-on-one against the NCAA in yet another court for restricting 
the size of logos on some of its apparel. After that, next up on 
the organization's legal dance card is a lawsuit from a 
manufacturer of baseball bats. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of prevailing in courts at all levels, it looks like  
all the bullying and bad karma the NCAA has been handing out for 
years is suddenly coming home to roost. There is a temptation to 
chalk up the organization's increasing woes to an increasingly 
litigious society, but it would be more accurate to think of the 
NCAA as a corrupt cop, arrogant and sloppy after collecting bag 
money for years from the schools it is supposed to be protecting. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, there is something unjust about an organization that  
makes it possible for millions to flow into university coffers, but 
impossible for the ``student-athletes'' who generate most of it to 
get their hands on walking-around money. And there is something 
unseemly about colleges banding together to come up with enough 
``product'' to keep the networks, advertisers and endorsement 
people happy, then turning around and policing one another to make 
sure everybody's labor costs stay low. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent events suggest contradictions like these will be harder  
and harder to defend, let alone control. 
</P>
<P>
	The eligibility standards struck down by a Philadelphia judge as  
unfair to blacks had their origin more than a dozen years ago. They 
came in response to a series of embarrassing news stories about 
star athletes who were unable to read, and others whose eligibility 
was used up without being anywhere close to graduating. 
</P>
<P>
	But almost no one disputes that the state of affairs at the  
moment -- no eligibility standards at all -- will serve the kids they 
were supposed to protect any better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things where we knew something was wrong,''  
said Rudy Washington, who once headed the Black Coaches Association 
and now serves as commissioner of the Southwestern Athletic 
Conference. ``And we tried to get people to listen to us, but they 
wouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a familiar complaint against the NCAA. The difference  
is that now people are telling it to the judge. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> RJR Nabisco To Shed Tobacco Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Food and tobacco conglomerate RJR Nabisco  
Holdings Corp. is sending its cigarette business out on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR said Tuesday it will sell its international tobacco business  
to Japan's largest tobacco company and will break off its domestic 
tobacco operations into a separate company owned by RJR 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come amid rising legal challenges to the tobacco  
industry and falling U.S. cigarette sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tobacco industry is in deep trouble,'' said Ahron  
Leichtman, executive director of Citizens for a Tobacco-Free 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	But RJR said the cigarette and food companies will probably fare  
better as separate entities. 
</P>
<P>
	Its tobacco brands include Camel, Winston and Salem cigarettes,  
and the deals will leave it in control of a food business which 
makes Ritz crackers, Oreo cookies, Life Savers candy and Planters 
nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The $17 billion conglomerate has been under pressure for several  
years from major stockholders to separate its food and tobacco 
businesses because the tobacco is considered a drag on RJR's stock. 
Some investors won't put their money in any company that has 
tobacco holdings, out of either opposition to smoking or fear that 
lawsuits will hurt profits. 
</P>
<P>
	John Maxwell, analyst at Davenport &AMP; Co., said RJR got a  
fantastic price for the international business -- $7.8 billion. He 
said RJR will use the proceeds to help reduce its $9.1 billion 
debt, leaving the domestic tobacco company in a better position to 
compete in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Icahn, a onetime corporate raider who holds about 7.7  
percent of RJR stock, had threatened to launch a fight for control 
of the board of directors to force a quick separation. Icahn failed 
to return repeated calls for comment Tuesday. The deadline for 
filing a rival slate is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR is selling its international tobacco business to Japan  
Tobacco Co. which is also assuming $200 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal will allow us to secure a base for future growth  
overseas and establish us as a global player,'' Japan Tobacco said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The RJR international tobacco business is a distant third to  
Philip Morris Cos. and British-American Tobacco PLC, and its 
earnings have fallen amid financial turmoil in its key Russian and 
Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sale, the RJR board plans to spin off its domestic  
tobacco operations, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., to RJR shareholders. 
The tobacco company will keep its name and will retain its 
headquarters in Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the food and tobacco businesses will be best  
able to achieve their full potential under separate ownership 
structures,'' said RJR chairman and chief executive Steven F. 
Goldstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Importantly, the new corporate structure allows people filing  
tobacco suits to continue to make claims against either R.J. 
Reynolds Tobacco Co. or the renamed RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff would leave RJR Nabisco with an 80.6 percent stake  
in Nabisco Holdings Corp., the food division that also makes Oreos, 
Chips Ahoy! and Snackwell's cookies, Premium saltines and A1 steak 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Mulvey, executive director of corporate accountability  
watchdog Infact, said RJR's moves meant ``the corporation 
responsible for Joe Camel would no longer being operating with the 
same influence on the national or international scenes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her Boston-based group has been encouraging consumers to avoid  
buying Nabisco products since 1994 because of the food company's 
ties to cigarette making. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with lower debt after the spinoff, Reynolds Tobacco faces  
challenges. Analysts expect the steady decline in cigarette 
consumption will accelerate due to hefty price hikes that are being 
used to pay for a lawsuit settlement that is costing the industry 
$246 billion over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government is considering a similar suit to recover  
the costs of treating sick smokers. A California jury recently 
ordered Philip Morris to pay $51 million judgment to a smoker. A 
class-action smokers' suit is pending in Florida and several union 
health funds are also suing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had long warned that simply spinning off the food  
division into a separate independent company would face a prolonged 
court challenge because plaintiffs would charge the company with 
putting valuable assets out of their reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Daynard, a tobacco critic who heads the Tobacco Products  
Liability Project, said that plaintiffs may still protest if the 
company uses the proceeds from the sale of the international 
company for a stock buyback or higher dividends.

<HEADLINE> American Breaks Through in Skiing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- While Norway's Lasse Kjus took a  
small step toward his second overall World Cup title, North 
Americans Chad Fleischer and Melanie Turgeon made the biggest leaps 
of their ski racing careers. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kjus, teammate Kjetil Andre Aamodt and defending champion  
Hermann Maier raced for World Cup overall supremacy, Fleischer and 
Turgeon made their first appearances on the medals podium. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer's second place in the men's downhill helped Kjus  
distance himself from Aamodt and Maier in the chase for the overall 
crystal globe. 
</P>
<P>
	With most of the contenders having already run and Aamodt in  
second place behind Kjus, Norwegian rookie Audun Groenvold squeezed 
into third place and Fleischer into second -- with Aamodt dropping 
to fourth. Defending World Cup champion Maier finished ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of picking up 80 points in the overall standings, Aamodt  
got only 50. With three races remaining, Kjus leads the overall 
standings with 1,359 points to 1,317 for Aamodt and 1,271 for 
Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	Happy for the American but also grateful, Kjus gave Fleischer a  
giant bear hug following the race. 
</P>
<P>
	For Fleischer, the second place did little to affect his spot in  
the season standings, but it's a major breakthrough after seven 
seasons without a podium finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this a long time, so it feels really great,''  
said Fleischer, who placed a surprising sixth in super-G at the 
worlds at home in Vail, Colo., last month, but had never finished 
better than ninth in a World Cup. ``It's taken a long time, but I 
think people become successful because they know what they want. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of lost in the world of ski racing for a long time,  
so it was hard to achieve anything. But now I just want to win. I 
believe that's my destiny to dominate ski racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aware he comes across as cocky and overconfident, the  
27-year-old Fleischer adds to that image with a flamboyant, 
snow-leopard hairdo that he adopted last May. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mindset,'' explained Fleischer, rubbing his hand over  
his short bleach-blond hair dotted with brown and black spots. ``My 
hair is meant to make me go fast, to remind me every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now my dad will have to dye his hair the same way. He promised  
that if I got a podium he'd do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a place on the podium was a long time coming for  
Fleischer, it seemed even longer for Turgeon, who showed unusual 
promise back in 1994 when she won two golds, a silver and a pair of 
bronze medals at the junior world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian then finished fifth in her first World Cup race.  
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Turgeon had been unable to match that result,  
battling pressure, painful shin splints and back problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally a podium,'' shouted Turgeon, who finished third in the  
women's downhill behind winner Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria and 
runner-up Ingeborg Helen Marken of Norway. ``I've waited for this 
day for so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to drop everything midseason, I cried a lot and had  
many frustrations. But a day like today erases all the bad 
moments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon, the only downhill skier on a weak Canadian women's  
team, attributes her success in the season's final downhill to 
newly found peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, there was a lack of communication with the coaches,  
but now the group fits well together,'' explained Turgeon, 22. 
``We've fallen on the right combination of people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a small group, but we blend well together. We're all  
very supportive of each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon also planned to race in today's final super-G race.  
Meissnitzer, who already clinched the overall World Cup title, was 
hoping to add a second crown to her collection.

<HEADLINE> Jones Recovering From Car Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- George Jones is making progress in his  
recovery from a near-fatal car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The country singer was removed from a ventilator Tuesday and  
breathing on his own. He will likely remain hospitalized for the 
rest of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that he's demonstrated very amply that he's made of  
tough stuff,'' Dr. Virginia Eddy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the one hand, he's very sick, he's extremely fragile. But  
on the other hand, he's still doing better than I would have 
expected at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, has been in critical condition since crashing his  
sport-utility vehicle Saturday. He was talking on a cellular phone 
when he slammed into a bridge a mile from his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has recorded such classics as ``He Stopped Loving Her  
Today'' and ``A Good Year for the Roses.''

<HEADLINE> Paper: Microsoft Seeks Travel Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is joining a group of Web-based  
travel agents who will ask the Justice Department to investigate 
possible antitrust violations by the nation's airlines, The New 
York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint will be addressed to Justice Department antitrust  
division chief Joel Klein, who is handling the government's lawsuit 
against Microsoft over the software giant's alleged 
anti-competitive practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft says the two issues are unrelated. A spokeswoman for  
the Redmond, Wash.-based company told the Times the ongoing lawsuit 
``does not prevent us from moving forward with our business 
strategies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's MSN Expedia is one of a number of online travel  
agents upset over the airlines' aggressive online ticket sales and 
the small commissions paid to online agencies. The group contends 
the practices keep most travel agents off the Web, which could 
drive up fares by limiting choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're concerned things are happening in the marketplace that  
are disadvantageous to the online travel agent,'' said Simon 
Breakwell, the general manager of Microsoft's travel business unit. 
``There are implications for consumer choice, and that would have 
implications on price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., estimates that nearly  
$30 billion in tickets and travel-related products will be sold 
online annually by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Three online travel agent associations -- the Interactive Travel  
Services Association, the American Society of Travel Agents and the 
Coalition for Travel Industry Parity -- will file the complaint by 
the end of March, said ITSA executive director Reid Detchon. 
</P>
<P>
	The travel agents' group filed its own complaint last December  
alleging that airlines are trying to control Internet sales. 
Spokesmen for American Airlines, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and 
U.S. Airways declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics Ticket Case Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Six former ticket-sellers for the Seattle  
SuperSonics will get a chance to reinstate their $5.2 million 
damage award against the NBA team, which was overturned by a 
federal appeals panel last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew the three-judge  
panel's ruling Tuesday and said a majority of its 21 judges voted 
to refer the case to an 11-judge panel for a new hearing, not yet 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief issue is whether the team violated federal labor law  
by firing the employees after they complained about the cutoff of 
their overtime pay, a cutoff that a federal judge later ruled 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 ruling last October, the appeals court panel said  
federal labor law forbids retaliatory firings only if an employee 
has first filed a formal complaint with a federal agency. The court 
acknowledged that several other federal circuits have found that 
the law also prohibits retaliation for complaining to one's 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's decision to reconsider the issue ``is good news for  
employees generally,'' said John Widell, a lawyer for the 
ticket-sellers. ``It seems to me that employees who complain to 
employers about overtime shouldn't be fired for doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission joined  
employees in asking the court to reconsider. The EEOC has no 
authority over overtime laws, but enforces other federal labor 
laws, including equal pay for women, that could be affected by the 
ruling, Widell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's managing company, Full House Sports and  
Entertainment, said in a statement that the court's action was just 
another step in the legal process. ``The plaintiffs have won no 
victory,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case dates from mid-1994, when the Sonics eliminated the  
$2,000 annual overtime allowances paid to ticket sales account 
executives, as the employees were called, and stopped paying them 
any overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Employee Laura Lambert said she complained to team controller  
Brian Dixon. She said he replied that William Ackerley, then an 
executive of Ackerley Communications, the team's umbrella 
organization, didn't care about the law and wouldn't pay overtime. 
She said Dixon threatened to fire her if she persisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambert complained in writing to team management, which  
eventually repaid her and the other ticket-sellers for back 
overtime. She telephoned the U.S. Labor Department for information, 
but did not file a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine ticket-sellers, including Lambert and the other five  
plaintiffs, were fired in December 1994 by Full House Sports and 
Entertainment, which took over the team's business management and 
restructured the sales staff. 
</P>
<P>
	After U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein ruled that the  
team's overtime policy was illegal, a jury found that the six were 
fired in retaliation for complaining about the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors awarded them $697,000 in back pay, $450,000 for emotional  
distress, and $12 million in punitive damages, an amount Rothstein 
reduced to $4.18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 3-0 ruling Oct. 1, the appeals court panel said federal  
labor law prohibits retaliation for complaining about a violation 
of employees' rights -- but only if a formal complaint was filed 
with the proper federal agency. The law does not cover retaliation 
merely for ``informal complaints'' to one's supervisors, said the 
opinion by Judge Melvin Brunetti.

<HEADLINE>  Lasse Kjus Wins Men's Downhill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- Lasse Kjus of Norway won the men's  
downhill at the World Cup finals today and took the lead in the 
tight race for the overall season title. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> GOP Expecting Bigger Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to offer Americans the biggest possible  
election-year tax cuts, Republicans probably will delay writing a 
tax bill until new budget estimates expected to show more money 
available from growing federal surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP budget writers preparing spending blueprints for the budget  
year beginning Oct. 1 are hemmed in by their promise not to touch 
Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Honoring that pledge has left Republicans scrambling for other  
ways to pay for next year's tax cut because all of the expected 
$133 billion surplus in fiscal 2000 would come from Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers think they have found about $15 billion worth of  
savings for 2000, a modest start for a tax-cutting package they say 
will total $800 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans believe the tax cut could grow by at least $10  
billion if they wait until the summer -- and the prospect of an even 
bigger surplus forecast -- for the Congressional Budget Office's 
annual revision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll wait until CBO updates this summer,'' said House  
Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, asked when he would 
write a tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., has not  
decided on his timetable. His committee usually waits until Ways 
and Means has approved its tax plan. 
</P>
<P>
	House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, said the  
2000 budget his committee plans to vote on next week will state 
that if CBO surplus projections grow this summer, the extra money 
would pay for lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., is  
considering similar language. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is a bigger surplus, the number is bigger for the tax  
cut,'' Kasich said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how Kasich and Domenici would protect the extra  
money for tax cuts. One possibility would be to require 60 votes in 
the 100-member Senate to use the funds for anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	That would achieve another GOP goal: making it harder for  
President Clinton and Democrats to use the extra surpluses for 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	As before, White House aides accused Republicans of unwisely  
planning to use surpluses for tax cuts instead of helping Medicare, 
which faces financial problems in the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern right now is the fact that they are planning a  
large tax cut, rather than shoring up Medicare,'' White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	By awaiting the new projections, Republicans seem to be risking  
little. In recent years, CBO repeatedly has made its forecasts more 
optimistic, only to underestimate the health of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Many private analysts say the economy's continued strong  
performance -- growing 6.1 percent in 1999's final quarter -- means 
the surplus trend is only upward, although the magnitude is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers should inch up,'' said Ethan Harris, a senior  
economist with Lehman Brothers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	When CBO last week updated its January projections, the agency's  
forecast for the 2000 surplus had grown from $131 billion to $133 
billion in that short two-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican leaders revealed details of their plan to  
ensure that Social Security surpluses totaling $1.8 trillion over 
the next decade be used only to strengthen that program or to 
reduce the accumulated national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is part of their fight with Clinton over which side  
would do more to protect Social Security, the government's most 
popular and politically sensitive program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the GOP proposal, the public debt would have to decline  
every two years by an amount equal to the Social Security surpluses 
for that same period. Using the money for a purpose other than 
Social Security would require 60 Senate votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to locking away every penny of the Social  
Security trust fund surpluses for our nation's elderly,'' said 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	With Social Security facing fiscal pressures from the impending  
retirement of baby boomers, the White House's Toiv said the GOP 
plan does not extend Social Security's solvency ``by even one 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said Clinton's plan for helping Social Security  
doesn't extend its life either.

<HEADLINE> Carreras Sings Premiere of Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jose Carreras of Three Tenors fame is coming  
out of 12 years' absence from the American opera scene to take the 
title role tonight in ``Sly,'' a 72-year-old opera based on 
Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
	The opera, by Ernanno Wolf-Ferrari, has never been produced  
commercially in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish tenor, who has struggled with leukemia, continues to  
sing concerts that are less strenuous than major operatic roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sly'' is directed by Marta Domingo, wife of another of the  
Three Tenors -- Placido Domingo, the artistic director and singing 
star of the Washington Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	The title character -- Christopher Sly -- is a beggar in the  
first, framework scene of a Shakespeare play, sleeping off a binge 
outside a tavern. A passing nobleman hauls him off to his castle on 
a cruel whim, dresses him in fine clothes and tries to convince him 
that he is a nobleman, suffering from amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone then sees a performance by a visiting troupe of  
Shakespeare's ``The Taming of the Shrew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Sly nor the nobleman has anything to do with  
Shakespeare's main plot, and directors often leave this episode out 
of ``Shrew'' performances. But the Italian Giovacchino Forzano 
turned it into a tragic story, making Sly a poor poet who romances 
the nobleman's mistress and kills himself in the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-Italian composer Wolf-Ferrari made it into an opera,  
first performed in 1927 in Milan and later elsewhere in Europe, but 
never in North America. The composer is best known for lighter 
work, the operas ``Secrets of Suzanne'' and ``Jewels of the 
Madonna.'' Some critics consider ``Sly'' his best serious opera. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Opera has scheduled eight performances at the  
Kennedy Center this month, sung in Italian with English surtitles.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs ATM Fee Disclosure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee overwhelmingly  
approved today a measure that would require ATM surcharges to be 
clearly disclosed at the teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel voted, 48-1, to attach the measure to sweeping  
legislation it was drafting that would lift the Depression-era 
barriers between banks, securities firms and insurance companies by 
allowing them to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole dissenting vote came from Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill.,  
who said she believed the banks could sufficiently police 
themselves in operating automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATM surcharge measure, sponsored by the committee's  
chairman, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and its senior Democrat, Rep. 
John LaFalce of New York, was a compromise. It would require clear 
disclosure of the surcharges, which come on top of charges by 
customers' own banks for using a machine operated by another bank. 
In addition, consumers would have to be given the right to 
terminate their transaction before paying the double charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks currently do those things voluntarily at the ATMs  
they operate. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier attempt to ban the surcharges outright, pushed by  
Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, the House's lone independent, gave 
way to the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bank fees are soaring and bank profits are at a record high,''  
Sanders said before the vote. ``Maybe it's time we stood up for the 
consumers rather than large banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A surcharge ban was proposed last year by former Sen. Alfonse  
D'Amato, R-N.Y., then chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, but 
was rebuffed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common ATM surcharge was $1.50 as of last fall, and 64  
percent of the nation's banks imposed them, according to a study by 
congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee voted along party  
lines to approve and send to the full Senate a bill to overhaul the 
financial services laws proposed by Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, 
and opposed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In its current form, it would face a White House veto because  
Clinton believes the bill fails to protect consumers and would hurt 
community lending laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial overhaul legislation being drafted by the House  
banking panel, by contrast, is a bipartisan compromise bill for 
which the Clinton administration has indicated its strong support.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Urge More Hockey Padding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Young hockey players might want to check out  
better padding before they face off -- their very lives may be at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors on Wednesday recommended that young players should wear  
better neck and chest padding to protect against rare but 
catastrophic blows that can trigger cardiac arrest or strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Barry Maron of the Minneapolis Heart Institute said he knows  
of 12 cases over the last 15 years in which young male players died 
suddenly on the ice after being struck by hockey pucks or fists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not trying to scare the populace,'' Maron said.  
``Sports is safe. But we also need to inform the public about 
risks, even when they are small.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have calculated that overall, about one in 200,000  
school-age athletes dies annually from accidents on the playing 
field. Maron said that he believes many hockey fatalities haven't 
been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Maron, who released his figures at a meeting in New Orleans of  
the American College of Cardiology, said padding typically worn by 
young hockey players does not completely cover the neck, and the 
area over the chest is usually totally exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Routine blows to the neck can rupture the arteries that feed the  
brain, triggering bleeding strokes. Even seemingly innocent blows 
to the chest can cause cardiac arrest if they happen at precisely 
the right moment in the heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart is most vulnerable during the repolarizing phase, when  
it is preparing to contract again. On an electrocardiogram, this 
point is called the T-wave, and it comprises about one-hundredth of 
the entire heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting the chest at this point can put the heart into  
fibrillation, which is deadly unorganized quivering. When this 
happens, athletes instantly collapse and usually cannot be revived 
with CPR. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Adolph Hutter of Massachusetts General Hospital said he  
agrees that young hockey players -- especially those 8 to 13 -- 
should have better chest and neck protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are calling for is very simple,'' Hutter said.  
``Preventing even five or six deaths is worth it. We're not talking 
about changing the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutter said extra chest protection may not be needed for older  
players, since their chests are less pliable. Hutter is team 
cardiologist to the Boston Bruins and a former president of the 
college of cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 12 hockey fatalities compiled by Maron, six resulted from  
blows to the chest, five to the neck and one to the face.

<HEADLINE> Fight Is Big But Not Ali-Frazier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lennox Lewis believes his fight against Evander Holyfield  
matches the two best heavyweights on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	They are -- and their scheduled 12-round bout Saturday night in  
Madison Square Garden is a major match. More than 20,000 fans will 
fill the arena, and some people are comparing it to The Fight 
between Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali on March 8, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Such comparisons are unfair to Holyfield and Lewis. They have  
fought their way to this showdown and should be judged on their 
merits. 
</P>
<P>
	Their fight has many intriguing aspects.  
</P>
<P>
	How will Holyfield be affected by his age (36), numerous hard  
fights and the 6-foot-5 Lewis' size and strength? How will Lewis 
handle the tension of his first super fight? Does he have the chin 
and stamina needed to win? Does the laid-back Lewis have the desire 
to beat one of boxing's great warriors? 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's not The Fight, a match that took the Big Apple by  
the throat and shook it like it hasn't been shaken since. 
</P>
<P>
	It had everything. It was a battle between two unbeaten  
heavyweights. Frazier was the champion, but many people thought the 
only way he could truly claim the title was to beat Ali, from whom 
the championship was stripped for his refusal to accept the 
military draft. 
</P>
<P>
	So it had a real sense of drama, spiced by the fact that two  
fighters were each getting the unheard of sum of $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It also had the greatest publicist in the history of boxing --  
Ali. himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali turned news conferences into shows.  
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most such news conferences today, the fighters did most  
of the talking. When one of the fighters was Ali, a press 
conference could turn into a monologue. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali's points victory over Joe Bugner in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,  
was forgettable. Not so the prefight news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out that the commission member in charge of the gloves  
was a prison official and so the gloves were going to kept at the 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're putting my gloves in jail; My gloves are going to  
jail,'' bellowed Ali. ``They ain't done nothing . . . yet!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even weigh-ins became circuses when Ali was involved. In fact,  
when Ali retired, heavyweight weigh-ins should have been stopped. 
The fighters should be weighed privately, and their weights given 
to the media on mimeographed sheets. That's how interesting they 
have become. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali turned the weigh-in for his challenge to the menacing Sonny  
Liston at Miami Beach in 1964 into an event of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	He ranted and raved and convinced many reporters that he was so  
scared of the man he called the Bear that some of them thought the 
fight should be called off. Liston did not answer the bell for the 
seventh round, and boxing's most flamboyant career was launched. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, The Fight stands alone -- and that certainly is no putdown  
of the Holyfield-Lewis match. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield has helped hype the bout by matter of factly  
predicting he will knock out Lewis in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali would have said, ``Lennox Lewis came from over to sea, and  
it's a long way to come just to get knocked out in three.''

<HEADLINE> Buser, Swingley Pacing Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAKOTNA, Alaska (AP) -- The 1999 Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race  
hadn't yet reached its midway point Wednesday, but frontrunners 
were already saying Doug Swingley looked like the musher to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Swingley's in control right now,'' said Rick Mackey of Nenana,  
who won the 1983 Iditarod. ``He's got 14 dogs, and he's well ahead 
of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, of Lincoln, Mont., steamed out of Takotna at 8:29 a.m.  
Alaska time (12:29 p.m. EST), about two hours after Martin Buser of 
Big Lake, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	He cut 40 minutes off that difference by the time he reached  
Ophir, a gold-rush ghost town 23 miles up the trail. Swingley 
covered that distance in a little under two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley spent only 10 minutes in Ophir before pushing on toward  
Iditarod, another ghost town 90 miles away and the race's official 
midpoint. Buser was still in Ophir early Wednesday afternoon with 
10 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressing forward to Iditarod on his own was the same strategy  
Swingley used in 1995, when he became the first non-Alaskan to win 
the 1,100-mile race from Anchorage to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	That year, others in the lead pack took their mandatory 24-hour  
rest stop in Takotna or sooner. They figured Swingley was going to 
burn out his team. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, many are still doing their long break in Takotna, but  
they're not questioning Swingley's move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his (dogs) are speeding up,'' said DeeDee Jonrowe of  
Willow, last year's runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Five-time winner Rick Swenson of Two Rivers was impressed by  
``how strong Swingley's team appears to be. But that doesn't 
surprise me. This is where we start shaking things out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swenson was third to Takotna, arriving at 3:56 a.m., three  
minutes ahead of defending champion Jeff King of Denali Park. After 
that came Jonrowe, John Barron of Big Lake, and Norwegian rookie 
Harald Tunheim by 6:34 a.m. All were planning to complete their 
24-hour layover before continuing to Ophir. 
</P>
<P>
	Tunheim, who races in Europe and teaches mushing at a technical  
school in northern Norway, has caught the attention of other 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's no rookie,'' King said earlier, in Nikolai. ``He could  
win this thing -- and wouldn't that turn this race on its ear?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to be holding his team together nicely in a  
competitive position,'' Jonrowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	While tending his dogs in Takotna, Tunheim said his plan for  
this year's race was to watch the elite mushers and learn a few 
things. But he hasn't seen much of them on the trail or in the 
checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want to talk to me,'' he said. ``Maybe the  
competition is so tough they have to concentrate on themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tunheim said the Iditarod trail was about how he expected it --  
the surprise was the work load taking care of his checkpoint 
routine and getting some rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe, you get more help to dry clothes and fill up your  
coffee. But here you have to do everything, so it take more time 
before you can go to sleep,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first four days, Tunheim said he averaged an hour of  
sleep a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't sleep much if you want to stay in front,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A tired-looking Jonrowe said she wasn't originally planning to  
take her layover in Takotna, but her 12 dogs were bogging down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could've gotten these guys to Ophir, but they wouldn't have  
gotten there too fast,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vern Halter of Willow said the race's early pace was faster than  
he expected. He fell behind on the first two days, but battled back 
to be ninth into Takotna with 14 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get back into the ball game,'' he said. ``I  
think Swingley and DeeDee and Swenson are in pretty good shape, but 
this thing isn't all sorted out yet.''

<HEADLINE> Buser, Swingley Pacing Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAKOTNA, Alaska (AP) -- The 1999 Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race  
hadn't yet reached its midway point Wednesday, but frontrunners 
were already saying Doug Swingley looked like the musher to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Swingley's in control right now,'' said Rick Mackey of Nenana,  
who won the 1983 Iditarod. ``He's got 14 dogs, and he's well ahead 
of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, of Lincoln, Mont., steamed out of Takotna at 8:29 a.m.  
Alaska time (12:29 p.m. EST), about two hours after Martin Buser of 
Big Lake, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	He cut 40 minutes off that difference by the time he reached  
Ophir, a gold-rush ghost town 23 miles up the trail. Swingley 
covered that distance in a little under two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley spent only 10 minutes in Ophir before pushing on toward  
Iditarod, another ghost town 90 miles away and the race's official 
midpoint. Buser spent nearly five hours resting his team before 
departing at 2:02 p.m. with a slim team of 10 pullers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressing forward to Iditarod on his own was the same strategy  
Swingley used in 1995, when he became the first non-Alaskan to win 
the 1,100-mile race from Anchorage to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	That year, others in the lead pack took their mandatory 24-hour  
rest stop in Takotna or sooner. They figured Swingley was going to 
burn out his team. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, many are still doing their long break in Takotna, but  
they're not questioning Swingley's move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his (dogs) are speeding up,'' said DeeDee Jonrowe of  
Willow, last year's runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Five-time winner Rick Swenson of Two Rivers was impressed by  
``how strong Swingley's team appears to be. But that doesn't 
surprise me. This is where we start shaking things out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swenson was third to Takotna, arriving at 3:56 a.m., three  
minutes ahead of defending champion Jeff King of Denali Park. After 
that came Jonrowe, John Barron of Big Lake, and Norwegian rookie 
Harald Tunheim by 6:34 a.m. All were planning to complete their 
24-hour layover before continuing to Ophir. 
</P>
<P>
	Tunheim, who races in Europe and teaches mushing at a technical  
school in northern Norway, has caught the attention of other 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's no rookie,'' King said earlier, in Nikolai. ``He could  
win this thing -- and wouldn't that turn this race on its ear?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to be holding his team together nicely in a  
competitive position,'' Jonrowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	While tending his dogs in Takotna, Tunheim said his plan for  
this year's race was to watch the elite mushers and learn a few 
things. But he hasn't seen much of them on the trail or in the 
checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want to talk to me,'' he said. ``Maybe the  
competition is so tough they have to concentrate on themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tunheim said the Iditarod trail was about how he expected it --  
the surprise was the work load taking care of his checkpoint 
routine and getting some rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe, you get more help to dry clothes and fill up your  
coffee. But here you have to do everything, so it take more time 
before you can go to sleep,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first four days, Tunheim said he averaged an hour of  
sleep a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't sleep much if you want to stay in front,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A tired-looking Jonrowe said she wasn't originally planning to  
take her layover in Takotna, but her 12 dogs were bogging down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could've gotten these guys to Ophir, but they wouldn't have  
gotten there too fast,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vern Halter of Willow said the race's early pace was faster than  
he expected. He fell behind on the first two days, but battled back 
to be ninth into Takotna with 14 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get back into the ball game,'' he said. ``I  
think Swingley and DeeDee and Swenson are in pretty good shape, but 
this thing isn't all sorted out yet.''

<HEADLINE> Solar 'S' Mark Foretells Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An 'S' mark found in X-ray photos of the sun  
may forecast powerful solar explosions that can cause power 
outages, block radio communications and scorch satellites in Earth 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists said Tuesday that X-ray solar images taken by a  
Japanese spacecraft show that an S-shaped structure develops on the 
face of the sun several days before an eruption of what is called a 
coronal mass ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	The S-shaped sign, said Richard Canfield of Montana State  
University, Bozeman, can be used as a solar eruption warning 
signal. This would give power companies and satellite operators 
about three extra days to prepare for the effects of a coronal mass 
ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	Current technology detects the solar explosions as they happen.  
This gives some advanced warning since it takes three or four days 
for the explosive wave to reach Earth. The 'S' sign detected by the 
X-ray satellite would add days to the warning, Canfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The X-ray images will tell us when something is likely to  
happen,'' said Canfield, a co-author of research that detected the 
'S' sign. ``It could be developed into a powerful predictive 
tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coronal mass ejections are massive eruptions of electrically  
charged plasma, or superheated gas, from the outer atmosphere of 
the sun. The sudden release of energy can hurl 10 billion tons of 
gas into space at speeds of up to 2 million mph. The energy release 
can equal billions of megatons of TNT, said Canfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Such eruptions happen frequently and usually are harmless to the  
Earth. Occasionally, however, an explosion occurs on a side of the 
sun facing the Earth, sending a massive bubble of energy directly 
at the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Earth's magnetosphere shields the planet from most of the  
violence, but Earth's magnetic field lines can be charged suddenly 
with a powerful wave of electricity. Such surges along power lines 
have caused blackouts in the past, burning out transformers and 
disrupting service for thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave of solar energy also can disrupt long-distance radio  
transmissions and can damage satellites that are in deep space, 
beyond the protective envelope of the Earth's magnetosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	George Withbroe, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration  
scientist, said the solar storm effects now are only a nuisance. 
Power companies protect their systems from the natural electrical 
surge, and satellites are affected only rarely. 
</P>
<P>
	When humans eventually return to the moon or voyage on to Mars,  
Withbroe said, the ability to predict solar storms could save lives 
of astronauts traveling beyond the Earth's magnetosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we go to Mars, we will have to worry more about this,''  
said Withbroe. He said it is likely that Mars-bound spacecraft will 
be equipped with a shielded compartment, which he called ``a storm 
cellar.'' If Mars voyagers were warned in advance of an approaching 
solar storm, he said, they could retreat to the shelter until the 
danger passed.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Exec To Join MasterCard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup, which is loosening its ties with Visa  
USA, is getting a seat on the downsized board of directors of 
MasterCard International. 
</P>
<P>
	While MasterCard announced Wednesday it was slashing the size of  
its board nearly in half, the credit card association also 
nominated two new directors, including a Citigroup executive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the shake-up, the MasterCard board will be cut to 17 members  
from 31. The new members will be Robert B. Willumstad, head of 
global consumer lending for Citigroup, and Hiroshi Arai, president 
and chairman of Orient Corp. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, Citigroup's two representatives on the Visa  
board resigned in a dispute over Citigroup's plans to build up its 
own credit card brand image at the expense of Visa's. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup wanted to issue credit cards with the ``Citi'' name on  
the front and the Visa logo on the back. While Visa balked, 
MasterCard, which has been losing market share, swept in and made a 
deal with Citigroup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the way MasterCard is restructuring its board is  
going to be more aligned with our strategic thinking,'' said Susan 
Weeks, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect, over time, to issue a larger proportion of  
MasterCards in the United States than we have in the past, but we 
will continue to issue Visa cards,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	While MasterCard is expected to let Citigroup move the logo to  
the back of the card, Weeks said, ``Any decision (about the logo) 
would have to go before the MasterCard board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MasterCard said its decision to cut 14 board seats was part of a  
wider effort within the association to increase its flexibility and 
allow it to respond quickly to the fast-changing economic 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The change in the structure of our board, together with the  
recent realignment of our internal resources, is a strong 
demonstration of MasterCard's leadership, flexibility and intense 
focus on serving our most important customers,'' Robert W. 
Selander, president and chief executive of MasterCard, said in a 
statement.

<HEADLINE> Prostate Cancer Kills 40,000 a Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is second only to lung cancer among cancer  
killers of American men, taking about 40,000 lives annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Most prostate cancer happens sporadically; patients have no  
particular family history of the disease. However, about 1 in 10 
cases seems to be clearly inherited because many men in the same 
family have it. 
</P>
<P>
	There were an estimated 179,300 new cases of prostate cancer in  
the United States last year. More than 75 percent of all cases are 
diagnosed in men older than 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the symptoms of prostate cancer include interrupted  
urine flow or the inability to urinate, the need to urinate 
frequently, blood in the urine, continuing pain in the lower back, 
pelvis or upper thighs. 
</P>
<P>
	The method of treatment depends on age, stage of the cancer and  
other medical conditions. Hormone treatment may control prostate 
cancer for long periods by shrinking the size of the tumor and 
relieving pain. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 20 years, the survival rate for all prostate cases,  
regardless of stage, has increased from 67 percent to 93 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the most recent data, 68 percent of men diagnosed  
survive 10 years and 52 percent survive 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Dole Announcement Focuses GOP Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, taking a first, formal  
step toward a possible run for president, says it's high time that 
the nation's leaders restore voters' faith in their government -- to 
``call America to her better nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was among the themes the former U.S. labor and  
transportation secretary touted in a TV ad that was to accompany 
her announcement that she was forming an exploratory committee for 
the 2000 GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement at a rally here moves Mrs. Dole to the  
first tier of potential Republican contenders. Most polls have 
shown her and Texas Gov. George W. Bush far ahead of lesser-known 
potential Republican rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	In making her announcement, Mrs. Dole pointed to her experiences  
serving under five presidents but maintained a distance between 
herself and any rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a politician and, frankly, today that may be a plus,''  
Mrs. Dole said in her television ad, which was to air in Iowa and 
New Hampshire. Aides said the ad would flesh out the themes of a 
Dole campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics and the politics of governing have become so  
negative, so paralyzed by special interests, that as a people we're 
beginning to lose faith in our own institutions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her opening pitch took a not-too-subtle poke at President  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I run, this will be why: I believe our people are looking  
for leaders who will call America to her better nature,'' Mrs. Dole 
said. ``Yes, we've been let down, and by people we should have been 
able to look up to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the resume Mrs. Dole brings to a field of GOP contenders  
that could reach double digits: A very prominent and widely 
recognized name, extensive government experience and decades of 
campaigning as a surrogate for her husband, 1996 GOP presidential 
nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen many presidential campaigns up close,'' Mrs. Dole  
said in her 15-minute ad. ``I know what they entail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to bring a grace and a dignity to the race,'' said  
Ralph Reed, a consultant and former head of the Christian Coalition 
who is offering advice to Bush. ``I'm glad she's running. This 
nominating campaign is shaping into an embarrassment of riches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After today's announcement, Mrs. Dole's opening campaign swing  
takes her to Arizona, then to New Hampshire, before she heads back 
to her home in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's precinct caucuses mark the initial test of the  
presidential nominating season next February, while New Hampshire 
holds the first primary shortly after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has headed the Federal Trade Commission, served as  
secretaries of labor and transportation and been president of the 
American Red Cross. Some strategists argue that her Red Cross 
background insulates her from charges often hurled at Republicans 
that the party lacks compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	She hammered that experience in her TV pitch to voters.  
</P>
<P>
	``In my eight years at the American Red Cross, I saw things that  
will haunt me the rest of my life,'' she said. ``But I also saw the 
power of the human heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole said her early travels left her ``buoyed by the  
goodness of our citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Which is why I am ready to take the next step,'' Mrs. Dole  
said. ``This week, I have filed papers to form an exploratory 
committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among benefits Mrs. Dole brings to the campaign is her gender,  
some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gender plays into it to the extent that having a very visible  
and viable female candidate causes women voters to pay closer 
attention to the Republican primaries,'' said Ed Gillespie, a 
consultant allied with Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a likely 
presidential candidate in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has certainly gotten the attention of potential rivals  
like Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've long since passed the time when Americans are  
uncomfortable with women in any position of leadership,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reed argued that Bush has laid claim to the pillars of the  
Republican establishment, pointing to a broad range of prominent 
Republicans who joined the Texas governor last Sunday as he 
announced his exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Bush exploratory committee, you had the full range of  
the diversity of the Republican Party,'' said Reed. ``Bush has 
probably raised the bar for all subsequent contenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others suggested that front-runners like Mrs. Dole and Bush will  
stumble when they begin to face contentious issues that divide 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of soft underbelly when it comes to an issues  
campaign for this establishment candidate,'' said Greg Mueller, a 
consultant allied with publisher Steve Forbes and former 
communications director for conservative 1996 candidate Pat 
Buchanan.

<HEADLINE> GM Signs $1B Aluminum Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will buy more than $1  
billion in recycled aluminum over the next 13 years to use in 
making engines and components. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker has agreed to buy all of the recycled aluminum  
that Imco Recycling Inc. will produce at a new plant it plans to 
build in Zilwaukee. The plant will be situated near a GM Saginaw 
Metal Casting Operations, a powertrain facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a tremendous win for our foundry in Saginaw  
because it provides a solid future for our employees and provides 
numerous environmental benefits,'' John Stiles, executive director 
of GM purchasing of metals, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement with Imco, which is based in Irving, Texas, calls  
for almost 2 billion pounds of recycled aluminum over the next 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Recycled aluminum has become the largest single component of the  
national auto supply, said Imco chairman Don Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram said about 65 percent of the aluminum used in automobiles  
is recycled metal. He said the percentage could rise as more usable 
scrap become available. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Imco is the third major aluminum agreement GM has  
made in the last four months. In November, GM announced a 10-year 
agreement with Alcan Aluminium Ltd. to buy aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Imco rose almost 25 percent, or $2.93 3/4 to $14.75 on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Campaigns in Home State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley, who set high  
school basketball records in his native Missouri, says there is one 
key statistic in his favor in his run for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He's the only announced challenger to Vice President Al Gore for  
the Democratic presidential nomination next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``What pack?'' Bradley said Wednesday when asked how he will  
distinguish himself from other Democrats. ``And my guess is, it 
will remain a two-person race, which will be an interesting 
dynamic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, 55, spoke at a news conference sandwiched between a  
breakfast meeting with Kansas City friends and a major fund-raiser 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	An advocate of campaign finance reform during his 18 years in  
the U.S. Senate, he is refusing donations from political action 
committees and trying to raise $20 million through $1,000 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I have to reach out to the widest range of friends,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As he has throughout the young campaign, Bradley declined to  
criticize Gore. Instead, he focused on the differences in their 
``life experiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president has spent most of his life in Washington,''  
Bradley said of Gore, whose late father was a longtime U.S. senator 
from Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Bradley said, he grew up in a small community --  
Crystal City, on the Mississippi River -- and traveled widely for 30 
years, first during 10 years with the New York Knicks of the 
National Basketball Association and later as a New Jersey 
politician, author and businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was widely mentioned as a possible presidential  
candidate in 1988 and again in 1992, but has said the timing never 
felt right until now. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked about recent polls showing that Americans would  
favor probable Republican presidential candidates George W. Bush of 
Texas and Elizabeth Dole over the Democrat Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to have a nominee who can win,'' Bradley said. ``I  
think I can win.''

<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- Lasse Kjus of Norway won the men's  
downhill at the World Cup finals today and took the lead in the 
tight race for the overall season title. 
</P>
<P>
	American Chad Fleischer finished second in the downhill, his  
first top-three finish ever. He was timed in 1:49.89. Norwegian 
Audun Groenvold was third in 1:50.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus has 1,359 points to 1,317 for fellow Norwegian Kjetil Andre  
Aamodt and 1,271 for defending overall champion Hermann Maier of 
Austria. Three events remain to be skiied. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who wrapped up the season downhill title last week, added  
100 points to his season total in clocking a winning time of 1 
minute 49.73 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt was fourth in the downhill in 1:50.02. The result was  
worth 50 points and saw him slip into second place in the overall 
standings with 1,317 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the overall World Cup winner last season and two-time  
Olympic gold medal winner, continued his poor downhill showing and 
finished tied for ninth in 1:50.51. Maier, who slipped to 16th and 
11th place in downhills last week, fell 88 points off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus and Aamodt both ski all events and will battle for the  
overall title through the season's final super-G, giant slalom and 
slalom races. Maier, who seldom skis slalom, will race it this 
weekend to boost his fading chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt won the World Cup overall title in 1994 and Kjus was the  
1996 overall champion 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus last month became the first man in history to win five  
medals in the world championships including gold in super-G (which 
he shared with Maier) and giant slalom. He has also won an Olympic 
gold and two silver medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt won gold and bronze medals in the recent worlds and is is  
also an Olympic gold medalist.

<HEADLINE> Keillor Satirizes Ventura's Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When Minnesota elected a shaven-headed bone-crusher from the  
wild world of show wrestling to be its governor, it was a safe bet 
that another celebrated son of Minnesota would soon be taking up 
pen and paper to help us make sense of it. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long. Just four months later, ``Me, by Jimmy (Big  
Boy) Valente, as told to Garrison Keillor'' offers an uproarious 
take on the wrestler-as-governor phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	But wait a minute. Who is this Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente? Isn't  
the new governor's name Jesse (The Body) Ventura? And he didn't 
really fire sweat-seeking cruise missiles into the ring, did he? Or 
toss an eight-foot grizzly bear into the front row? 
</P>
<P>
	Of course not. This slim volume comes with an author's note that  
it is ``political satire,'' and ``should not be construed in any 
way as an autobiography of an actual governor of Minnesota, God 
bless him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura was initially peeved about the 152-page book,  
complaining that Keillor misused his image for commercial gain. But 
he has since eased up, and if he ever decides to run for president, 
Keillor's spoof could easily serve as campaign material. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, it portrays a man with everything it takes to get  
into the White House -- humble origins, patriotism, combat duty in 
Vietnam, devoted husband, honest entrepreneur, straight talker ... 
</P>
<P>
	So what if he weighs 250 pounds with his head shaven, drives  
large motorcycles and used to wear feathers and tights and jump up 
and down on people for a living? None of this should prevent him 
being elected president next year, Keillor said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, this is Garrison Keillor talking -- the radio  
storyteller who invented Lake Wobegon and convinced millions of 
readers worldwide that it was real; the author of ``We Are Still 
Married,'' a tale that almost makes us believe that an obscure bus 
driver's marital difficulties could result in a People magazine 
cover story, Congressional hearings and intervention by the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	So when he says Jesse Ventura is presidential material, you  
can't help wondering whether it's just Keillor still being 
satirical. 
</P>
<P>
	Not at all, insists the honeyed voice rolling down the phone  
line from Keillor's office in St. Paul, each sentence measured out 
in handpicked words and tantalizing pauses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this man can run for president and win in 2000. He  
talks the talk. He has a persona that is unlike anybody else's. 
Other politicians ... all come off as insurance agents -- sort of 
mildly affable, positive-thinking, inoffensive, smiling, vaguely 
intelligent white men, in their 50s, in maybe blue suits and white 
shirts and'' (pause) ``dark blue ties with'' (pause) ``red'' 
(pause) ``dots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And this man, the moment he walks into a room he's the leading  
man. He's a walking photo opportunity. ... But when he talks, he's 
brighter than you expect him to be for a 6-foot-4-inch man who 
shaves his head and talks in a steroid growl. He talks in whole 
sentences and says some things that make sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the country is peaceful and prosperous, politics falls into  
a trough and people stop crying out for leadership, Keillor 
explains. Then government ``becomes a sort of immense insurance 
company. You pay your premium in April and you buy a little 
insurance against disaster which you don't think you'll ever really 
need. ... And it doesn't really matter who's running things and so 
people are free to elect an entertainer. What harm can he do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may all be academic. Ventura says he has no immediate  
presidential ambitions, and a national poll commissioned by a 
Minneapolis TV station said 57 percent didn't want him to run, 
against 34 percent who said go for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Keillor says he has never met, nor tried to meet, Ventura, and  
seems to have mixed feelings about him. ``I don't begrudge the man 
his success,'' he says. ``I think he's very interesting.'' But 
``He's very stubborn, he's quite self-infatuated and he makes 
enemies unnecessarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But enough about reality. The Valente of Keillor's imagination  
is an entirely self-made man -- a foster child and 98-pound weakling 
who toughens himself enough to qualify for the elite WALRUS (Water 
Air Land Rising Up Suddenly) force and draw a stint in Vietnam. 
There, within 24 hours he is ripping the bolts off tank treads and 
hurling them into the cockpits of strafing enemy planes, which 
turns out to be good practice for the mayhem that awaits him on the 
pro-wrestling circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Here Keillor's satirical vision really starts firing on all  
cylinders. Fighters get thrown into Dumpsters and blown up, or 
crushed under 20-wheel monster trucks. The Widowmaker feeds 
opponents into a wood-chipper. Brent Beige the yuppie sits in the 
ring whining to his hair stylist on a cell phone while the crowd 
bays for his blood. Vicious Eddie the Mohawk Kid has ``a zipper 
implanted in his cheek which he unzipped so everyone could see the 
food in his mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the first wrestler,'' Valente boasts, ``to employ  
SWEAT-SEEKING CRUISE MISSILES in the ring. ... A flash of flame and 
big mushroom clouds and when the smoke cleared, my tormentor was 
burnt toast and I stood, bloodied but victorious in the 
crisscrossing spotlights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where did Keillor GET this stuff? From watching Jesse Ventura's  
videotaped highlights, he says. ``It's not that difficult to 
understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyway, retired from wrestling, ``Big Boy'' looks at politics  
and senses a vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
	He sees the Democrats as the party with ``programs for  
everything -- programs to combat grumpiness, stupidity, 
discrimination, covetousness, improper lane changes, low math 
scores, flat beer, poor taste, too much air in the Cracker Jack 
box, and all of the programs require battalions of social workers 
and reams of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republicans are equally unattractive: ``Squeeze the  
maximum profit out of everything, strip it clean, gouge what you 
can, clear-cut the forest, ... lay off the twenty-year guys and 
hire cheap replacements, cut costs, inflate the stock, sell out, 
make your pile, leave town, ... and feel no more remorse than a 
fruit fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he joins the Ethical Party, ``a grab bag of bikers and  
bird-watchers and disgruntled dishwashers and surly seniors and 
people who call in to talk shows to ... (complain) about the 
mailman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the rest is history. The book ends with ``Big Boy''  
confidently outlining his strategy for capturing the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura -- the real deal -- has said he's too busy governing  
Minnesota to consider a presidential run in 2000. And in 2004? He 
says anything's possible. 
</P>
<P>
	But Keillor says its 2000 or never. ``He'd be a fool to wait  
until 2004,'' he says.

<HEADLINE>  Orioles' Kamieniecki Makes Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Scott Kamieniecki doesn't have much  
to show for his 1998 season -- two wins and a scar on his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a long year,'' he said Wednesday. ``A very long year.''  
</P>
<P>
	After Kamieniecki started 30 games and went 10-6 in 1997, the  
Baltimore Orioles rewarded the right-hander a $6.1 million, 
two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamieniecki didn't provide much of an initial return on their  
investment, pitching in only 12 games last year and taking three 
trips to the disabled list during a horrid, injury-plagued season 
in which he went 2-6 with a 6.75 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't pitch after Aug. 21 and underwent surgery to repair a  
herniated disk in his neck in September, an operation that ended 
his season and left him with a two-inch scar. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Kamieniecki is healthy again and projected to be  
the fourth starter in the Orioles' rotation. His bid to return to 
the form he exhibited in 1997 began in earnest Wednesday when he 
pitched two innings against the Boston Red Sox -- his first 
appearance against outside competition in seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers looked good -- two innings, no runs, two hits and two  
walks. But Kamieniecki was critical of virtually every facet of his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have thrown 35 or 40 pitches; maybe four or five where  
I wanted to,'' he said. ``I was expecting a little better than 
that. I don't how I didn't give up any runs, as bad as I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When someone suggested that the poor showing could be attributed  
to the fact that he hadn't pitched competitively in months, 
Kamieniecki dismissed the notion with a wave of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any physical problems. There are no aches or  
pains and everything has gone pretty well,'' he said. ``Hopefully I 
just had a bad day. This is the worst, by far, the last four to six 
weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles manager Ray Miller was looking for three innings but  
pulled the plug after two. After a discussion with Kamieniecki 
outside the Baltimore dugout, he sent the pitcher to the bullpen to 
take a few more throws. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Miller, Kamieniecki will be treated carefully until  
he proves he's completely healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly going to conscious of pitch-counts with a guy  
who had neck surgery,'' Miller said. ``If he progresses, he'll 
probably start the season as a six-inning pitcher because of the 
problems he had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, unlike Kamieniecki, liked what he saw Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, Kammy is angry every day he pitches,'' Miller  
said. ``I saw some first-pitch breaking balls, some 2-0 fastballs 
... If he continues to pitch and get people out, he'll have a spot 
in the rotation.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Stays With Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- A senior DaimlerChrysler official said  
Wednesday that the giant carmaker had never threatened to end its 
support of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, senior  
vice president Matthias Kleinert said the company had no plans to 
cut its ties to the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleinert said his comments to the Australian newspaper were  
misleading because they had been taken ``fully out of context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are convinced that the problems of the IOC will be solved  
next week in Lausanne,'' Kleinert said. ``An end of our involvement 
is therefore not a topic of discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Kleinert as saying that the car  
maker's continued support was conditional upon IOC making its 
finances and business open. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleinert said he was only trying to describe procedures in the  
world of business and that DaimlerChrysler ``would not get involved 
in the discussions on IOC structures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We see no reason to doubt the IOC's determination to draw  
consequences from the affair,'' Kleinert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not an official sponsor, the company has been  
supporting the IOC since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it's a give and take,'' Kleinert said.  
</P>
<P>
	The partnership allowed the car company to enter new markets, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cooperation has been going on without problems, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have been in constant contact with the IOC leadership since  
the beginning of the affair and we saw no reason to draw any 
consequences,'' Kleinert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract with the IOC runs through 2004.  
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is holding an emergency session next week at its seat in  
Lausanne, Switzerland to discuss the case of IOC members accused of 
accepting lavish gifts from Salt Lake City before the U.S. city won 
the vote in 1995 to stage the 2002 Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> Rapper ODB Jailed in L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rapper ODB has been jailed after pleading  
innocent to a charge accusing him of violating a new state law 
banning violent felons from wearing body armor. 
</P>
<P>
	The musician, whose real name is Russell Jones, declared himself  
indigent and unable to post $115,000 bail Wednesday. Jones is the 
30-year-old singer for the Wu-Tang Clan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to how famous he is, he's at risk for his life,'' said  
Deputy Public Defender Mearl Lottman. ``He was wearing it for his 
own protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was pulled over for driving erratically in Hollywood on  
Feb. 16, and police arrested him after discovering he was wearing a 
bulletproof vest -- a violation in light of his prior arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy District Attorney Mary Ganahl suggested he heads a street  
gang named Wu-Tang Clan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that is a musical group,'' Judge Kevin Brown said with  
a smile. ``I have three children. That's why I know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was convicted of second-degree assault in 1993. He also  
faces trial in Los Angeles on charges he threatened to kill the 
mother of his 1-year-old child and made death threats to nightclub 
guards.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Torre Has Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees manager Joe Torre left  
the World Series champions Wednesday for treatment of prostate 
cancer, another blow to a team shadowed by death and disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre discovered he had the cancer from a test the Yankees  
required at spring training in response to Darryl Strawberry's 
colon-cancer diagnosis in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The team believes doctors caught the disease in its early  
stages, and owner George Steinbrenner said he expects Torre back in 
30 days -- which would be April 9, the day of the Yankees' 
home-opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine, and I am looking forward to taking care of this  
problem and getting back to work,'' said the 58-year-old manager, 
who spent the day at his spring home in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what his course of treatment will  
be or where he will be treated. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Torre's condition came two days after Yankees great Joe  
DiMaggio died of complications from lung-cancer surgery and on the 
same day Strawberry returned to the lineup for the first time in 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a very tough week for the Yankees but we'll be able  
to handle it,'' said Steinbrenner, who visited Torre and found him 
in good spirits. ``We have a great capacity of being able to deal 
with adversity. Time after time after time, we've done it 
throughout this franchise's history. It's built into being a 
Yankee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, former Yankees star Catfish Hunter appeared at  
the team's camp too weak to shake hands because of Lou Gehrig's 
Disease. In 1996, when Torre became the Yankees' manager, his 
brother Rocco died, and his brother Frank had a heart transplant 
during the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said the team was ``devastated'' by the news of  
Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to see someone else face this particular  
battle,'' Strawberry said. ``It is a difficult battle for anybody. 
We all have to realize that until there is a cure for cancer there 
are no guarantees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, whose regular season begins April 5 at Oakland,  
will rotate managers while Torre is out. Hitting coach Chris 
Chambliss managed the split squad game Wednesday in Fort Myers 
against the Red Sox and Stump Merrill, who managed the Yankees in 
1990-91 and is now a special assistant to general manager Brian 
Cashman, handled the team's other game in Bradenton against the 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-base coach Willie Randolph and pitching coach Mel  
Stottlemyre also will share the managing duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Yankees left Tampa this morning, Torre called  
veterans Joe Girardi, Paul O'Neill and David Cone into his office 
to break the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Girardi informed the Yankees who went to Fort Myers in a brief  
closed-door meeting two hours before the game. O'Neill told the 
group of players in Bradenton, while Cone told those who stayed in 
Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to be upbeat. But it is hard when you see two people  
in the prime of their lives go through this,'' Girardi said of 
Strawberry and Torre. ``The best thing we can do for Joe right now 
is to play the way Joe wants us to play. Joe's going to want to 
fight this and he's going to want us to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is second only to lung cancer among cancer  
killers of American men, taking about 40,000 lives annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Most prostate cancer happens sporadically; patients have no  
particular family history of the disease. However, about 1 in 10 
cases seems to be clearly inherited, because many men in the same 
family have it. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre is the third prominent person in baseball to be diagnosed  
with cancer this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga was diagnosed with a  
cancerous tumor in his lower back and is undergoing chemotherapy. 
He will miss the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell, a former Yankees  
prospect, was diagnosed last month with testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Marv Levy, the former coach of the Buffalo Bills, underwent  
surgery for prostate cancer during the 1995 NFL season and, at 70, 
was back coaching within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is taking the correct steps,'' Levy said. ``It is a  
disease that, when diagnosed early and treated aggressively, is 
highly curable. My prayers and best wishes for a swift recovery are 
certainly with Joe Torre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre has a 302-184 record and has won two World Series  
championships in his first three years as Yankees manager. Last 
year, Torre led the Yankees to an AL-record 114 wins and swept the 
San Diego Padres in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He means everything to our club,'' Tino Martinez said. ``He  
helps keep us together day in and day out. It's just shocking. 
After what Darryl went through last year, we just have to be ready 
for something like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who signed a two-year contract extension last month,  
joined Casey Stengel and Ralph Houk as the only managers to lead 
the Yankees to the postseason in their first three years at the 
helm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees trip to the World Series in 1996 was Torre's first  
as a player or manager after 4,268 games in the majors.

<HEADLINE> Austerity Measure Passed in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's government has won an  
important vote in its bid to pass a major austerity measure 
expected to yield $8 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chamber of Deputies voted 357-135 late Tuesday to increase a  
tax on financial transactions. The lower house must vote one more 
time for the measure to make it law. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's upper house, the Senate, passed the bill in January.  
</P>
<P>
	The measure is the last in a $14.9 billion austerity plan that  
helped ensure Brazil a $41.5 billion loan from the International 
Monetary Fund and other lenders in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has already started work on a new set of  
belt-tightening measures since its currency plunged 40 percent 
after the central bank let it float freely starting Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Finance Ministry and the IMF made public Brazil's  
revised 1999 economic targets. These include a budget surplus of 
3.1 percent and 16.8 percent inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	To achieve the targets, the government plans to freeze salaries  
of 500,000 civil servants, speed up privatization and raise 
electric energy charges, among other measures.

<HEADLINE>  DiMaggio's Son To Be Pallbearer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio's estranged son will be a pallbearer at his  
father's private funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 30 relatives and close friends will attend the  
service Thursday at Sts. Peter and Paul Church, where DiMaggio 
married his first wife, Dorothy Arnold, in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe insisted that his funeral be a private, religious service,  
and his family is intent on carrying out his wishes,'' said Morris 
Engelberg, DiMaggio's friend and attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some dispute about whether New York Yankees owner  
George Steinbrenner was invited. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Steinbrenner asked to come. So did Reggie Jackson and a  
lot of other people he knew and liked, but the family had to say 
`no,''' Engelberg told The Associated Press from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone disputed that Steinbrenner wasn't  
invited, saying the Yankees owner was asked to accompany the family 
to the West Coast. And it was Steinbrenner who declined the 
invitation because he didn't want an exception to the guest list 
made in his case, Cerrone said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's only son, Joe Jr., will be one of the pallbearers.  
The two had been estranged and had not seen each other in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pallbearers will be Roger Stein and James Hamra, the  
husbands of DiMaggio's two granddaughters; Joseph DiMaggio, son of 
ballplayer's late brother, Mike; Joe Nacchio, a friend of 
DiMaggio's for 59 years, and Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be memorial services in other parts of the  
country,'' Engelberg said. ``Steinbrenner said there would be one 
at Yankee Stadium in the Memorial Park there. And, there are plans 
to erect a monument next to the one for Babe Ruth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church's twin steeples tower over the North Beach section of  
San Francisco where DiMaggio spent most of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral procession will drive into Beach Street in San  
Francisco's Marina section, where the DiMaggio family lived as it 
makes its way to the Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, where DiMaggio 
will be buried. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's body was flown from Miami to San Francisco late  
Monday on private jet. The Hall of Famer died Monday at age 84 at 
his home in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio divorced Arnold in 1943. DiMaggio wed Marilyn Monroe in  
1954 and they divorced later that year.

<HEADLINE> FTC Probes Fight Over Generic Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Generic drugs were once seen as the solution to  
rising cost of brand-name prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But large pharmaceutical companies have become increasingly  
sophisticated at starving off generic competitors by finding ways 
to extend the patent life of their blockbuster drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the federal government is taking a hard look at whether all  
the methods pass legal muster. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts, though, expect little to come of the  
investigation because they believe the companies, such as Eli Lilly 
and Dupont, are acting within their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies are all doing the normal practices that they  
have to do to protect their franchises,'' said Hemant Shah, a drug 
analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission is looking at deals drug companies  
have with potential rivals and other activities undertaken to 
protect their patents. The agency's widened inquiry was first 
reported in the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, for example, Eli Lilly formed an agreement to buy a  
modified form of Prozac from Sepracor, a company that specializes 
in removing dangerous side effects from established drugs and 
licensing the rights back to the manufacturer. The FTC is 
requesting more information on that deal, Eli Lilli officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is valuable to Lilly because Prozac, which had nearly  
$3 billion in worldwide sales in 1998, is expected to lose patent 
protection in the next two years. While Sepracor isn't a generic 
drug maker, it illustrates Lilly's desire to hold onto the rights 
to desirable second-generation drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Lilly-Sepracor deal is an exclusive arrangement it  
eliminates a potential rival in a class of drugs dominated by 
Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	A second generation Prozac drug made by Lilly would likely  
hamper potential sales of a generic competitor to the existing 
Prozac drug because the newer form would have fewer side effects, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulatory concerns have been fueled as drug prices continue to  
increase at more than twice the overall inflation rate. The higher 
prices combined with the rising demand for new drugs has placed a 
difficult burden on private and public health insurance programs. 
``We think this is positive that the FTC is looking into this, and 
at least calling into question the parameters of these deals,'' 
said Carole Cox, a spokeswoman for generic drugmaker Barr 
Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	An FTC spokeswoman said the agency does not comment on  
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr is suing Lilly for blocking its ability to make a generic  
form of Prozac. Barr is also suing Dupont, which has cracked down 
on Barr's efforts to sell its generic form of the blood thinner 
Coumadin. Dupont asserts that Barr's generic copy is not equivalent 
to Coumadin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said the FTC contacted the company last month about Prozac  
and Coumadin issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies, such as Abbott Laboratories, have paid potential  
generic rivals not to produce a generic drug until they resolve 
their litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst David Saks of Gruntal &AMP; Co. said that may appear  
anti-consumer, but such deals help both firms, and ensure a generic 
version eventually does come to market. Without such an agreement, 
major pharmaceutical companies could keep small generic firms in 
court for years before resolving patent disputes, he said.

<HEADLINE> Emmylou, Dolly and Linda Are Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt  
can't explain why they sound so good singing together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad we do,'' Parton says. ``We do love to sing. Your  
whole life you wait to find those compatible voices. It's like 
making love. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get off on it. I do. I get so thrilled. When it buzzes, it  
is good. It's just like sex in that way. Don't fight it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their new CD, ``Trio II,'' was recently released, debuting in  
the No. 4 spot on Billboard's country album charts. 
</P>
<P>
	The CD was recorded in 1994. But they were too busy to promote  
it, so the album went on a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Asylum Records contacted Ronstadt at her home in Arizona.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a contract with them,'' Ronstadt, 52, explains.  
``I'm sitting in Tucson where I no longer apply makeup. I'm a 
servant for two children. They sent someone to my house to ask, 
`What do you intend to do with the future of your recording 
career?' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Well, we have this great record still in the can.'''  
</P>
<P>
	To her surprise, Asylum agreed to release ``Trio II.''  
</P>
<P>
	When Ronstadt phoned Parton, her response was ``Praise the  
Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronstadt didn't have a copy of the finished record. But all the  
tracks were located and the CD was assembled without having to 
rerecord any of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pictures on the CD's cover show the three singers when they  
were little girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows what we look like now,'' Harris says. ``It's  
intriguing to see what people look like as children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three singers met in the early 1970s. Several years later,  
almost by chance, they discovered their voices blended sweetly: 
Parton visited Harris in Los Angeles, Harris invited Ronstadt over, 
and they sang a little country harmony. They sang on Parton's TV 
show in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trio,'' which sold 1.8 million copies, was released in 1987.  
The album produced four Top 10 hits, including the No. 1 ``To Know 
Him Is to Love Him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all so very proud of the first 'Trio' record and this  
one,'' Parton says. ``It's my two favorite things I've ever 
participated in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a gift,'' says Harris. ``I think it's a very  
special, healing record, the songs and the sound of our voices. 
I've been listening to it a lot. I'm quite moved by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parton, 53, is hoping the second album will be as popular as the  
first, and would like to record another CD if ``Trio II'' does 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronstadt and Harris are less interested in album sales.  
</P>
<P>
	``As little or as much as it sells, I think it should be out  
there for people to have an opportunity to have it,'' Harris says. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Ronstadt, ``I'd just like to get a chance to sing  
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronstadt is producing a record for Sony Classical on the history  
of glass music, including a glass instrument built by Benjamin 
Franklin. She and Harris, who will be 52 on April 2, are working on 
a record to be released in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to write for my next solo record,'' says Harris,  
this year's Grammy winner for ``Same Old Train'' with Clint Black, 
Joe Diffie, Merle Haggard, Alison Krauss, Patty Loveless, Earl 
Scruggs, Ricky Skaggs, Marty Stuart, Pam Tillis, Randy Travis, 
Travis Tritt and Dwight Yoakam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been trying to take a year off since last January,''  
Harris says. ``That hasn't worked out exactly. I have managed to 
get some writing done. I pretty much let my band go. I left my 
record company. I wanted to clean out my closet, so to speak, and 
put all my energy into writing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parton has a gospel special on TNN on April 1, and her East  
Tennessee theme park Dollywood will open for the 1999 season in 
April.

<HEADLINE> Coaches Say Ruling Could Open Doors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- NCAA coaches say a federal court ruling  
tossing out the NCAA's minimum test score requirement might help 
many student athletes get educations they couldn't otherwise 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
	But the four high school athletes who sued the NCAA in 1997 on  
grounds of discrimination for eligibility rules barring them from 
athletic scholarships have already found other ways to attend 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge barred enforcement of an NCAA rule saying  
students must score at least 820 on the Scholastic Assessment Test 
to compete as college freshmen, in addition to achieving a 2.5 
grade-point average in 13 ``core'' courses. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling would have helped one of the Philadelphia plaintiffs  
in the 1997 lawsuit, Leatrice Shaw, now competing for the 
University of Miami as a junior, according to her foster father, 
Robert Massie. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the rule, when Shaw was a freshman she could only  
practice with the Miami track team, said Massie, head track coach 
at Simon Gratz High School, where Shaw and fellow plaintiff Tai 
Kwan Cureton were high school stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they went to compete, she had to wave `bye-bye,''' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cureton was able to compete as a freshman by going to Wheaton  
College in Massachusetts, a Division III school where the SAT 
minimum did not apply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tai Kwan was president of the Student Government Association  
(at Gratz) and president of the senior class, but he didn't have 
the SAT scores,'' Massie said. ``Leatrice was a member of the 
National Honor Society. She took the test three times. She came up 
10 points short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temple basketball coach John Chaney said the SAT requirement was  
``a denial of opportunity and access for youngsters and targeted 80 
to 90 percent black, Hispanic, poor and disadvantaged youngsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If upheld, the ruling could restore a lost year of eligibility  
to athletes like Temple senior guard Rasheed Brokenborough, who sat 
out his freshman year due to the SAT cutoff and ran up $15,000 in 
debt because he could not qualify for a scholarship that year, 
Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who wouldn't like to get another year back?'' said  
Brokenborough, who said that although he is graduating, he would 
use the additional year of eligibility to pursue graduate studies. 
``I only got to play three years of basketball and I'd like to come 
back a fourth year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw did not immediately return messages left on her answering  
machine seeking comment Tuesday. Massie said he told her about the 
ruling Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's happy about it,'' but since Shaw is entering her junior  
year ``she's not really affected by it,'' Massie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other plaintiffs were Alexander Wesby, a basketball player now  
in his freshman year at Temple, and Andrea Gardner, a junior on the 
track team at Howard University. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner could not immediately be reached at Howard, where  
university offices and the athletic department were closed due to a 
snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, an early strong advocate of  
tougher academic standards, declined to comment on the new ruling, 
saying he wanted to find out more about the details of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	When the NCAA launched eligibility reforms in the early 1980s,  
Paterno said that a lack of standards hurt a generation of black 
students by allowing them into college unprepared for the academic 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, president of the National  
Association of Basketball Coaches, said the group has long been 
concerned about how the minimum test score would affect youths from 
lower socioeconomic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This court ruling will certainly open a new discussion for  
creating better legislation for all youngsters,'' Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes the SAT is viewed as a measure of kids' innate  
abilities. It's not. It's a measure of learned skills,'' said Andy 
Rosen, chief executive officer of Kaplan Educational Centers in New 
York, which offer education and career services including test 
preparation training. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaplan runs a ``Good Sports Athletic Scholars Program'' designed  
to help about 200 students a year in poor neighborhoods meet the 
NCAA eligibility requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a fun class, too,'' said Lawrence Wade, a junior at  
Eastern High School in Washington, D.C., who hopes to play football 
at a college such as Maryland, North Carolina State or Florida 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the training, the SAT requirement could make that a  
distant dream, Wade said. ``I took a practice SAT. It was kind of 
hard. I think they should consider other things as well.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Wednesday as  
Tokyo stocks soared and Japanese companies brought yen back home 
before the close of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also fell against the euro as investors became less  
concerned that Europe would lower interest rates or that the United 
States would raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (the dollar's) pausing to take a breath,'' said Robert  
Katz, a foreign exchange dealer at MTB Bank Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.88  
Japanese yen, down from 121.00 yen on Tuesday. The euro was quoted 
at $1.0940, up from $1.0890. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, the yen got a boost as one of the key indices  
gauging the Nikkei stock average rose 2.54 percent to 15,480.00, 
its highest close since August 10. On Tuesday, the index climbed 
2.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the rally boosted demand for yen.  
</P>
<P>
	``The market doesn't have much appetite for further (dollar)  
buying now,'' said Koichi Kubo, assistant general manager for the 
foreign group at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in Tokyo. ``Market sentiment 
is that it is still top-heavy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corporations and banks were still selling dollars and  
dollar-denominated assets and bringing yen home to boost balance 
sheets before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4603 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4667, and 1.5222 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5178. The British 
pound rose to $1.6271, up from $1.6186. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Identify Obesity Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two research groups have identified the first gene known to  
suppress obesity and regulate the burning of calories -- a find that 
could lead the way toward a drug that keeps people trim. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't reach for that second jelly doughnut just yet.  
</P>
<P>
	The gene, known as Mahogany, or the MG gene, was discovered in  
mice. It is the sixth gene found to be implicated in obesity. But 
researchers said it is the first discovered to regulate metabolism 
and the expenditure of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of two studies published in Thursday's issue of the  
journal Nature, scientists at Millennium Pharmaceuticals in 
Cambridge, Mass., tested groups of mice with normal and mutated MG 
genes. They fed the mice diets with varying percentages of fat. 
</P>
<P>
	Mice with a mutated MG gene did not gain weight regardless of  
whether they ate a high-fat diet or a low-fat one. Mice with the 
normal gene gained weight on the high-fat diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said they were optimistic that the gene would play  
the same role in humans, but cautioned that it has been 
demonstrated only in mice so far. ``Mahogany'' refers to the 
animals' brown fur. 
</P>
<P>
	And although the findings suggest it plays an important role in  
diet-related obesity -- which afflicts most of the 54 percent of 
American adults who are too hefty -- obesity is thought to more than 
a matter of genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obesity is a complex problem for which diet, exercise and  
biology all are important,'' said geneticist Craig Warden of the 
University of California at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one reason why it could be several years before the  
researchers can transform their discovery into a fat-busting drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pessimistic that we'll ever get that pill that allows us  
to remain sedentary, eat high-fat diets and stay lean,'' said 
University of Colorado obesity researcher James O. Hill. ``But 
that's what Americans want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molecular biologist Karen Moore, who directed the MG study for  
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, said the findings could show 
researchers how to develop a drug to control obesity by mimicking 
the activity of the mutated gene. 
</P>
<P>
	The process of how such a drug could enter a cell is described  
in the second study in Nature, by Stanford University researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other obesity researchers said the MG studies provide key  
information in understanding how the body warehouses fuel when 
people eat more than necessary.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Finance Director Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The finance director for the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee has quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Hamson was already out on administrative leave while SLOC  
determined his role in the Olympics bid scandal. He was one of two 
employees put on leave Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The other, senior vice president of marketing and legal affairs  
Kelly Flint, returned to work last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamson submitted his resignation last Friday but gave no reason  
for quitting, SLOC spokesman Frank Zang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamson joined the bid effort in 1989 as a volunteer and was  
later hired as finance and licensing director. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent ethics panel last month blamed Tom Welch, former  
head of the bid committee, and David Johnson, senior vice 
president, for lavishing more than $1 million in gifts, cash and 
other favors on International Olympic Committee members and their 
families during the bidding for the 2002 Winter Games. Hamson 
prepared vouchers for checks co-signed by Flint that paid for 
relatives of IOC members to live in the United States and attend 
American universities, the ethics panel reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Flint told the ethics panel he thought the checks were  
authorized under a scholarship program. He said he had no way of 
knowing that the names on the checks belonged to relatives of IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The report described Hamson as a fresh college graduate who was  
given the title of finance director, but who had no leadership 
role. Hamson socialized with IOC members and simply did what he was 
told by Welch and Johnson, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this regard, he was not unlike other bid committee  
employees who were aware of educational grants to IOC relatives and 
had suspicions about direct payments,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Study Prehistoric Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere fluctuated after the Ice  
Age, helping to heat up Earth's climate and trigger the spread of 
deserts thousands of years ago, a study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists say the findings -- which were based on an analysis of  
ice cores drilled from glaciers in Antarctica -- could serve as 
warning of what global warming could do to the Earth in the 21st 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is called a ``greenhouse gas''  
because it traps the sun's heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Levels of carbon dioxide fell and rose by small but persistent  
amounts between 11,000 and 1,000 years ago, according to the Swiss 
and American scientists who examined the ice cores. 
</P>
<P>
	They also found that the fluctuations correlate with droughts  
and the spread of deserts in Africa and Asia during the prehistoric 
period known as Holocene. 
</P>
<P>
	These ancient carbon dioxide levels, while significant, were far  
lower than the rising concentrations in today's atmosphere that are 
blamed on industry and motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the findings raise questions about whether the  
Earth is headed for rapid and drastic climate changes in the 21st 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	``The carbon dioxide changes over the last few thousand years  
have been tiny and slow compared to what humans are doing,'' said 
glaciologist Richard Alley of Pennsylvania State University, who 
did not participate in the study. ``We are moving into uncharted 
waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the University of Bern in Switzerland and the  
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., examined 
400 samples drilled from the upper layers of the Taylor Dome 
glacier in Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
	From 11,000 to 8,000 years ago, carbon dioxide levels overall  
dipped by 8 parts per million, the scientists reported. During the 
next 7,000 years, carbon dioxide rose by 25 ppm. The increase 
probably came from carbon that was released as plants burned or 
deteriorated in a drying climate, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers reached their conclusions by analyzing different  
forms, or isotopes, of carbon dioxide in the layers of ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings challenge the assumption that Earth's climate has  
been stable since the glaciers retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have tended to view the last 10,000 years as being  
constant,'' said ice core expert James White of the University of 
Colorado. ``But carbon levels really haven't stabilized. Humans 
have continuity built into their thinking, and this study will 
shock people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Holocene's climate swings were a natural phenomenon. But  
during the past 200 years, the burning of coal, gasoline and other 
fossil fuels has added more than 80 ppm of carbon dioxide to the 
atmosphere. The total amount is now above 370 ppm and is expected 
to double in the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990s are the warmest decade on record. Many scientists fear  
that human activity is the driving force behind the warming. 
</P>
<P>
	White and other scientists said the group's analysis is  
plausible, but suspect it is too neat to be precisely accurate. It 
does not adequately reflect the complex interactions of oceans, 
forests and other ecological features in the carbon cycle, White 
said.

<HEADLINE> Allegedly Gay Teacher Has Class Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A school district illegally bowed to  
parents' requests to remove 15 pupils from the classroom of a 
purportedly gay teacher, a state official said. 
</P>
<P>
	By granting the requests, the district wrongfully fostered  
different treatment toward the eighth-grade science teacher based 
on his perceived sexual orientation, Chief Deputy Labor 
Commissioner Jose Millan wrote in a ruling made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling prohibits the Rio Bravo-Greeley Union School District  
from discriminating against James D. Merrick, a former teacher of 
the year, in any aspect of employment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, while it also prohibits removal of any more students,  
the ruling does not expressly require the return of any students to 
Merrick's class. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrick, a teacher for 40 years, was hired by the district in  
1994. He has neither said he is gay nor denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	The district can appeal to state Industrial Relations Director  
Stephen Smith. Should it lose and refuse to comply, Smith could go 
to court to enforce the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The rural Bakersfield district of about 800 youngsters is about  
100 miles north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision vindicates all of us who believe that bigotry and  
hate have no place in the classroom,'' said Myron Dean Quon, a 
lawyer for Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay rights 
organization that has represented Merrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents began removing their children from Merrick's  
classes in September, after he got involved in a campaign seeking 
the resignation of the Rev. Douglas Hearn over his remarks that 
gays are sick and should not be teaching children. The parents said 
students were uncomfortable with Merrick's mannerisms and public 
discussion of homosexuality.

<HEADLINE> Takeover Shakes Up French Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A $37.2 billion takeover bid by Banque Nationale de  
Paris for Paribas and Societe Generale that would create the 
world's largest banking group sent shock waves today through the 
normally staid French bank sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid coincides with widespread consolidation among European  
banks scrambling to compete in a market transformed by a new common 
currency and fewer barriers to financial trade. 
</P>
<P>
	It also shows that French banks, often criticized for their slow  
reaction to consolidation, are moving frantically to catch up with 
their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro has the effect of increasing competitive pressures in  
Europe,'' Banque Nationale chairman Michel Pebereau said today at a 
news conference detailing the takeover bid. ``France needed to 
create a banking champion. Our offer sets this up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banque Nationale's takeover bid, announced late Tuesday, comes  
just weeks after Societe Generale moved to buy Paribas for $17.07 
billion to create Europe's second-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined bank would hold nearly $1 trillion in assets,  
surpassing the $800 billion in assets from the bank that would be 
created by the pending merger of Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said today that the takeover bid throws into question  
France's role in future consolidation of the European banking 
sector, and is likely to undergo scrutiny from anti-trust 
authorities in Brussels and in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also seen as an attempt to pre-empt a foreign takeover bid  
for French banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``What worries me is that this is a Franco-French solution,''  
said Bruno Eudes, a trader with the brokerage house 
Meeschaert-Rousselle. ``It doesn't add much to the banks' 
international competitiveness and excludes any foreign bank from 
getting a big share of the French industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement today, Paribas chairman Andre Levy-Lang and  
Daniel Bouton, his Societe Generale counterpart, described Banque 
Nationale's intentions as ``risky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chairmen said they had been unaware of Banque Nationale's  
interest until Tuesday night. ``This operation therefore cannot be 
portrayed as being friendly,'' they concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Pebereau insisted that the bid was not hostile. ``It isn't a  
question of a forced marriage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really positions BNP as a major player in the European  
scene and leaves them well-positioned to move into North America in 
a bigger way,'' said Keith Stock, a New York-based global 
management consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Banque Nationale's bid would be the second-highest price ever  
paid in a bank deal, just shy of the $41.5 billion merger between 
NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Banque Nationale is offering 15 of its shares for seven Societe  
Generale shares and 11 of its shares for eight Paribas shares. 
Trading in shares of all three banks have been suspended on the 
Paris stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	While French banks have been slow to expand into the United  
States, several European banks are making moves, including Deutsche 
Bank, HSBC, Dresdner and ABN Amro. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance companies are also getting in the game. On Monday,  
Fortis, one of the biggest insurance and banking companies in 
Europe, said it would buy American Bankers Insurance Group, a Miami 
insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Aegon NV said it was buying TransAmerica of San  
Francisco for almost $10 billion.

<HEADLINE> `Rough' Coming to Masters This Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Additional length on two holes and the addition of 20 pine trees  
down the right side of the 15th fairway won't be the only 
significant changes at the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta National Golf Club will finally have some rough.  
</P>
<P>
	Masters officials prefer to describe it as the ``second cut.''  
Whatever the name, Augusta's chairman confirmed Wednesday that the 
grass beyond the fairway will be twice as high when the tournaments 
starts next month -- from five-eighths of an inch, enough to give 
the fairways definition, to 1 3-8 inches, which could be just 
enough to create havoc. 
</P>
<P>
	``While changes made to the golf course this year included  
distance, the principle objective was to place greater emphasis on 
accuracy off the tee,'' said Hootie Johnson, in his first year as 
chairman. ``The second cut is consistent with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of rough at Augusta have been circulating the past couple  
of weeks, as well as speculation on how it might impact scoring in 
the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Augusta with rough? On a hard, fast day? Man,'' said Ernie  
Els, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
	The second cut will be nothing like the U.S. Open, where any  
errant drive often allows for nothing more than a wedge to chop it 
back into play. But because of the severity of Augusta's slick, 
contoured greens, 1 3-8 inches of grass -- nearly the depth of a 
golf ball -- could prevent players from controlling the spin on 
their iron shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, all these years you've had a beautiful lie with  
which do anything you can to the ball,'' said Ben Crenshaw, a 
two-time Masters champion. ``Even if you take just a little bit of 
spin off the ball, it will make a big difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, any changes figured to come the year after Tiger  
Woods, despite a 40 over his first nine holes, won the 1997 Masters 
with a record 18-under-par 270. The previous mark was 271, first 
set by Jack Nicklaus in 1965 and matched by Raymond Floyd in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	But former chairman Jack Stephens said last year there was no  
cause for alarm, no need to go beyond the annual tweaks to the 
course that Bobby Jones and Alister MacKenzie designed in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, defending champion Mark O'Meara and everyone else will find  
striking changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The tees on the par-5 second hole and the par-4 17th have been  
moved back about 25 yards, and the pine trees have been planted 
where there used to be mounds down the right side of the par-5 
15th. Also, the 11th green has been elevated about 2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	And the grass will be a littler higher even though the fairways  
will be plenty wide. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether rough becomes the most significant change to Augusta  
since bentgrass greens replaced Bermuda in 1981 remains to be seen. 
But Els believes one thing is certain -- Woods' record 270 is 
probably safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that you're going to have flier lies?'' he said. ``That  
record will last forever, and I'll put money on it.''

<HEADLINE> Coach Suspended After Race Comment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HENDERSONVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A high school baseball coach held  
up a chain to one of his black students and asked if he wanted to 
go for a ride, an apparent reference to the dragging death of a 
black man in Texas, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Decker Jr. was suspended for three days without pay after  
Beech High School senior Carlos Jarrett complained about the remark 
to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of action will not be tolerated in any manner,''  
Jeff Helbig, assistant director for Sumner County schools, wrote in 
a March 4 disciplinary letter to Decker. 
</P>
<P>
	Decker has only said the incident ``was all a misunderstanding''  
and he has apologized to Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Jarrett's father, Willie Jarrett, Carlos and a  
group of boys were leaving school March 1 when Decker, standing by 
his truck and holding a piece of chain, said: ``Carlos, do you want 
a ride?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was apparently referring to the torture killing in Texas of  
James Byrd Jr., a black man decapitated while being dragged behind 
a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The remark comes after a radio shock jock was fired last month  
from a Washington-area station for making light of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug ``Greaseman'' Tracht said, ``No wonder people drag them  
behind trucks'' after playing a portion of a song by Grammy-award 
winning recording artist Lauryn Hill, who like Byrd is black.

<HEADLINE> Report Probes Atlanta, Amateur Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A tax-exempt nonprofit foundation supporting  
Atlanta's Olympic legacy has spent only $20,000 to bolster amateur 
sports in the 2 1/2 years since the Atlanta Olympic Games, The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation has given grants of  
$10,000 each to two youth golf programs, but spent almost $1 
million to buy the personal memorabilia of its chairman, Billy 
Payne, who founded the organization more than 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletic legacy for the games has basically been nil, and  
that has really been unfortunate,'' said Dennis Berkholtz, 
president of the national team handball federation, which relocated 
to Atlanta in hopes of benefiting from the city's Olympic legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne, who headed the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games,  
says the foundation has ``an admirable record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It has hosted sporting events and given grants for a multiple  
number of years,'' Payne said. ``The process was interrupted when 
the bid was accepted. Now that everybody has got a second wind, we 
are going to pick it back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation has plans for an Olympic museum. It has a  
collection of memorabilia and archived documents that are being 
held at the Atlanta History Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The two $10,000 grants were made last fall to the East Lake  
Community Foundation for its junior academy and the Friends of John 
A. White Park for First Tee for inner-city kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Both programs were connected to Payne or his board members, the  
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me and a lot of people that their objective is get  
the museum built, and that's a legacy, but that's not a legacy for 
kids and sport,'' Berkholtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne says the foundation has spent much time beginning the  
process of looking into the memorabilia and records. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have spent thousands of hours on the museum feasibility  
study,'' Payne said. ``Those are fundamental and appropriate 
undertakings and ones that we are proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sports activists would like to see more done for athletes.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've already got a beautiful (Centennial Olympic) park, and  
I'm glad we've got it,'' said Steve Kearney, president of USA 
Badminton. ``But what is that going to do for the sports? I'd also 
like to have a gym I could play in and teach kids in. The athletes 
are the legacy.''

<HEADLINE> Year in Jail for Fake Kidnap Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) -- A man was sentenced to one year in  
jail for a fund-raiser in which he asked people to donate the 
ransom money he needed to free his kidnapped daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Norbert Michalski, of Sterling Heights, was sentenced Tuesday to  
one year in jail for the October 1997 fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Michalski claimed his daughter had been kidnapped by his former  
wife, but the girl had actually been taken into protective custody 
because her mother had a drug problem, and Michalski knew that, 
Eastpointe police Detective Leon Berdy said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Undercover police sang a karaoke version of ``I Fought the Law''  
at a fund-raiser, and then arrested Michalski on stage for holding 
the event under false pretenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Michalski, 45, pleaded guilty to felony false-pretense.  
</P>
<P>
	The Fraternal Order of Eagles in Eastpointe lent the use of its  
hall for the fund-raiser and dozens of businesses donated gifts for 
auction. About 50 people paid $5 admission.

<P>
	``Everybody just sort of fell for it,'' said Barbara Martin, 60,  
the club's secretary.

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft Begins Mapping of Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Mars Global Surveyor has finally begun  
mapping the red planet, turning an array of instruments on Earth's 
dusty neighbor a year later than originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``All our instruments are on now,'' flight operations manager  
Joseph Beerer said Tuesday at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft, which started its primary mission Monday  
afternoon, has a camera to make wide- and narrow-angle images of 
Mars, and a laser altimeter to measure surface features by bouncing 
pulses of light off the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	It also carries a spectrometer to scan for heat transferred from  
the planet to the atmosphere and to map mineral composition, and a 
magnetometer to gather data that can be used to understand the 
interior of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft has already delivered a preview of the science  
portion of its mission. It has sent back detailed images of such 
features as 16-mile-high Olympus Mons and the planet's ancient 
water and lava flows. 
</P>
<P>
	The surveyor was launched in November 1996 and went into orbit  
around Mars in September 1997. It was supposed to begin its primary 
mapping mission a year ago after using a process called aerobraking 
to tighten its orbit.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Looks to Past for Best Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood may be obsessed with the here and  
now, but the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters 
dipped into the recent and distant past to select the nominees for 
best movie of 1998. Three concern World War II, two are set in 
Elizabethan times. 
</P>
<P>
	Costume pictures are out of fashion in American studios, partly  
because of the cost of creating bygone attire and settings. Another 
factor: young ticket buyers, the core audience, like contemporary 
themes, often laced with sex and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Academy members in the past two decades have often favored  
period films of an epic nature, filmed abroad. Among the best 
picture winners: ``Chariots of Fire,'' ``Gandhi,'' ``Amadeus,'' 
``Out of Africa,'' ``Platoon,'' ``The Last Emperor,'' ``Schindler's 
List,'' ``Braveheart,'' ``The English Patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As well as similarity of themes, the five nominees for the 71st  
best-picture Oscar are filmmaking of uncommonly high quality. 
That's what makes predictions so hard. Here is a rundown: 

</P>
<P>
                  	 *``ELIZABETH'' (7 nominations)    	
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, there wasn't any tortured story with  
'Elizabeth,''' says Russell Schwartz, president of Gramercy 
Pictures. ``It wasn't nine years in the making, it wasn't in 18 
different versions... . Based on Michael Hirst's first draft, we 
all agreed that this was something we had to put on as fast a track 
as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The producers were not worried about ``Elizabeth,'' starring  
Cate Blanchette as England's Queen Elizabeth, being a costume 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secret is how you make it relevant to a contemporary  
audience,'' Schwartz observed. ``What was happening in Elizabeth's 
16th-century court could certainly be happening in a 20th-century 
court -- or suite. We always saw the movie as the 'Godmother' or the 
'Godfather' of the 16th century. We tried to sell it as a 
historical thriller.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramercy took chances on a virtually unknown leading lady,  
Australia's Blanchette, and a director, India's Shekhar Kapur, who 
had never made an English-language film. Amazingly for a movie of 
such scope, ``Elizabeth'' cost only about $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
               	 *``LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL'' (7 nominations)    	
</P>
<P>
	Having established himself as Italy's most popular film and  
television comedian, Roberto Benigni decided to try something very 
different with ``Life Is Beautiful'' (``La Vita E Bella''). 
</P>
<P>
	A Holocaust comedy may seem like the worst of oxymorons. Yet  
director-writer-actor Benigni managed to get laughs as well as 
pathos out of his tale of an Italian Jew who saves his son from the 
horror of a concentration camp by making a game of their 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some accused Benigni of trivializing the subject. At a forum  
after the premiere in Jerusalem, he was warned, ``It's dangerous to 
laugh at the Holocaust.'' Almost in tears, the comedian declared 
the film was ``invented from truth,'' adding, ``It's my best cry 
and scream about the Holocaust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acclaimed at the Cannes Film Festival, ``Life Is Beautiful'' has  
become the biggest foreign-language moneymaker in the United 
States, surpassing 1996's ``Il Postino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Life Is Beautiful'' is only the second film to be nominated  
for both picture and foreign-language picture in the same year. The 
other was ``Z'' in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *``SAVING PRIVATE RYAN'' (11 nominations)    	
</P>
<P>
	``I made this picture for my father and the rest of his  
generation who fought the war,'' says Steven Spielberg of ``Saving 
Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The director, who had dealt with the Holocaust in ``Schindler's  
List,'' turned to World War II with ``Saving Private Ryan,'' 
covering the heroics and tragedies of American GIs from Omaha Beach 
to the French interior. He was determined to make the battle scenes 
as realistic as possible. The gore of the opening D-day sequence 
drew gasps from audiences and earned an R rating because of the 
violence -- unusual for a Spielberg film. That did not seem to 
hinder ``Saving Private Ryan'' at the box office, however. This 
year's re-release brought the domestic total over $200 million, 
displacing ``Armageddon'' as the top moneymaker released in the 
United States and Canada in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielberg's urge to depict World War II began when, as a  
movie-mad teen-ager, he was impressed by the raw realism of the 
1949 William Wellman film, ``Battleground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to make the kind of war film about which a veteran of  
Omaha Beach might remark, 'This is pretty close to what it was 
like,' '' Spielberg has said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
             	 *``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'' (13 nominations)    	
</P>
<P>
	Unlike ``Elizabeth,'' ``Shakespeare in Love'' followed a rocky  
road to completion. In 1991, writer Marc Norman sold Universal 
Pictures on the idea of a young Will Shakespeare who found his love 
and inspiration while barely surviving as an actor and playwright 
in London. A script was written, and in 1994 Edward Zwick 
(``Glory'') was primed to direct, with Julia Roberts as Will's 
love. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they were unable to find the right actor for  
Shakespeare,'' says Donna Gigliotti, who became a producer of the 
final project. ``Sometimes at big studios when things fall apart 
they're pretty hard to resurrect. So it went on the shelf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gigliotti, who was in charge of European production for  
Miramax Films and is now an independent producer, recommended the 
script to her then-boss, Harvey Weinstein. After lengthy 
negotiations, Miramax acquired the project, with Universal 
remaining as co-financer and overseas distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Stoppard contributed to the script, John Madden (``Mrs.  
Brown'') came on as director, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph 
Fiennes became the stars. For a film that cost in the low $20 
millions and has already grossed more than $60 million 
domestically, it has proven a wise investment for Miramax and its 
parent, the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
               	 *``THE THIN RED LINE'' (7 nominations)    	
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years ago, writer-director Terrence Malick made the  
critically acclaimed ``Badlands.'' Five years later he made the 
stunningly beautiful ``Days of Heaven.'' Then for the next two 
decades he made -- nothing, and became an enigma. 
</P>
<P>
	Malick's return to filmmaking with James Jones' war novel, ``The  
Thin Red Line,'' seemed destined to be a film event. While reviews 
were mixed, most critics agreed that Malick's talent for capturing 
a poetic beauty amid human brutality remained unimpaired. 
</P>
<P>
	The screen rights to Jones' novel of GIs during the Guadalcanal  
campaign were acquired in 1988. With customary thoroughness, Malick 
worked years on the script. He intended only to write, but was 
persuaded to direct as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Malick's name was enough to attract actors such as Sean Penn,  
Nick Nolte, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney and Ted 
Danson, some of them for roles of only a few minutes. The company 
shot two weeks of locations in Guadalcanal. The rest was filmed in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	To no one's surprise, Malick has shunned all publicity for ``The  
Thin Red Line.''

<HEADLINE> US Condemns Russian Vandalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department on Wednesday deplored  
vandalism of a synagogue in Siberia and urged Russian leaders to 
speak out against anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perpetrators of this crime in Novosibirsk must be brought  
to justice,'' said spokesman James P. Rubin, citing a rise in 
anti-Semitism in Russia, including recent anti-Semitic statements 
by leading members of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Vandals threw Torahs on the floor and scrawled swastikas and  
anti-Semitic writings on the walls and ceiling of the Novosibirsk 
synagogue in southern Siberia late Sunday or early Monday, 
according to Jewish leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Police confirmed the incident but played down the seriousness of  
the attack. An investigator described it as ``kids having high 
jinks.'' Nobody claimed responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin noted that President Clinton has raised concern over  
attitudes toward Jews and other religious and ethnic minorities in 
Russia and said the United States rejects the activities of 
neo-fascist groups such as the Russian National Unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anti-Semitism, racism and extremism have no place in any  
civilized society and must be strongly combated,'' said Rubin. 
``The issue remains a key element of our dialogue with the Russian 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin commended Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his  
government, however, for condemning anti-Semitism and other 
expressions of ethnic and religious hatred.

	Clinton Addresses Past in Guatemala  
</P>
<P>
	GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) -- Trying to heal old wounds,  
President Clinton today acknowledged the U.S. role in Central 
America's civil wars and repression but he urged that the United 
States now be viewed as ``a partner, a friend.'' Clinton said the 
United States was committed ``to shed light on the dark events of 
the past so that they are never repeated.'' His pledge to seek 
revisions in U.S. laws that discriminate by country in the 
treatment of illegal immigrants won loud applause from lawmakers 
from across Central America who had gathered for Clinton's address. 
Clinton also said he was seeking trade benefits for nations trying 
to rebuild after last fall's storms.

	Dow Hits New High on Gain of 79.08  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot to record highs today as oil prices  
soared, but concerns about technology-company earnings crimped 
gains in the Nadsaq Composite index. The Dow industrials climbed 
79.08 to 9,772.84, surpassing its previous high of 9,736.08, set 
last Friday. The Dow is now up 6.4 percent for the year. On the 
NYSE, advancers led decliners 1,676-1,344. The Nasdaq rose 13.07 to 
2,406.01.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole moved a step closer to a  
full-fledged campaign for president, announcing the formation of an 
exploratory committee today. Mrs. Dole pointed to her experience as 
secretary of labor and secretary of transportation as well as her 
eight years heading the American Red Cross. Early polls have shown 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Mrs. Dole far ahead of other 
potential GOP rivals. And a poll released today showed Mrs. Dole 
with 50 percent support compared to 45 percent for Vice President 
Al Gore in a one-on-one matchup.

	Latest Susan McDougal Trial Opens

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- One of Kenneth Starr's prosecutors  
opened the latest trial of Susan McDougal today by charging that 
her refusal to testify has kept investigators from determining 
whether President Clinton lied under oath about his business 
dealings. Associate Independent Counsel Mark Barrett mentioned the 
president and Hillary Rodham Clinton 10 times during his opening 
statement, signaling the Clintons' conduct will be a key focus of 
the trial. But the lawyer for McDougal said that Starr's tactics 
will also be on trial.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline passengers packed a hearing today to  
tell their tales of alleged mistreatment by airline companies as 
lawmakers moved to improve protections of air travelers' rights. 
One women told the House Transportation Committee of being confined 
for nine hours on a Virgin Atlantic plane that never took off. When 
she declined to take another plane the next day, the airline 
refused to return her luggage. Panel Chairmain Bud Shuster, R-Pa., 
has introduced a bill that would require airlines to pay 
compensation to passengers kept waiting on a runway more than two 
hours.

President Slobodan Milosevic today rejected NATO forces to police a 
Kosovo peace agreement. Milosevic said the U.S.-sponsored peace 
plan is ``a good basis'' for a political settlement of the Kosovo 
crisis. But he continued to reject the key provision of NATO troop 
deployment. Meanwhile, in Kosovo, Yugoslav forces backed by tanks 
torched the homes of ethnic Albanians and sent hundreds fleeing.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs ATM Fee Disclosure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee overwhelmingly  
approved today a measure that would require ATM surcharges to be 
clearly disclosed at the teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel voted, 48-1, to attach the measure to sweeping  
legislation it was drafting that would lift the Depression-era 
barriers between banks, securities firms and insurance companies by 
allowing them to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole dissenting vote came from Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill.,  
who said she believed the banks could sufficiently police 
themselves in operating automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATM surcharge measure, sponsored by the committee's  
chairman, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and its senior Democrat, Rep. 
John LaFalce of New York, was a compromise. It would require clear 
disclosure of the surcharges, which come on top of charges by 
customers' own banks for using a machine operated by another bank. 
In addition, consumers would have to be given the right to 
terminate their transaction before paying the double charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks currently do those things voluntarily at the ATMs  
they operate. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier attempt to ban the surcharges outright, pushed by  
Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, the House's lone independent, gave 
way to the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bank fees are soaring and bank profits are at a record high,''  
Sanders said before the vote. ``Maybe it's time we stood up for the 
consumers rather than large banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A surcharge ban was proposed last year by former Sen. Alfonse  
D'Amato, R-N.Y., then chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, but 
was rebuffed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common ATM surcharge was $1.50 as of last fall, and 64  
percent of the nation's banks imposed them, according to a study by 
congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee voted along party  
lines to approve and send to the full Senate a bill to overhaul the 
financial services laws proposed by Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, 
and opposed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In its current form, it would face a White House veto because  
Clinton believes the bill fails to protect consumers and would hurt 
community lending laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial overhaul legislation being drafted by the House  
banking panel, by contrast, is a bipartisan compromise bill for 
which the Clinton administration has indicated its strong support.

<HEADLINE>  Dole Forms Presidential Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole moved a step closer to a  
full-fledged campaign for president Wednesday, announcing the 
formation of an exploratory committee and saying she sees ``a great 
American yearning'' that she is ready to fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting her qualifications in the race for the 2000  
Republican nomination, Mrs. Dole said she had worked for five 
presidents -- and had held two Cabinet posts -- but she also sought 
to separate herself from other political candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``What does a woman like me have to offer the country?'' she  
asked. ``I'm not a politician and, frankly, today I think that may 
be a plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She pointed to her experience as secretary of labor and  
secretary of transportation as well as her eight years heading the 
American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's experience and that's what counts,'' said Mrs. Dole.  
``I'm not a seat-warmer. I want to get in there and make a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her speech, announcing an exploratory committee looking toward a  
campaign, was heavy on themes and light on specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hear from you, this is a people-to-people effort on  
my part,'' Mrs. Dole told more than 400 backers who jammed a rally. 
``We're going to be laying out positions on all these issues, but 
we're going to be doing it in a thoughtful way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During her speech, Mrs. Dole moved about the room much as she  
had during a presentation that won her high marks at the 1996 
Republican National Convention that gave the 1996 GOP nomination to 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole did not attend Wednesday's event, and she didn't refer  
to him directly. 
</P>
<P>
	After her speech, Mrs. Dole left the room without answering  
reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Early polls have shown Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Mrs. Dole  
far ahead of other potential GOP rivals. And Bush issued a 
statement welcoming her to the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Elizabeth Dole is a fine person and I'm glad she's in  
the race,'' Bush said. ``I think it's instructive to America that 
the first viable female presidential candidate is a Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole also bought half-hour slots of television time in Iowa  
and New Hampshire to air commercials referring indirectly to 
President Clinton's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I run, this will be why: I believe our people are looking  
for leaders who will call America to her better nature,'' Mrs. Dole 
said. ``Yes, we've been let down, and by people we should have been 
able to look up to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's precinct caucuses launch the presidential nominating  
season next February. It's a state where she is well known, with a 
long history of campaigning for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a known commodity and starts out with a lot of  
strength,'' said Iowa Republican Chairman Kayne Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	A Gallup Poll released Wednesday showed Mrs. Dole with 50  
percent support compared to 45 percent for Vice President Al Gore 
in a one-on-one matchup. Bush had a 56 percent to 41 percent lead 
over Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Four out of 10 poll respondents said that, all else being equal,  
a man would make a better president than a woman. Three out of 10 
said a woman would be better. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,014 adults was conducted Friday through  
Sunday and had an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	In a weekend event on his own exploratory committee, Bush  
featured a blue-ribbon panel of prominent national Republicans. 
Mrs. Dole focused on Iowa GOP leaders and her long ties to the 
state which opens the nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not say exactly who would be on her committee.  
</P>
<P>
	At times, Mrs. Dole sounded a theme of individual involvement in  
public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must rekindle a spirit in our hearts, something very  
American, something still alive but buried beneath a thickening 
layer of skepticism and doubt,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``Honesty and 
integrity is what people yearn for today.''

	``If I run, this will be why: I believe our people are looking  
for leaders who will call America to her better nature,'' Mrs. Dole 
said. ``Yes, we've been let down, and by people we should have been 
able to look up to.''

	Iowa's precinct caucuses launch the presidential nominating  
season next February. It's a state where she is well known, with a 
long history of campaigning for her husband.

	``She's a known commodity and starts out with a lot of  
strength,'' said Iowa Republican Chairman Kayne Robinson.

	A Gallup Poll released Wednesday showed Mrs. Dole with 50

American, something still alive but buried beneath a thickening 
layer of skepticism and doubt,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``Honesty and 
integrity is what people yearn for today.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Plans Flight Safety Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A soon-to-retire Navy admiral will lead a  
joint U.S.-Italian review of safety rules for U.S. military 
training flights originating from bases in Italy, the Pentagon 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-day review is designed to prevent the kind of mistakes  
that led to the Feb. 3, 1998, accident in which a Marine Corps jet 
severed cables holding a ski gondola near Cavalese, Italy, killing 
20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the EA-6B jet, Marine Capt. Richard Ashby, was  
acquitted last week in a military court-martial on 20 counts of 
involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide. The Marines are 
likely to make a decision by the end of this week on whether to go 
ahead with the court-martial of Ashby's navigator on that flight, 
Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, who also faces a charge of obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the gondola accident, the Marines ordered a  
tightening of safety procedures, including a review of all maps to 
ensure that obstructions such as ski lifts are accurately plotted. 
Ashby's attorneys argued that his crew was given a flight map that 
did not show the cable his plane struck. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ashby flight originated at Aviano air base in northern  
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint U.S.-Italian review of safety procedures will be  
headed by Adm. Joseph Prueher, who last month finished his tenure 
as commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command and is due to 
retire in May. Prueher previously served as commander of the U.S. 
6th Fleet, based at Naples, Italy, and is a naval aviator with more 
than 5,500 hours of experience in 52 types of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Prueher is to ``assess the adequacy'' of operational and safety  
measures taken in the aftermath of the gondola incident and to 
recommend whether any additional measures are called for. He is to 
conduct the review jointly with Italian defense officials and 
report to the U.S. and Italian defense chiefs in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Corps, meanwhile, is weighing whether to proceed with  
the Schweitzer court-martial next week. The Ashby acquittal 
triggered speculation that the case against Schweitzer, 31, of 
Westbury, N.Y., would be dropped. Jury selection is scheduled to 
begin March 18 at Camp Lejeune, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision is up to Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine  
Forces Atlantic. Marine officials said a possibility remains that 
Pace will decide to proceed with the case against Schweitzer. One 
alternative would be to drop the criminal case and go directly to 
administrative action that could include removing Schweitzer and 
Ashby from the Marines.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Pakistanis Reach Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas (AP) -- After months at sea with  
nowhere to go, the 740-foot Delta Pride is now a ghost ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Its 23-man Pakistani crew is alive and well, and most  
importantly, all of them are now ashore. The 12 remaining crew 
members finally made it to land Tuesday after a nearly year-long 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very thankful to God,'' Capt. Maqsood Ahmed said. ``We  
were prisoners at sea without committing a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta Pride, which transported coal and other natural  
materials, became stranded in Tampico, Mexico, in May when its 
owner, Tri-star Shipping Lines of Karachi, went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	A financial dispute with Mexican officials followed, leading to  
the seizure of the ship's documents and the crew's passports. 
</P>
<P>
	SOS calls were ignored as life aboard the ship became more  
desperate by the day. With fuel almost gone, there was no way to 
run the air conditioner or lights. The seamen lived off rain water 
and whatever fish they could catch. 
</P>
<P>
	With no clean water for bathing and washing clothes, rashes and  
early signs of scurvy were setting in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people were dying in front of me,'' said Ahmed, who was on  
his first voyage as captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no one died, the men were threatening to commit mass  
suicide by November. That's when Ahmed found a $10 bill in a drawer 
and was inspired by the words ``In God We Trust.'' He gathered his 
crew and told them they were making a 300-mile journey to the 
United States for help. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't have much fuel or even enough water to keep the  
engines cool. Also, two of three generators weren't working and the 
other kept catching fire. Any breakdown could have set them adrift. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta Pride made it to U.S. waters on Nov. 24, but was  
denied the ship permission to pull into port because of mechanical 
problems and because it lacked documents guaranteeing payment if 
the ship caused any damage. Crew members couldn't come ashore 
because they had no passports. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven crew members with health problems were finally allowed to  
go home earlier this year, leaving Ahmed and 11 others. Chief 
officer Ahmed Shamshad, who had spent 2 1/2 years on the Delta Pride, 
didn't know if he'd ever see his wife and six children in Pakistan 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have the hope that we would be alive and go home to  
our families,'' said Shamshad, a 28-year seaman who kissed the 
ground when he came ashore Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service said the crewmen  
could remain in the country for 30 days while they worked out 
travel plans and other details. They will stay in a Catholic-run 
refugee center. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the abandoned ship was auctioned for scrap for  
$300,000 to ESCO, a North Carolina company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamshad doubts he'll ever sail again.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is very difficult for my family,'' he said, noting that  
he's spoken to them for about three minutes in the past year. ``It 
was a very bad experience.''

<HEADLINE> Supervisor of CIA's LSD Tests Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Sidney Gottlieb, who oversaw CIA  
experiments during the Cold War that included the use of LSD and 
other mind-altering drugs on unwitting test subjects, has died at 
age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Gottlieb died Sunday in this small town near the Blue Ridge  
Mountains where he had spent his final years tending to dying 
people in a hospice. His family withheld the cause of his death. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA experiments with psychedelics, a project called MKUltra,  
began at a time when the agency feared the Soviet Union might use 
LSD as a chemical weapon or that China would perfect brainwashing 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in a World War II mode,'' John Gittinger, a CIA  
psychologist who described Gottlieb as one of the most brilliant 
men he had ever known, told The New York Times. ``The war never 
really ended for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1950s and early '60s, the CIA gave psychedelic drugs  
to hundreds of Americans who were unaware that they were part of 
the agency's experiments on mind control. 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects ranged from prisoners and mental patients to  
military officers and college students. At least one subject died, 
others went insane and others were damaged psychologically, 
according to firsthand testimony, government documents and court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before his retirement in 1972, Gottlieb concluded that  
the experiments had been useless. 
</P>
<P>
	Gottlieb was also involved in CIA assassination plots, the Times  
reported. During the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, he 
carried out orders to develop a poison handkerchief to kill an 
Iraqi colonel, toxic gifts for Fidel Castro and a poison dart to 
kill a leftist leader in the Congo. None of the plots succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the CIA, Gottlieb and his wife, Margaret, ran a  
leprosy hospital in India for 18 months. They bought a small farm 
near Boston, Va., about 10 miles northwest of Culpeper, and 
indulged in folk dancing and goat herding, two lifelong hobbies.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Get Recchi From Montreal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers obtained right wing  
Mark Recchi from the Montreal Canadiens on Wednesday for 
right-winger Dainius Zubrus and a pair of draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadiens will get the Flyers' second-round pick in 1999 or  
2000 as well as either a seventh-round pick in 1999 or a 
sixth-rounder in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi, 31, was the Canadiens' scoring leader with 47 points,  
but has only 12 goals this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers general manager Bob Clarke said he expects Recchi to play  
for the Flyers against the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, one day 
after he played for the Montreal Canadiens against the St. Louis 
Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers are on an eight-game winless streak, having lost five  
in a row before getting ties in their last three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Zubrus, 20, has three goals and five assists in 63 games this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi, 31, is returning to Philadelphia. He played portions of  
four seasons for the Flyers, leading the team in scoring in each of 
his two full seasons with the team. In 1991-92 and 1994-95, Recchi 
got 105 goals and 157 assists for 262 points and 171 penalty 
minutes in 200 games. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Montreal's second trade in as many days. The Canadiens  
acquired defenseman Scott Lachance from the New York Islanders on 
Tuesday for a third-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke said the Recchi deal took awhile to negotiate.  
</P>
<P>
	``They thought they should get Danius and the first-round  
pick,'' Clark said, but he wasn't willing to give up next season's 
first-round pick.

<HEADLINE> Lamar Alexander Jumps In GOP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- He's left the plaid shirt in the closet  
this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander launched his second bid  
for the Republican presidential nomination with a speech Tuesday 
before a few hundred supporters at the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``I invite you to join me in a campaign to expand American  
freedom, renew its pioneer spirit and bring out the best in 
America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander was to visit Washington today to pick up endorsements  
from Tennessee's two senators, Bill Frist and Fred Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it's on to New Hampshire and Iowa, the states most crucial  
to his candidacy because of their early primary and caucus. He'll 
also visit New York and Los Angeles before returning to his 
hometown of Maryville on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander sought the GOP nomination in 1996, but dropped out  
after the early primaries. He's been gunning for the 2000 election 
ever since, maintaining his campaign organization and fund-raising 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he hasn't done well in public opinion polls and is likely  
to have plenty of competition, including Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
son of former President Bush. Elizabeth Dole, former American Red 
Cross president and Bob Dole's wife, planned to form an exploratory 
committee today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan and New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith have already  
announced their candidacies. The 58-year-old Alexander said he's 
the most qualified, experienced candidate and has the best-defined 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who announced his candidacy last time wearing a  
bright plaid shirt, wore a business suit this year. He has said 
that talk about his shirt interfered with his message in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The former U.S. education secretary and University of Tennessee  
president said he wants to let states decide how to spend federal 
education money, give more autonomy to teachers and principals and 
let parents decide where their children should attend classes. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd like to create a $1,500 scholarship for kindergarten  
through high school students similar to the HOPE program in 
Georgia, which provides poor and middle-class college students with 
financial help. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also said he wants a missile defense system to target  
terrorists and a new branch of the armed services to stem the flow 
of drugs from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	He said inheritance and capital gains taxes should be cut,  
married couples should get more of a tax break, the deduction for a 
child should be tripled and the tax code shouldn't discriminate 
against parents who stay home with their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also took several digs at President Clinton, whom he  
called ``the Wizard'' and Vice President Al Gore, a fellow 
Tennessean likely to be the Democratic presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look behind the screen of their magic show and see what has  
really happened in the last six years,'' Alexander said. ``Twelve 
more countries have jumped over us in high school graduation rates, 
our taxes are higher, our military defense is weaker, it is harder 
than ever for parents to raise children, ... and our standards of 
right and wrong have sunk to a new low.''

<HEADLINE> Roller Derby Back in Glitzier Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The camera rolled and California Quakes  
skater Sean Atkinson, taking a cue from a producer, jumped out of 
his seat in the stands and started taunting a member of an opposing 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, Atkinson and his opponent were rolling around on the  
skating track, exchanging fake punches and body slams. 
</P>
<P>
	The roaring studio audience ate it up. Producers of  
``Rollerjam'' hope cable TV audiences will, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The show is the latest incarnation of Roller Derby, the low-rent  
piece of Americana that entertained audiences for four decades 
before it ground to a halt in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Taped at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando, ``Rollerjam''  
began airing on The Nashville Network in January (it airs Friday at 
8 p.m. EST) and the premiere reached about 1.2 million homes, 
according to Nielsen Media Research. By comparison, cable's 
highest-rated show, ``WWF Wrestling'' on the USA Network, reaches 
about 4.6 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rollerjam'' is taped at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando  
and is shown Friday at 8 p.m. EST on The Nashville Network. Its 
January premiere reached about 1.2 million homes, according to 
Nielsen Media Research. By comparison, cable's highest-rated show, 
``WWF Wrestling'' on the USA Network, reaches about 4.6 million 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Roller Derby, men and women speed around an indoor track,  
scoring points by passing members of the opposing team, who try to 
stop them by shoving, elbowing and slamming them to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it basically follows the same rules, the  
next-generation of Roller Derby is a tad glitzier and sexier than 
its knock-'em-down predecessor, immortalized in the 1973 Raquel 
Welch film ``Kansas City Bomber.'' The skating is also faster, 
sometimes up to 35 mph, because the teams use inline skates instead 
of roller skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it's 60-plus years old, it appears very modern for  
people raised on MTV and the Extreme Games,'' said Jerry Seltzer, 
commissioner of the World Skating League, which calls itself 
Rollerjam's organizing body. 
</P>
<P>
	Seltzer's father, Leo, started the original Roller Derby in 1935  
as a way for Depression-era audiences to forget their troubles. At 
first, the game was based on distance and endurance and physical 
contact was banned.That changed two years later when audiences took 
to the shoving and pushing. 
</P>
<P>
	Roller Derby was first televised in 1948 on CBS in New York.  
Television later made stars of such skaters as Joan Weston, known 
as the ``Blonde Bomber,'' who skated for the San Francisco Bay 
Bombers in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were mean and lean,'' reminisced Diane Frederick, a  
Detroit postal worker, fan of the original Roller Derby and 
spectator at a recent taping of ``Rollerjam.'' ``The women were 
meaner than the men,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	TV producer Stephen Lamb says the inspiration to resurrect  
Roller Derby in its current form was Ms. Weston's death in 1997 at 
age 62, from an incurable nervous disease. 
</P>
<P>
	There are now five teams, each with five men and five women,  
that have already taped shows at Universal: the Enforcers, the 
Quakes, the Florida Sundogs, the Nevada Hot Dice and the Texas 
Rustlers. A sixth team, the Illinois Riot, is being put together. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaters include a cousin of boxer Marvin Hagler; a woman whose  
publicity material describes her as an ordained minister, 
bodybuilder and bodyguard; a former American Gladiator contender; 
several competitive speed skaters; a former homecoming queen from 
Iowa; and the ``creamed corn wrestling'' champion from Daytona 
Beach's Bike Week. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I found out I could knock people over, I said 'Yes!'''  
said the Sundogs' Denise Loden, 32-year-old former speed skating 
champion. ``I let all that aggression out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Loden is romantically involved with Atkinson, the Quakes  
skater whose father and grandfather competed in the original Roller 
Derby. The couple's true-life romance has been incorporated into 
the show's storyline. 
</P>
<P>
	So have the frequent outbreaks of shoving, wrestling, body slams  
and trash-talking between opposing teams that often make 
``Rollerjam'' look like the World Wrestling Federation on skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're just jealous because my muscles are bigger than yours,  
and I work out harder than you,'' the Enforcers' Jannet Abraham 
shouted at Atkinson after he wrestled with her teammate, Mark 
D'Amato, on the track. ``Your workout is at the dinner table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atkinson didn't challenge Ms. Abraham, 5-feet-9 and 197 pounds --  
the preacher known to her fans as the Minister of Pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The violence is part of it,'' Atkinson said, smiling after his  
tussle on the track. ``We're in the Jerry Springer era and I think 
that sells.''

set aside enough reserves for possible losses due to global 
financial turmoil, federal bank and security regulators warned 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement -- issued jointly by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Federal Reserve Board, 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Office of Thrift 
Supervision -- was issued as a followup to a warning in November 
against inflating loss reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	That earlier statement came after the SEC criticized the  
Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc. for setting aside larger reserves 
than needed in order to use the money later during a possible 
downturn in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest statement acknowledged ``continued uncertainty among  
financial institutions as to the expectations of the banking and 
securities regulators'' regarding loan loss reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The agencies said they ``continue to emphasize the importance of  
depository institutions having prudent, conservative, but not 
excessive, loan loss allowances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But they added, ``We recognize that today instability in certain  
global markets, for example, is likely to increase loss inherent in 
affected institutions' portfolios and consequently require higher 
allowances for credit losses than were appropriate in more stable 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agencies said they were establishing a joint working group  
and would, within a year, issue more complete guidance on several 
issues regarding loan loss reserves.

<HEADLINE> German Sex Chain To Offer Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Germany's best-known erotic shop is  
going public -- not with tawdry tales, but with a stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
	The business may be risque, but there was nothing unconventional  
about the announcement Wednesday by Beata Rotermund, owner of the 
Beata Uhse sex shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotermund said she plans to sell shares in her enormously  
successful erotic business beginning in May or June to finance 
expansion with the goal of making it the biggest in the world. The 
deal will be handled by Commerzbank, Germany's third-largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time is ripe for the Beata Uhse stocks,'' the 79-year-old  
Rotermund told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Beata Uhse's sales rose 34.2 percent last year to $96 million.  
The business includes over 50 erotic shops, a mail-order business 
and a chain of X-rated theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotermund plans an initial public offering of 25 percent of the  
company, with about 5 percent reserved for her 750 employees. The 
majority stake in the company will remain in the family. 
</P>
<P>
	A Luftwaffe captain during World War II, Rotermund escaped  
Berlin with her 2-year-old son just before the Russians moved in 
during the closing days of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Settling in a small town near the Danish border, she started her  
own business in 1946 selling information about birth control to the 
wives of returning soldiers. She soon added contraceptives and 
other items to her stock and branched into a mail-order business. 
She opened her first sex shop in 1962.

<HEADLINE> Caution Urged on Y2K Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Journalists should shun the role of ``Chicken  
Little'' in reporting Year 2000 computer problems and avoid 
undermining Americans' confidence in the banking system, a senior 
regulator said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If glitches occur or problems loom, report fully on them, of  
course, but make sure to place the problem in an appropriate 
context,'' Federal Reserve Board member Edward W. Kelley Jr. said 
during a panel discussion at the Freedom Forum Media Studies 
Center. ``Balance and perspective are key.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said the Federal Reserve was conducting ``extensive  
advance planning'' to ensure that banks and savings institutions 
have cash on hand to meet any surge in demand late in the year from 
Americans nervous about losing access to their money if computers 
misread the year ``00'' as 1900 rather than 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, federal regulators are conducting their second  
inspection of every one of the nation's 10,600 banks and S&AMP;Ls to 
ensure that customer records are secure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As journalists report the story over the next 10 months, ``no  
one should be `Pollyanna' about Y2K, but based on the huge amount 
of work being done to prepare, it is just not responsible to be a 
'Chicken Little' either,'' he said. ``We do not expect the sky to 
fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Journalist members of the panel explained the difficulties in  
covering the Year 2000 story. Different sources, for example, 
present sharply conflicting scenarios, ranging from the 
sky-is-falling outlook to more rosy visions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to curb a traditional impulse, which is to answer a  
question once and for all,'' said Jonathan Krim, assistant managing 
editor of the San Jose Mercury News. ``This is about whether or not 
people are going to do the work, spend the money and get the job 
done in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug occurs because many computers programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year won't work properly 
beginning Jan. 1, 2000, when machines will assume it is 1900. Some 
computers can be reprogrammed, but many devices have embedded 
microchips that must be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Planes aren't going to fall from the sky, elevators aren't  
going to the basement and pacemakers aren't going to stop,'' said 
John A. Koskinen, chairman of the presidential Y2K committee, 
referring to several frightening -- but unlikely -- scenarios. ``But 
a lot of things are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While both Koskinen and Kelley painted a generally optimistic  
picture of how well the federal government and the Federal Reserve 
System were preparing for the date changeover, they acknowleged 
there would be inevitable problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said the nation's financial system would not ``freeze up  
or collapse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But is that a guarantee?'' he said. ``No, I can't do that. An  
educated confidence? Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other members of the panel, titled ``Y2K: The Press and  
Preventing Panic,'' were Barnaby J. Feder, a business and financial 
reporter for The New York Times; Jeff C. Gralnick, executive vice 
president of CNN Financial News; James W. Walker, an ABC News 
correspondent, and Jonathan Wolman, managing editor of The 
Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Browns To Review Couch's Arm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns might decide to use their  
No. 1 pick in the NFL draft on someone other than Tim Couch. If 
they do, Mike Leach thinks they're making a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd be crazy not to take Tim,'' said Leach, Couch's  
offensive coordinator for two years at Kentucky. ``I don't think 
there is a better quarterback out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what the Browns planned to find out today at Couch's  
private workout in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, Kentucky's All-American quarterback, will get a chance to  
convince the Browns that he should be their choice with the No. 1 
overall pick in the April 17 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer, who earlier this week observed  
quarterback Akili Smith's workout in Oregon, visited with Couch on 
Wednesday. Couch's workout session also was to be attended by 
Cleveland director of football operations Dwight Clark; 
quarterbacks coach John Hufnagel; player personnel director Joe 
Collins; and director of college scouting Phil Neri. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching hours of game film, the Browns' braintrust will  
finally see first hand what Couch can do with a football. 
</P>
<P>
	With snow in the forecast, the workout will take place inside  
Nutter Field House adjacent to UK's football stadium. The Browns 
had hoped to see Couch throw outdoors, so they could see if he 
possesses the arm strength to handle the blowing winds off Lake 
Erie that are sure to make passing difficult in Cleveland's new 
lakefront stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	How far and how hard he can throw a football have been the  
biggest questions about Couch, who rarely needed to air it out 
while playing at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's ridiculous,'' Leach said. ``He can throw it as  
far down field as he needs to. If he was throwing it 60 yards for 
us, we weren't happy. That meant it was a broken play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under head coach Hal Mumme and Leach, who is now at Oklahoma,  
Couch ran a Kentucky offense that stressed throwing the ball 
underneath coverage. Patterns of 5 to 10 yards were the norm, not 
50- and 60-yard bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran timing patterns with the deepest route about 28  
yards,'' Leach said. ``Tim has all the arm strength the Browns will 
ever need. Hey, if they're looking for a guy who can throw it 60 
yards, there are defensive ends at Kentucky and Oklahoma who can 
throw it farther than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't mean they are quarterbacks. They can't play  
quarterback on the same planet as Tim Couch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was to be assisted in his workout by four of his top five  
receivers at Kentucky, including All-SEC wideout Craig Yeast. Couch 
has spent the last two months working out a game plan for the 
Browns and the other NFL teams who'll attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to run all the different routes from each side  
of the field,'' said Greg Couch, Tim's brother and one of his 
advisors. ``He'll do three-, five- and seven-step drops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leach is confident that once the Browns see Couch in person, all  
this talk about arm strength will fade away for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Tim has a stronger arm than Joe Montana, it's stronger  
than Steve Young's and Fran Tarkenton's. The Hall of Fame is full 
of guys who couldn't throw it that far. But when they had a target, 
they usually hit it.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Ruling Raises Major Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A sign that the apocalypse is upon us turned up this week in  
Overland Park, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice in as many days. The NCAA has been found lacking the same  
thing for which it has smacked many a school. It appears to have 
lost institutional control. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the same thing as misplacing your dentures or  
running over a neighbor's mailbox after a heated argument. Still, 
the two losses combined to make the watchdog of college sports look 
less fearsome, yet just as vindictive as always, not exactly the 
image somebody in the enforcement business wants to be projecting 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a federal judge in Philadelphia ruled the NCAA cannot  
force member schools to use a minimum score of 820 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test as the bottom-line measurement of whether 
incoming freshmen are eligible to play sports. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the men's basketball tournament, its biggest  
moneymaker, the NCAA has a say which teams get in, but not which 
players those teams put on the floor. Can anarchy be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
	``What you have clearly, right now, is no rule,'' spokesman  
Wally Renfro said just before the NCAA asked U.S. District Judge 
Ronald Buckwalter to stay his order. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means you have no consistent, uniform across-the-board  
rule,'' Renfro added. ``That means you have over 500 rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To shake things up further, on Tuesday the NCAA conceded defeat  
in a second lawsuit, agreeing to pay $54.5 million to about 2,000 
Division I assistant coaches whose salaries were capped at $16,000 
for a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
	That litigation dragged on for nearly four years, during which  
the organization stubbornly refused chances to settle for 
considerably less. And yet, in typical NCAA-speak, executive 
committee chairman Charles Wethington described it as a kind of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This association-wide nightmare is over,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the same sense, you might say the NCAA is on a roll -- only  
it's all been downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	Just recently, the organization lost a lawsuit brought by  
students with learning disabilities. Last April, it settled a 
decades-long dispute with lifelong rebel and current Fresno State 
coach Jerry Tarkanian for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Over that time, Tark's lineups included more unsavory characters  
than a year's worth of ``America's Most Wanted.'' But shoddy 
investigative work and suggestions of a vendetta ultimately blew 
the NCAA's case apart. When Tarkanian finally maneuvered the NCAA 
into a Las Vegas court, there was nothing the organization could do 
but throw up its hands and reach for the wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	That could happen again with increasing frequency. Adidas, the  
very powerful athletic shoe and clothing manufacturer, is going 
one-on-one against the NCAA in yet another court for restricting 
the size of logos on some of its apparel. After that, next up on 
the organization's legal dance card is a lawsuit from a 
manufacturer of baseball bats. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of prevailing in courts at all levels, it looks like  
all the bullying and bad karma the NCAA has been handing out for 
years is suddenly coming home to roost. There is a temptation to 
chalk up the organization's increasing woes to an increasingly 
litigious society, but it would be more accurate to think of the 
NCAA as a corrupt cop, arrogant and sloppy after collecting bag 
money for years from the schools it is supposed to be protecting. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, there is something unjust about an organization that  
makes it possible for millions to flow into university coffers, but 
impossible for the ``student-athletes'' who generate most of it to 
get their hands on walking-around money. And there is something 
unseemly about colleges banding together to come up with enough 
``product'' to keep the networks, advertisers and endorsement 
people happy, then turning around and policing one another to make 
sure everybody's labor costs stay low. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent events suggest contradictions like these will be harder  
and harder to defend, let alone control. 
</P>
<P>
	The eligibility standards struck down by a Philadelphia judge as  
unfair to blacks had their origin more than a dozen years ago. They 
came in response to a series of embarrassing news stories about 
star athletes who were unable to read, and others whose eligibility 
was used up without being anywhere close to graduating. 
</P>
<P>
	But almost no one disputes that the state of affairs at the  
moment -- no eligibility standards at all -- will serve the kids they 
were supposed to protect any better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things where we knew something was wrong,''  
said Rudy Washington, who once headed the Black Coaches Association 
and now serves as commissioner of the Southwestern Athletic 
Conference. ``And we tried to get people to listen to us, but they 
wouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a familiar complaint against the NCAA. The difference  
is that now people are telling it to the judge. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stephen F. Austin Haunted by Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	More losses than the team would care to relive marred Stephen F.  
Austin's path to the NCAA women's basketball tournament. None was 
more devastating than the one that occurred on Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after an 85-84 loss to Northwestern State left the  
Ladyjacks an uncharacteristic 7-7, they received horrifying news: 
</P>
<P>
	Katrina Price, the star of last season's team and a revered  
figure at the school, was dead -- the victim of an apparently 
self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
	Price's death stunned the campus and put a team that already was  
struggling into an even deeper funk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had already lost a couple of basketball games. We were  
already low, so that was a hard hit to take,'' senior forward 
Anitra Davis said. ``It took us a while to rebound. Who's to say we 
completely rebounded?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But rebound they did. Stephen F. Austin has won 10 of its last  
12 games, including a 90-77 victory over Northwestern State in the 
finals of the Southland Conference tournament to earn a berth in 
the NCAA field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Jacks, seeded 15th in the Midwest Regional, play at  
second-seeded Texas Tech on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were questioning do they have the character and the  
heart to come back and get it done,'' coach Royce Chadwick said. 
``Well, they played great. For them to turn it around the way they 
have, I've never coached a team I'm more proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick said this loss was so difficult, and his players had no  
one to turn to for solace. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a player that loses a family member, usually  
they're gone for a while and when they come back, the others pull 
together and help them get through the tough times,'' he said. ``In 
our case, we all lost a family member and there was nobody on the 
team to help pull everybody through. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like forever,'' Chadwick said. ``We had counselors, we  
rescheduled a couple of games, we reorganized the majority of our 
schedule for two weeks to give ourselves an opportunity to recover. 
It was the toughest thing I've ever been through as a coach of a 
basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Have they recovered?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we'll ever be 100 percent over it,'' Chadwick  
said. ``But it doesn't possess us like it did at one time. You lay 
down at night and you can't sleep and when you finally do get over 
it, you wake up and before you get out from the covers, you're 
thinking about it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Price's death, this would not have been a typical  
season for Stephen F. Austin. The Ladyjacks have appeared regularly 
in the Top 25 through the years but never once this season. They 
went 25-4 a year ago but are 17-11 now, and their 12-6 Southland 
Conference record was their worst since joining the league 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not expected to lose here,'' said Davis, the team's  
leading scorer (19.8) and rebounder (9.1). ``This was a winning 
program. We probably lost more games this year than any other team. 
That's very disappointing, almost embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the past is past,'' she said, ``and we have to move on and  
start today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game at Texas Tech sends Chadwick back to his roots, He's  
from Floydada, Texas, which is 50 miles northeast of Lubbock. He 
knows the Tech coaches and most of the players and cheers for the 
Lady Raiders when he's not playing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick also knows how hard it is to win at Tech, but he's not  
going to complain about being sent there, not after the kind of 
season his team just endured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have gone to Saskatchewan,'' he said. ``It wouldn't  
have mattered. We just wanted an opportunity to play again.''

<HEADLINE> Laredo Sizzles, Stanley Shivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Laredo, Texas, edged past Lake Havasu City,  
Ariz., to claim the title as the nation's most consistently hot 
city last year, while Stanley, Idaho, dethroned West Yellowstone, 
Mont., as the chilliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Laredo was the hottest place in the 48 contiguous states on 34  
days in 1998, while Lake Havasu City -- No. 1 a year earlier -- 
topped the nation on 33 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Close behind was Lajitas, Texas, with 32 days as the hottest,  
according to the annual compilation of warmest and coolest places 
published in Weatherwise magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	For the long term, Lake Havasu City maintains a giant lead over  
the competition, scoring the top temperature some 511 days in this 
decade. Bullhead City, Ariz., is a distant second at 202. 
</P>
<P>
	West Yellowstone, which had the most cold readings in 1997,  
slipped to a tie for second in 1998 with Gunnison, Colo. Each had 
29 days as the cold spot, compared to 49 for Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the top three was Truckee, Calif., which was the  
coldest place in the 48 contiguous states on 20 days. Then came 
Jackson, Wyo., with 19 days, and Alamosa, Colo., with 18. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was West Yellowstone that recorded the lowest reading in  
the 48 contiguous states last year, at 41 degrees below zero 
Fahrenheit on Dec. 21. The daily average low reading for the year 
was 12.5 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	So far in the 1990s, though, Truckee has recorded the most days  
as the coldest place, with 200, while Wisdom, Mont., is second at 
172 and Stanley is third at 171, based on a review of the annual 
rankings put together by David Hickcox, director of environmental 
studies at Ohio Wesleyan University. 
</P>
<P>
	On the hot side of the ledger, fourth ranking in 1998 went to  
Coolidge, Ariz., and Presidio, Texas, tied at 29 days as hot point, 
followed by Thermal, Calif., with 23 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hickcox does not include Death Valley, Calif., in his totals  
because it so often records extreme temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	As if to prove his point, Death Valley recorded the year's  
hottest temperature, 129 degrees on July 17, and managed 125 
degrees on Aug. 5, 6 and 7. The average daily high for the year was 
97.6. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year was the hottest on record worldwide, according to  
analyses released earlier by NASA and the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Communities that have been the coldest spot 20 or more times  
this decade are: 
</P>
<P>
	Truckee, 200 days; Wisdom, 172; Stanley, 171; Fraser, Colo.,  
160; West Yellowstone, 112; Pinedale, Wyo., 96; Alamosa, 71; 
Leadville, Colo., 65; Gunnison, 48; Winter Park, Colo., 38; 
Jackson, 36; and Creede, Colo., 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Places that have been the hottest 20 or more days are:  
</P>
<P>
	Lake Havasu City, 511; Bullhead City, 202; Coolidge, 189;  
Lajitas, 144; Borrego Springs, Calif., 136; Palm Springs, Calif., 
132; Laredo, 127; Fort Myers, Fla., 108; Thermal, Calif., 104; 
Presidio, Texas, 102; McAllen, Texas, 72; and Yuma, Ariz., 22.

<HEADLINE> Rapper ODB Jailed for Body Armor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rap star ODB was jailed on $115,000 bail  
Wednesday on charges that he violated a new state law that bans 
violent felons from wearing body armor. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer for Russell Jones, the real name of the 30-year-old  
singer for the hip hop group Wu Tang Clan, argued that he needed 
the protection because of his fame. Jones pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to how famous he is, he's at risk for his life,'' said  
Deputy Public Defender Mearl Lottman. ``He has been in gunbattles 
and that's why he was wearing body armor. He was wearing it for his 
own protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lottman noted that police in New York shot at Jones in January.  
A grand jury last month dismissed attempted murder charges brought 
against him in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors suggested that Jones was a danger.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is an issue of public safety here,'' said Deputy  
District Attorney Mary Ganahl. ``The danger is to the community. He 
can go into the community and not worry about the police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganahl also suggested that Jones is the head of a street gang  
named Wu-Tang Clan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that is a musical group,'' Municipal Court Judge Kevin  
Brown said with a smile. ``I have three children. That's why I know 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones filed a statement with the court saying he could not  
afford a lawyer. The court accepted the statement but will examine 
Jones' resources before appointing him a permanent lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was enacted after a 1997 bank robbery in North  
Hollywood, when armor-clad gunmen with automatic weapons wounded 
more than a dozen officers and civilians. Both gunmen were killed 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The law seeks to protect police from assailants who can shoot  
without fear of return fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said it could leave the vulnerable unprotected and  
infringes on the right of citizens to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law is well-intentioned but misguided,'' said Erwin  
Chemerinsky, a professor of constitutional law at the University of 
Southern California. ``People might feel the need for protection 
for so many reasons other than wanting to commit a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganahl said there was no constitutional issue because anyone can  
wear a bulletproof vest, as long as they haven't been convicted of 
a serious felony. Exceptions can also be made upon petition to the 
local police or sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was convicted of second-degree assault in New York in  
1993. He also faces trial on two Los Angeles felony charges -- that 
he threatened to kill the mother of his 1-year-old child and that 
he made death threats to guards at a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones has also been accused of shoplifting in Virginia and of  
being a deadbeat dad, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	In the body armor case, he was arrested in Hollywood on Feb. 16  
when he parked in a no-parking zone and police found he was wearing 
a bulletproof vest.

<HEADLINE> Charges Against Cisneros Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court has rejected former  
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros' effort to avoid a trial on 
charges of lying to the FBI about how much money he paid a former 
mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia on Tuesday unanimously denied Cisneros' 
request to dismiss 18 counts against him on grounds his responses 
during a background check did not influence President Clinton's 
decision to nominate him. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros said in the appeal that Clinton decided not to withdraw  
his nomination after he told the president about the payments to 
the former mistress. He was subsequently confirmed by the Senate in 
1993 but resigned in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorneys argued that because presidents have the sole  
authority to pick whom they please as Cabinet officers, Cisneros' 
comments to the FBI were irrelevant and that prosecuting him over 
them represents the judiciary usurping executive powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court panel called Cisneros' argument a ``bold  
position,'' noting that a trial judge had said it ``would allow 
unqualified candidates for high public office to lie their way into 
extremely sensitive and important positions of government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges grew out of payments that Cisneros, then mayor of  
San Antonio, Texas, made to Linda Jones in 1990 through 1992 and 
his efforts to hide them from the FBI during a background check on 
his nomination to be secretary of housing and urban development. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' trial had been scheduled to begin last fall and the  
appeals court's decision Tuesday will allow it to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who went by her married name at the time, Linda Medlar,  
pleaded guilty last year to charges of lying to federal authorities 
about Cisneros' payments and was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Latest Susan McDougal Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- One of Kenneth Starr's prosecutors  
opened the latest trial of Susan McDougal on Wednesday by charging 
that her refusal to testify before a grand jury has kept 
investigators from determining whether President Clinton lied under 
oath about his business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Associate Independent Counsel Mark Barrett mentioned the  
president and Hillary Rodham Clinton 10 times during a 35-minute 
opening statement that signaled the first family's conduct will be 
a key focus of the latest Whitewater trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of Mrs. McDougal's testimony, ``the other two  
people who might know about these events ... reside in the White 
House,'' Barrett told the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawyer for Mrs. McDougal told the jurors that Starr's  
tactics will also be on trial and that he will show his client is 
being ``used as a pawn ... to get the president or the first 
lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She was not going to cooperate with an investigation that was  
totally flawed and corrupt,'' attorney Mark Geragos said, adding 
his client will testify in her own defense and make clear she is 
concealing no crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, 44, who along with her late former husband,  
James, formed the Whitewater land venture with the Clintons two 
decades ago, is charged with obstruction of justice and contempt 
for defying a judge's order that she answer Starr's questions 
before a federal grand jury investigating Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the third trial for Mrs. McDougal in three years. She was  
convicted of fraud charges brought by Starr in 1996 and sentenced 
to prison and more recently was acquitted of embezzlement in a 
California state trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett told the jurors that Mrs. McDougal refused to testify  
about financial transactions that he charged undercut Clinton's 
sworn testimony at the 1996 trial of Mrs. McDougal, her former 
husband and then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Clinton said, `I never received a loan from''' the  
McDougals' failing savings and loan, Barrett told the jury. In 
fact, prosecutors now have a $27,600 cashier's check from the 
McDougals' S&AMP;L made payable to ``William Jefferson Clinton,'' he 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor pointed to a $5,081 check bearing the words  
``payoff Clinton'' and said the money had been partial payment of 
the $27,600 check which was used to pay off a Whitewater debt. The 
$5,081 came from an account under Mrs. McDougal's control, Barrett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors plan to call as witnesses some of the grand jurors  
who wanted to question Mrs. McDougal as part of their investigation 
of the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos called Barrett's theory ``nonsense,'' and said Mrs.  
McDougal will describe the treatment she received from Starr's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1996 conversation with Mrs. McDougal, Starr's prosecutors  
told her: ``You know who we want and you know what we want,'' 
Geragos told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are sophisticated lawyers,'' Geragos said of Starr's  
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting at the table behind Geragos, Mrs. McDougal repeatedly  
nodded in agreement at her lawyer's comments and periodically shook 
her head in disagreement with Barrett's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors wanted Mrs. McDougal to testify in September 1996  
and again in April 1998, after the original $27,600 cashier's check 
made payable to Clinton turned up in the trunk of an abandoned car 
struck by a tornado south of Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said ``we vigorously and categorically deny that''  
Starr's office had sought perjured testimony to force Mrs. McDougal 
to lie just to implicate the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing on two motions under seal, attorneys alluded to  
the pending issue of what the defense can introduce regarding 
prosecutorial misconduct. U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. 
made it clear that he would consider the issue later in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said last week that any evidence of ``prosecutorial  
vindictiveness'' is irrelevant. The judge's order left it uncertain 
to what extent, if any, others critical of Starr, such as former 
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, could testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal served 18 months for civil contempt after her  
September 1996 refusal to testify. That came after she was 
convicted of four counts of fraud in May 1996 regarding a 
fraudulent $300,000 loan. She served 3 1/2 months of a 24-month term 
before Howard, the same judge presiding at this case, freed her 
because of a bad back.

<HEADLINE> Sore Achilles Will Sideline Ewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Patrick Ewing will remain sidelined  
indefinitely with a sore Achilles' tendon, and just like last 
season -- although not for as long -- the New York Knicks will have 
to learn to live without him. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is that it's hurting, and hopefully when the  
swelling goes away the pain will go away and I can get back to the 
team,'' Ewing said Wednesday after practice as the Knicks prepared 
to begin a stretch of five games in six days. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Ewing plays in any of those games remains to be seen.  
The team officially listed him as day-to-day, although it seems 
certain they will take a conservative approach to bringing Ewing 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to wait until it starts feeling better to decide  
that,'' Ewing said when asked whether he'll wait until he feels 100 
percent recovered. ``I want to be out there, but I definitely don't 
want to miss the season again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, a broken wrist sidelined Ewing for the final 56  
games of the regular season and the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing suffered that injury against Milwaukee, and there was an  
eerie similarity Tuesday night as the Knicks were playing the same 
team as Ewing walked off the court just 29 seconds into the first 
quarter grimacing in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I tore it,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	An MRI revealed no serious injury to the tendon, but Ewing said  
it remained sore Wednesday. He wasn't predicting a quick return. 
</P>
<P>
	In his absence, the Knicks are likely to start Chris Dudley at  
center, although coach Jeff Van Gundy said Latrell Sprewell might 
move into the starting lineup with Larry Johnson moving to power 
forward and Kurt Thomas to center. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another option would be to start Marcus Camby at center.  
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year, when Buck Williams and Terry Cummings were on  
the team and the Knicks went 28-28 after Ewing went down, the 
Knicks do not have a lot of offensive depth on the front line. 
</P>
<P>
	They also are among the worst rebounding teams in the league,  
and Ewing was leading them in that category. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been working hard just in case a situation like this does  
come up,'' said Dudley, who broke an 11-game scoreless drought in 
Tuesday's loss to the Bucks. ``You hope it doesn't happen, but it 
has happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's loss was the Knicks' third by one point in the past  
four games, and Van Gundy clearly has become frustrated with his 
team's lack of mental toughness on the road and the absence of 
sound decision-making down the stretch of close games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am tired of us playing our worst when our best is needed.  
That's the bottom line,'' he said. ``I'm not fearful of anything 
except not winning. It has nothing to do with Patrick's absence. We 
did this drill last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't fearful last year; we're not going to be fearful  
this year. We've played five close games and lost four of the five, 
and we've lost three one-point games in the last week. That's the 
difference between being eighth and ninth for the playoffs or in 
first place.''

<HEADLINE> Office Can Be Obstacle for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Regina Genwright used to press the start button  
on her office copier and hope for the best. Mrs. Genwright, who is 
blind, couldn't work the machine's control panel to switch paper 
size or reduce text. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she simply tells her new voice-activated copier, ``Two  
copies. Double-sided. Print now.'' And it obeys. 
</P>
<P>
	The product, which hits the market Thursday, marks a notable  
step forward for disabled workers at a time when many are still 
unwelcome around the office. 
</P>
<P>
	The copier, made by Pitney Bowes, has a Braille keyboard and  
wheelchair-accessible height and was tested at the American 
Foundation for the Blind, where Mrs. Genwright directs an 
information clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
	It debuts at a time when regulations are being tightened to make  
federal workplaces more accessible to disabled people and 
telecommunications equipment more user-friendly for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The new regulations follow the 1990 Americans with Disabilities  
Act, which bans discrimination based on disability and requires 
employers to take ``reasonable'' steps to accommodate qualified 
disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its passage, 1 million more disabled people have found  
jobs. However, nearly half of the 30 million disabled people of 
working age remain unemployed, and the majority say they'd like to 
have a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a terrible failure of connection between corporate  
America and this community,'' says Charles Riley, editor in chief 
of WE, a magazine for people with disabilities. Companies are 
vastly ``underestimating the contribution that people with 
disabilities can make to companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In part, employers fear disabled people won't be able to carry  
out the little tasks that make up office life: copying, e-mail, 
memo-writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employer feels right up front that he or she is taking a  
risk in employing a blind person,'' says Carl Augusto, president of 
the American Foundation for the Blind. 
</P>
<P>
	People with physical and mental limitations can do many of these  
chores, but less efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something more is needed. We believe it's ease of use of the  
tools people need to be successful in the workplace,'' says Pitney 
Bowes chief executive Michael Critelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology has driven innovations in office equipment for the  
disabled in recent years. But demand has grown slowly, especially 
in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were expecting the ADA was going to cause this market to  
explode,'' says Dick Schieck, manager of the Xerox division that 
handles equipment accommodations for disabled people. ``Quite 
frankly it didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disabled workers will get a boost in 2000 when new regulations  
take effect that force all federal agencies to make office 
equipment accessible to them. In addition, the Federal 
Communications Commission this spring will issue a new rule 
requiring the telecommunications industry to ensure equipment and 
services, such as cellular phones, can be used by everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, designers are hampered by the need to accommodate a wide  
range of disabilities, while -- naturally -- making a profit. ``We're 
not a charity,'' Schieck says. ``I have to look at each investment 
relative to how much good are you going to do out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most products to help disabled people in the workplace involve  
accommodations to existing equipment, such as tilting a copier 
control panel slightly so that wheelchair users can see it better. 
</P>
<P>
	That change can be made by a technician for $500. Other changes  
to equipment range from $50 for Braille stickers to $3,700 for a 
remote keyboard for a high-end copier. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitney Bowes' new copier links a sophisticated ``Universal  
Access'' computer system -- costing a steep $15,995 -- with a normal 
office copier, which runs about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Genwright, the machine provides something money can't  
buy -- more freedom on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, when we had a regular copy machine, I could not do the  
things I'm able to do now,'' she says. ``Now, I don't have to think 
about what I'm going to do if I can't find someone to make copies 
for me, or something goes wrong.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Begins Pitching Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans say they would let states  
shift unspent welfare funds to education as the party hunts for 
ways to boost priority programs while honoring two-year-old 
spending limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, said  
Tuesday that diverting surplus welfare money to schools was 
justified because of falling welfare caseloads, a phenomenon caused 
by the robust economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these states have had a windfall,'' Kasich told  
reporters. ``They can do a lot for education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Details of Kasich's plan were not immediately available. But  
governors have long insisted that the excess welfare funds should 
be left alone because they will be needed when the economy slows 
and welfare rolls increase again. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, crucial committee chairmen expressed skepticism that  
Congress can honor spending limits enacted as part of the 1997 
budget-balancing deal with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can live with the caps,'' said House Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., whose committee will start 
writing the bills in coming weeks. ``Can 218 members of the House 
live with caps?'' he said, referring to a majority of the 
435-member chamber. ``We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can stick to the caps if we have the votes to do  
so,'' Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, 
R-Alaska, told reporters separately. ``I'm not sure Congress can 
take the actions necessary to live within them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Living within those spending limits is among several principles  
GOP House and Senate leaders set last week as their guidelines for 
this year's budget fight with Clinton. With narrow GOP 
congressional majorities and with most Democrats favoring 
additional spending, the comments by Young and Stevens illustrated 
how tough it will be to keep Republicans united enough to obey the 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, leaders said their plan would prevail.  
</P>
<P>
	``To start off this year saying, 'Oh, you know, we're going to  
just ignore these restraints we agreed to just two years ago,' is 
not good,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending bills account for nearly one-third of next year's  
expected $1.8 trillion budget. According to the budget agreement, 
they are limited to $536 billion next year. But there is pressure 
to spend perhaps $30 billion beyond that to boost defense and 
education and to keep programs even with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides honoring the spending limit, GOP leaders agreed last  
week to produce a budget containing gradually growing tax cuts and 
reserving $1.8 trillion in projected Social Security surpluses over 
the next decade. The still unspecified tax cuts would be worth 
about $15 billion next year but swell to a 10-year cost of about 
$800 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate budget committees plan to vote next week on  
spending blueprints for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, 
reflecting the ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	In closed sessions with House Republicans Tuesday afternoon,  
participants said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told them 
of a morning meeting he had with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert told Republicans that Greenspan ``liked the idea of  
buying down the debt'' and providing tax cuts in future years, said 
one GOP leadership aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``He 
was also very happy we held the line on spending,'' Hastert said, 
according to the aide. 
</P>
<P>
	Many House Republicans left a budget briefing by Hastert and  
Kasich satisfied with the budget framework. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a sense in the room that we'd turned the corner,  
that we were back on our agenda,'' said conservative Rep. David 
McIntosh, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Young said he was negotiating with administration  
officials over ways to pay for most of a $1.2 billion emergency 
measure for Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch, aid to 
Jordan and help for U.S. farmers hurt by declining exports. A $1.9 
billion Senate version has drawn administration objections because 
it is paid for with cuts from food stamps, welfare and other social 
programs.

<HEADLINE>  DiMaggio's Son To Be Pallbearer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio's estranged son will be a pallbearer at his  
father's private funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 30 relatives and close friends will attend the  
service Thursday at Sts. Peter and Paul Church, where DiMaggio 
married his first wife, Dorothy Arnold, in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe insisted that his funeral be a private, religious service,  
and his family is intent on carrying out his wishes,'' said Morris 
Engelberg, DiMaggio's friend and attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some dispute about whether New York Yankees owner  
George Steinbrenner was invited. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Steinbrenner asked to come. So did Reggie Jackson and a  
lot of other people he knew and liked, but the family had to say 
`no,''' Engelberg told The Associated Press from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone disputed that Steinbrenner wasn't  
invited, saying the Yankees owner was asked to accompany the family 
to the West Coast. And it was Steinbrenner who declined the 
invitation because he didn't want an exception to the guest list 
made in his case, Cerrone said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's only son, Joe Jr., will be one of the pallbearers.  
The two had been estranged and had not seen each other in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pallbearers will be Roger Stein and James Hamra, the  
husbands of DiMaggio's two granddaughters; Joseph DiMaggio, son of 
ballplayer's late brother, Mike; Joe Nacchio, a friend of 
DiMaggio's for 59 years, and Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be memorial services in other parts of the  
country,'' Engelberg said. ``Steinbrenner said there would be one 
at Yankee Stadium in the Memorial Park there. And, there are plans 
to erect a monument next to the one for Babe Ruth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church's twin steeples tower over the North Beach section of  
San Francisco where DiMaggio spent most of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral procession will drive into Beach Street in San  
Francisco's Marina section, where the DiMaggio family lived as it 
makes its way to the Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, where DiMaggio 
will be buried. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's body was flown from Miami to San Francisco late  
Monday on private jet. The Hall of Famer died Monday at age 84 at 
his home in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio divorced Arnold in 1943. DiMaggio wed Marilyn Monroe in  
1954 and they divorced later that year.

<HEADLINE> Au Pair TV Report Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- More than 70 forensic experts, neuropathologists  
and pediatricians who specialize in child abuse have told CBS that 
its report suggesting that Matthew Eappen was strangled was 
``preposterous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The television news magazine ``60 Minutes'' reported Sunday that  
two doctors believe 8-month-old Matthew was not shaken and slammed 
by British au pair Louise Woodward as prosecutors charged. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to CBS on Tuesday, the doctors said the network  
and the doctors interviewed by the program owe an apology to 
Matthew's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the physicians who signed the letter put their names on  
another missive in November 1997 that attacked Ms. Woodward's 
defense theory. During her murder trial, Ms. Woodward's lawyers 
argued that the baby died from an old head injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Woodward was convicted in October 1997 of second-degree  
murder in Matthew's death earlier that year. The trial judge 
reduced her sentence to involuntary manslaughter and released her 
from prison. She returned home to England in June, after the 
judge's sentence was upheld on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, she settled a civil wrongful death case with the  
baby's parents, Drs. Sunil and Deborah Eappen. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers said they may return to court with what the  
doctors said on ``60 Minutes.'' Prosecutors said there is no 
evidence to warrant reopening the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors interviewed on ``60 Minutes,'' Dr. Floyd Gilles, a  
neuropathologist, and Dr. Marvin Nelson, a radiologist, are both 
affiliated with Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our doctors stand behind the results of more than six months  
of examining the scientific evidence in the Matthew Eappen case, 
and they feel it's fine for people to have differing opinions as 
long as those are informed opinions,'' hospital spokesman Steve 
Rutledge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' spokesman Kevin Tedesco said the 70 doctors who  
wrote the letter haven't seen the evidence that Gilles and Nelson 
have. 
</P>
<P>
	``What would be more interesting is if they could all get  
together some place and look at the evidence firsthand instead of 
basing their opinions on newspaper accounts and hearsay,'' Tedesco 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of letter-writing physicians, led by Dr. Carole Jenny  
of Brown University's School of Medicine in Providence, R.I., said 
the strangulation theory is not supported by medical literature. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty mystified by how in the world people can come to  
a conclusion that totally overlooks the skull fracture, the 
subdural hemorrhages and all of the other things that this child 
had,'' Jenny said Wednesday. ``There's no doubt he had his skull 
busted open.''

<HEADLINE>  DiMaggio's Son To Be Pallbearer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio's estranged son will be a pallbearer at his  
father's private funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 30 relatives and close friends will attend the  
service Thursday at Sts. Peter and Paul Church, where DiMaggio 
married his first wife, Dorothy Arnold, in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe insisted that his funeral be a private, religious service,  
and his family is intent on carrying out his wishes,'' said Morris 
Engelberg, DiMaggio's friend and attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some dispute about whether New York Yankees owner  
George Steinbrenner was invited. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Steinbrenner asked to come. So did Reggie Jackson and a  
lot of other people he knew and liked, but the family had to say 
`no,''' Engelberg told The Associated Press from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone disputed that Steinbrenner wasn't  
invited, saying the Yankees owner was asked to accompany the family 
to the West Coast. And it was Steinbrenner who declined the 
invitation because he didn't want an exception to the guest list 
made in his case, Cerrone said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's only son, Joe Jr., will be one of the pallbearers.  
The two had been estranged and had not seen each other in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other pallbearers will be Roger Stein and James Hamra, the  
husbands of DiMaggio's two granddaughters; Joseph DiMaggio, son of 
ballplayer's late brother, Mike; Joe Nacchio, a friend of 
DiMaggio's for 59 years, and Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be memorial services in other parts of the  
country,'' Engelberg said. ``Steinbrenner said there would be one 
at Yankee Stadium in the Memorial Park there. And, there are plans 
to erect a monument next to the one for Babe Ruth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church's twin steeples tower over the North Beach section of  
San Francisco where DiMaggio spent most of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral procession will drive into Beach Street in San  
Francisco's Marina section, where the DiMaggio family lived as it 
makes its way to the Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, where DiMaggio 
will be buried. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's body was flown from Miami to San Francisco late  
Monday on private jet. The Hall of Famer died Monday at age 84 at 
his home in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio divorced Arnold in 1943. DiMaggio wed Marilyn Monroe in  
1954 and they divorced later that year.

<HEADLINE> American Wins Gold in World Moguls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEIRINGEN, Switzerland (AP) -- World Cup champion Ann Battelle of  
Steamboat Springs, Colo., a three-time Olympic skier who considered 
retirement last summer, took advantage of changing snow conditions 
Wednesday to win the gold medal in moguls in the freestyle World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's event, Finns swept all three medals in bright  
sunshine, led by Olympic silver medalist Janne Lahtela. He received 
26.59 points from the judges with Lauri Lassila (26.12) taking the 
silver medal and Sami Mustonen in third place with 26.07 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Battelle, 31, who didn't ki moguls until 1989 after graduating  
from Middlebury College, where she played soccer. She received 
24.38 points from the judges. A native of Williston, Vt., she 
clinched the World Cup title last month, winning the last event in 
Madarao, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kari Traa of Norway took the silver medal with 24.12 and local  
favorite Corinne Bodmer of Switzerland was third with 23.81. 
</P>
<P>
	The other American skier in finals was Justine Van Houte of  
Telluride, Colo., but one of her skis broke during training and she 
had to compete using a coach's pair, and finished 15th. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty cool, now I can say I was the world champion,''  
Battelle said. ``This is one of the steepest and toughest courses 
on the World Cup. It's the big gnarly one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had pondered retirement last spring but a summer of working  
as an intern for a brokerage firm instead of spending time on skis 
in training camp left her refreshed. A shortened World Cup season 
after the Olympics also was appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth in the last two world championships, she came to  
Meiringen with a relaxed attitude after almost a week of easy 
skiing and seeing friends at home. Training, though, was a little 
unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were frozen ice balls on the course during training and  
I couldn't make it down the course to save myself,'' Battelle said. 
``But it got softer when the sun came out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those mornings where I figured, `If I live  
through today, it'll be a miracle.' It was definitely not a lot of 
fun ... but I didn't realize everybody else was having trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the snow softening, Battelle, skiing next to last in the  
flip-16 format after qualifying second on Monday, nailed her two 
jumps and skied off with the gold medal. Marja Elfman of Sweden, 
who, coincidentally, lost the World Cup title to Battelle in Japan, 
was the only one who could have caught her, but made several 
mistakes and finished fifth.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 79.08, Hits New High / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shot to record highs Wednesday as oil  
prices soared, but concerns about technology-company earnings 
crimped gains in the Nadsaq Composite index. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 79.08 to 9,772.84,  
surpassing its previous high of 9,736.08, set last Friday. The Dow 
is now up 6.4 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, which lagged the Dow for most of the  
day, narrowed the gap late in the session. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 index set its second record of the week, adding 7.00 to finish 
at 1,286.84, beating the record 1,282.73 set Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite ended in positive territory but was  
hampered by ongoing nervousness about technology company earnings. 
The Nasdaq added 13.06 to finish at 2,406.00, still shy of its 
all-time closing high of 2,510.09, which was reached Feb 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were sharply higher, following reports that leading  
exporting nations are close to agreement on production cuts in a 
bid to shore up prices. Oil prices have been rising steadily for 
over a week, recovering from 12-year lows and pushing oil stocks 
higher. Crude oil for April delivery closed 84 cents higher to 
$14.69 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, its highest 
level since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped the Dow, which includes Chevron, which was up 3 5/16  
at 83 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont was another big winner among Dow shares, up 3 13/16 to  
57 3/8, after the company said it would issue a separate stock to 
track the performance of its life-sciences business and was seeking 
alliances with drug companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer-related stocks sank after retailer Computer Associates  
was downgraded by Morgan Stanley, which cited concerns about softer 
demand for computers, increasing competition, and potentially lower 
profit margins. Computer Associates' shares dropped 5 1/16 to 34 
15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer, whose warning of possible lower earnings sent  
the market lower last week, declined 1 3/16 to 31 9/16 in leading 
New York Stock Exchange volume. Its competitor, Dell Computer, fell 
in leading Nasdaq volume. Dell dropped 3/4 to 43 5/16, even after the 
computer maker announced that it had agreed with Amazon.com to 
offer linked Web sites. Amazon's shares climbed 7 3/16 to 137 1/8, 
along with other Internet-related shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks got a turbo charge Wednesday afternoon as Ralph Acampora,  
director of technical research at Prudential Securities and a 
well-known market bull, told a group of Belgian traders that U.S. 
equities, especially blue-chip Dow components, are in the ``early 
stages of another bull market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acampora said low inflation, low interest rates, the technology  
revolution and a peacetime economy are all supporting stocks. The 
fact that blue-chip companies are leading the market means ``the 
market's telling me that it wants to go up, because it's led by 
quality,'' Acampora said, predicting that the Dow will climb as 
high as 11,500 sometime in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen  
Securities, said he agreed that the market is in good shape, for 
now. But he repeated warnings that stocks are already pricey and 
analysts don't expect earnings this year to be knocked out of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody can say stocks are undervalued, and earnings are going  
to be OK,'' Pradilla said. ``But you're going to get some 
unpleasant exposure (to earnings declines) as the year goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds fell, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury up to 5.55  
percent from 5.53 percent late Tuesday. The higher rates didn't 
disturb bank stocks, however. Citigroup shares advanced 1 1/2 to 64. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered  
decliners by a 5-to-4 margin. Consolidated volume came to 1.02 
billion shares, up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 3.55 to 606.48 , and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.69 to 715.14. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies added 1.92 to 401.12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei index in Tokyo surged 2.54 percent as Japanese  
investors repatriated funds to their own markets. In Europe, 
Frankfurt's DAX index eased 0.78 percent, but the FT-SE 100 index 
in London and CAC in Paris each added 0.06 percent.

<HEADLINE> MacLeod Says Resignation His Idea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- John MacLeod denied Wednesday that he  
was pressured into resigning as basketball coach at Notre Dame, 
saying it was the right time to step down. 
</P>
<P>
	He now hopes to return to the NBA, where he spent 18 seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod, who didn't attend the Tuesday night news conference  
during which his resignation was announced, indicated as late as 
Tuesday morning he intended to coach another year at Notre Dame, 
where he has had just three winning seasons in eight years as 
coach. He wouldn't say what changed his mind but said he did not 
leave for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the thing to do, just a situation where it was the best  
move for me to make at the time,'' MacLeod said in a phone 
interview. ``I leave knowing full well that the program is a great 
deal better, vastly improved from when I started. I know that I 
made major contributions to the university as a man and as 
basketball coach. I'm leaving the program in, I think, superb 
condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as a shock to many of his players, who are  
on spring break this week, despite the team's 14-16 record this 
season and 8-10 mark in the Big East. MacLeod called each one 
Tuesday to tell them the news, and point guard Martin Ingelsby said 
he first thought MacLeod was just calling to check up on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the situation is or if Notre Dame asked him  
to leave or what,'' Ingelsby said. ``But I really thought coach 
wanted to come back, and I was really looking forward to next year 
and I think he was, too. I don't think it was him that wanted to 
leave. I think Notre Dame wanted a change and it was just time to 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although sticking to his assertion that it was his choice to  
leave, MacLeod expressed frustration that Lon Kruger was praised 
for winning 14 games at Illinois with mostly underclassmen, which 
is exactly what Notre Dame did this season with two freshmen and a 
sophomore in the starting lineup. He also said the Irish exceeded 
expectations this season and had a strong nucleus for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were picked to finish 12th'' in the Big East, MacLeod said.  
``We finished eighth, one win from sixth and two wins from fourth, 
so how were we doing? We were doing pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod's Notre Dame teams have a 106-124 mark, and his only  
winning years were 1991-92, his first at the school, 1994-95 and 
1996-97. He is the only coach in school history to lead the team at 
least five seasons and still register an overall losing record. 
</P>
<P>
	But players said they thought MacLeod would get at least one  
more year, especially with freshmen Harold Swanagan, Dave Graves 
and Troy Murphy, the Big East rookie of the year, providing a solid 
foundation for next season. Plus, MacLeod had secured commitments 
from 6-foot-5 guard Mike Monserez of Cincinnati and Matt Carroll, a 
6-5 guard from suburban Philadelphia considered one of the top 30 
recruits in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the class he brought in and the way he had the freshman  
class perform this year and the recruits coming in next year, he's 
got all the pieces of the puzzle right there,'' senior Antoni Wyche 
said. ``It's hard to explain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It surprised me, really,'' Swanagan said. ``I figured that he  
would stay. I knew we had a bad season, but not anything like that 
severe where he would get fired. I don't know. I really don't know. 
I thought he was going to stay for at least another year if he was 
going to get replaced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod, 61, said he'll now turn his attention to landing a job  
in the NBA, either as a coach or a general manager. He said he 
won't coach in the college ranks again and would consider a spot in 
the broadcast booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no harsh feelings (toward Notre Dame). I know what I've  
been able to do; I know how the program has turned around,'' 
MacLeod said. ``Did anybody think we were going to come out of 
independent status and be a dominant player in the Big East? It 
took Miami six years to win a Big East Tournament game. We 
accomplished a great deal in four years.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Clippers Keep On Losing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Even Billy Crystal, their most famous  
fan, is having a rough time with this. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been exceptionally hard the last couple of years,'' the  
actor said from his courtside seat at the Sports Arena. ``The guys 
are great guys, I know a few of them. After a while, how much of 
this can you take?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows? The Los Angeles Clippers just keep on losing, with no  
end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	They suffered a 94-75 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers at the  
Forum on Wednesday night for their 17th straight loss, matching the 
worst start to a season in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they're one loss away from having the futility record all  
to themselves, and that could happen Thursday night if they lose to 
the much-improved Sacramento Kings at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rooting for them, I want them to win at least one game,''  
said Eileen Foster, who works in one of the Sports Arena's souvenir 
shops. ``I feel sorry for them. I can't believe they're so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, the Clippers were at home and lost to the  
Lakers 103-99. And most of the announced crowd of 13,380 seemed to 
be pulling for the Lakers. No great surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have made the playoffs just three times since the  
1975-76 season, and have had just one winning season in the last 19 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering this season, they were 416-814 since moving to Los  
Angeles from San Diego in 1984. That's just a little more than one 
win in every three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dudas has been a season ticket-holder since 1989, and he's  
seen a lot of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans aren't rational,'' he said. ``There are a few of us,  
4,000 or 5,000 dedicated Clipper fans. They have to be dedicated to 
cheer for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-year Clippers coach Chris Ford has tried to stay upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's my job to stay positive,'' Ford said. ``It's not easy.  
Winning's easy, losing's tough at any level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Darrick Martin said that for the franchise to change, the  
change must start at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got guys who don't know what's going on, who don't feel  
appreciated here,'' Martin said. ``Everyone wants to feel 
appreciated. I've talked to different guys on other teams who say 
when things are going bad, the general manager, the owner, come and 
talk to you. It hasn't happened here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does get frustrating at times. I don't like to lose. I've  
lost a lot of sleep over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he thinks Ford has handled things admirably.  
</P>
<P>
	``Me, I'd probably be throwing chairs right now if I coached the  
team,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Taylor, a second-year forward who scored 24 points  
Tuesday night, recalled the Phoenix Suns of two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phoenix started 0-13 and made the playoffs,'' he said. ``I  
don't give up, not on anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Lawler, the Clippers' play-by-play radio announcer, thinks  
the team will be helped by the move next fall to the new Staples 
Center, where the Lakers and NHL's Los Angeles Kings will also 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be easier to attract free agents, and the team  
will be well under the salary cap after this season,'' Lawler said. 
``It's absolutely there for the team this summer. I think it's 
going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does 20-year-old Lakers star Kobe Bryant -- at least at some  
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my 20-year career here, I'm sure they're going to have some  
pretty good teams,'' Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why the Clippers have been down for so long, Bryant  
needed some time to come up with an answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad luck,'' he said. ``A lot of bad luck.''

<HEADLINE> Frozen Embryos at Kansas Beef Expo / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Cattle auction.  
</P>
<P>
	The very words conjure up images of clanging gates as cowboys  
drive wild-eyed cattle into the sale ring moments before the 
fast-talking auctioneer starts the bidding. It is a tradition as 
old as the American West. 
</P>
<P>
	But the future is gaining a foothold at the Kansas Beef Expo  
this week. For among the 300 consigned cattle -- representing 11 
beef breeds -- will be 10 frozen embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angus embryos, just seven days old, will be offered in two  
lots of five embryos each. Frozen in liquid nitrogen, the live 
embryos can be implanted in the buyer's recipient cow immediately -- 
or 20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sire is dead, so there is limited semen -- hopefully that  
should make them more intriguing to somebody,'' said Galen Fink, 
owner of Fink Beef Genetics of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, breeders have flushed out several fertilized eggs  
from more expensive donor cows and transplanted them into 
commercial-grade cows. As many as 25 percent of Kansas purebred 
cattle producers use embryo transplants to some degree, Fink said. 
</P>
<P>
	But most such sales are usually made directly, and only more  
recently have embryos been showing up at production sales around 
the country.

	``That is something new, the beef industry is changing. We are  
auctioning off an unborn calf, and they are selling a mating 
between a certain cow and a certain bull,'' said Todd Johnson, 
executive secretary of the Kansas Livestock Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good way to get some of the best genetics available in  
a short amount of time,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not the first time embryos have been sold at the Beef  
Expo, but they are still uncommon here. And the embryos are not the 
only unusual item that will hit the beef sale ring this Friday 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	Also up for bidding will be three straws of semen from a  
Simmental bull. Those sale proceeds will benefit the Kansas Junior 
Simmental Association, which is hosting the national classic show 
in Hutchinson in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nice thing is you don't have to buy the bull or the cow,  
which might be very valuable,'' Johnson said. ``This way you can 
propagate these animals without the expense of purchasing the 
mother or father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, embryos sell for between $300 and $1,000, while a  
yearling calf from the same parentage can sell for between $2,000 
and $10,000, Fink said. A semen straw from a prized bull can sell 
for as much as $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, half of the calf embryos are successfully implanted,  
Fink said.

	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Even though Texas sweet onions  
were planted late this year, the crop is rapidly growing to make up 
for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the wettest falls in history delayed the planting of  
spring onion, according to Joe Pena of the Texas Agricultural 
Extension Service in Uvalde. 
</P>
<P>
	``This delayed the planting of the onions,'' Pena said, ``and  
they did not have time to grow in the fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pena said the mild winter has allowed the onions to grow faster,  
and dry conditions have benefited onions because high humidity 
causes disease problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dry conditions mean less need to use fungicide,'' Pena said,  
``but it also means the crop needs to be irrigated more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are distinct markets in the onion industry and people know  
when to look for Texas onions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The onions in the store now are from Mexico,'' Pena said. ``By  
the time the Mexican onions are sold out, the onions in the Rio 
Grande Valley are just being harvested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the current estimate for acres for harvest in Texas is  
12,400 acres, which is about 1,000 acres more than last year. State 
production for this year is forecast at 347.2 million pounds, an 
increase of 20 percent from last year. Pena said thats enough 
onions to make about 26 billion onion rings.

<HEADLINE> Education Savings Accounts Pushed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers from both parties renewed a push  
Wednesday for education tax legislation that President Clinton 
vetoed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure offers tax breaks for parents who send their  
children to private schools and allows tax-free withdrawals from 
education savings accounts for pre-college expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed the legislation last summer, saying it would have  
provided $3 billion to fund tax benefits for richer families while 
doing ``virtually nothing for average families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional backers believe they have a ``strong, bipartisan  
coalition building here,'' said one sponsor, Rep. Kenny Hulshof, 
R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters are ``struggling against a very large component,  
particularly in this city, who are committed to the status quo; 
they don't want to change,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic co-sponsors are Sen. Robert Torricelli of New  
Jersey and Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would expand the tax-free savings accounts that  
Congress created in 1997, with Clinton's blessing, to provide for 
college expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot easier for parents to sock money away each month  
during a child's early years,'' Hulshof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation lawmakers are introducing this year,  
covered expenses would include private tutors, home computers, 
supplies and transportation. It also contains other tax breaks for 
prepaid tuition plans and employer-paid tuition, along with breaks 
to make it easier for communities to build new public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Families, employers, friends, relatives and other sponsors could  
contribute up to $2,000 a year to the accounts on a child's behalf. 
Accrued interest and withdrawals would be tax-free; the money could 
pay for expenses beginning with kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
	While the average family's tax break would be small, Coverdell  
said, the savings accounts would leverage up to $6 billion over 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts would cost the Treasury an estimated $1.5 billion  
over 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Stephen F. Austin Haunted by Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Stephen F. Austin's basketball season was turning into an  
embarrassment for Anitra Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Here she was a senior, the leader of a team from a school with a  
rich tradition in women's hoops, a perennial NCAA tournament 
qualifier, and the Ladyjacks were losing. It wasn't fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not expected to lose here,'' Davis said. ``We probably  
lost more games this year than any other team. That's very 
disappointing, almost embarrassing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway though the season, Stephen F. Austin stood 7-7. Then,  
just when it looked as if it couldn't get any worse, it did. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 18, two days after a second straight narrow loss, Davis  
and her teammates learned the horrifying news that Katrina Price, 
the star of last year's team and a revered figure in the SFA 
community, had died, apparently from a self-inflicted shotgun 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone was stunned -- players, coaches, family and friends.  
Many wondered if the Ladyjacks would get over it. 
</P>
<P>
	But they did, and Saturday night, Stephen F. Austin will play  
Texas Tech in the first round of the NCAA Midwest Regional. The 
Ladyjacks finished with 10 victories in their last 12 games and won 
the Southland Conference tournament to earn their NCAA berth. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were questioning do they have the character and the  
heart to come back and get it done,'' SFA coach Royce Chadwick 
said. ``Well, they played great. For them to turn it around the way 
they have, I've never coached a team I'm more proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick said Price's death was such a burden on his players  
because they had no one to turn to for solace. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a player that loses a family member, usually  
they're gone for a while and when they come back, the others pull 
together and help them get through the tough times,'' he said. ``In 
our case, we all lost a family member and there was nobody on the 
team to help pull everybody through. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like forever,'' Chadwick said. ``We had counselors, we  
rescheduled a couple of games, we reorganized the majority of our 
schedule for two weeks to give ourselves an opportunity to recover. 
It was the toughest thing I've ever been through as a coach of a 
basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick wonders if those who knew Price will ever recover  
completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we'll ever be 100 percent over it,'' he said.  
``But it doesn't possess us like it did at one time. You lay down 
at night and you can't sleep and when you finally do get over it, 
you wake up and before you get out from the covers, you're thinking 
about it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the players still feel the pain of their teammate's  
loss. But now when she thinks about Price, Davis tries to picture 
how she played and how she used to respond when things got tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a fierce competitor in everything and didn't accept  
losing when we played here together,'' said Davis, the team's 
leading scorer (19.8) and rebounder (9.1). ``It inspired me to go 
out and make it important. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the game and I wanted to go out and play like I love  
the game,'' she said. ``I think it helped. It turned the season 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turnaround enabled Stephen F. Austin to extend its run of  
consecutive NCAA tournament appearances to 12. It's the 14th time 
overall the Ladyjacks have made the field and maybe, Davis muses, 
all is becoming right again in the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think now,'' she said, ``we're a little more deserving to  
wear the Ladyjack uniform.''

<HEADLINE> Quiet Irish Play Is Making Noise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Four men and a woman gather to swap stories, some  
of them ghostly, in a remote Irish pub, and from their yarns is 
woven a tapestry of love, loss and perhaps even healing. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the essence of ``The Weir,'' a play slight in plot but  
rich in character and feeling that, for all its quiet intimacies, 
has been making quite a noise. 
</P>
<P>
	Conor McPherson's drama initially opened for a mere monthlong  
run two summers ago in a 60-seat London theater. Since then, it has 
generated three companies of actors, the first of which will lead 
the play to Broadway this month. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 12, the Royal Court production of ``The Weir'' produced  
further clamor, winning the Olivier Award for the best play of 1998 
in a hotly contested race with Michael Frayn's ``Copenhagen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It all seems very weird,'' says McPherson, a shy, stocky  
Dubliner with carrot-colored hair. ``I just stay home and wait for 
the checks,'' the 27-year-old playwright deadpans. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadway previews begin March 23, before an April 1 opening. The  
replacement London cast opened March 8, while yet a third cast has 
embarked on an 11-week British tour. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson could scarcely have imagined this when he wrote ``The  
Weir,'' set in a country pub in County Leitrim, northwest Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of plays are earmarked all along for the West End and  
Broadway. That is their reason to exist,'' he says. ``But this has 
been so organic -- if the play had just been around for those first 
three weeks, I would have been happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the universal is grounded in the particular, ``The Weir''  
proves it, as did another award-winning 1990s play set in an Irish 
backwater, Brian Friel's ``Dancing at Lughnasa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Weir,'' says director Ian Rickson, ``draws upon all sorts  
of needs we have at this moment to do with community and contact 
and intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You spend an evening in real time and in a real place with  
real characters on a human journey that is so necessary, needed, 
desired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the start, the play seems to be little more than an exercise  
in banter, as bartender Brendan greets some pub regulars on a windy 
day during which his all-important Guinness tap is broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the booze must be poured out of a bottle, and with it  
come various eerie stories of increasing intensity designed to 
impress Valerie, the new girl in a very male town. 
</P>
<P>
	What the men competing for her attention can't predict is that  
Valerie has on reserve her own story, which is that much more 
genuinely disturbing and heart-stirring for being true. 
</P>
<P>
	No sooner has she spoken her narrative than Jack, the pub's  
senior denizen, offers up his second tale of the play, this time 
drawing from a well of emotion that Valerie's presence has gently 
yet piercingly evoked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack is sort of feminized by Valerie,'' Rickson says. ``He's  
able to tell a story about himself that he would never have been 
able to tell at the beginning of the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And although the town itself possesses its own weir, or dam, the  
play suggests that unlike the flow of water, feelings cannot be 
easily controlled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read it, and I cried for about an hour,'' Jim Norton, the  
play's very first Jack, says of the play. ``I just thought, `This 
is a major new voice' -- the ability and maturity and ease with 
which Conor writes about very complex subjects. `If I don't play 
this part, I'll die.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Norton, Kieran Ahern as the sweet-natured mama's boy Jim, and  
Brendan Coyle as the ever-watchful bartender together make up the 
play's so-called ``home team.'' All three have been with ``The 
Weir'' since its July 4, 1997, debut at the Royal Court's tiny 
Theater Upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Coyle has spent more than 300 performances listening  
attentively to the others, since Brendan is the only character who 
doesn't get to tell his own story. 
</P>
<P>
	Does his mind ever wander?	   ``It's very, very difficult, and that's the key. If I don't  
listen, I have a bad night,'' says Coyle, who won his own Olivier 
for best supporting performer in a play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, you find yourself thinking, `Oh, I forgot to set the  
video,' but you have to fight that. It's like meditation: You have 
to get rid of any outside rubbish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's talk of a Tony Award in June. But as the members of the  
original company get ready for New York, they just hope such an 
unshowy and deeply felt play can hold its own on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just want it to work,'' says Michelle Fairley, the  
northern Irish actress who plays Valerie. ``Through working on it, 
you love it so much that it becomes like your baby, so you just 
want everybody to like your baby.''

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Education Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill that would grant the states greater  
freedom in spending federal education money gained momentum in 
Congress Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate broke through six days of procedural jousting and  
agreed to vote Thursday on both the bill and amendments demanded by 
Democrats to implement President Clinton's education proposals, 
including federal subsidies for hiring thousands of new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, however, Republicans continued to block Democrats'  
efforts to attach Clinton's proposals to their so-called ed-flex 
bill reducing number of strings the federal government puts on 
education aid to states and local school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans promised a final vote on their bill Thursday,  
telling Democrats they could bring up Clinton's new-teacher plan 
later as part of a larger education bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, visiting Guatemala and El Salvador, issued a statement  
saying he was pleased the Senate agreed to an up-or-down vote on 
hiring 100,000 new teachers ``to reduce class size in early 
grades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he would ``vigorously oppose'' amendments by  
Senate Republicans to instead devote to special education the money 
he wants for reducing class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Clinton isn't thinking  
veto -- at least not yet. ``We'll wait and see how it comes out in 
the Senate,'' Siewert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota predicted  
that the final package will pass overwhelmingly. ``We've reached a 
point where we are going to be able to finish this bill,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans didn't seem eager to make accommodations as  
they rejected a Democratic proposal to add more state requirements 
to the ed-flex bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't improve education unless you admit you have a  
problem,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., who called the 
``ed-flex'' bill a first step in addressing what he called 
education's core problem: too many rules and not enough local 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic proposal for new money for teachers to reduce  
class sizes would only add money without fixing those problems, 
said Goodling, chairman of the House Education Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the ed-flex measure, states and school districts could  
apply federal money to programs that serve them best, Republicans 
say. For example, states could allow schools to use money targeted 
for low-income students or for training math and science teachers 
on other programs that benefit the entire school. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats also support that idea, but insist that schools  
need more federal money to hire more teachers to reduce class 
sizes. Rep. Bill Clay, D-Mo., was offering one such amendment in 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, in a spending bill compromise, Congress approved $1  
billion for the states to use to hire new teachers. Clinton has 
said his plan to hire a total of 100,000 new teachers for the 
nation's schools would require $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a vital first step,'' said Rep. David Wu, D-Ore.  
``Unfortunately, some in Congress don't want to continue past the 
first year, leaving school districts in budgetary limbo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since education's emergence as a popular issue of concern to  
voters, both parties have rushed to be the first to pass an 
education bill this session, leading to frustration on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The scramble is particularly keen in the Senate, where  
retirement announcements leave some big seats up for grabs in the 
2000 elections in New York, New Jersey, Florida and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to raise all of these presidential programs  
often, to get the GOP voting against popular programs,'' said Sen. 
Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who brought ed-flex to the Senate with 
Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. ``We've started off with a 
program aimed at the 2000 elections and I find that extremely 
distasteful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the ed-flex bill passes, it would not affect many of the  
rules governing the $15 billion in education spending for 
kindergarten through high school. By law, states cannot waive rules 
regarding a school's safety, maintenance or assurance of student 
civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The states also could not waive regulations under the federal  
special education law, which many states view as the most expensive 
and time-consuming to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill is HR 800; the Senate bill is S 280.

<P>
        The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ranked 48 states  
on their ability to handle a mild recession based on the projected 
size of their reserve funds at the end of the current fiscal year. 
The first figure indicates the three-year shortfall or surplus in reserves 
in millions of dollars and the second figure is the percentage that 
equals of the state's 1999 budget. A shortfall is denoted with a minus 
sign and a surplus with a plus sign. Alaska and Hawaii were not included 
in the study.

<HEADLINE> Senator Chides Reno Over Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of a Senate spending panel  
accused the Justice Department on Tuesday of playing politics with 
proposals to cut more than $1.4 billion from community law 
enforcement programs in the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., told Attorney General Janet Reno the  
cuts were sought to put his subcommittee in the ``untenable 
position'' of having to find money elsewhere to pay for the 
programs, while another lawmaker asked why the $21 billion budget 
request included no money for new Border Patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno was also questioned about the independent counsel law,  
which is under fire from both political parties and scheduled to 
expire in June unless Congress renews it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg, who runs the Appropriations panel that funds the  
department, noted the administration had changed its position 
``basically 180 degrees'' to oppose renewal of the act, which 
provides for independent investigation of allegations concerning 
certain senior administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, who has sought seven independent counsels over the past  
six years but has opposed an outside investigation of alleged 
fund-raising abuses during President's Clinton 1996 re-election 
campaign, said there were problems with the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the attorney general has that authority and  
responsibility under the act, you're not going to get away from the 
issue of is the independent counsel independent,'' she said. 
``There are going to be questions raised, as there are constantly 
over the decisions that I make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding Justice's budget plan, Gregg criticized proposals to  
eliminate a $250 million juvenile accountability block grant and a 
$523 million local law enforcement block grant, and to reduce 
grants for state prisons by nearly $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The department, meanwhile, wants $600 million to expand an  
existing community policing program to help states hire between 
30,000 and 50,000 police officers over five years. The program 
known as COPS, enacted in 1994, is nearing its original goal of 
putting 100,000 police officers on the nation's streets. The new 
money would be for even more officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've made politically attractive choices at the expense of  
this committee,'' said Gregg, noting that the programs Justice 
wants to cut have ``been strongly supported, up until now, jointly 
by this committee and the administration.'' Justice's proposal 
``was done in order to put us ... in the untenable position of 
having to go out and find the money to put back in those 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said crime is down significantly nationwide, and state and  
local law officers shouldn't become too dependent on the federal 
government. She also said the proposed budget still contains 
funding for juvenile justice and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg said the subcommittee may accede to the administration's  
plan to cut the three programs, but would not back expanding COPS, 
saying the money would be spent elsewhere, such as on beefing up 
border patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, criticized Justice's  
decision not to hire 1,000 Border Patrol agents authorized by a 
1996 immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno called it an ``extraordinarily high priority,'' but said  
recruiting difficulties forced cancellation of some classes for new 
agents.

<HEADLINE> French Bank Takeover Faces Hurdles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Banque Nationale de Paris' surprise $37.2 billion  
bid for two rival French banks faces serious hurdles including the 
politically sensitive issue of layoffs in a country with high 
unemployment and possible clashes in management styles. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by BNP to create a $1 trillion world-leading banking  
group in an unprecedented three-way merger with Paribas and Societe 
Generale comes as European banks are joining forces to better 
compete in a market transformed by a new common currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The unsolicited offer is evidence that French banks, often  
criticized for their slowness to consolidate, are moving 
frantically to catch up with their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro has the effect of increasing competitive pressures in  
Europe,'' BNP Chairman Michel Pebereau said at a news conference 
Wednesday. ``France needed to create a banking champion. Our offer 
sets this up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, the combined bank would be a formidable  
competitor, setting the stage for international acquisitions and 
possible inroads in the U.S. market, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they are more profitable in France, they will be better  
equipped to attack the U.S. and other world markets,'' said Yves 
Burger, a banking analyst at Standard and Poor's in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	But another cautioned that initially, ``top management will be  
too busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They won't have the time or the resources to look to the U.S.  
market for the next few years,'' said Evagelos Kavouriadis, 
European banking analyst at Bernstein Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While French banks have been slow to expand into the United  
States, several European banks are making moves, including Deutsche 
Bank, HSBC, Dresdner and ABN Amro. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 trillion in combined assets under the merger proposal  
would easily exceed the size of what was going to be the world's 
biggest bank -- the $800 billion institution that would be created 
by the pending acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp. by Deutsche Bank 
AG. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP's takeover bid, announced late Tuesday by regulators from  
the Paris stock exchange, comes just weeks after Societe Generale 
moved to buy Paribas for $17.07 billion to create Europe's 
second-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	While regulators suspended trading Wednesday on shares of all  
three banks on the Paris stock exchange, other European banks 
rallied on merger expectations. Dresdner Bank, seen as a merger 
candidate, rose 5.5 percent in trading in Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers saw BNP's move as defensive, especially after the  
bank was rejected as a partner in the privatization of the 
state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said BNP's bid, though feasible, faces difficulties  
because its hostile nature means management will have a hard time 
working out the complicated structure of a new entity. 
</P>
<P>
	Paribas and Societe Generale on Wednesday described BNP's offer  
as ``risky,'' adding that they didn't see it as ``friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both banks said they would study the proposal. BNP's takeover  
offer would scuttle Societe Generale's plans to buy Paribas, an 
investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, possible staff reductions would be extremely  
politically sensitive in this strike-prone country. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP has said there will be no massive layoffs in France and that  
they will maintain the group's two major retail banking networks. 
Staff reductions will come largely from an expected wave of 
retirements, BNP said. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said the deal's success depends on whether a joint  
management team can wring out major cost savings from BNP and 
Societe Generale's overlapping domestic networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't lay off workers, the deal doesn't make sense,''  
Kavouriadis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The French Finance Ministry and the Bank of France, in a joint  
statement Wednesday, said BNP's takeover offer will have to respect 
the need to preserve jobs -- an expression of government anxiety 
over France's 11.4 percent jobless rate.

<P>
	NEW PHILADELPHIA, Ohio (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy who helped  
search for a missing 5-year-old playmate after the little girl's 
mother paid him $5 was convicted Wednesday of stabbing the child to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge found Anthony Harris guilty of juvenile charges of  
murder in the slaying last summer of Devan Duniver. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony could be held until he is 21. No sentencing date was  
set. 
</P>
<P>
	Devan's body was found June 28 underneath brush in the woods  
near the complex of townhouses where she and Anthony lived in this 
city about 70 miles south of Cleveland. Prosecutors said Anthony 
confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Devan's mother, Lori Duniver, said the boy joined the search for  
her daughter after she gave him $5. He wanted the money so he could 
go to a tractor pull.

<HEADLINE> Chechnya Hunts Kidnap Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechnya's president called top police and  
security officials together today to plan action against foes whom 
he accused of abducting a top Russian general in order to draw 
Russia into war. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to throw the Chechen people into the abyss of war,''  
President Aslan Maskhadov said on Chechen television late Tuesday, 
referring to a number of warlords whose armed gangs roam Chechnya 
with virtual impunity. 
</P>
<P>
	He specifically accused two key opponents, Shamil Basayev and  
Salman Raduyev, of masterminding the abduction. The pair has 
intensified efforts to oust him from power in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you must, even put Basayev in jail,'' Maskhadov said.  
``Those people don't care for the people's needs. We had war for 
two years, and we don't want to have it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and Chechnya fought a 1994-1996 war in which the Chechens  
won de-facto independence. Moscow still claims the republic as part 
of Russia, but leaves it to manage own affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions were ratcheted up a notch by the latest confrontation,  
in which kidnappers dragged police Maj. Gen. Gennady Shpigun off an 
airplane just before it was to take off Friday from the Chechen 
capital Grozny. So far, no one has claimed responsibility or named 
any conditions for his release. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Moscow threatened military attacks on the republic  
if Shpigun is not found. Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin also 
ordered more troops to the border areas around Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Shpigun's disappearance was a blow to Maskhadov, who has  
Moscow's backing but has seen his authority undermined by violence 
and a wave of kidnappings of Russians and foreigners alike. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is still smarting from the high-profile abduction of  
Valentin Vlasov, Russia's envoy to Chechnya, who was held for six 
months and released late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov, however, warned the Russian government against using  
force if Shpigun isn't found soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Threats and blackmail are unacceptable,'' Maskhadov said  
through his spokesman, Mairbek Vachagayev. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin discussed the situation late Tuesday with President  
Boris Yeltsin, who is hospitalized with an ulcer, but no decisions 
were announced. The Russian government scheduled a meeting today to 
discuss a response. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on Russian television late Tuesday, Yeltsin's deputy  
chief of staff, Oleg Sysuyev, said the government would try to 
prevent hostilities, but may launch strikes against ``bandits'' in 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bandits will be punished. There will be a full-scale war  
against them,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Professor Wins $1.2M Religion Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ian Barbour, a nuclear physicist and theologian  
who has devoted his career to reconciling science and faith, won 
the $1.24 million Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Templeton is the world's richest annual prize for  
achievement in any field. 
</P>
<P>
	The 75-year-old Barbour, who holds both a theology degree and a  
Ph.D. in nuclear physics, teaches at Carleton College in 
Northfield, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent the past 15 years examining moral issues raised by  
technological advances such as cloning and nuclear power. He did 
doctoral work with Enrico Fermi, one of the fathers of the atomic 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to think science has all the answers, because it's a  
very powerful tool,'' Barbour said Wednesday. But he insisted that 
science cannot answer humanity's spiritual and ethical questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize was established in 1972 by mutual fund entrepreneur  
John M. Templeton to spotlight advances in a field omitted by the 
Nobel prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour will accept the award at a May 17 ceremony at the  
Kremlin. The site symbolizes Russia's move from enforced scientific 
atheism toward toleration of faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour is the ninth winner engaged in science and religion.  
Other recipients have included Mother Teresa, the Rev. Billy 
Graham, Alexander Solzhenitsyn and prison evangelist and Watergate 
figure Charles Colson. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour plans to give some of the prize money to Carleton  
College and his local United Church of Christ congregation. But $1 
million will go to the Center for Theology and the Natural 
Sciences, affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union in 
Berkeley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Beijing, Barbour was chairman of the physics department  
at Kalamazoo College in Michigan before he moved to Carleton in 
1955 to teach both physics and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, he published ``Issues in Science and Religion,''  
considered a pioneering work in relating the two fields. His recent 
works include ``Ethics in an Age of Technology'' (1993) and 
``Religion and Science: Historical and Contemporary Issues'' 
(1997). 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour said that when he started in the field, there were two  
main ways of looking at science and religion: They were either in 
conflict or two strictly separate domains. At the time he favored 
the latter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very attractive solution, in a way,'' he said. ``But  
ultimately we're whole people. We can't live in two worlds.''

<HEADLINE> Money for Clinton Museum Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Just days before President Clinton is  
due in his native Hope, Arkansas lawmakers rejected a $500,000 plan 
to make improvements at his boyhood-home-turned-museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sandra Rodgers, D-Hope, rushed from the House chamber after  
the House defeated her bill Tuesday and cried in the Capitol hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want President Clinton to know that they don't support  
him, that's fine with me, I'll try to convey that message for 
him,'' said Ms. Rodgers, her voice breaking. ``I'm just really 
mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many representatives who opposed the bill said it had nothing to  
do with Clinton, but with the source of the money. The project 
would have been funded immediately, instead of having to compete 
later with other projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which needed 75 votes in the 99-member House, was  
defeated 41-8. Most members, not wanting to appear opposed to 
Clinton, either didn't vote or cast a ``present'' vote. 
</P>
<P>
	One representative said he opposed the funding because he  
opposes Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have voted for impeachment, and I think he has  
disgraced our state in a lot of ways,'' said Rep. Jim Bob Duggar, 
R-Springdale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rodgers had hoped to have the funding approved before  
Friday, so she could present Clinton with a copy of the legislation 
when he makes his first visit to his birthplace home. Clinton is 
attending the dedication of the Virginia Clinton Kelly Memorial 
Garden in memory of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum, which opened in June 1997, has received about $1  
million in donations from individuals and corporations. Executive 
Director Becky Moore said the state money would have sped up work 
so that the museum could be part of the national park system. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500,000 would have funded a 40-seat theater, computer room,  
board room, gift shop expansion and relocation of the director's 
office at the tourist center next to Clinton's home. Some of the 
money also could be used to spruce up the grounds.

<HEADLINE> How Much Did Citigroup Pay Execs? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc., the nation's largest financial  
company, paid their top two executives handsomely last year. How 
handsomely? 
</P>
<P>
	Six major newspapers reported different totals for the salary,  
bonus and stock options paid to John S. Reed and Sanford I. Weill, 
co-chairmen and co-chief executive of the New York financial giant. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest discrepancies were over the Weill's compensation,  
which ranged from $166.9 million, according to The Wall Street 
Journal and $27.2 million according to The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Schlein, a spokesman for Citigroup, ``I wouldn't say any  
of them were wrong. They just added up the numbers differently.'' 
(Eventhough the company went so far as to give the media a 
four-page crib sheet along with its proxy statement to help 
reporters decipher the accounting.) 
</P>
<P>
	So, just what did Weill earn?  
</P>
<P>
	The board of directors of Citigroup, which was formed last  
October through the merger of Citibank and Travelers Group, agreed 
both Weill and Reed would be paid the same base compensation: $9.5 
million, plus 1.75 million stock options with a market value of 
about $16.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not that simple.  
</P>
<P>
	Weill was paid a salary of $1.03 million and a bonus of $6.17  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the easy part. But there's more. His restricted stock  
awards of $3.1 million, and other compensation, such as a personal 
trip taken on a corporate jet, of $237,253. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the stock options. In addition to the 1.75 million options  
awarded by the board, Weill actually cashed out some 7.1 million 
previously awarded stock options, and realized a $156.6 million 
gain. Some people didn't include this money because it wasn't 
technically part of his 1998 compensation package. 
</P>
<P>
	For Reed, it was easy: $1.67 million salary, $7.86 million  
bonus, and the 1.75 million options (which can't be exercised until 
2004, but have a market value of $16.9 million.)

<HEADLINE> Big Asian Markets Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asia's top three stock markets -- Tokyo, Hong  
Kong and Singapore -- all posted strong gains Wednesday, though 
smaller exchanges were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped  
383.30 points, or 2.54 percent, to 15,480.00, its highest close 
since Aug. 10. On Tuesday, the Nikkei had climbed 317.65 points, or 
2.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have been rising ever since electronics giant Sony  
announced Tuesday that it would undertake aggressive restructuring, 
including cutting 17,000 jobs over four years. Sony's stock 
skyrocketed 8.3 percent, after a 8.9 percent rally Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony is seen as a leader among Japanese firms and its move  
fueled optimism that other Japanese companies would also become 
more aggressive about restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall market's sentiment has improved substantially,''  
said Masaru Arai, general manager at Ryoko Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market rally helped boosted demand for the Japanese  
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar fell to 120.54 yen, down 1.22 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo, and less than its late New York level 
of 121.00 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares also surged for a second consecutive day,  
as sharp gains in banking giant HSBC Holdings PLC and buying in the 
futures market pushed the key stock index to close at a 15-week 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index jumped 216.07 points, or 2.1 percent, to  
10,749.72. The Hang Seng had gained 2.6 percent on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC's shares gained 2.6 percent to their highest close in  
nearly a year. Analysts said international investors have been 
bullish on HSBC's prospects ever since the banking group unveiled 
two weeks ago its plan to launch a secondary listing on the New 
York Stock Exchange later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, positive sentiment on the property sector pushed  
the key stock index sharply higher. The Straits Times Index rallied 
2 percent, or 29.01 points, to 1,469.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stocks rose on the renewed belief the government  
will be able to pass key economic legislation through parliament 
soon. The SET index gained 3.69 points, or 1.1 percent, to 333.28. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares tumbled on a weakening local currency, the  
rupiah, and uncertainty over an expected government announcement of 
more bank closures. The JSX Composite Index fell 5.619 points, or 
1.5 percent, to 373.802. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares fell on speculation that banks  
might gain the right to assume some of the function of stock 
brokers. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 2.41 
points, or 0.45 percent, at 528.12. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Negative corporate news weakened Philippine shares. The  
PSE index dropped 16.93 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,981.48. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean stocks fell on futures market concerns. The  
Kospi index fell 3.58 points, or 0.62 percent, to 567.27. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed higher, driven by a resurgence  
in the banking sector and selected corporate announcements. The All 
Ordinaries index rose 10.6 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,931.4 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI : Taiwanese stocks fell as investors sold financial  
shares after recent gains and on concern over growing bad debts in 
the banking sector. The Weighted Price Index fell 6.82 points, or 
0.1 percent, to 6,486.61. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares slumped, dragged down by  
bellwether Telecom Corp. of New Zealand. The NZSE-40 Capital Index 
fell 11.72 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,144.08.

say, ``Two copies. Double Sided. Print Now.'' And it obeys. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pitney Bowes copier hits the market today and marks a  
notable step forward for disabled workers at a time when many are 
still unwelcome around the office. It includes a Braille keyboard 
and wheelchair-accessible height and was tested at the American 
Foundation for the Blind, where Mrs. Genwright directs an 
information clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The copier debuts as regulations are being tightened to make  
federal workplaces more accessible to disabled people and 
telecommunications equipment more user-friendly for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The new regulations follow the 1990 Americans with Disabilities  
Act, a civil rights law that bans discrimination based on 
disability and orders employers to ``make reasonable 
accommodation'' to qualified disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its passage, 1 million more disabled people have found  
jobs. However, nearly half of the 30 million disabled people of 
working age remain unemployed, although the majority say they'd 
like to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a terrible failure of connection between corporate  
America and this community,'' says Charles Riley, editor-in-chief 
of WE, a magazine for people with disabilities. Companies are 
vastly ``underestimating the contribution that people with 
disabilities can make to companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In part, that's because employers fear that disabled people  
won't be able to carry out the little tasks that make up the fabric 
of office life: copying, e-mail, memo-writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employer feels right up front that he or she is taking a  
risk in employing a blind person,'', says Carl Augusto, president 
of the American Foundation for the Blind. 
</P>
<P>
	People with physical and mental limitations can do many of these  
chores, but less efficiently, since most office equipment isn't 
geared to their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something more is needed. We believe it's ease of use of the  
tools people need to be successful in the workplace,'' said Pitney 
Bowes chief executive officer Michael Critelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology has driven innovations in office equipment for the  
disabled in recent years. But demand has grown slowly, especially 
in the private sector, says Dick Schieck, manager of the Xerox 
division that handles all equipment accommodations for disabled 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were expecting the ADA was going to cause this market to  
explode,'' he said. ``Quite frankly it didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disabled workers will get a boost in 2000 when new regulations  
take effect that force all federal bodies to make office equipment 
accessible to them. In addition, the Federal Communications 
Commission this spring will issue a new rule requiring the 
telecommunications industry to ensure equipment and services, such 
as cellular phones, can be used by everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, designers are hampered by the need to accommodate a wide  
range of disabilities, while -- naturally -- making a profit. ``We're 
not a charity,'' says Schieck. ``I have to look at each investment 
relative to how much good are you going to do out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most products to help disabled people in the workplace involve  
accommodations to existing equipment, such as tilting a copier 
control panel slightly so wheelchair-users can see it better. 
</P>
<P>
	That change, Xerox's most popular for this market, can be made  
by a technician for $500. Other changes to equipment range from $50 
Braille stickers to a $3,700 remote keyboard for a high-end copier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 70 percent of companies, however, spend less than $500 to  
accommodate a disabled worker, according to a survey for the 
President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitney Bowes' new copier effectively links a sophisticated  
``Universal Access'' computer system -- costing a steep $15,995 - 
with a normal office copier, which costs about $8,000. That means 
the Universal Access system alone costs about $9 a day for the five 
years that average copiers last. 
</P>
<P>
	For Regina Genwright, however, the machine provides something  
money can't buy -- more freedom on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, when we had a regular copy machine, I could not do the  
things I'm able to do now,'' she said. ``Now, I don't have to think 
about what I'm going to do if I can't find someone to make copies 
for me, or something goes wrong.''

<HEADLINE>  Tibet Protesters Burn China Flags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DHARMSALA, India (AP) -- On the 40th anniversary of his people's  
exile, the Dalai Lama today accused China of lacking the 
``political will and courage'' to seek a compromise on Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Tibetan protesters in New Delhi burned 40 Chinese  
flags, lit firecrackers and burned an effigy representing Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin. The crowd also stood in silence for a minute 
to honor Tibetans who had died over the last four decades of 
Chinese rule. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 5,000 people, many in traditional Tibetan dress,  
strode behind the Tibetan flag toward the Indian parliament 
building, chanting slogans against what they call the Chinese 
occupation of their Himalayan homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern town of Dharmsala, the Dalai Lama told 4,000  
Tibetans and international observers -- including Hollywood stars 
Richard Gere and Goldie Hawn -- that China has intensified the 
repression of his people and was not prepared to hold talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lack of political will and courage on the part of the  
Chinese leadership has resulted in their failure to reciprocate my 
numerous overtures over the years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the speech, the audience spilled into the streets of the  
hilltop town in a 6-mile protest march led by maroon-robed monks 
and nuns. They chanted slogans urging the United Nations to send a 
fact-finding team to Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
	Tibetans are marking 40 years since the uprising against Chinese  
rule that resulted in the crackdown that forced the Dalai Lama to 
flee into exile. March 10 is known as Tibetan National Day in the 
Tibetan calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, Chinese military vehicles  
patrolled the streets near the Barkhor, the market and Buddhist 
pilgrimage route that surrounds the 7th century Jokhang, Tibet's 
oldest temple, the London-based Free Tibet Campaign reported. No 
disturbances were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 Tibetans also demonstrated today in the Nepalese  
capital of Katmandu. ``We want free Tibet. Tibet for the Tibetans, 
Long Live Dalai Lama,'' chanted the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Paris, two people scaled the walls of the Notre Dame  
cathedral under cover of darkness early today to place a Tibetan 
flag atop the landmark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama has been facing increasing pressure from younger  
Tibetans to abandon his moderate approach and demand full 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said in his speech he was confident he could control the  
radicals if China agreed to a ``just and fair solution.'' He 
pledged to ``use my moral authority to persuade the Tibetans not to 
seek separation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, the Dalai Lama said secret talks with China  
through unidentified intermediaries broke down late last year 
``without obvious reason.'' That ended 18 months of hopeful 
informal contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Late last autumn without any obvious reason there was  
noticeable hardening of the Chinese position on dialogue and their 
attitude toward me. This abrupt change was accompanied by a new 
round of intensified repression in Tibet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden turn last autumn ended a period of hope that peaked  
with President Clinton's visit to China in June. 
</P>
<P>
	China sent its army into Tibet in 1950, claiming it was  
historically a Chinese province. Tibetans say they were independent 
for generations. Since the Dalai Lama fled, about 120,000 Tibetans 
have followed him into exile in India. Thousands more live in 
Europe and North America.

<HEADLINE> NYC Sued Over DWI Car Seizures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Civil Liberties Union sued the city  
Wednesday over a new policy to seize the cars of people accused of 
drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Siegel, the organization's executive director, called the  
policy ``unfair, excessive and un-American.'' The group seeks to 
make it a class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government should not be in the business of seizing  
people's cars without the requisite authority,'' Siegel said. ``And 
even if authorized, it should not do so prior to a trial and 
conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed on behalf of 72 people who lost their cars  
because of the policy that went into effect Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's police, suspects with a blood  
alcohol level exceeding the state's legal limit of .10 will lose 
their cars as the ``instrumentalities of a crime,'' and the 
vehicles might not be returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims the policy is unconstitutional because it  
denies a suspect due process and illegally usurps a function of the 
Legislature -- prescribing punishment for drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very, very confident that the law is constitutional  
and proper and will be upheld in court,'' said Michael Hess, a 
lawyer for the city.

<HEADLINE> NIT Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- Being left out of the NCAA tournament  
was tough to swallow for Mississippi State. Being forced to play 
its first game of the National Invitation Tournament on the road 
felt like an added insult. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs (20-12) travel to Colorado State (17-10) for an NIT  
game tonight, when all 16 first-round games will be played. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team earned the right to be in the NCAA,'' Bulldogs coach  
Rick Stansbury insisted. ``It won 20 games. It won seven of its 
last 11. Of the 12 losses we had, seven were against Top 25 teams. 
But we can't control any of that. We feel fortunate to have another 
opportunity to play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the road assignment, Stansbury said, ``Why? I don't  
know. But again, I'm not in control of that. All we're going to be 
concerned with are the things we are in control of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs launched a surprising run in the SEC tournament  
that ended with a semifinal loss Saturday to Arkansas, then were 
one of the teams snubbed by the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played hard and won 20 games,'' guard Detrick White said.  
``We were looking forward to getting into the NCAA tournament. We 
were disappointed when we watched the selection show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State, which has enjoyed increased success since  
going to a smaller lineup in January, faces a Colorado State team 
that was surprised to get an NIT nod. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams, making their third appearance in the NIT in four  
years, made an early exit from the Western Athletic Conference 
tournament last week. The home game was equally unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge advantage for us,'' coach Ritchie McKay said.  
``We're 12-2 at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McKay is concerned primarily about MSU's athleticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mississippi State is more athletic than any team we have  
played,'' he said, ``and we have played some pretty good teams in 
Tulsa and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play strong on defense and limit Tyrone  
Washington's catches. Washington is an NBA prospect, a big 6-10 
kid. We have to make him work for everything he gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other NIT games tonight have Xavier (21-10) at Toledo (19-7),  
Hofstra (22-9) at Rutgers (18-12), Georgia (15-14) at Clemson 
(16-14), Seton Hall (15-14) at Old Dominion (24-8), Butler (20-9) 
at Bradley (17-11), Alabama (17-14) at Wake Forest (16-13) and 
Providence (16-13) at North Carolina State (18-13). 
</P>
<P>
	Also, it's Nevada-Las Vegas (16-12) at Nebraska (19-12),  
Pepperdine (19-12) at Colorado (17-14), Georgetown (15-15) at 
Princeton (20-7), Texas Christian (19-10) at Kansas State (20-12), 
Southern California (15-12) at Wyoming (17-9), Northwestern (15-13) 
at DePaul (17-12), Fresno State (21-11) at California (17-11) and 
Georgia Tech (15-15) at Oregon (16-11). 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, 16th-seeded Princeton nearly pulled off the  
biggest upset in NCAA tournament history against No. 1 seed 
Georgetown. The Tigers get another crack at Georgetown, only this 
time in the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers in 1989 NCAA gave the Hoyas a memorable first-round  
scare in which Georgetown held on to win 50-49. A No. 16 seed has 
never defeated a No. 1 in the history of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different story now,'' Tigers senior guard Brian Earl  
said. ``It's not on the same stage, it's the NIT as opposed to the 
NCAA's. And they're not so much the powerhouse, we're not so much 
the underdog. I'm sure it sparks memories, but not many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Tigers win this time around, it wouldn't be much of a  
surprise. Princeton's chance to make the NCAA tournament slipped 
away in a loss to Pennsylvania in its final regular season game, 
while the Hoyas barely made the NIT, extending their streak of 
postseason appearances to 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the near upset, Princeton has become a national fixture,  
going to six more NCAA tournaments and winning two first-round 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas have gone in the opposite direction, compiling a 31-30  
record the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown finished 0-9 against NCAA teams this year as opposed  
to Princeton's 4-3 mark. But Georgetown's young starting lineup, 
which includes two freshmen and two sophomores, has recently come 
together, and the Hoyas won six of their last 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is Hofstra making its first postseason appearance in 22  
years, the Flying Dutchmen only have to travel about 60 miles for 
the game, so their fans are going to be able to make the trip 
rather easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our players are familiar with Rutgers and because we watch  
them all the time,'' Hofstra coach Jay Wright said. ``Eleven of our 
13 guys are from the metropolitan area and Rutgers has a lot, and 
our guys love that challenge, they really do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright's biggest concern is the health of junior point guard  
Craig ``Speedy'' Claxton. He missed the final regular-season game 
and was not at hardly played in the conference tournament with a 
strained left thigh. His status probably won't be determined until 
just before tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Claxton averaged 13.3 points, while handing out 159 assists. The  
junior was the player of the year in the American East conference 
as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	With Claxton, Hofstra might present problems for Rutgers, which  
struggled late in the season, losing five of its last six games and 
a potential NCAA berth.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Files Stay of Eligibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The NCAA requested a stay Wednesday of an  
order throwing out freshman eligibility requirements, saying the 
ruling would cause chaos at more than 300 college and university 
sports programs and the upcoming men's and women's basketball 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter in Philadelphia will hear  
arguments Monday afternoon, a week after he ordered the NCAA to 
stop using minimum test scores in freshman eligibility 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA, which plans to appeal the initial ruling, said it  
needed more time to write replacement eligibility requirements and 
another three years to implement the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Without new rules, the NCAA, its 302 Division I schools and  
thousands of prospective athletes ``would face irreparable harm,'' 
according to court papers filed by the NCAA Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, the court's order has effectively stripped the  
NCAA and its member institutions of any initial eligibility 
rules,'' NCAA lawyer David Bruton wrote. ``The situation facing the 
membership can only be described as chaotic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was the result of a suit filed by four black  
athletes, who said they were denied NCAA scholarships or sports 
eligibility because they didn't meet the minimum test score. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule, known as Proposition 16, required athletes to have a  
minimum score of 820 on the Scholastic Assessment Test regardless 
of their high school grades. Buckwalter's decision did not rule out 
some use of the tests, which many educators have long said are 
racially and culturally discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA also asked the court Wednesday to amend its ruling to  
clarify that it only affects the four black athletes who filed the 
suit. If the decision is not limited, the NCAA said, the ruling 
could extend to thousands of first-year students nationwide and the 
NCAA men's and women's basketball tournaments, which tip off this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 64 teams in each tournament have athletes who are  
sitting out their freshman years because they failed to reach the 
requirements. If Buckwalter's ruling stands, those players could 
play in the tournament without fear of penalty.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Settles Coaches Earnings Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- When Southern California cut Andy  
Greer's salary by one-third, the assistant basketball coach took 
out a loan to cover living expenses. He also took the NCAA to court 
for allowing the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Greer is in line to receive at least $9,000 in lost wages.  
And the NCAA has the painful job of assessing Division I schools 
their shares of a $54.5 million settlement with Greer and about 
2,000 others affected by its short-lived restricted earnings rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule, adopted by Division I schools to save money, created a  
class of assistant coaches -- except in football -- whose pay was 
fixed at $12,000 per academic year and $4,000 for summer work. It 
was in effect from August 1992 until May 1995, when a judge ruled 
the NCAA had violated antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tuesday's settlement, the NCAA abandoned further appeals of  
a nearly $67 million judgment won by the coaches last year. NCAA 
officials estimated that continuing the fight could have pushed the 
cost above $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want a lawsuit. We begged, we pleaded with the NCAA,  
`Don't do this, don't put this into effect''' said Greer, who made 
$25,000 at USC before his pay was slashed, speaking Tuesday from 
his office at Northern Illinois, where he's an assistant basketball 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Wethington, NCAA executive committee chairman,  
acknowledged that the organization's handling of the case ``pitted 
employee against school and sometimes friend against friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there will be those will say the NCAA should have  
settled long ago,'' while others argue that appeals should have 
been pursued to the end, Wethington said. But for now, he said, 
``the association-wide nightmare is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nightmare could return in September, when the NCAA expects  
to notify all of the 302 Division I schools of their shares of the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive director Cedric Dempsey said the schools' financial  
pain could be cushioned by about $22 million in projected NCAA 
cost-cutting measures the next three years, but the schools would 
be responsible for the balance of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey would not speculate on individual schools' possible  
allocations. An NCAA subcommittee is studying the question, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was reached through mediation that began after  
the judge granted the coaches' motion in January to increase the 
$67 million judgment to $75 million to account for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the judge must approve the settlement, clearing the way for  
the coaches to submit claims and their lawyers to take their share 
in fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount the coaches receive will probably be based on what  
they made under the cap and what their schools would otherwise have 
paid them, said Dennis Cross, a Kansas City-based lawyer for the 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Greer, 36, said he had ``no idea'' how much he will receive when  
checks start going out, ``and I don't think anybody does at this 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also unknown is how many Division I careers were derailed by the  
restricted earnings rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of people got out of the coaching profession,'' Greer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greer's own career was detoured into Division III because of the  
rule. He had nine years of college coaching, including a stint at 
Boston University, when he left USC after his third season there 
because of his paltry pay and took the head coaching job at 
Merchant Marine, which paid better. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that really bothered me was that the NCAA tried to  
portray this as covering entry-level coaches,'' he said. ``That's 
ridiculous. We worked as many hours as anybody else.''

<HEADLINE> Underdog Winthrop Ready for Auburn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- To call Winthrop a longshot is an  
understatement. The Big South Conference champion Eagles are in the 
NCAA tournament for the first time, awaiting a debut Thursday 
against Auburn, the top seed in the South Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	First-year coach Gregg Marshall, who turned a 7-20 team into  
21-7 after a preseason challenge to the players, has fulfilled his 
initial goal to get a spot in the 64-team tourney field. Now, who 
knows what will happen? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this team will be surprised by anything that  
happens to them,'' Marshall said Wednesday. ``The fact that no No. 
16 seed has every gotten a No. 1 ... I'm not worried about that. We 
were picked dead last (in the conference). Now we're first. We're 
here. This is a reality. We're going to go out and play the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5,600-student school in Rock Hill, S.C., has offered a men's  
basketball program for 21 years and earned its first NCAA bid by 
winning the Big South tourney two weeks ago. It's also the first 
time Winthrop has won 20 games in a season, and the turnaround 
began when Marshall arrived and told the players that anyone who 
didn't think the team could still be playing in March might as well 
pack his bags and leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first three years, every loss hurt,'' said forward Heson  
Groves, the team's scoring and rebounding leader. ``When coach 
Marshall came, I knew he was a winner. We've worked extremely hard, 
and we're not going to stop now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (27-3), making its first NCAA appearance since 1988,  
earned a top seed despite a loss to Kentucky in the Southeastern 
Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's other first-round games in the RCA Dome,  
fourth-seeded Ohio State plays No. 13 Murray State, No. 5 UCLA 
faces 12th-seeded Detroit, and No. 8-seed Syracuse plays No. 9 
Oklahoma State. The second round will be on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a magic carpet ride for this team this season,''  
the Winthrop coach said. ``We've given life to a program that was a 
little stagnant, a little dormant. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was a two-part goal, to play in March, with a chance to  
advance,'' he said. ``I didn't come here to roll over. If they 
didn't think this game was necessary, the No. 1 teams would get a 
bye. But they don't. Stranger things have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn knows that, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers beat Winthrop by 25 points in their only other  
meeting, two years ago in the regular season, but they're not 
counting on a victory by that margin, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't go out and match their intensity, you're liable  
to get beat,'' forward Bryant Smith said. ``Anything can happen. We 
watched Valparaiso last year. Who's to say Winthrop can't be one of 
those teams?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valparaiso, seeded 13th, reached the tourney Sweet 16 a year  
ago, a sobering lesson to all the so-called favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what's going to happen,'' Auburn coach Cliff  
Ellis said. ``I know Winthrop's going to come out and play, and our 
team, I think, will play with a lot of energy. I don't know what 
the results will be, but I would be very disappointed if that 
energy wasn't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn scoring leader, Chris Porter, a second-team All-American,  
said the Tigers' status as favorite is no cause for relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the NCAA, you don't get a second chance. You play every  
game like it's your last game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma State (22-10) is in the tournament for the 16th time.  
The Cowboys lost to Kansas in the finals of the Big 12 Conference 
tourney. Syracuse (21-11), making its 25th NCAA appearance, lost to 
Connecticut in the Big East semifinals. Both teams received 
at-large bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two teams are pretty evenly matched,'' Cowboys coach Eddie  
Sutton said. ``Maybe the biggest keys will be how well we can 
defend their transition game and how well we get on the defensive 
boards. Then the biggest key in any game is how well you shoot it. 
That camouflages so many shortcomings in other areas of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse, the NCAA runner-up in 1987 and 1996, lost in the  
regional semifinal to Duke last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams might be a little better than they played this  
year,'' Sycacuse coach Jim Boeheim said of his Orangemen and 
Oklahoma State. ``We'll find out.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Scary Films Stay With You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Still scared of the water all those years after  
``Jaws''? Researchers say you're not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of 150 students at the Universities of Michigan and  
Wisconsin found that one in four had some lingering ``fright'' 
effect from a movie or TV show they saw as a child or a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger children were when they were frightened, the longer  
the reaction lasted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people who saw the 1975 thriller about a man-eating shark  
never went into the ocean again, said Kristen Harrison, a 
University of Michigan communications professor who co-wrote the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	And what about ``Psycho,'' the 1960 thriller with the deadly  
shower scene? 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who shower with the door open, even though  
they're quite sure there isn't a killer in the house,'' Harrison 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety percent said they were scared by a TV or movie from their  
childhood or adolescence; 26 percent said they still experience 
``residual anxiety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ranny Levy, president of the Coalition for Quality Children's  
Media in Santa Fe, N.M., said her own 27-year-old son was 
frightened of taking a swim in the sea a few years ago and blames 
it on seeing ``Jaws'' as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to force himself. He really identified it with watching  
`Jaws' when he was little,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Two Charged in Baby's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A woman was charged Wednesday with covering up  
the death of her infant son by cremating the boy after he drowned 
in a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman's boyfriend and his sister also were charged in the  
death of 14-month-old Christopher Hutton last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Mjelde, 22, was charged with first-degree criminal  
assistance and filing a false police report. Police say she 
initially told them the boy was staying with his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Her boyfriend, Stanley Red, 24, was charged with first-degree  
manslaughter for allegedly allowing Christopher to drown in a 
bathtub in October. His sister, Cynthia Red, also was charged with 
first-degree criminal assistance in the cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	All were in custody Wednesday pending arraignment, scheduled for  
March 18. Bail was set at $200,000 for Red, $50,000 for Ms. Mjelde 
and $25,000 for Ms. Red, authorities said. It was not known if the 
three had attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities lacked evidence to file murder charges in the case,  
Prosecutor Norm Maleng said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Ms. Mjelde left the boy with Red while she went to  
California for three days beginning Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	At some point, police said, Red left the boy alone in a bathtub  
in about 8 inches of water while he went to the store to buy beer 
and the baby drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon her return, Ms. Mjelde suggested they burn the body rather  
than bury it so she could keep the ashes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three used gasoline to burn the baby's body in a garbage can  
in a nearby park before eventually heading to Ms. Red's home to use 
her fireplace, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police began investigating in January, when the boy's aunt told  
authorities the boy had not been seen for about three months.

<HEADLINE> GOP Lawmakers Push School Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans expect debate on their  
education bill to go more smoothly than it has in the Senate, which 
has wrangled over a similar measure for five days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a good reason why a bill like this hasn't just  
hasn't flown through,'' Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., said of the bill, 
which would give states more flexibility in the way they can spend 
federal education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the House version of the bill would pass quickly,  
despite chances that the House Democrats will offer the same kind 
of amendments slowing down the Senate bill. The House was working 
late Tuesday on how to manage the potential amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	A success in the House could put pressure on the Senate, which  
remains deadlocked over Republicans' determination to block a 
new-teacher plan that Democrats want to attach to the bill. The 
amendment by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., would reduce class sizes 
by hiring 100,000 teachers over the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since education's emergence as a popular polling issue, both  
parties have rushed to be the first to pass an education bill this 
session, leading to frustration on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to ask whether the Democrats really want to give  
states autonomy,'' said Joe Karpinski, a spokesman for the Senate 
Labor Human and Resources Committee, which sent the bill to the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, charged that Democrats are using  
the bipartisan education flexibility plan to push through other 
initiatives they want and force Republicans into an early vote 
against those ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is all meant, personally, to get someone to make  
a vote against a program that could be used in a 30-second 
television spot,'' Voinovich said as his fellow Republicans failed 
on a second attempt Tuesday to limit the number of proposals that 
can be attached to the ``ed-flex'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats insisted Tuesday they are not trying to  
embarrass the Republicans on education. Senate Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D., said he unsuccessfully offered to limit the number 
of Democratic amendments and ensure the bill would be completed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said Democrats will keep offering their proposals, even  
if Republicans pull the bill from the floor out of frustration and 
Democrats have to attach their plans to other measures. A key focus 
is the class-size plan. 
</P>
<P>
	An initial $1 billion for the teacher plan was approved by  
Congress last year in a spending bill compromise. President Clinton 
has said the whole plan would cost $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the second day in a row, the Republican leadership has  
continued its efforts to stand in the way of voting on an amendment 
to finish the job of hiring 100,000 teachers to reduce class 
size,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, which started with broad bipartisan support,  
has become enmeshed in political scuffles. Two more votes to try to 
block the amendments were scheduled for today. A third try is 
slated for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S 280.

<HEADLINE> GOP Expecting Bigger Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to offer Americans the biggest possible  
election-year tax cuts, Republicans probably will delay writing a 
tax bill until new budget estimates expected to show more money 
available from growing federal surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP budget writers preparing spending blueprints for the budget  
year beginning Oct. 1 are hemmed in by their promise not to touch 
Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Honoring that pledge has left Republicans scrambling for other  
ways to pay for next year's tax cut because all of the expected 
$133 billion surplus in fiscal 2000 would come from Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers think they have found about $15 billion worth of  
savings for 2000, a modest start for a tax-cutting package they say 
will total $800 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans believe the tax cut could grow by at least $10  
billion if they wait until the summer -- and the prospect of an even 
bigger surplus forecast -- for the Congressional Budget Office's 
annual revision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll wait until CBO updates this summer,'' said House  
Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, asked when he would 
write a tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., has not  
decided on his timetable. His committee usually waits until Ways 
and Means has approved its tax plan. 
</P>
<P>
	House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, said the  
2000 budget his committee plans to vote on next week will state 
that if CBO surplus projections grow this summer, the extra money 
would pay for lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., is  
considering similar language. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is a bigger surplus, the number is bigger for the tax  
cut,'' Kasich said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how Kasich and Domenici would protect the extra  
money for tax cuts. One possibility would be to require 60 votes in 
the 100-member Senate to use the funds for anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	That would achieve another GOP goal: making it harder for  
President Clinton and Democrats to use the extra surpluses for 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	As before, White House aides accused Republicans of unwisely  
planning to use surpluses for tax cuts instead of helping Medicare, 
which faces financial problems in the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern right now is the fact that they are planning a  
large tax cut, rather than shoring up Medicare,'' White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	By awaiting the new projections, Republicans seem to be risking  
little. In recent years, CBO repeatedly has made its forecasts more 
optimistic, only to underestimate the health of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Many private analysts say the economy's continued strong  
performance -- growing 6.1 percent in 1999's final quarter -- means 
the surplus trend is only upward, although the magnitude is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers should inch up,'' said Ethan Harris, a senior  
economist with Lehman Brothers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	When CBO last week updated its January projections, the agency's  
forecast for the 2000 surplus had grown from $131 billion to $133 
billion in that short two-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican leaders revealed details of their plan to  
ensure that Social Security surpluses totaling $1.8 trillion over 
the next decade be used only to strengthen that program or to 
reduce the accumulated national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is part of their fight with Clinton over which side  
would do more to protect Social Security, the government's most 
popular and politically sensitive program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the GOP proposal, the public debt would have to decline  
every two years by an amount equal to the Social Security surpluses 
for that same period. Using the money for a purpose other than 
Social Security would require 60 Senate votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to locking away every penny of the Social  
Security trust fund surpluses for our nation's elderly,'' said 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	With Social Security facing fiscal pressures from the impending  
retirement of baby boomers, the White House's Toiv said the GOP 
plan does not extend Social Security's solvency ``by even one 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said Clinton's plan for helping Social Security  
doesn't extend its life either.

<HEADLINE> Midwest, East Clean Up After Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Marian Andersen was just about to move the last of her red and  
yellow snow shovels at Guse Hardware from a display wall into the 
store's basement when the storm hit. 
</P>
<P>
	With Minneapolis blanketed under 16 inches of snow, Andersen's  
shovels were in demand once again. ``That's what we're here for,'' 
she said with a smile Tuesday as a customer walked out with a new 
shovel. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Midwest to the East Coast, a lot of people were using  
shovels today. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts in Virginia and Maryland were closed again  
today as more light snow fell before beginning to taper off. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first major snowstorm of the season for Washington,  
D.C., leading the House to postpone Tuesday's floor votes, delaying 
flights in and out of Dulles and Ronald Reagan National airports, 
and delaying a memorial service for the late Supreme Court Justice 
Harry A. Blackmun. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 11 inches fell in the Washington suburbs of Purcellville  
and Vienna, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's traffic was light today as most commuters had been  
given the day off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a White Christmas three months late,'' said Ann  
Powers, who was commuting to work at a downtown Washington law 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beautiful, but it does make extra work,'' said Ruth  
Burkholder as she shoveled the red brick sidewalk outside her baked 
goods store in Sharpsburg, Md., which received about 5 inches of 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my mother February was so nice, now we're making up for  
it in March,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen inches of snow fell in the mountains of West Virginia  
and western Maryland, as well as parts of Iowa. Ice and snow even 
coated roads as far south as northern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic deaths were blamed on the storm in Minnesota, Iowa,  
Indiana, West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve-year-old Daniel Warden avoided a science test when his  
Dayton, Ohio, school was closed Tuesday. Instead, he went sledding 
with his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a big science test today and I wanted to get it over  
with, but there's always tomorrow,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only scattered snow fell today in Ohio.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice at certain times -- white, clean, pure,'' Russell  
Carson said as he took a break from clearing his driveway in the 
Dayton suburb of Moraine. ``But ... right now, we're looking 
forward to spring -- nice warm weather.''

<HEADLINE> GM Signs $1B Aluminum Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT, Mich. (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will buy more than $1  
billion in recycled aluminum over the next 13 years to use in 
making engines and components. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker has agreed to buy all of the recycled aluminum  
that IMCO Recycling Inc. will produce at a new plant it plans to 
build in Zilwaukee. The plant will be situated near a GM Saginaw 
Metal Casting Operations, a powertrain facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a tremendous win for our foundry in Saginaw  
because it provides a solid future for our employees and provides 
numerous environmental benefits,'' John Stiles, executive director 
of GM purchasing of metals, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement with IMCO, which is based in Irving, Texas, calls  
for almost 2 billion pounds of recycled aluminum over the next 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Recycled aluminum has become the largest single component of the  
national auto supply, said IMCO chairman Don Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram said about 65 percent of the aluminum used in automobiles  
is recycled metal. He said the percentage could rise as more usable 
scrap become available. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with IMCO is the third major aluminum agreement GM has  
made in the last four months. In November, GM announced a 10-year 
agreement with Alcan Aluminium Ltd. to buy aluminum.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Funeral To Be Quite Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Across the street, in Washington Square,  
scaffolding was built for TV cameras, and barriers were set up to 
block access to Sts. Peter and Paul Church for Joe DiMaggio's 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	In the church, where DiMaggio received his first communion and  
married his first wife, there was a feeling of serenity. And that's 
exactly the atmosphere the Yankee Clipper requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, whose twin steeples tower over the North Beach  
neighborhood in which DiMaggio spent most of his childhood, was to 
be closed to the public today as Father Armand Oliveri led the 
service for DiMaggio, who died Monday at his Florida home at the 
age of 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveri, 79, who had known DiMaggio since the two grew up  
together in North Beach, said the service was a regular funeral 
Mass, including Psalm 23 as well as readings from both the Old and 
New Testaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominick DiMaggio, Joe's younger brother and a fellow major  
leaguer, was to give the eulogy. Oliveri said there would only be 
about 40 people attending the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they wanted it to be family, and that was about  
it,'' Oliveri said. ``Perhaps some close friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ornate church, dark and solemn despite the light filtering  
through its stained-glass windows, has been visited by President 
Lyndon Johnson and Vice President Walter Mondale. It also was the 
site of funeral services for former San Francisco Mayor Joseph 
Alioto. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no indications at the church entrance Wednesday that  
a dignitary was about to be eulogized there. There was no mention 
of DiMaggio on a bulletin board announcing the times for Masses in 
English, Italian and Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside Sts. Peter and Paul, secretary Aurora Piazza leafed  
through a church book to a two-page spread of DiMaggio and actress 
Dorothy Arnold from their wedding on Nov. 19, 1939. Piazza, who 
grew up in North Beach, waited outside the church on that autumn 
day 60 years ago to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds. 
</P>
<P>
	Church organist Lola Simi, who will be joined by two singers for  
the funeral service, was preparing ``Amazing Grace'' and Schubert's 
``Ave Maria'' among five musical works requested by the DiMaggio 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's estranged son, Joseph Paul DiMaggio Jr., was to be  
one of the pallbearers carrying the casket from the church after 
the service. The funeral procession was set to pass DiMaggio's 
former home on Beach Street on its way to Holy Cross Cemetery in 
nearly Colma. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Jr., who had not talked with his dad in two years, was  
DiMaggio's only child. His mother was Dorothy Arnold, whom DiMaggio 
divorced in 1943. DiMaggio wed Marilyn Monroe in 1954 and they 
divorced later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's close friend and attorney, said the  
Hall of Famer wanted a private religious service and that his 
family was determined to follow his wishes. That meant excluding 
people such as Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone disputed that Steinbrenner wasn't  
invited, saying the Yankees owner was asked to accompany the family 
to the West Coast. Cerrone said Steinbrenner declined the 
invitation because he didn't want an exception to the guest list 
made in his case. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was one more person outside the family to be there,  
Joe would have wanted George Steinbrenner,'' Engelberg said 
Wednesday. ``He really loved George, and said he was one of the 
most humane people he knew. I agree. But the family had to say, and 
reluctantly so, no one else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to DiMaggio's son, other pallbearers were Roger  
Stein and James Hamra, the husbands of DiMaggio's two 
granddaughters; Joseph DiMaggio, son of the ballplayer's late 
brother, Mike; Joe Nacchio, a friend of DiMaggio's for 59 years, 
and Engelberg.

<HEADLINE> Preparations Underway for DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- At Sts. Peter and Paul Church, where Joe  
DiMaggio received his first communion and was wedded to his first 
wife, arrangements were being completed for Thursday's private 
funeral of the Yankee Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	Church organist Lola Simi, who will be joined by two singers for  
the funeral service, was preparing ``Amazing Grace'' and Schubert's 
``Ave Maria'' among five musical works requested by the DiMaggio 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	The ornate church, dark and solemn despite the light filtering  
through its stained-glass windows, has been visited by President 
Lyndon Johnson and Vice President Walter Mondale. It also was the 
site of funeral services for former San Francisco Mayor Joseph 
Alioto. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, whose twin steeples tower over the North Beach  
neighborhood in which DiMaggio spent most of his childhood, will be 
closed to the public Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 40-50 relatives and close friends will be invited to  
listen to the Rev. Armand Oliveri lead the service for DiMaggio, 
who died Monday at his Florida home at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveri, 79, who has known DiMaggio since the two grew up  
together in North Beach, said the service will be a regular funeral 
Mass and will include Psalm 23 (``The Lord is my shepherd...'') as 
well as readings from the Old and New Testaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominick DiMaggio, Joe's younger brother and a fellow major  
leaguer, will give the eulogy, Oliveri said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no indications at the church entrance Wednesday that  
a dignitary was about to be eulogized there. There was no mention 
of DiMaggio on a bulletin board announcing the times for Masses in 
English, Italian and Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	But the area surrounding the church was alive with activity.  
Scaffolding for TV cameras already had been set up in Washington 
Square, a park facing the church in which the American flag had 
been lowered to half staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Police barriers were stacked together, preparing to cordon off  
the area on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside Sts. Peter and Paul, secretary Aurora Piazza leafed  
through a church book to a two-page spread of DiMaggio and actress 
Dorothy Arnold from their wedding on Nov. 19, 1939. Piazza, who 
grew up in North Beach, waited outside the church on that autumn 
day 60 years ago to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds.

<HEADLINE> Quiet Irish Play Is Making Noise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Four men and a woman gather to swap stories, some  
of them ghostly, in a remote Irish pub, and from their yarns is 
woven a tapestry of love, loss and perhaps even healing. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the essence of ``The Weir,'' a play slight in plot but  
rich in character and feeling that, for all its quiet intimacies, 
has been making quite a noise. 
</P>
<P>
	Conor McPherson's drama initially opened for a mere monthlong  
run two summers ago in a 60-seat London theater. Since then, it has 
generated three companies of actors, the first of which will lead 
the play to Broadway this month. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 12, the Royal Court production of ``The Weir'' produced  
further clamor, winning the Olivier Award for the best play of 1998 
in a hotly contested race with Michael Frayn's ``Copenhagen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It all seems very weird,'' says McPherson, a shy, stocky  
Dubliner with carrot-colored hair. ``I just stay home and wait for 
the checks,'' the 27-year-old playwright deadpans. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadway previews begin March 23, before an April 1 opening. The  
replacement London cast opened March 8, while yet a third cast has 
embarked on an 11-week British tour. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson could scarcely have imagined this when he wrote ``The  
Weir,'' set in a country pub in County Leitrim, northwest Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of plays are earmarked all along for the West End and  
Broadway. That is their reason to exist,'' he says. ``But this has 
been so organic -- if the play had just been around for those first 
three weeks, I would have been happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the universal is grounded in the particular, ``The Weir''  
proves it, as did another award-winning 1990s play set in an Irish 
backwater, Brian Friel's ``Dancing at Lughnasa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Weir,'' says director Ian Rickson, ``draws upon all sorts  
of needs we have at this moment to do with community and contact 
and intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You spend an evening in real time and in a real place with  
real characters on a human journey that is so necessary, needed, 
desired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the start, the play seems to be little more than an exercise  
in banter, as bartender Brendan greets some pub regulars on a windy 
day during which his all-important Guinness tap is broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the booze must be poured out of a bottle, and with it  
come various eerie stories of increasing intensity designed to 
impress Valerie, the new girl in a very male town. 
</P>
<P>
	What the men competing for her attention can't predict is that  
Valerie has on reserve her own story, which is that much more 
genuinely disturbing and heart-stirring for being true. 
</P>
<P>
	No sooner has she spoken her narrative than Jack, the pub's  
senior denizen, offers up his second tale of the play, this time 
drawing from a well of emotion that Valerie's presence has gently 
yet piercingly evoked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack is sort of feminized by Valerie,'' Rickson says. ``He's  
able to tell a story about himself that he would never have been 
able to tell at the beginning of the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And although the town itself possesses its own weir, or dam, the  
play suggests that unlike the flow of water, feelings cannot be 
easily controlled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read it, and I cried for about an hour,'' Jim Norton, the  
play's very first Jack, says of the play. ``I just thought, `This 
is a major new voice' -- the ability and maturity and ease with 
which Conor writes about very complex subjects. `If I don't play 
this part, I'll die.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Norton, Kieran Ahern as the sweet-natured mama's boy Jim, and  
Brendan Coyle as the ever-watchful bartender together make up the 
play's so-called ``home team.'' All three have been with ``The 
Weir'' since its July 4, 1997, debut at the Royal Court's tiny 
Theater Upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Coyle has spent more than 300 performances listening  
attentively to the others, since Brendan is the only character who 
doesn't get to tell his own story. 
</P>
<P>
	Does his mind ever wander?	   ``It's very, very difficult, and that's the key. If I don't  
listen, I have a bad night,'' says Coyle, who won his own Olivier 
for best supporting performer in a play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, you find yourself thinking, `Oh, I forgot to set the  
video,' but you have to fight that. It's like meditation: You have 
to get rid of any outside rubbish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's talk of a Tony Award in June. But as the members of the  
original company get ready for New York, they just hope such an 
unshowy and deeply felt play can hold its own on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just want it to work,'' says Michelle Fairley, the  
northern Irish actress who plays Valerie. ``Through working on it, 
you love it so much that it becomes like your baby, so you just 
want everybody to like your baby.''

<HEADLINE> Marty Cordova's MRI Shows No Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Minnesota Twins left fielder Marty  
Cordova doesn't have structural damage in his right shoulder, 
general manager Terry Ryan said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova, a disappointment the last two seasons in part because  
of injuries, had the magnetic resonance imaging exam Wednesday 
because of persistent soreness. Ryan said Cordova should be able to 
resume throwing soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordova, who has 25 home runs and 120 RBIs the last two years  
after a combined 40 and 195 in his first major league seasons, 
thinks the pain in his shoulder resulted from an alteration in his 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
	He was bothered by it last week and has had trouble throwing  
since. He hasn't picked up a baseball in three days and he didn't 
travel to Dunedin for the Twins' 6-4 loss to Toronto on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Glitches in Army Parachute System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) -- Some Army paratroop units have stopped  
using a new kind of backup parachute after it failed to open when 
tested on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Bragg officials said there are no known cases of it failing  
during a jump. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 28,000 members of the 18th Airborne Corps who  
are stationed at Fort Bragg are using an older backup parachute 
while Army safety officials examine the new one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we continue to see this as a fairly short-range  
situation,'' Lt. Col. Rick Spearman said Wednesday. ``Our only 
concern right now is for us to do the prudent thing, the right 
thing -- not place soldiers at unnecessary risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paratroop units at other Army bases, including Fort Benning,  
Ga., continue to use the new model. 
</P>
<P>
	Airborne units began using the Modified Improved Reserve  
Parachute System in November. It has a spring-loaded mechanism to 
help it open. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Fort Bragg scaled back use of the parachutes March  
3 after a soldier pulled his reserve rip cord while on the ground 
and nothing happened. Safety investigators then examined 10 
parachutes and found six did not deploy when the rip cord was 
pulled. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. John Latimer, chief of staff at Fort Benning, said that  
even if the chute sometimes doesn't open on the ground, it will 
work in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's reliable. It works great. There is not a problem with  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin Aerospace, the manufacturer, said the new parachute has  
saved six lives since Fort Bragg began using it last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Guidelines issued last week direct soldiers to punch the  
parachute with a fist to loosen it if the rip cord fails during a 
jump. Army officials said that was standard procedure with the 
older model.

<HEADLINE> Takeover Shakes Up French Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A $37.2 billion takeover bid by Banque Nationale de  
Paris for Paribas and Societe Generale that would create the 
world's largest banking group sent shock waves today through the 
normally staid French bank sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid coincides with widespread consolidation among European  
banks scrambling to compete in a market transformed by a new common 
currency and fewer barriers to financial trade. 
</P>
<P>
	It also shows that French banks, often criticized for their slow  
reaction to consolidation, are moving frantically to catch up with 
their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro has the effect of increasing competitive pressures in  
Europe,'' Banque Nationale chairman Michel Pebereau said today at a 
news conference detailing the takeover bid. ``France needed to 
create a banking champion. Our offer sets this up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banque Nationale's takeover bid, announced late Tuesday, comes  
just weeks after Societe Generale moved to buy Paribas for $17.07 
billion to create Europe's second-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined bank would hold nearly $1 trillion in assets,  
surpassing the $800 billion in assets from the bank that would be 
created by the pending merger of Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said today that the takeover bid throws into question  
France's role in future consolidation of the European banking 
sector, and is likely to undergo scrutiny from anti-trust 
authorities in Brussels and in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also seen as an attempt to pre-empt a foreign takeover bid  
for French banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``What worries me is that this is a Franco-French solution,''  
said Bruno Eudes, a trader with the brokerage house 
Meeschaert-Rousselle. ``It doesn't add much to the banks' 
international competitiveness and excludes any foreign bank from 
getting a big share of the French industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement today, Paribas chairman Andre Levy-Lang and  
Daniel Bouton, his Societe Generale counterpart, described Banque 
Nationale's intentions as ``risky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chairmen said they had been unaware of Banque Nationale's  
interest until Tuesday night. ``This operation therefore cannot be 
portrayed as being friendly,'' they concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Pebereau insisted that the bid was not hostile. ``It isn't a  
question of a forced marriage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really positions BNP as a major player in the European  
scene and leaves them well-positioned to move into North America in 
a bigger way,'' said Keith Stock, a New York-based global 
management consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Banque Nationale's bid would be the second-highest price ever  
paid in a bank deal, just shy of the $41.5 billion merger between 
NationsBank Corp. and BankAmerica last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Banque Nationale is offering 15 of its shares for seven Societe  
Generale shares and 11 of its shares for eight Paribas shares. 
Trading in shares of all three banks have been suspended on the 
Paris stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	While French banks have been slow to expand into the United  
States, several European banks are making moves, including Deutsche 
Bank, HSBC, Dresdner and ABN Amro. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance companies are also getting in the game. On Monday,  
Fortis, one of the biggest insurance and banking companies in 
Europe, said it would buy American Bankers Insurance Group, a Miami 
insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Aegon NV said it was buying TransAmerica of San  
Francisco for almost $10 billion.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Tom Preparing for Iowa Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Tom Davis removed his glasses and took a soothing  
sip of water as he listened to his players pay him tribute. 
Emotions are hard to hide as Dr. Tom prepares to write his final 
basketball prescription at Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, whose Hawkeyes play Alabama-Birmingham in the first round  
of the NCAA tournament Thursday, learned last spring that his 13th 
season in Iowa City would be his last. His contract would not be 
renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I debated a long time whether to come back another year and do  
this thing,'' Davis said Wednesday. ``I did it because of the 
seniors and my staff. Sometimes I say, `I'm not sure I should have 
done this,' but the guys have been terrific. They've really been a 
lot of fun and appreciative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To some degree, Iowa also has overachieved, winning games at  
Ohio State, at Michigan and at Kansas. Though they slumped late in 
the season and finished 9-7 in the Big Ten, the Hawkeyes enter the 
tournament ranked No. 21 and the fifth seed in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Iowa hasn't advanced past the second round of the NCAAs  
since 1988, the players have plenty of inspiration to extend the 
Davis era another three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing for coach has been the greatest basketball experience  
of my life,'' senior guard Kent McCausland said. ``It was more than 
just wanting to be a Hawkeye. I wanted to soak in everything he had 
to give me. It's been perfect. I hope we can take it as far as we 
can for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like McCausland, senior Jess Settles has treasured his time with  
Davis. Settles missed nearly all of the 1997-98 season with health 
problems, but won another year of eligibility -- a year he is not 
taking for granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came out of high school and I considered myself an average  
player,'' said Settles, who ranks sixth on Iowa's career scoring 
list. ``He gave me the opportunity to have the chance to be great. 
I owe my entire career to him. I would have made a huge mistake if 
I'd have gone anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a 60-year-old with a Ph.D and a career record of 541-289,  
doesn't know where he will be this time next year. He has not ruled 
out coaching and said Thursday he plans ``to look at everything'' 
available to him. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, he is hoping to get past Alabama-Birmingham and keep  
his emotions in check. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I'll deal with it is day-to-day, minute-to-minute,  
whatever,'' Davis said. ``When other thoughts jump into your head -- 
which they do -- just push them aside, and then when the season's 
over, look back and reflect.''

	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees manager Joe Torre was  
diagnosed with prostate cancer and has left the World Series 
champions to undergo treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine,'' the 58-year-old manager said today, ``and I am  
looking forward to taking care of this problem and getting back to 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately how advanced the disease was or how long  
Torre will be away from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe will handle this situation with the same determination and  
courage that he has always demonstrated. Our prayers are with 
him,'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Torre's condition came two days after Yankees great Joe  
DiMaggio died of complications from lung-cancer surgery and on the 
same day Darryl Strawberry was to make his return from colon cancer 
surgery in October. Strawberry was in the Yankees' lineup today for 
a split-squad game with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was just last week that former Yankees star Catfish  
Hunter appeared at the team's camp, too weak to shake hands because 
of Lou Gehrig's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very hard day for all of us,'' Strawberry said. ``We  
as a team are devastated. Like when it happened with me, we as a 
team will stick together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre told catcher Joe Girardi before the Yankee split squad  
left Tampa this morning. Girardi told the rest of the team before 
the two-hour bus ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys were very sad,'' Girardi said. ``It is hard when it  
hits so close to you. Joe was upbeat. He's a fighter and he will 
make it through this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is second only to lung cancer among cancer  
killers of American men, taking about 40,000 lives annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Most prostate cancer happens sporadically; patients have no  
particular family history of the disease. However, about 1 in 10 
cases seems to be clearly inherited, because many men in the same 
family have it.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Declares Strike Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Protesters blocked provincial highways  
with rocks and trees and police repelled demonstrators with tear 
gas in Ecuador's capital today, the first day of a nationwide 
strike over economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Indians barricaded highways in 15 of the country's  
22 provinces, causing long traffic jams. Demonstrators hurled 
stones at police and burned tires on the streets of Guayaquil, 
Ecuador's main port city 170 miles southwest of the capital, Quito. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, markets and factories were closed, and the streets of  
Quito were largely deserted as bus drivers heeded the strike call. 
Police used tear gas to disperse about 100 marchers 10 blocks from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second national strike called by the leftist-led  
Unified Workers Federation, Ecuador's largest labor federation, 
since President Jamil Mahuad took office seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with increased powers under a newly declared state of  
emergency, machine gun-toting troops guarded power plants, oil 
installations and gasoline stations against union members who have 
threatened to disrupt vital industries. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 48-hour strike likely to aggravate Ecuador's economic  
crisis, the president on Tuesday declared a 60-day state of 
emergency that limits freedom of movement and assembly and gives 
him the authority to order strikers back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Unions have threatened to paralyze Ecuador if Mahuad does not  
back down on reforms that have caused prices to soar and a bill now 
in Congress that calls for deep public spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some influential members of the armed forces tried to calm the  
nation of 12 million people by denying there was discontent within 
the military over the economic crisis and offering to protect oil 
installations from strikers. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Minister Vladimiro Alvarez said today that soldiers  
have orders not to violently disperse highways barricades where 
protesters ``are using women and children as cannon fodder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahuad has extended through Thursday an emergency bank holiday  
that has shut banks since Monday to keep people from withdrawing 
their savings in anticipation of drastic economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was declared a surprise bank holiday after a run on  
deposits last week threatened Ecuador's tottering financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's currency, the sucre, lost a quarter of its value last  
week amid rumors the government planned to forcibly convert dollar 
bank accounts into sucres and doubts about Mahuad's ability to 
reform Ecuador's statist economy. 
</P>
<P>
	With banks and automatic teller machines closed for three days  
now, many people have no money to buy basic goods, leading to 
rising popular discontent. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Ana Lucia Armijos has said that the government  
will announce emergency economic measures Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's economy is in tatters after floods last year did $2.6  
billion in damage and the price of its main export, oil, plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic growth has stagnated, inflation is running near 50  
percent, the budget deficit reached $1.2 billion and state coffers 
are bare. In September, Mahuad ended fuel subsidies, causing prices 
to soar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have stopped working not because we support the strike or  
not, but simply because we cannot work. We're broke,'' said truck 
driver Guido Molina.

<HEADLINE> Roller Derby Back in Glitzier Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The camera rolled and California Quakes  
skater Sean Atkinson, taking a cue from a producer, jumped out of 
his seat in the stands and started taunting a member of an opposing 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, Atkinson and his opponent were rolling around on the  
skating track, exchanging fake punches and body slams. 
</P>
<P>
	The roaring studio audience ate it up. Producers of  
``Rollerjam'' hope cable TV audiences will, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The show is the latest incarnation of Roller Derby, the low-rent  
piece of Americana that entertained audiences for four decades 
before it ground to a halt in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Taped at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando, ``Rollerjam''  
began airing on The Nashville Network in January (it airs Friday at 
8 p.m. EST) and the premiere reached about 1.2 million homes, 
according to Nielsen Media Research. By comparison, cable's 
highest-rated show, ``WWF Wrestling'' on the USA Network, reaches 
about 4.6 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rollerjam'' is taped at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando  
and is shown Friday at 8 p.m. EST on The Nashville Network. Its 
January premiere reached about 1.2 million homes, according to 
Nielsen Media Research. By comparison, cable's highest-rated show, 
``WWF Wrestling'' on the USA Network, reaches about 4.6 million 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Roller Derby, men and women speed around an indoor track,  
scoring points by passing members of the opposing team, who try to 
stop them by shoving, elbowing and slamming them to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it basically follows the same rules, the  
next-generation of Roller Derby is a tad glitzier and sexier than 
its knock-'em-down predecessor, immortalized in the 1973 Raquel 
Welch film ``Kansas City Bomber.'' The skating is also faster, 
sometimes up to 35 mph, because the teams use inline skates instead 
of roller skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it's 60-plus years old, it appears very modern for  
people raised on MTV and the Extreme Games,'' said Jerry Seltzer, 
commissioner of the World Skating League, which calls itself 
Rollerjam's organizing body. 
</P>
<P>
	Seltzer's father, Leo, started the original Roller Derby in 1935  
as a way for Depression-era audiences to forget their troubles. At 
first, the game was based on distance and endurance and physical 
contact was banned.That changed two years later when audiences took 
to the shoving and pushing. 
</P>
<P>
	Roller Derby was first televised in 1948 on CBS in New York.  
Television later made stars of such skaters as Joan Weston, known 
as the ``Blonde Bomber,'' who skated for the San Francisco Bay 
Bombers in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were mean and lean,'' reminisced Diane Frederick, a  
Detroit postal worker, fan of the original Roller Derby and 
spectator at a recent taping of ``Rollerjam.'' ``The women were 
meaner than the men,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	TV producer Stephen Lamb says the inspiration to resurrect  
Roller Derby in its current form was Ms. Weston's death in 1997 at 
age 62, from an incurable nervous disease. 
</P>
<P>
	There are now five teams, each with five men and five women,  
that have already taped shows at Universal: the Enforcers, the 
Quakes, the Florida Sundogs, the Nevada Hot Dice and the Texas 
Rustlers. A sixth team, the Illinois Riot, is being put together. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaters include a cousin of boxer Marvin Hagler; a woman whose  
publicity material describes her as an ordained minister, 
bodybuilder and bodyguard; a former American Gladiator contender; 
several competitive speed skaters; a former homecoming queen from 
Iowa; and the ``creamed corn wrestling'' champion from Daytona 
Beach's Bike Week. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I found out I could knock people over, I said 'Yes!'''  
said the Sundogs' Denise Loden, 32-year-old former speed skating 
champion. ``I let all that aggression out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Loden is romantically involved with Atkinson, the Quakes  
skater whose father and grandfather competed in the original Roller 
Derby. The couple's true-life romance has been incorporated into 
the show's storyline. 
</P>
<P>
	So have the frequent outbreaks of shoving, wrestling, body slams  
and trash-talking between opposing teams that often make 
``Rollerjam'' look like the World Wrestling Federation on skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're just jealous because my muscles are bigger than yours,  
and I work out harder than you,'' the Enforcers' Jannet Abraham 
shouted at Atkinson after he wrestled with her teammate, Mark 
D'Amato, on the track. ``Your workout is at the dinner table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atkinson didn't challenge Ms. Abraham, 5-feet-9 and 197 pounds --  
the preacher known to her fans as the Minister of Pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The violence is part of it,'' Atkinson said, smiling after his  
tussle on the track. ``We're in the Jerry Springer era and I think 
that sells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`ZOE' TIMES TWO: It's back-to-back episodes of the WB comedy  
``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane'' tonight at 9 p.m. EST. First up: ``A 
Good Man Is Hard toTo Find,'' with guest stars Will Friedle (``Boy 
Meets World'') and Jacinda Barrett (``The Real World''). Zoe falls

<HEADLINE> Au Pair TV Report Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- More than 70 doctors sent a letter to CBS  
criticizing a ``60 Minutes'' report suggesting that Matthew Eappen 
was strangled, not shaken and slammed by his au pair as prosecutors 
contend. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS news magazine reported Sunday that two doctors believe  
the 8-month-old baby was strangled up to two days before he was 
hospitalized on Feb. 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for au pair Louise Woodward said they may return to  
court with what the doctors said. Prosecutors said there is no 
evidence to warrant reopening the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Woodward was convicted in October 1997 of second-degree  
murder in Matthew's death. The trial judge reduced her sentence to 
involuntary manslaughter and released her from prison. She returned 
home to England in June, after the judge's sentence was upheld on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	In January she settled a civil wrongful death case with the  
baby's parents, Drs. Sunil and Deborah Eappen. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to CBS on Tuesday, forensic experts,  
neuropathologists and pediatricians who specialize in child abuse 
said the network and the two doctors owe the Eappen family an 
apology. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's leader, Dr. Carole Jenny of Brown University's  
School of Medicine in Providence, R.I., said Wednesday the 
strangulation theory is not supported by medical literature. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty mystified by how in the world people can come to  
a conclusion that totally overlooks the skull fracture, the 
subdural hemorrhages and all of the other things that this child 
had,'' Jenny said. ``There's no doubt he had his skull busted 
open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors interviewed on ``60 Minutes,'' Dr. Floyd Gilles, a  
neuropathologist, and Dr. Marvin Nelson, a radiologist, are both 
affiliated with Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our doctors stand behind the results of more than six months  
of examining the scientific evidence in the Matthew Eappen case, 
and they feel it's fine for people to have differing opinions as 
long as those are informed opinions,'' hospital spokesman Steve 
Rutledge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' spokesman Kevin Tedesco said the 70 doctors who  
wrote the letter haven't seen the evidence that Gilles and Nelson 
have. 
</P>
<P>
	``What would be more interesting is if they could all get  
together some place and look at the evidence firsthand instead of 
basing their opinions on newspaper accounts and hearsay,'' Tedesco 
said.

<HEADLINE> Monica Yields Big Ratings for ABC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thanks to Barbara Walters and Monica Lewinsky,  
ABC chalked up its best week in the ratings in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter's interview with Ms. Lewinsky had an average viewership  
of 48.5 million last Wednesday, more than twice as many viewers as 
any other prime-time show last week, Nielsen Media Research said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's 10.1 rating and 16 share for the week easily topped CBS,  
which had a 9.0 rating and 15 share. NBC was third with an 8.6 and 
14. Fox had a 6.7 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ABC's best week since March 23, 1998, when it broadcast  
the Academy Awards, which were a big night for ``Titanic.'' ABC 
hadn't won any week in the ratings since November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home Improvement,'' ending a two-part episode in which Jill  
had a hysterectomy, finished a strong fifth place in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	With the sweeps period over, NBC reverted to reruns for its  
typically strong Thursday night lineup. That particularly hurt 
``ER,'' which slipped to ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news race with an  
8.5 rating and 17 share. NBC's ``Nightly News'' was second at 8.4 
and 17, while the ``CBS Evening News'' trailed with a 7.1 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 1-7, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``20/20,'' ABC, 33.4; ``Friends,'' NBC, 15.2; 
``Touched by an Angel,'' CBS, 15.1; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.8; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 14.3; ``Home Improvement,'' ABC, 14.3; ``Just 
Shoot Me'' Special, NBC 13.6; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 13.1; ``ER,'' NBC, 
12.2; ``Drew Carey Show,'' ABC, 11.8.

<HEADLINE> Susan Lucci in Alaska for Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- She's not going to win this contest,  
either, but that doesn't bother Susan Lucci. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucci, who plays Erica Kane on ABC's ``All My Children'' and has  
failed in 18 tries to win a Daytime Emmy, spent last weekend in the 
world of sled dogs and mushers, watching the start of the Iditarod 
Trail Sled Dog Race. 
</P>
<P>
	At Saturday's ceremonial start, Lucci was an ``Iditarider,''  
zipping through downtown Anchorage while sitting in Rick Mackey's 
sled. Mackey won the 1,100-mile race in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always read about the Iditarod in The New York Times, and  
I've always been curious about Alaska,'' said Lucci, who added that 
she was awed by the state's rugged terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	Other celebrity Iditariders included Joan Rivers, Gary Collins  
and wife Mary Ann Mobley.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Pull Back / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds pulled back Wednesday, halting a  
three-session advance, as traders locked in some gains before 
Thursday's report on retail activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/8 point  
Monday, or by $3.75 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.55 percent from 5.53 
percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have been rebounding from inflation jitters since Friday,  
bolstered by an encouraging economic report and some soothing 
remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders will scour Thursday's report on February retail sales  
for more clues on whether inflationary pressures remain under 
control. Rapid inflation makes fixed-income investments like bonds 
less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Also pressuring the bond market Wednesday were more than $4  
billion worth in new debt securities from Lucent Technologies Inc. 
and mortgage company Freddie Mac. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Wednesday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell 1/16 point to 1/8 point, while intermediate 
maturities fell 3/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.80 
points to 1,284.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged from late  
Tuesday's 4.59 percent while the discount held steady at 4.47 
percent. Six-month yields were unchanged at 4.66 percent, and the 
discount remained 4.49 percent. One-year yields rose to 4.74 
percent, while the discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.51 
percent compared with late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks was unchanged from late Tuesday's 4.56 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/16 point to 124. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.23 percent, up from 5.22 percent late Monday.

<HEADLINE> Final Four Is Maryland's Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Len Elmore and Len Bias never made it.  
Neither did Buck Williams or Walt Williams. Joe Smith and John 
Lucas fell short, too. 
</P>
<P>
	All-America players at Maryland, all of them. And there's one  
other link -- none of them played in a Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's Steve Francis' turn to try to take the Terrapins to a  
place they've never reached. Expected to go far in the NCAAs, they 
begin their bid Thursday in the first round of the South Regional 
against last year's tournament darling, Valparaiso. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no added pressure,'' Francis said before practice  
Wednesday. ``We're not here for a vacation, we're here to play 
basketball. Hopefully, we have six games to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The explosive guard sparked No. 5 Maryland the whole season,  
averaging 17.2 points in his first year since transferring from a 
junior college. The Terrapins are seeded second, but many predict 
they will emerge from the South, not top seed Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there were times when expectations were so high that it  
was tough on our players. Hopefully, we learned from that,'' coach 
Gary Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, we were always the team that would sneak up on  
somebody,'' he said. ``This year, we usually had the higher ranking 
when we played good teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland and Valparaiso play in the first of four games at the  
Orlando Arena, followed by Louisville vs. Creighton. At night, St. 
John's takes on Samford and then Indiana plays George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Maryland and Valparaiso have never met, the Terps know  
all about their 15th-seeded opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the whole basketball world learned about Valpo in last  
year's tournament. In a play epitomizing March Madness, the 
Crusaders stunned favored Mississippi when Bryce Drew -- son of 
coach Homer Drew -- hit a buzzer-beating 3-pointer for a 70-69 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone heard the story. Coach Drew and his son, the  
Cinderella story of last year's tournament,'' Maryland senior Laron 
Profit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Valpo went on to reach the round of 16, beating Florida State  
before losing to Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``We received a lot of attention for that,'' coach Drew said.  
``People now know we're 50 miles from Chicago. Most people now know 
how to pronounce Valparaiso, with a long `a,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryce now plays in the NBA for the Houston Rockets and last  
year's last-second play -- called ``Pacer'' -- has been replaced by a 
new one, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a different play this year,'' Homer said. ``It's called  
`Houston.' I think you can see why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A team looking to become this year's Valpo is 14th-seeded  
Samford, making its first NCAA appearance. Billing themselves as 
``Southern-Fried Princeton,'' the Bulldogs run the same kind of 
deliberate offense as their Ivy League idols. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Tillette has patterned his style after Princeton,  
talking to its coaches and watching game films. Last week, he even 
traveled to New Jersey to watch the Tigers play Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Samford will face a tough test in much more athletic St.  
John's. The Red Storm led the Big East in scoring in their first 
year under coach Mike Jarvis, but have not won an NCAA tournament 
game since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana also is looking for some redemption as coach Bob  
Knight's team has lost five of its last six tournament games. The 
Hoosiers are coming off last week's 16-point loss to Illinois in 
their first Big Ten tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	George Washington is led by 5-foot-4 Shawnta Rogers, the  
Atlantic 10 player of the year. The Colonials already have had a 
tough time -- because of bad weather, their plane was delayed 
several hours out of the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	Creighton is 8-1 against teams in this year's tournament.  
Louisville, however, last month beat a more formidable force -- for 
the first time ever, the NCAA overturned a postseason ban and let 
the Cardinals play. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalized for a recruiting violation, coach Denny Crum's team  
was freed because of a procedural error. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jerry Reed: Still Picking, Grinning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- Jerry Reed sits by the TV in his condo,  
a stone's throw from the 18th hole of a golf course, cracking up as 
he watches the soap opera ``Days of Our Lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now this guy -- the one with that fake Russian accent -- he's  
got the mind-control thing going with that girl,'' the 
singer-guitarist-actor-comedian gleefully explains. ``I love this 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter tries to engage him in conversation. A photographer  
glances at his watch. A publicist fidgets as his schedule slips 
away. Reed winks and turns back to the soap. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, 61, is supposed to be spending the day promoting  
``Pickin,'' his first album of new music in nearly a decade. But 
he'll do it his way, squeezing every ounce of fun out of the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're laughing your guts out, how can you be depressed?''  
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Jerry Reed Hubbard in Atlanta, he gained notoriety in the  
1970s by making people laugh with songs like ``When You're Hot, 
You're Hot'' and playing rakish good ol' boys in films, most 
notably the truck-driving sidekick in the ``Smokey and the Bandit'' 
series starring his friend, Burt Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I was never going to be a Perry Como or Tom Jones or  
Glen Campbell,'' Reed said. ``I wanted to be a Phil Harris, a Spike 
Jones. My favorite people on Earth are the Jack Bennys and Jackie 
Gleasons and Red Skeltons and Sid Caesars -- those guys that could 
just tear your head off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed's humor often overshadowed his musical talents. He's a  
superb guitarist; his instrumental ``The Claw'' has become a 
classic that guitarists struggle to master. And he's an 
accomplished singer-songwriter whose range goes far beyond novelty 
hits like ``Amos Moses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote the touching ``A Thing Called Love,'' a hit for Johnny  
Cash in 1972. Elvis Presley recorded Reed's ``Guitar Man'' and 
``U.S. Male,'' and used Reed as his guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed has played at thousands of recording sessions, including  
those of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. Chet Atkins, his mentor, 
has recorded many of his guitar instrumentals and collaborated on 
albums with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed started playing guitar at 9, and was good enough to perform  
on the bill with country stars like Ernest Tubb when still in his 
teens. He got his first record deal at 17. 
</P>
<P>
	After a stint in the military, he moved to Nashville in 1962. He  
became an in-demand guitarist at recording sessions and wrote some 
hits, but attempts to mold him into a standard country star didn't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe almost every bit of success that has come to me to Chet  
Atkins,'' Reed says. Atkins, a legendary guitarist and music 
industry executive, signed Reed to RCA and produced his records. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a nonconformist, and he suggested that I just play my  
guitar and sing my songs and he'd release singles,'' Reed says. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed hit the charts in 1967 with ``Tupelo Mississippi Flash.''  
He quickly established an inimitable style: funny, unabashedly 
Southern songs accompanied by his aggressive, complex guitar 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, he had a No. 1 country hit with ``When You're Hot,  
You're Hot.'' The song went to No. 9 on the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, his comic talents won him frequent guest shots on  
the ``Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.'' He was host of a short-lived 
network variety show in 1972, then became one of Reynolds' favorite 
movie partners, starting in 1974 with ``W.W. and the Dixie Dance 
Kings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He kept scoring country hits until 1983, including a No. 1 tune  
with ``She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)'' in 1982. Then he 
was pushed aside by a new generation of stars. 
</P>
<P>
	He continued playing concerts, but faded from national view  
until his film comeback playing an outlandishly mean Southern 
college football coach in the 1998 comedy ``The Waterboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed now has teamed with fellow country stars Waylon Jennings,  
Mel Tillis and Bobby Bare to form the Old Dogs, a less glamorous 
version of The Highwaymen, of which Jennings is a member. They sing 
comic, ribald songs about the perils of growing older. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not one of those flat-belly singers anymore,'' Reed says.  
``The record industry is one of those industries that will 
discourage you and turn you loose. They sell records to those 
screaming little girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed says he understands the country music industry's obsession  
with youth, and it's not a big deal to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``But guitar playing is timeless,'' Reed says. The 10 songs on  
``Pickin''' are all excuses for him to show off his guitar playing. 
</P>
<P>
	The album has autobiographical songs in the ``Guitar Man'' mode  
(``Does Anybody Want to Boogie''), Atkins-style acoustic 
instrumentals (``My Priscilla'') and, of course, a novelty song 
(``Talk the Talk &AMP; Walk the Walk.'') 
</P>
<P>
	On the latter, Reed plays a braggart who can't back up his big  
talk. It's the kind of record that made him a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secret of my records is the attitude,'' Reed said. ``I  
want my records to be fun and individualistic. ... Today, I can 
hear records and I don't know who ... I'm listening to half the 
time. Do you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all his musical accomplishments, Reed remains best known  
as Reynolds' partner in the ``Bandit'' movies. 
</P>
<P>
	That's fine with him, he says.  
</P>
<P>
	``To this day, kids follow me down the street talking about  
those movies,'' Reed says. ``They see the reruns on Saturday 
afternoons. The pictures gave me an (image) that kept me out there 
long after the music industry wasn't interested any more.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bullet Hits School Bus in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- A bullet struck a school bus carrying  
special education students and injured a man who was walking 
nearby, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet hit the back of the bus and sailed through a window  
on the opposite side, police spokesman Doug Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured pedestrian was hit in the torso while walking toward  
his car, Anderson said. Three students in their teens were on the 
bus. None were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still unknown if it was one shot, two shots, or if the  
bus was the intended target,'' Anderson said. ``Some witnesses 
heard one gunshot, others heard two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet passed through a section of the bus where none of the  
students were seated. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured man, who has not been identified, was hospitalized  
in stable condition.

<HEADLINE> Solar 'S' Mark Foretells Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An 'S' mark found in X-ray photos of the sun  
may forecast powerful solar explosions that can cause power 
outages, block radio communications and scorch satellites in Earth 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists said Tuesday that X-ray solar images taken by a  
Japanese spacecraft show that an S-shaped structure develops on the 
face of the sun several days before an eruption of what is called a 
coronal mass ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	The S-shaped sign, said Richard Canfield of Montana State  
University, Bozeman, can be used as a solar eruption warning 
signal. This would give power companies and satellite operators 
about three extra days to prepare for the effects of a coronal mass 
ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	Current technology detects the solar explosions as they happen.  
This gives some advanced warning since it takes three or four days 
for the explosive wave to reach Earth. The 'S' sign detected by the 
X-ray satellite would add days to the warning, Canfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The X-ray images will tell us when something is likely to  
happen,'' said Canfield, a co-author of research that detected the 
'S' sign. ``It could be developed into a powerful predictive 
tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coronal mass ejections are massive eruptions of electrically  
charged plasma, or superheated gas, from the outer atmosphere of 
the sun. The sudden release of energy can hurl 10 billion tons of 
gas into space at speeds of up to 2 million mph. The energy release 
can equal billions of megatons of TNT, said Canfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Such eruptions happen frequently and usually are harmless to the  
Earth. Occasionally, however, an explosion occurs on a side of the 
sun facing the Earth, sending a massive bubble of energy directly 
at the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Earth's magnetosphere shields the planet from most of the  
violence, but Earth's magnetic field lines can be charged suddenly 
with a powerful wave of electricity. Such surges along power lines 
have caused blackouts in the past, burning out transformers and 
disrupting service for thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave of solar energy also can disrupt long-distance radio  
transmissions and can damage satellites that are in deep space, 
beyond the protective envelope of the Earth's magnetosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	George Withbroe, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration  
scientist, said the solar storm effects now are only a nuisance. 
Power companies protect their systems from the natural electrical 
surge, and satellites are affected only rarely. 
</P>
<P>
	When humans eventually return to the moon or voyage on to Mars,  
Withbroe said, the ability to predict solar storms could save lives 
of astronauts traveling beyond the Earth's magnetosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we go to Mars, we will have to worry more about this,''  
said Withbroe. He said it is likely that Mars-bound spacecraft will 
be equipped with a shielded compartment, which he called ``a storm 
cellar.'' If Mars voyagers were warned in advance of an approaching 
solar storm, he said, they could retreat to the shelter until the 
danger passed.

<HEADLINE> Gophers Hit With Academic Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- An erupting academic scandal could leave four  
Minnesota players, including starters Miles Tarver and Kevin Clark, 
ineligible for the Gophers' game Thursday against Gonzaga in the 
first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The university was conducting a quick investigation of a report  
in Wednesday's Saint Paul Pioneer Press quoting a former university 
employee as saying she did take-home exams and other course work 
for the four current players and at least 16 former players. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper also quoted four former players as confirming that  
work was prepared for them in possible violation of the student 
code of conduct and NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Of immediate concern to university officials was the eligibility  
of Tarver, Clark, Antoine Broxsie and Jason Stanford -- the current 
players named by the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``That decision will only be made after we have fully evaluated  
all the information that we can compile in this short period of 
time,'' Chris Schoemann, the university's director of athletic 
compliance, said Wednesday. ``We expect to have that decision made 
by tomorrow morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the university suspends the players, the NCAA could  
reinstate them because there hadn't been time for a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The game between the Gophers (17-10), the West's No. 7 seed, and  
the Bulldogs (25-6), starts at 11:42 a.m. PST in the first of the 
four games Thursday at Seattle's Key Arena. The West's No. 2 seed, 
Stanford (25-6) plays No. 15 seed Alcorn State (22-26) in 
Thursday's second game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, Florida (20-8) plays Pennsylvania (21-5) and  
Weber State (24-7) meets North Carolina (24-9). 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota players declined to comment on the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anything that's going on besides our basketball  
game tomorrow with Gonzaga,'' Tarver said. ``As far as I know, I'm 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins, who told the Saint Paul paper that he knew  
nothing of the specifics of the charges, praised the ``character 
and class'' of his players Wednesday but otherwise tried to avoid 
the issue when he appeared for a news conference that is mandatory 
for all tournament teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``All our guys plan on playing tomorrow,'' Haskins said. ``The  
investigation going on is being conducted by the university and 
they are doing a great job with that. We are here to focus on 
basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schoemann, who reports to the university president's office and  
not to the athletic director, was expected to interview all four 
players. Meanwhile, the university's general counsel was conducting 
the probe back in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger questions of whether there was widespread cheating,  
and the possible ramifications on Haskins' 13-year tenure at 
Minnesota, were taking a back seat to the immediate eligibility 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very fast process,'' said Jeff Schemmel, senior  
associate athletic director. ``I'm sure in the long run a lot of 
investigating will be done. We're just trying to deal with four 
athletes right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To add to the distractions, Clark suffered a seizure similar to  
those associated with epilepsy Tuesday on the flight to Seattle. He 
was expected to play but not be at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had three major seizure attacks the past 3 1/2 weeks,''  
Haskins said. ``He won't be 100 percent but he'll be 100 percent 
there in terms of effort. His energy level won't be as high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, a starting guard, is the team's No. 2 scorer at 14.7  
points per game. Tarver, who starts at forward, led the team in 
rebounding at 7.1 per game. Both are seniors. Clark was a 
junior-college transfer two seasons ago. Tarver was a reserve on 
the 1997 Final Four team. 
</P>
<P>
	Broxie, a sophomore center, played in all 27 games this year off  
the bench. Stanford, a senior forward, played in 21 games, also as 
a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota star Quincy Lewis, the Big Ten's leading scorer at  
23.7 points per game, was not among those implicated. He said the 
Gophers will have no problem staying focused on the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go back to the hotel, watch some film, go to  
bed, get up tomorrow at 7 o'clock, have a pre-game meal, come to 
the arena and get ready to play,'' Lewis said. ``I don't care if 
the whole city of Seattle falls down, we have to be ready to play. 
As long as the gym doesn't fall down, then we're going to be there 
ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota figured to have a tough time anyway with Gonzaga, one  
of the country's best outside shooting team, and one that should a 
crowd favorite, since the campus is across the state in Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seven kids from this side of the mountains between  
Seattle and Portland and it is a great opportunity for them to play 
in front of their family and friends,'' Gonzaga coach Dan Monson 
said. ``But for a coach, it is a tremendous concern because of the 
distractions to go along with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monson had another distraction. Washington State coach Kevin  
Eastman resigned Wednesday, and Monson has been mentioned as a 
possible successor. He said he'd think about any job offers after 
the season was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be selfish about me thinking about another job right  
now,'' Monson said.

<HEADLINE> Jurors To Testify Against McDougal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Grand jurors will testify against  
Whitewater figure Susan McDougal in her contempt trial, as will an 
FBI agent who investigated her use of a government-backed 
fraudulent loan for $300,000, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Associate Independent Counsel Mark Barrett would not say Tuesday  
who else might testify this week at the trial of Mrs. McDougal, who 
remains defiant after having served 18 months in prison on a civil 
contempt citation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, 44, faces a three-count indictment alleging  
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice for refusing to talk 
to the Whitewater grand jury about President Clinton and first 
lady's business dealings in Arkansas. If convicted, Mrs. McDougal 
could be fined $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements were expected to begin this afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors wanted Mrs. McDougal to testify in September 1996  
and again in April 1998. Among other things, they wanted to know if 
Clinton knew about Mrs. McDougal's use of the $300,000 loan for 
which she was convicted of fraud in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said she didn't have any relevant information and  
that prosecutors wanted her to lie -- a claim they deny. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said that among the government's witnesses will be FBI  
agent Michael Patkus, who investigated Mrs. McDougal's use of the 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Whitewater prosecutor W. Hickman Ewing Jr. has said the  
government could prove that Mrs. McDougal had relevant information 
to give the panel, which disbanded last May. 
</P>
<P>
	During jury selection, questions centered on whether potential  
jurors harbored animosity toward Whitewater Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr, the president or Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, ex-husband James McDougal and the Clintons were  
business partners in the failed real estate development known as 
Whitewater. McDougal died in prison a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The McDougals and then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker were convicted in  
1996. Mrs. McDougal also was recently acquitted of embezzlement in 
a separate, unrelated California case.

<HEADLINE>  Now Stanford's Vulnerable in NCAAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Stanford's regular season ended ingloriously with  
a 14-point loss at Oregon State. In February, the Cardinal were 
embarrassed by an 11-point home loss to a Connecticut team missing 
its best player. 
</P>
<P>
	Now key reserve Jarron Collins, one of Stanford's best inside  
players, is using crutches because of a sprained ankle. He's an 
athletic 6-foot-9 forward who is averaging 5.2 points and 5.9 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Could Stanford be vulnerable when it opens the NCAA tournament  
against Alcorn State on Thursday? 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely, we have the most pressure on us,'' Stanford's  
Arthur Lee said Wednesday. ``But we've had pressure on us all year 
long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to the Final Four is the ultimate,'' teammate Mark  
Madsen said. ``I think we have the same hunger to make it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Final Four team last year, Stanford is making its fifth  
straight trip to the tournament under coach Mike Montgomery with 
its highest seeding ever, No. 2 in the West.

<HEADLINE>  Now Stanford's Vulnerable in NCAAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Stanford's regular season ended ingloriously with  
a 14-point loss at Oregon State. In February, the Cardinal were 
embarrassed by an 11-point home loss to a Connecticut team missing 
its best player. 
</P>
<P>
	Now key reserve Jarron Collins, one of Stanford's best inside  
players, is using crutches because of a sprained ankle. He's an 
athletic 6-foot-9 forward who is averaging 5.2 points and 5.9 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Could Stanford be vulnerable when it opens the NCAA tournament  
against Alcorn State on Thursday? 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely, we have the most pressure on us,'' Stanford's  
Arthur Lee said Wednesday. ``But we've had pressure on us all year 
long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to the Final Four is the ultimate,'' teammate Mark  
Madsen said. ``I think we have the same hunger to make it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Final Four team last year, Stanford is making its fifth  
straight trip to the tournament under coach Mike Montgomery with 
its highest seeding ever, No. 2 in the West. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canadian Dollar Hurts Snowbird Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Fern Plamondon doesn't smile when she says a  
weak Canadian dollar may benefit her shuffleboard game. 
</P>
<P>
	Plamondon, 64, who migrates from Edmonton, Alberta, to Arizona  
each winter, says an unfavorable exchange rate has prompted her to 
cut costs by doing more free activities like shuffleboard at the 
recreational vehicle park where she stays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our rent is $3,500 instead of $2,500. We're trying to stay at  
home (at the R.V.) and spend less money,'' Plamondon said as she 
arranged handmade lace at a weekly bazaar at the Good Life Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses throughout Arizona used to a steady stream of  
spending by Canadian snowbirds say they are being hurt by a weak 
Canadian dollar, which is leading to fewer visitors who spend less 
and head home sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	And an alarming number of Canadians are saying goodbye to the  
Good Life altogether by selling their units, according to park 
manager Marianne Weins. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year is very unusual. Maybe we have 20 to 30 units for  
sale, all by Canadians. Usually we have about six,'' says Weins, 
who is in her 17th winter at the Good Life. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian dollar hit a 30-year low in October and has hovered  
around that level since then, according to Peter Dalton, spokesman 
at Custom House Currency Exchange in Victoria, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian dollar's decline means that between March and  
October 1998, American goods and services became about 9 percent 
more expensive for Canadians. Dating back to October 1997, the 
American price hike for Canadians is 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For many Canadians, that has meant cutting back on winter  
escapes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're calling to find something cheaper and for a shorter  
period of time,'' says Fred Farshler, a rental agent at McCulloch 
Realty in Lake Havasu City. 
</P>
<P>
	The sluggishness of this year's rentals prompted McCulloch to  
shorten the minimum rental period from three months to one month, 
unprecedented in his 15 years in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, by the end of November we're completely rented  
through April, but this year's been an ongoing process,'' Farshler 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Another property manager in Lake Havasu City, Londonderry  
Realty, also reports a downturn in Canadian business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We usually have about 20 Canadians, but this year we have only  
five,'' says Marie Neadle, who has managed the company's 200 
properties for the past nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	The decrease in numbers doesn't tell the whole story.  
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of (the Canadians) stayed for one month instead of  
three months and they have tended to look at cheaper units,'' 
Neadle says. 
</P>
<P>
	They also spend less.  
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't bought much clothes this year and we have to shop  
much more carefully for our groceries,'' says Edie Lawton, 63, a 
Good Life resident from Fruitvale, British Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sew and I haven't been buying much material, either,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnie Barsness, president of the Lake Havasu Tourism Bureau,  
said the decrease in Canadian visitors got the winter season off to 
a slow start for rental agencies in Lake Havasu City, but March 
bookings look promising. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamber of Commerce officials and the Arizona Office of Tourism  
recently made a trip to western Canada to try to drum up snowbird 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the exchange rate is hard to counteract. We have no  
control over it,'' Barsness says. 
</P>
<P>
	Milt Fort, acting director of sales and marketing at the Mesa  
Convention and Visitors Bureau, says Mesa is also reporting a 
decline in Canadian business because of currency woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far this winter we are probably 3 or 4 percent down and  
people who come say they are planning to spend less,'' Fort says. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all destinations in Arizona say they are seeing fewer  
Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appear to be a busy as ever,'' says Roger Beadle, executive  
director for the Yuma Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``Our walk-in 
traffic at the visitors center is up 67 percent over last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Yuma Convention and Visitors Bureau does not  
specifically track Canadian visitors, property managers in Yuma 
reflected a similarly rosy picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been saying we'll be seeing fewer and fewer Canadians  
because of the currency situation, but we haven't seen that 
happening,'' says Jami Frandsen of Realty Executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Yuma property manager, who also reported a strong rental  
market among Canadians, says Yuma enjoys certain advantages over 
other areas that might give it more staying power. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Lake Havasu) is a lot smaller and they're probably more  
congested,'' says Barbara Horn, also of Realty Executives. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dalton of the Custom House Currency Exchange says from what  
he hears from about 3,500 Canadian customers who travel to Arizona, 
everyone is feeling the effect of the currency decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It affects everything, including the day-to-day costs,''  
Dalton says. ``In terms of long-term planning, the exchange rate is 
the most significant factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Finn, 74, from Alberta, Calgary, says the exchange rate  
prompted him shorten his stay this year from five months to four. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he's holding out on cutting down on golf.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably continue golfing twice a week, but I might have  
to cut down next year if things don't improve,'' says Finn with a 
smile.

<HEADLINE> Gallup Presidential Poll Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some results from a Gallup Poll on the presidential race,  
Elizabeth Dole, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al 
Gore. When the total is less than 100 percent, the remainder didn't 
know or offered no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--As of today, do you lean more toward Al Gore, the Democrat, or  
Elizabeth Dole, the Republican? 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, 45 percent; Dole, 50 percent. About the same as in January  
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--As of today, do you lean more toward Al Gore, the Democrat, or  
George W. Bush, the Republican? 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, 41 percent; Bush, 56 percent. A Gallup poll in January had  
Bush and Gore in a dead heat. Many polls in recent months have 
given Bush a double-digit lead. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--Everything else being equal, who do you think would make the  
better president. ... 
</P>
<P>
	A man, 42 percent; a woman, 31 percent; would not matter, 22  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who preferred a man as president, the reasons most  
often cited were ability to control emotions, the tradition of male 
presidents and ability to make decisions. Among those who said a 
woman would make a better president, the three reasons most often 
cited were their common sense or intelligence, a need for a change 
and their compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	--If your party nominated a generally well-qualified woman for  
office would you vote for that person? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, 92 percent; no, 7 percent. A decade ago, eight of 10 said  
yes to that question. And in 1975, less than three-quarters of the 
population said yes. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Gallup poll of 1,014 people was taken Friday through Sunday  
with an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Criticizes Fraud Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura sharply criticized the timing  
of a newspaper story Wednesday on a report of academic fraud in the 
Minnesota basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	``They felt the need to release this story the day before the  
NCAA tournament. It couldn't have waited until after?'' Ventura 
said when asked for a comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saint Paul Pioneer press reported Wednesday that a former  
university employee said she wrote papers and did take-home exams 
and other course work for at least 20 university basketball 
players, including four now on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Four former players told the newspaper that work was prepared  
for them in possible violation of the student code of conduct and 
NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer Press editor Walker Lundy said the newspaper began  
researching the story three months ago and didn't complete the 
reporting and writing until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the governor's world, he would either have us run the story  
prematurely or sit on the story for a while. The Pioneer Press 
doesn't do either,'' Lundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's report came a day before the start of the NCAA  
basketball tournament. The Golden Gophers are scheduled to play 
Gonzaga on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's despicable in the fact that they would release a  
story like this that apparently has been going on for, what -- a 
year?'' Ventura said. The newspaper said it spent three months 
investigating the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said the newspaper put its needs above others by  
publishing the story ``so that they could take the pleasure of 
these young people, who have worked so hard to get to that 
tournament and somehow try to spoil it for them, it somehow doesn't 
surprise me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We take no more pleasure in writing about allegations of  
academic fraud at the University of Minnesota than we do in 
watching the governor speak without the facts,'' Lundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Gardebring, the university's vice president of  
institutional relations, didn't attach any special motivation to 
the story's timing but did say it came at the worst possible time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts us in a box in terms of having to make a decision  
while our players are in Seattle getting ready for a tournament,'' 
she said. ``They have rights, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, a former professional wrestler who attended community  
college, didn't comment on the substance of the story, other than 
to say he had ``full confidence'' in university President Mark 
Yudof and the Board of Regents to handle the matter ``in whatever 
manner is appropriate.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Newsweek To Launch in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newsweek is teaming with scholastic publisher  
Weekly Reader Corp. to launch Teen Newsweek in time for the next 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen Newsweek, which will launch in September, will be aimed at  
students in sixth to ninth grades and teachers nationwide, the 
publishers announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident that Teen Newsweek will get teens to talk  
about, understand and form their own opinions about news issues,'' 
said Peter Bergen, president and chief executive of Weekly Reader. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen Newsweek joins a growing number of attempts by magazine  
publishers to reach a younger audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek's main rival, Time, launched Time for Kids in 1995 for  
readers ages 9 to 12. Parade magazine also created a teen spinoff, 
React, that same year. In addition, Time Inc. last year 
successfully launched Teen People, and Hearst Corp. plans to test a 
teen-oriented spinoff to Cosmopolitan in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen Newsweek will publish an eight-page edition 26 times during  
the school year, along with a four-page teacher's guide. Weekly 
Reader will select, edit and design news stories gathered by 
Newsweek's staffers, develop the teacher's guides, and handle 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies would not say how much they are investing in Teen  
Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek, published by The Washington Post Co., is the nation's  
second-largest newsweekly behind Time, with a circulation of more 
than 3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekly Reader was established as a scholastic current-events  
magazine in 1928 and has spawned eight other publications, 
including Read and Current Science. It is owned by Primedia Inc., 
whose other titles include New York, Seventeen and Soap Opera 
Digest.

<HEADLINE> Energy Secretary: Weapons Labs Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to blunt criticism from Congress,  
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says there's ``no evidence'' of 
additional espionage activity in the federal weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the measures in place and the counterintelligence  
presence that we have at the labs now, the polygraphs, the 
increased scrutiny ... we believe the problem is addressed,'' 
Richardson said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said counterintelligence programs have been increased  
at the labs and ``there's no evidence of any more (espionage) 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers on Tuesday were questioning security at  
U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories and whether Clinton 
administration efforts to boost ties with China delayed a 
long-standing espionage investigation at one of the research 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing national security controversy erupted after the  
Energy Department fired a Chinese-American computer scientist at 
the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he had been under FBI 
investigation since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, quickly went into hiding. He has not  
been charged with a crime, although federal officials said the FBI 
investigation was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday defended the administration's  
policies toward China and its investigation of a nuclear weapons 
espionage case that he said the administration inherited from the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keep in mind that happened in the previous administration,''  
Gore said in an interview on CNN's ``Late Edition'' program. He 
said that ``law enforcement agencies pressed it and pursued it 
aggressively with our full support'' once the concerns were raised 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gore and other administration officials left unanswered  
why the FBI investigating action was taken this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The political sensitivity of the issue was highlighted Wednesday  
when Republican presidential candidates Lamar Alexander and Steve 
Forbes called for President Clinton's national security adviser, 
Sandy Berger, to resign over the issue, and candidate Patrick 
Buchanan said Berger should explain what happened or quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger, traveling with President Clinton in Central America,  
said Tuesday night, ``I reject the notion there was any dragging of 
feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said he received a narrow briefing in 1996 on an alleged  
espionage case at Los Alamos. Then in July 1997 he got a briefing 
from Energy officials about China and the labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard enough in the July '97 briefing to believe we had a  
serious problem,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued a presidential directive in February 1998  
ordering stepped up security at the weapons labs and there hasn't 
been any allegation of ``leakage of technology'' since those 
safeguards were imposed, said a senior administration official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and other  
lawmakers on Tuesday questioned why the investigation had taken so 
long before any action was taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``That makes no sense, especially where he'd been suspected of  
espionage and they would keep letting him work there (with) all the 
security clearances,'' Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the 
Intelligence panel's chairman, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby said his committee would question Richardson and FBI  
Director Louis Freeh at a closed-door hearing next week about the 
delay and whether the administration downplayed the incident when 
it first surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, in a telephone interview Tuesday night, defended the  
investigation as ``extremely thorough and vigorous'' and said he 
had no choice but to wait before taking action against the 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moment the FBI gave me the green light to terminate this  
individual, I did,'' said Richardson. He said he had been advised 
not to pursue the dismissal until ``a thorough investigation and 
questioning took place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Taiwan, Lee, whom associates describe as being in  
his 50s, had worked at the prestigious weapons research laboratory 
in New Mexico for about 20 years. According to U.S. officials, he 
became a prime suspect of an espionage investigation as early as 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was triggered by the concerns of U.S.  
Intelligence agents that China in the 1980s had obtained top secret 
information on nuclear warhead technology that allowed the Chinese 
to develop miniaturized nuclear warheads so that more than one 
warhead could be delivered on a single missile. Nuclear scientists 
at Los Alamos had developed the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	With the administration under sharp attack from congressional  
Republicans, Gore sought to contain the damage and also defend the 
administration's broader efforts to work with China. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is the most populous country in the world. Its economy  
is growing and its role in the world is going to continue to grow 
whether we want that or not,'' Gore said. ``And so, obviously, 
having a relationship with them within which we can try to affect 
their behavior ... (is) in our best interest. We do that without 
compromising our interests in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flap over China's alleged theft of nuclear weapons secrets  
and questions about the speed of the investigation fueled what 
already had been long-standing criticism from Republican lawmakers 
about U.S. Technology transfers to China. GOP-led congressional 
committees in 1997 also investigated but were unable to prove 
whether China had tried to buy influence in the 1996 Clinton-Gore 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Several foreign-born business owners, including some with  
connections to China, have been charged as part of the Justice 
Department's investigation into campaign finance abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior administration official, traveling with Clinton in  
Latin America, acknowledged that it was clear before 1998 that the 
weapons labs ``were enormously porous.'' He said other countries, 
not just China, ``had access that was troublesome'' because 
scientists from around the world did nuclear work at the 
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Wohlers Shows Old Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Wohlers showed a glimpse of his old  
form Tuesday, retiring three of four batters as he pitched a 
scoreless inning for Atlanta against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers entered in the third inning and gave up a single to  
right field by Mike Piazza, then retired John Olerud and Craig 
Paquette on grounders and Robin Ventura on a flyout. Wohlers threw 
11 fastballs and one slider. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing today was I didn't get ahead,'' Wohlers said.  
``I got behind a couple of hitters and I was able to come back and 
throw some fastballs. I think Piazza's ball would have been a home 
run if the wind wasn't blowing in so hard. That's all right. A 
little luck now and then doesn't hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Javy Lopez was impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to last year, this is a big, big, big improvement,''  
Lopez said. ``He's starting to get his confidence back and 
hopefully this is not just a two-game thing. Today was kind of 
windy, so it's hard to throw hard. But on a nice day, he would have 
thrown 95 easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox also was pleased. In his first outing, Wohlers  
gave up four earned runs in an inning against Houston last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great hope right now,'' Cox said. ``You really didn't  
know what to expect. He's not that far away from getting good. He 
was throwing plenty hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers said pitching is becoming natural again for him. He said  
thought earlier he could correct his problems physically, but that 
has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get to where I'm at now, I needed to concentrate on my  
mechanics,'' Wohlers said. ``My brain would just think about bad 
stuff. What I try to do now, especially when I'm warming up, is 
remind myself about mechanical things, to get to the point where my 
mechanics are dumb proof. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half the pitches I threw today, I just saw the sign and I just  
went toward the target. That's where you need to be. You know what 
pitch you're going to throw, you know you can make yourself do it. 
Just go. My mind's basically blank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 7,323 cheered wildly when Wohlers was announced as  
starter Kevin Millwood's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I'll get to the point where I get the last out of  
the ballgame and people stand up and cheer because we won,'' 
Wohlers said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Lawmakers Push School Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans expect debate on their  
education bill to go more smoothly than it has in the Senate, which 
has wrangled over a similar measure for five days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a good reason why a bill like this hasn't just  
hasn't flown through,'' Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., said of the bill, 
which would give states more flexibility in the way they can spend 
federal education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the House version of the bill would pass quickly,  
despite chances that the House Democrats will offer the same kind 
of amendments slowing down the Senate bill. The House was working 
late Tuesday on how to manage the potential amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	A success in the House could put pressure on the Senate, which  
remains deadlocked over Republicans' determination to block a 
new-teacher plan that Democrats want to attach to the bill. The 
amendment by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., would reduce class sizes 
by hiring 100,000 teachers over the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since education's emergence as a popular polling issue, both  
parties have rushed to be the first to pass an education bill this 
session, leading to frustration on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to ask whether the Democrats really want to give  
states autonomy,'' said Joe Karpinski, a spokesman for the Senate 
Labor Human and Resources Committee, which sent the bill to the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, charged that Democrats are using  
the bipartisan education flexibility plan to push through other 
initiatives they want and force Republicans into an early vote 
against those ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is all meant, personally, to get someone to make  
a vote against a program that could be used in a 30-second 
television spot,'' Voinovich said as his fellow Republicans failed 
on a second attempt Tuesday to limit the number of proposals that 
can be attached to the ``ed-flex'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats insisted Tuesday they are not trying to  
embarrass the Republicans on education. Senate Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D., said he unsuccessfully offered to limit the number 
of Democratic amendments and ensure the bill would be completed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said Democrats will keep offering their proposals, even  
if Republicans pull the bill from the floor out of frustration and 
Democrats have to attach their plans to other measures. A key focus 
is the class-size plan. 
</P>
<P>
	An initial $1 billion for the teacher plan was approved by  
Congress last year in a spending bill compromise. President Clinton 
has said the whole plan would cost $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the second day in a row, the Republican leadership has  
continued its efforts to stand in the way of voting on an amendment 
to finish the job of hiring 100,000 teachers to reduce class 
size,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, which started with broad bipartisan support,  
has become enmeshed in political scuffles. Two more votes to try to 
block the amendments were scheduled for today. A third try is 
slated for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S 280.

<HEADLINE> Soccer's Wynalda Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- San Jose Clash forward Eric Wynalda  
had surgery Wednesday to repair torn knee ligaments and will miss 
most of the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynalda, 29, was on loan to Leon in Mexico's first division when  
he was hurt two weeks ago. He is expected to be sidelined for 
5-to-6 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury originally was thought to be only a sprain but it  
turned out to be a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial 
meniscus in his left knee. Dr. Bert Mandelbaum, the U.S. national 
team's physician, repaired the injury during a 90-minute operation 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynalda has 32 goals in 101 career appearances for the United  
States and is the national team's leading scorer. He was scheduled 
to remain with Leon until May, and the Clash were thought to be 
discussing possible trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clash obtained Raul Diaz Arce during the offseason, making  
Wynalda expendable, but the Salvadorian forward has not reported to 
the Clash in a contract dispute.

<HEADLINE> Washington Digs Out From Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The capital city was slowly digging out and  
getting back to work today after the first significant snowfall in 
years snarled commutes and gave many people a day off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wish I had gotten a Jeep,'' said John Smithson as he  
dug his sports car out of a high drift caused by snowplows on a 
city street early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the region's approximately 270,000 federal workers took  
the day off, although the snow day counts against their annual 
leave time. And with many others staying home as well, traffic was 
light. The roads were mostly passable, with some slippery, slushy 
spots on side roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress for the most part was back to normal today, with the  
House going to work on an education bill and scheduling four votes 
on measures that were postponed Tuesday as the heavy snow piled up. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hearings were canceled, including two House Veterans  
Affairs Committee hearings and a Senate hearing on education 
research, but dozens of other committees were meeting as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Light flurries still hung in the air today as Washington awoke  
to 8.5 inches of snow -- the most in years and more than enough to 
close schools and offices across the city and its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some runways were closed at both Reagan National and Dulles  
International airports, and airlines told travelers to expect 
delays. The city's subways and buses were running, although buses 
skipped some hilly sidestreets. 
</P>
<P>
	Those heading to work were mostly good-natured, despite deep  
slush that made street corners tricky for those without tall snow 
boots. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a White Christmas three months late,'' said Ann  
Powers, who was commuting to work at a law firm in downtown 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, which took the city somewhat by surprise, carried the  
first significant snowfall in three years, and the most from a 
March storm since 1993. Red-faced forecasters began the day Tuesday 
predicting only an inch or two of snow, and spent the day revising 
their estimates upward.

	``The Disco Box'' (Rhino) -- Various  

</P>
<P>
	Rhino Records has unleashed its most ambitious effort yet  
devoted to the ``Boogie Nights'' generation -- disco balls and 
platform shoes not included. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Disco Box'' ($59.98) is four discs that include most of  
the essentials of one of the most criticized music forms ever, from 
the instrumental ``Love's Theme'' (1973) to Kool &AMP; The Gang's 
``Fresh'' (1985). 
</P>
<P>
	To today's dour, techno dance crowd, disco may sound awfully  
dated. Still, most of the 80 tunes register instant nostalgic 
smiles (``Rock the Boat'' by The Hues Corporation, for one). Others 
should remain in a time capsule (``Get Dancin''' by Disco-Tex &AMP; the 
Sex-O-Lettes featuring Sir Monti Rock III). 
</P>
<P>
	The set is packaged in a silver holographic box with liner notes  
that try too hard to put a kind of academic spin on an era that 
just wanted to have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazingly, the box set ignores the most popular disco act ever --  
the Bee Gees. No ``Saturday Night Fever'' tracks? Rhino couldn't 
get the rights. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. Despite its knocks over the years, maybe disco will  
be taken seriously for the mindless fun that it was. So get out 
there and shake your booty!

	``Confessin''' (Black Top Records) -- Rusty Zinn  

</P>
<P>
	Generation-X singer-guitarist Rusty Zinn proves once again the  
timelessness of the blues. Zinn artfully heads East with his 
California swing roots to meet Chicago blues about midway in the 
jump tradition of Kansas City. Zinn's voice brings to mind Gene 
Pitney, which just adds to the nostalgic good-times feeling of 
``Confessin','' Zinn's second compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't think of Zinn as some sort of novelty act. He studied  
with Chicago's Luther Tucker and cut his teeth touring with Kim 
Wilson. For ``Confessin','' Zinn enlisted fellow West Coast 
troupers Rick Estrin and Charlie Baty of Little Charlie and the 
Nightcats. At 28, Zinn should be ``confessin''' with authority for 
some time to come.

	``Garage Inc.'' (Elektra Records) -- Metallica  

</P>
<P>
	If you think that when you've heard one heavy metal record  
you've heard them all, then hear this. ``Garage Inc.,'' Metallica's 
collection of covers and tributes to its predecessors, incorporates 
almost the entire history of the genre into two CDs -- one filled 
with new tracks and another with previous covers. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the results are spotty, the highlights make the  
project worth a listen, especially since one of heavy metal's 
biggest acts digs deep into its past. 
</P>
<P>
	Metallica is usually at its best when it doesn't take itself too  
seriously, and the same applies here. The four-piece band's 
rapid-fire cover of Budgie's ``Crash Course in Brain Surgery'' 
stays just on the right side of camp. And on Diamondhead's ``It's 
Electric,'' Metallica shows its knack for finding the hook among 
all the power chords. 
</P>
<P>
	Those looking for the crossover appeal will cuddle up to the  
band's edgy take on the Bob Seger road-blues classic ``Turn the 
Page,'' but the musical highlight of the collection is the 
melancholy ``Loverman,'' originally produced by Nick Cave And The 
Bad Seeds. The track shows how Metallica can tone it down while 
staying true to their heavy metal roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Garage Inc.'' shows Metallica has a sense of history, but more  
important, fun.

	``Valence Street'' (Columbia Records) -- The Neville Brothers  

</P>
<P>
	The Neville Brothers -- singers Art and Aaron, saxophonist  
Charles and percussionist Cyril -- still manage to keep their sound 
fresh, as evidenced on their 14th album ``Valence Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The record is named for the street where the brothers grew up in  
New Orleans, and like that city, the CD is a melting pot of styles. 
The album swings from the soaring soul of ``A Little Piece of 
Heaven'' through the funked-up version of Pete Seeger's folk 
classic ``If I Had a Hammer'' to the smooth jazz of the 
instrumental title track. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight is a collaboration with rapper Wyclef Jean. But  
the Neville Brothers' classic sound only complements the toned-down 
hip hop on ``Mona Lisa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the reason for the Brothers' longevity is that the music  
is timeless. Or as shown on ``Valence Street,'' maybe it's because 
they have made it timeless, and uniquely their own.

	``Wander This World'' (A&AMP;M) -- Jonny Lang  

</P>
<P>
	This teen-ager's exceptional first album, the 1996 ``Lie to  
Me,'' like any such startling debut, raised more questions than it 
answered. This, his second release, answers them. Jonny is for real 
and this disc is mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
	His ability, at age 17, is intimidating. As a singer, Jonny is  
settling down. As a guitarist, his play and sophisticated variety 
are astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonny Lang is already a darling of teen fanzines, and the  
sharpest track of this disc, ``Still Rainin,'' has been getting 
rock radio exposure. We dare say it now: Lang could rival Stevie 
Ray Vaughan in attracting an outside, pop-weary audience to 
reinvigorate the blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Blues veterans like B.B. King have seen his gift, pulling Lang  
into concerts and onto their releases as a guest player. But Lang 
is truest on his own, with some nicely written songs, refreshing 
variety, and soulful vocals on some tracks that remind us of Steve 
Marriot or perhaps of his own idol, Otis Redding. 
</P>
<P>
	Lang's covers of Luther Allison's ``Cherry Red Wine'' and  
Prince's ``I Am'' show a range that should be the envy of many pros 
who have been at it since before the kid was born.

	``Cecilia and Bryn: Duets'' (London/Decca) -- Cecilia Bartoli,  
Bryn Terfel, Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, 
conductor Myung-Whun Chung 

</P>
<P>
	In their first joint recording, Cecilia Bartoli and Bryn Terfel  
shine with as much luster as their performances of Mozart's ``The 
Marriage of Figaro'' at the Metropolitan Opera last fall, a 
compelling duo in a light and delightful recording that figures to 
be a big hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The mezzo-soprano and baritone start off with much of the first  
15 minutes of ``Figaro,'' through Figaro's ``Se vuol ballare.'' 
Miss Bartoli, who has no problem adjusting to higher soprano lines, 
then goes into ``Un moto di gioia,'' one of the pair of alternative 
arias that created a controversy when she sang them for three 
performances at the Met. (It substitutes for ``Venite 
inginocchiatevi'' in the second act). 
</P>
<P>
	Terfel is the perfect Figaro and Miss Bartoli is a compelling  
Susannah, hitting it off like Ricky and Lucy. It makes the listener 
hunger for a full ``Figaro'' recording from the pair. 
</P>
<P>
	Terfel switches characters for the Count's third-act duet with  
Susannah, ``Crude! perche finora farmi languir cosi?'' They follow 
with the Dorabella-Guglielmo duet from ``Cosi fan tutte'' (``Il 
core vi dono''), the Zerlina-Don Giovanni duet (``La ci darem la 
mano''), and a Papageno-Papagena excerpt from ``The Magic Flute.'' 
These two could go on singing Mozart for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	While Miss Bartoli takes a star turn in a pair of Rossini duets  
-- ``Dunque io son ... tu non m'inganni?'' from ``The Barber of 
Seville'' and ``Ai capricci della sorte'' from ``The Italian Girl 
in Algiers'' -- it is not the ideal role for Terfel, who struggles 
with the coloratura. He does much better in the Adina-Dr. Dulcamera 
``Quanto amore!'' from Donizetti's ``The Elixir of Love.'' Some 
opera house should immediately sign the pair for this opera. 
</P>
<P>
	While they often sing different repertoire, Miss Bartoli and  
Terfel appear to have a great future as a duets act.

<HEADLINE> Vicar Favored for Florida Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A familiar cast of characters will be  
back for Saturday's Florida Derby, and that's OK with trainer Carl 
Nafzger -- as long as the results are the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's talking about a surprise, and I hope to heck there  
aren't any,'' said Nafzger, who trains Fountain of Youth winner 
Vicar, the 3-1 morning line favorite for the $750,000 Florida Derby 
at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A field of 11 3-year-olds, including the impressive filly Three  
Ring, were entered Wednesday for the 1 1/8-mile race. Vicar, a winner 
in three of five career starts, will also be facing five others who 
challenged him in the Fountain of Youth, including the second, 
third and fourth-place finishers in Cat Thief, Certain and Grits'N 
Hard Toast. 
</P>
<P>
	Also taking another shot at Vicar will be Casanova Star (eighth)  
and Aly's Alley, who was ninth in his first start this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Marquard, breeder and owner of Aly's Alley, expects his  
colt to run much better in the Florida Derby, one of several major 
Kentucky Derby prep races around the country this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was too anxious after being off 3 1/2 months,'' said Marquard,  
who was delighted his colt drew the No. 11 post. ``He seems to do 
better from the outside, so we hope to give you all a pleasant 
surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aly's Alley left from the No. 13 post when he finished second in  
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Plesa, the trainer of Three Ring, was far from thrilled  
when his filly drew the No. 10 post. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outside post certain doesn't enhance her chances,'' Plesa  
said. `I'll talk it over with owner Barry Schwartz and we'll decide 
whether we want her in the Florida Derby or scratch her from the 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Three Ring is pulled out, she would run in the Bonnie Miss on  
March 16, the closing day at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
	No filly has ever won the Florida Derby, first run in 1952.  
Three Ring, with four wins in seven career starts, is coming off a 
14 3/4-length romp in the Davona Dale on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, who will be ridden by Shane Sellers, won the Fountain of  
Youth by a neck over the D. Wayne Lukas-trained Cat Thief. The 
victory came after a disappointing fifth-place finish in the Holy 
Bull on Jan. 16, and it gave Nafzger a touch of Derby fever again. 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger won the 1990 Kentucky Derby with Unbridled, who also won  
the Florida Derby. The winner of the Florida Derby has gone on to 
win the Kentucky Derby nine times, with Thunder Gulch the last to 
do it in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't be happier with him'' Nafzger said of his Wild  
Again colt, who is owned by James Tafel. ``He just keeps getting 
better. I saw what I wanted to see in his last work. We wanted him 
to relax and listen to his rider. He's a pretty happy horse right 
now. I think we have something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Derby field, from the rail out, with jockeys and  
odds is: Valid Trefaire (Jose Santos, 15-1); Cat Thief (Pat Day, 
4-1); Certain (Kent Desormeaux, 6-1); Adonis (Jorge Chavez, 10-1); 
Vicar (Sellers, 3-1); Casanova Star (Mike Smith, 20-1); Wondertross 
(8-1, Jerry Bailey); Grits'N Hard Toast (Robbie Davis, 8-1); First 
American (Jose Velez, 20-1); Three Ring (John Velazquez, 5-1); and 
Aly's Alley (Edgar Prado, 15-1). 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Derby (ABC-TV, 5:43 p.m. EST post time) is one of  
several Derby preps at three tracks this weekend, with trainer Bob 
Baffert's brigade set to run in California and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Baffert sends out current Derby favorite Exploit  
and Prime Timber in the San Felipe at Santa Anita and the filly 
Silverbulletday in the Fair Grounds Oaks; on Sunday, he's got 
Answer Lively -- the 2-year-old champion -- and General Challenge in 
the Louisiana Derby and the filly Excellent Meeting in the Santa 
Anita Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert nearly captured the Triple Crown the last two years,  
winning the Derby and Preakness with Silver Charm in 1997 and with 
Real Quiet in 1998.

	Gov. Jeb Bush ordered Morris ``Mike'' Scionti removed as  
executive secretary of the athletic commission after the state's 
inspector general determined there was a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Scionti ``committed improper and or unethical acts constituting  
malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty and insubordination,'' 
Bush said in an executive order firing the official. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush suspended another commissioner, Alvin Goodman, who the  
inspector general discovered worked as a lawyer for people who were 
licensed by the commission and solicited political contributions 
from licensees. 
</P>
<P>
	Scionti did not immediately return a call to his home, and a  
message left at Goodman's office after business hours was not 
immediately returned. His home telephone number is not listed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush appointed the assistant executive secretary, Shelley  
Bradshaw, to serve as interim executive secretary until the 
commission meets March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general found that Scionti asked King in June 1997  
for a donation to his foundation, known as the Florida State Boxing 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Jack Guggino said in a sworn statement to the  
inspector general's investigators that Scionti approached King and 
other promoters asking for help with the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'Look, can you help us with this foundation for the  
purpose of helping boxers get through life, giving them an 
education, because boxing isn't everything,''' the inspector 
general's report quoted Guggino as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	King said through a spokesman Wednesday that Scionti was wrongly  
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels it is wrong that Mike Scionti was fired for something  
that was beyond his control,'' said King spokesman Greg Fritz. ``He 
was trying to do something right for boxing in establishing the 
foundation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the donation, Scionti advocated to the commission that it  
reverse its policy of excluding longterm contracts between 
promoters and fighters, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts tie fighters to promoters for several fights.  
Critics argue they exploit young boxers by tethering their earnings 
to one promoter. Supporters, such as King, contend promoters need 
to earn back the money they invest in young boxers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, King was seeking a change in the commission's rules  
to allow for the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	That might have helped King, who was being sued over similar  
contracts he had with boxers Julio Cesar Chavez and Mike Tyson., 
who were trying to get out of the agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Woodyard, general counsel for the Department of Business  
and Professional Regulation, which oversees the commission, said he 
told Scionti of the report's findings Friday and asked him if he 
wanted to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Scionti refused. The governor's office also asked for Scionti's  
resignation before firing him. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-member athletic commission is appointed by the governor  
and confirmed by the state Senate. Members serve four-year terms. 
The commission's main job is to regulate professional boxing and 
kickboxing in Florida.

	DHARMSALA, India (AP) -- The Dalai Lama is marking the 40th  
anniversary of his people's exile today, and he is accusing China 
of lacking the ``political will and courage'' to seek a compromise 
on Tibet. Meanwhile, Tibetan protesters in New Delhi burned 40 
Chinese flags, lit firecrackers and burned an effigy representing 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The crowd also stood in silence for 
a minute to honor Tibetans who had died over the last four decades

<HEADLINE> NEA Cancels Children's Book Grant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Endowment for the Arts rescinded  
a grant to help a Texas printer publish and distribute a children's 
tale after finding the book was written by Mexican guerrilla leader 
Subcomandante Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
	William J. Ivey, the federal arts agency's head, canceled the  
$7,500 subsidy for the English edition of the children's book after 
a New York Times reporter brought the title's author to his 
attention, an NEA spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I determined that this was not an appropriate use of  
government money,'' Ivey said in a statement relayed by the 
spokeswoman, Cherie Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivey's concern was based on the possibility that some of the  
money could find its way to Marcos, Simon said, although the 
publisher said Marcos would not. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcos leads the Zapatista guerrillas in the southern state of  
Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, called ``The Story of Colors,'' is a folk tale about  
Mexican gods, as told to Marcos by an Indian friend. It was 
originally published in Spanish in 1997 by a Mexican press with no 
financial help from the U.S. agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the front cover of the English edition, just printed by  
Cinco Puntos Press -- the small publisher in El Paso, Texas, that 
had been slated to get the grant -- is a photo of Marcos wearing a 
black ski mask over his face and with ammunition belts slung across 
his chest. That photo was not in the original Mexican edition, the 
NEA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grant had been approved in the last few weeks by NEA panel  
that focused on the book's artistic merit, Simon said. None of the 
grant money had gone out, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grant was approved by lower-level NEA officials, by an  
independent panel and by the National Council for the Arts, which 
includes two Republican House members, the spokeswoman said. They 
have a voice but no vote on the council. 
</P>
<P>
	The NEA staff knew of Marcos' authorship, and that appeared in  
the summaries the panel approved, Simon said. The final grant 
needed Ivey's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Republican leadership tried again last year to abolish  
the agency, after members complained the NEA had helped some 
projects they considered obscene. The effort failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Cinco Puntos Press, which has so far spent  
$15,000 to print 5,000 copies of Marcos' book, called the decision 
``spineless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This book is essentially about diversity and tolerance,  
everything the NEA is supposed to stand for,'' Bobby Byrd, a poet 
who runs the publishing company, told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas publisher still will get $7,500 from the NEA to  
publish an English version of another Spanish book, this one not 
written by Marcos, Simon said.

<HEADLINE> Gophers Say Guard Clark Will Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota guard Kevin Clark is expected to  
play in Thursday's first-round game in the NCAA tournament, despite 
his seizure on the team's charter plane en route to Seattle, coach 
Clem Haskins said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins said Clark won't be 100 percent but he'll give ``100  
percent effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins said Clark, the Golden Gophers' No. 2 scorer,  
received medical clearance to play against Gonzaga and went through 
a light practice Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark has taken medication since childhood to stave off  
seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had three really major attacks in the last 3 1/2 weeks,''  
Haskins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark has been averaging 14.7 points a game.  
</P>
<P>
	Clark's playing status also is jeopardized by allegations  
published Wednesday in the Saint Paul Pioneer Press that he and 
three other current Golden Gophers committed academic fraud. At 
least 20 current and former players are accused of turning in 
papers, tests and other coursework prepared for them by a 
university employee and passing it off as their own work. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clark can't play, Haskins said the Gophers will start Mitch  
Ohnstad.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Urge More Hockey Padding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Young hockey players should wear better neck  
and chest padding to protect against rare but catastrophic blows 
that can trigger cardiac arrest or strokes, doctors recommended 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Barry J. Maron of the Minneapolis Heart Institute said he  
knows of 12 cases over the last 15 years in which young male hockey 
players died suddenly on the ice after being struck by hockey pucks 
or fists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not trying to scare the populace,'' Maron said.  
``Sports is safe. But we also need to inform the public about 
risks, even when they are small.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maron said that such deaths are not routinely reported to health  
authorities, and he believes many more hockey fatalities have 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts have calculated that overall, about one in 200,000  
school-age athletes dies annually from accidents on the playing 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Maron released his figures at a meeting in New Orleans of the  
American College of Cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the padding typically worn by young hockey players does  
not completely cover the neck, and the area over the chest is 
usually totally exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Routine blows to the neck can rupture the arteries that feed the  
brain, triggering bleeding strokes. Even seemingly innocent blows 
to the chest can cause cardiac arrest if they happen at precisely 
the right moment in the heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Adolph Hutter of Massachusetts General Hospital said he  
agrees that young hockey players -- especially those 8 to 13 -- 
should have better chest and neck protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are calling for is very simple,'' Hutter said.  
``Preventing even five or six deaths is worth it. We're not talking 
about changing the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutter said extra chest protection may not be needed for older  
players, since their chests are less pliable. Hutter is team 
cardiologist to the Boston Bruins and a former president of the 
college of cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 12 hockey fatalities compiled by Maron, six resulted from  
blows to the chest, five to the neck and one to the face. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart is most vulnerable during repolarizing phase, when it  
is preparing to contract again. On an electrocardiogram, this point 
is called the T-wave, and it comprises about one-hundredth of the 
entire heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting the chest at this point can put the heart into  
fibrillation, which is deadly unorganized quivering. When this 
happens, athletes instantly collapse and usually cannot be revived 
with CPR.

<HEADLINE> Joe Torre Has Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees manager Joe Torre has  
prostate cancer and left the World Series champions today to 
undergo treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine,'' the 58-year-old manager said, ``and I am  
looking forward to taking care of this problem and getting back to 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how advanced the disease was or how  
long Torre will be away. The Yankees also did not say who will 
manage in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who led the Yankees to a record 125 victories last  
season, will undergo treatment at Johns Hopkins University in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre's first season in New York in 1996 was marked by the death  
of brother Rocco and a heart transplant for brother Frank during 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe will handle this situation with the same determination and  
courage that he has always demonstrated,'' Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner said. ``Our prayers are with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Word of Torre's condition came two days after Yankees great Joe  
DiMaggio died of complications from lung-cancer surgery and on the 
same day Darryl Strawberry was to return from colon cancer surgery 
in October. Strawberry was in the lineup today for a split-squad 
game with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was just last week that former Yankees star Catfish  
Hunter appeared at the team's camp, too weak to shake hands because 
of Lou Gehrig's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very hard day for all of us,'' Strawberry said. ``We  
as a team are devastated. Like when it happened with me, we as a 
team will stick together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre told catcher Joe Girardi before the Yankee split squad  
left Tampa this morning. Girardi told the rest of the team before 
the two-hour bus ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys were very sad,'' Girardi said. ``It is hard when it  
hits so close to you. Joe was upbeat. He's a fighter and he will 
make it through this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is second only to lung cancer among cancer  
killers of American men, taking about 40,000 lives annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Most prostate cancer happens sporadically; patients have no  
particular family history of the disease. However, about 1 in 10 
cases seems to be clearly inherited, because many men in the same 
family have it. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre is the third prominent person in baseball to be diagnosed  
with cancer this spring. Atlanta Braves first baseman Andres 
Galarraga had a cancerous tumor removed from his back last month 
and will miss the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell, a former Yankees  
prospect, was diagnosed last month with testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Marv Levy, the former coach of the Buffalo Bills, underwent  
surgery for prostate cancer during the 1995 NFL season and, at age 
70, was back coaching within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre has a 302-184 record and won two World Series  
championships in his first three years as Yankees manager. Last 
year, Torre led the Yankees to an AL-record 114 wins and swept the 
San Diego Padres in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who signed a two-year contract extension last month,  
joined Casey Stengal and Ralph Houk as the only managers to lead 
the Yankees to the postseason in their first three years at the 
helm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees trip to the World Series in 1996 was Torre's first  
as a player or manager after 4,268 games in the majors.

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Rules Against Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's bankers had a setback Wednesday  
as a federal judge denied their request to block a new government 
rule allowing more people to join credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington denied  
the American Bankers Association's request for an injunction 
barring the National Credit Union Administration from putting the 
rule into effect. She has yet to rule on the merits of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time the banking industry's largest trade  
group has gone to court over the issue. The first legal action led 
to a 1998 Supreme Court ruling favoring the banks over the credit 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCUA, an independent federal agency, ``continues to pose a  
threat to small financial institutions,'' said Beth Climo, an 
official of the bankers' group. Unless the agency is ``reined in, 
we will see a migration of customers and dollars'' to big credit 
unions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule, adopted by the agency in December, codifies a law  
enacted last summer in a stinging defeat for the banking industry. 
The legislation overrode the Supreme Court ruling by allowing 
federally chartered credit unions to continue to include more than 
one occupational group in their memberships -- as long as each group 
doesn't exceed 3,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	NCUA Chairman Norman D'Amours himself had voted against the  
rule, saying he feared it would hurt smaller credit unions although 
he did not believe it was illegal. The other two board members, 
Yolanda Wheat and Dennis Dollar, voted in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit union industry has said the new rule will allow  
millions of people -- including employees of small businesses -- to 
join lower-cost credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers' group maintained that the rule went beyond the  
bill's intent by promoting big, expansive credit unions with 
multiple membership groups at the expense of small, local ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit unions compete with banks -- especially small community  
banks -- by often providing lower-cost loans and other services at 
more favorable rates for their members. They contend they are the 
best source of help for people of modest means. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry has bitterly protested credit unions'  
exemption from federal taxes, which was retained by the bill.

<HEADLINE> American Breaks Through in Skiing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- After seven mostly fruitless years  
on skiing's top circuit, Chad Fleischer finished second Wednesday 
in the downhill at the World Cup finals -- trailing only the 
season's best downhiller, Norway's Lasse Kjus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will my dad ever have a surprise when he comes out of  
anesthesia,'' said Fleischer, whose father had knee surgery at home 
in Vail, Colo., after a skiing accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called my personal trainer and told him to make sure my dad  
knows about it when he comes to. He's going to be psyched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Fleischer is also going to be sporting a new hairdo to  
match his son's -- a bleach-blond job with black and brown spots, a 
copy of a snow leopard's coat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now my dad will have to dye his hair the same way,'' Fleischer  
said. ``He promised if I got a podium, he'd do it. Maybe they'll 
give it to him when he gets out of surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, coming off what he called an ``absolute wreck'' of a  
season, Fleischer took a three-week break in Hawaii to contemplate 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was three seconds out every race,'' he recalled. ``I had a  
million excuses -- it was boots, it was skis, the coach. But the 
real problem was me. I couldn't figure out how to put it together 
and get faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus' victory stretched his overall World Cup points lead to 42  
over fellow Norwegian Kjetil Andre Aamodt and 88 in front of last 
year's overall champion Hermann Maier. Kjus also won an 
unprecedented five medals in the worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	Three races remain before the season ends Sunday. Aamodt was  
fourth in the downhill and Maier tied for ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	On the women's side, 22-year-old Canadian Melanie Turgeon -- like  
Fleischer -- got the first top-three finish of her career with a 
third in downhill behind winner Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria 
(1:54.16), and Norway's Ingeborg Helen Marken 1:54.47. Turgeon 
clocked 1:54.70. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally a podium. I'm so excited,'' said Turgeon, in her  
seventh season on the circuit. ``It's been a long time coming. I 
took it out of my back pocket. I gave it everything I had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer wrapped up the overall World Cup title last week and  
is a prohibitive favorite to add season super-G and giant slalom 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer is 27 and old by racing standards. Entering the season  
he'd never finished better than 11th in any World Cup, a record he 
topped slightly this season with a best of ninth in a super-G and 
11th in downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a month ago, he was mostly an also-ran with a wild haircut  
-- the best American racer on a modest team that misses the injured 
Olympic gold medalist Picabo Street, or retired Olympic gold 
medalist Tommy Moe. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came his sixth last month in super-G in the worlds in Vail.  
Last week he won a downhill training run in Norway and then came 
Wednesday's breakthrough -- a silver medal in 1 minute 49.89 
seconds, just .16 behind the downhill season champion Kjus, who is 
also a favorite to win the overall season title.

<HEADLINE> House Hears of Foster Care Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When he was just a kid, Reggie Rollins had to  
look out for his younger brother and sister because his mother, a 
drug addict, couldn't care for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were many times when there was no food, or heat, or  
electricity, because our family income had gone to buy drugs,'' 
Rollins, 21, of Stamford, Conn., told the House Ways and Means 
subcommittee on human resources Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	After years in foster care, Rollins ended up at a group home,  
run by the Domus Foundation, that he credits for giving him the 
skills to live on his own. Now, he shares an apartment and goes to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	``The group home had life skills classes where I learned about  
money management, transportation, cooking and other skills I would 
need,'' said Rollins, one of many witnesses who asked Congress to 
increase funding for programs that help foster children make the 
transition to independent living. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, about 20,000 teen-agers without permanent families  
leave foster care each year when they turn 18. Without support, 
many have a difficult time keeping a job or an apartment, and often 
end up in prison or living on the street, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these youngsters experience depression, isolation and  
loneliness,'' said Carol Williams, a U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services associated commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too early to say how Congress may address the problems  
facing the after-foster care population. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md., has proposed legislation that would,  
among other things, let states continue providing benefits, 
including Medicaid, to foster care youths up to age 21 if they are 
working or in school. Now, benefits end at 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., the subcommittee chairwoman, is  
also considering drafting her own bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has also proposed increasing funding  
for the Independent Living Program, which provides services to 
older children in foster care, by 50 percent, to about $105 million 
a year. The states would provide a $45 million match. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, federal funding for the program has held at about  
$70 million a year, but the number of children age 16 and older in 
foster care has grown from about 62,000 in 1992 to over 77,000 in 
1998 and is expected to continue to grow at least for the next 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has also proposed a new state grant program  
to help pay for room and board for youths, age 18 to 21, who are 
out of foster care and enrolled in school or job training. Funding 
would go from $5 million in fiscal 2000, which starts Oct. 1, to 
$20 million in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, of HHS, and William Pinto, adolescent services  
coordinator for Connecticut's Department of Children and Families, 
cited studies that found alarming trends among young people 
recently out of foster care. 
</P>
<P>
	Within two to four years, just half had completed high school,  
less than half were employed, 25 percent had been homeless for at 
least a night, 25 percent of the men had spent time in prison and 
60 percent of the women had at least one child, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These young people have suffered enough,'' said Pinto, whose  
program serves more than 600 Connecticut youths a year.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Italia Mum on Olivetti Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- After meeting for several hours late Wednesday,  
Telecom Italia's board postponed making a statement on its 
long-awaited plan to fend off a hostile takeover effort by Olivetti 
SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's directors are expected to issue a statement Thursday,  
a company spokeswoman said. The delay added to the drama 
surrounding Olivetti's $57.3 billion bid, which, if successful, 
would be the biggest-ever European telecom deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Olivetti announced its takeover plans on Feb. 20, analysts  
have been expecting Telecom to merge with its 60 percent-owned 
mobile phone subsidiary, Telecom Italia Mobile, to make such a 
takeover more expensive. A merger with TIM would add some $21.8 
billion to the price the much smaller Olivetti would need to pay 
Telecom shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian news agency Ansa reported earlier Wednesday that it  
had obtained a draft copy of the plan calling for the merger. 
Telecom's chief executive Franco Bernabe stated two weeks ago that 
he would ask his board of directors to approve a merger with TIM. 
</P>
<P>
	In other measures aimed at driving up its value, Telecom will  
also offer investors the right to convert their nonvoting savings 
shares into common stock and will seek permission to buy back up to 
10 percent of all capital, ANSA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report didn't specify whether Telecom Italia would adopt all  
three measures or if its board would be asked to opt for one or 
more of them. 
</P>
<P>
	ANSA said Telecom Italia would also move ahead with asset sales.  
</P>
<P>
	However, a source close to Olivetti claimed Wednesday that any  
of these defensive measures would be illegal under Italian 
regulations unless Telecom first obtained the approval of 30 
percent of its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that a  
merger between Telecom and its mobile subsidiary would only 
increase the size of what Olivetti would have to buy and would not 
boost Telecom's value to shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Guillen Finally Gets Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Jose Guillen's visa waiver was approved  
by the U.S. State Department, and the Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder 
might arrive at spring training as early as Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy had asked Sen. Rick Santorum to  
help Guillen regain his visa. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as Jose gets the visa in his hands, our hope is he'll  
be on the next flight here,'' Pirates general manager Cam Bonifay 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen remained in the Dominican Republic for three weeks,  
missing the start of spring training, because U.S. immigration 
officials questioned the validity of a marriage license he 
presented before trying to return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both senators really helped move this process along with the  
State Department and made the whole thing happen very quickly,'' 
McClatchy said. ``We are very appreciative of that. It's a relief 
to get this out of the way and get Jose Guillen back to where he 
needs to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following an investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service refused Monday to reinstate Guillen's visa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a question about Jose misrepresenting himself  
in documents,'' McClatchy said. ``But this is a 22-year-old kid who 
recently lost his father. He might not have had the guidance that a 
normal 22-year-old would have. He might have made some mistakes, 
though I don't think they were intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to sit down and talk with Jose once he gets here. I  
want to found out everything that happened and see if I can 
possibly provide some counseling or guidance to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum was a strong supporter of the effort to build a new  
stadium for the Pirates and helped obtain federal funding for 
transportation projects near the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonifay would not say if Guillen will be fined. The mandatory  
reporting date was March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be a private matter,'' Bonifay said. ``I do want to  
talk to Jose, though. I'm sure he's done a lot of explaining to a 
lot of people these past couple of weeks. We'll sit down and talk 
about things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, who is recovering from a shoulder injury sustained in  
winter ball, has already missed so much spring training that he may 
start the season at Triple-A Nashville and miss the Pirates' April 
5 opener against Montreal at Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once Jose gets here, he'll receive the same physical all the  
other players do,'' Bonifay said. ``If he checks out fine 
physically, then we'll put him on a program designed to get him 
into shape to get ready to see game action. How long it will take 
him to get ready for the start of the season remains to be seen 
until he gets here and we see what kind of shape he is in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen has been the Pirates' starting right fielder for two  
seasons after making the jump from Class A to the major leagues 
during 1997. He hit .267 last year with 14 homers and 84 RBIs in 
153 games.

<HEADLINE> Study: Hepatitis Behind Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The most common form of liver cancer is on the rise in the  
United States, and the increase is expected to continue until 
hepatitis B and C are brought under better control. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma increased 71 percent  
from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, according to researchers at 
the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Albuquerque, N.M. 
Hospitalization and death rates for all types of liver cancer were 
also found to be increasing at a similar pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Liver cancer will strike an estimated 14,500 Americans in 1999,  
according to the American Cancer Society. Most of them will get 
hepatocellular carcinoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatocellular carcinoma is nearly always fatal; only 5 percent  
of sufferers are alive five years after diagnosis, because the 
tumors usually are found only after the cancer has spread. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancer is often caused by chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis  
C, viral diseases that lead to liver scarring, known as cirrhosis, 
which in turn can lead to liver cancer. Hepatitis also can cause 
other changes in liver cells that make them cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcoholism is another leading cause of cirrhosis and liver  
cancer. But alcoholism is declining and hepatitis B infections are 
slowing because of a vaccine and effective treatments. So 
researchers believe most of the increase in liver cancer is due to 
hepatitis C, a disease discovered a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Americans with hepatitis C got it during the 1960s and '70s  
from transfusions before the blood supply was cleaned up by 1992. 
The virus can also be spread between drug users sharing needles, 
and in rare cases, through sex. In half of all cases, doctors do 
not know how patients got it. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 4 million Americans are infected with the hepatitis  
C virus, but no one knows the exact number because it can take up 
to 30 years for symptoms to develop. There is no vaccine and the 
only available treatment does not help the majority of patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists call hepatitis C a hidden epidemic.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people still don't know they have it,'' said Dr. Jack  
Wands, a liver research expert at Brown University. ``I think it 
will continue to rise until we have either a vaccine or an 
effective treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors should test patients with hepatitis-induced cirrhosis  
for liver cancer, because if tumors are caught early enough, 
surgery can be successful, said Dr. Hashem El-Serag, lead author of 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis B is more infectious but is easier to treat. It is  
spread through blood, sex or from mother to child at birth. About 
200,000 Americans are diagnosed each year. The vaccine has been 
available since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Hepatitis A, a relatively mild form of the virus, is not a risk  
factor for liver cancer. It is spread primarily through 
contaminated food, such as shellfish from tainted water or 
restaurant food that has been touched by infected employees.

<HEADLINE> Kidd Subs for Hill on Olympic Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Grant Hill's upcoming wedding  
opened a spot for Jason Kidd on the U.S. men's Olympic basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd was among the nine players officially selected to the  
qualifying team today by USA Basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The others, all of whom are expected to remain on the team for  
the 2000 Olympics, are Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Gary Payton, Tim 
Hardaway, Steve Smith, Tom Gugliotta, Allan Houston and Vin Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who was among the original nine selections, opted not to  
play in this summer's qualifying tournament July 14-25 in San Juan, 
Puerto Rico, because it conflicts with the date of his planned 
marriage to the singer Tamia. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd, the league leader in assists and one of the flashiest  
players in the NBA, gave his commitment late last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich will coach the U.S. squad  
in both the qualifying tournament and the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Three non-NBA players will be added later this year to the team  
for the qualifying tournament. The United States must finish first 
or second in that tournament to qualify for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Three NBA players will be added to the Olympic team after the  
1999-2000 season, with Shaquille O'Neal almost certain to receive 
one of those spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone are among the early  
candidates for the other two spots. 
</P>
<P>
	If the U.S. qualifies, it will use NBA players in the Olympics  
for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Dream Team won the gold medal in the 1992 Olympics  
at Barcelona, and an American team comprised entirely of 
professionals won the gold medal in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of NBA players was selected to represent the United  
States in last summer's World Championships at Athens, but those 
players were replaced when they would not commit to playing in the 
event of a lockout by the owners.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks $15M for Indian Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked Congress for $15  
million Wednesday to cover Interior Department expenses defending 
itself in a lawsuit over Indian trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the White House said the funds -- over and above  
the general budget request that Clinton submitted last month -- were 
needed in the current budget year ``to carry out critical 
activities, including court-ordered document production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed on behalf of some 3,000 individual Indian  
money accounts against the Interior and Treasury departments, 
alleges mismanagement of $500 million in Indian trust funds. The 
money includes lease revenue, royalties and court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge last month found Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt of court 
over their delay in producing records sought by five account 
holders who filed the lawsuit. The administration was ordered to 
pay legal fees the plaintiffs incurred while waiting for the 
records.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- In an attempt to calm critics who  
claimed he was steamrollering plans for a new constitution, 
Venezuela's president limited his own participation in the process 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sovereignty of electing members of the assembly belongs to  
the people and not the president, as some have said in an attempt 
to make me look like a tyrant, an autocrat,'' President Hugo 
Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt, said in a 
nationally broadcast address. 
</P>
<P>
	He provoked a storm of controversy when he took office last  
month and issued a decree calling for a national vote April 25 on 
whether Venezuela should write a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The decree also called for a national referendum asking  
Venezuelans to give Chavez the right to decide how assembly members 
are chosen. Critics claimed it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez says a new constitution is needed to fight a corrupt  
political establishment many blame for squandering vast oil 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan announced Wednesday, Venezuelans would choose 103  
members of a constituent assembly in open elections. Active 
soldiers and high-level elected officials, including Chavez, would 
be barred from running. 
</P>

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- The president of the central bank said  
Wednesday Brazil should be able to jump-start its sluggish economy 
in the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Arminio Fraga said he had ``received good  
signs'' by foreign banks on their exposure in Brazil, estimated at 
$20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Many had decided to continue extending credit to Brazil and none  
has said credit would be reduced. A few said they planned to 
increase credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil and the International Monetary Fund revised the original  
$41.5 billion rescue package after Brazil floated its currency in 
January. Since then, the real has lost nearly 40 percent of its 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday, the real strengthened for the sixth consecutive day,  
closing at 1.86 per dollar. In late February, the real reached its 
weakest point at 2.23 per dollar.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's human rights image has been hurt by a  
critical U.S. State Department report and the case of an 
Israeli-born TV station owner forced into exile, a newspaper quoted 
U.S. Ambassador Dennis Jett as saying Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the report released Feb. 26 and the case of Baruch Ivcher  
had ``greatly affected Peru's image abroad,'' the Lima newspaper El 
Sol quoted Jett as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The report called Peru's judicial system corrupt and susceptible  
to government pressure and said President Alberto Fujimori 
interfered with press freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	It highlighted the case of Baruch Ivcher, the Israeli-born  
majority owner of Channel 2, which in 1997 broadcast reports 
linking Peru's military and National Intelligence Service to human 
rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	After airing the reports, a court revoked Ivcher's Peruvian  
citizenship, arguing he never renounced his Israeli citizenship. 
Since Peruvian law does not allow foreigners to own TV stations, 
another court stripped Ivcher of his controlling interest in 
Channel 2. He fled to exile in Miami.

	Meanwhile, Alexander called for the resignation of National  
Security Adviser Sandy Berger over allegations that Clinton 
administration efforts to boost ties with China delayed a 
longstanding espionage investigation at a research facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that this is one of the most serious national  
security breaches in 50 years,'' Alexander said. ``For his 
unwillingness to act on this serious matter, Mr. Berger should 
resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger, traveling with President Clinton in Guatemala, defended  
the administration's work on the investigation as ``appropriate'' 
and swift. ``I have no intention of resigning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, two other Republican presidential hopefuls also had  
harsh comments on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``Berger and others who dragged their feet on this must go,''  
said Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Berger is the responsible authority here,'' Pat Buchanan said.  
``He ought to explain his actions to the country or resign.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Intervenes Over Satellite TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Satellite TV customers losing Fox and CBS  
programs would get some relief under a bill passed by a Senate 
panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved on a voice vote by the Senate Commerce  
Committee, is the latest twist in the dispute between satellite 
companies and broadcasters over the conditions under which viewers 
who get their TV from satellite can watch network programs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 700,000 satellite TV customers already have lost Fox and  
CBS signals under an order from a federal court in Miami. Another 
order by the same court will cut off an additional 1.5 million 
customers from CBS and Fox signals by April 30. None of these 
orders affect NBC, ABC or other networks' affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	The order affects customers who the court said aren't legally  
entitled to receive the network programs. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate bill becomes law, however, customers who lost the  
network programs would once again be able to watch them on their 
satellite systems until Dec. 31, 1999. If the bill becomes law 
before April 30, it would avert a second cutoff, allowing customers 
to continue receiving the CBS and Fox signals until Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	And it would prevent satellite customers from also losing NBC,  
ABC or other networks' affiliates during that period, said the 
committee's counsel, Lauren Belvin. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee agreed Wednesday to add this provision by Sen. Jay  
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., to the satellite bill written by Senate 
Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are not guilty in this,'' Rockefeller said.  
</P>
<P>
	After Dec. 31, satellite customers living closest to their local  
stations -- as determined by a technical test involving the 
stations' coverage areas -- would be cut off from the network 
programs, Belvin said. But customers living on the edges of the 
stations' coverage areas may be able to continue receiving the 
signals unless federal regulators decide otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would give satellite TV customers, for the first  
time, the right to receive local TV stations on their satellite 
systems. This would help make satellite companies stronger 
competitors with cable companies, which are permitted to deliver 
local TV signals to cable customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bill doesn't change the existing test for determining  
when satellite customers can legally receive ``distant'' network 
programs. Federal law allows satellite companies to provide distant 
network signals from other broadcast areas to customers only if 
those customers can't receive their local stations using rooftop 
antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite and broadcasting industries have been at odds for  
years over how to interpret an arcane legal test for determining 
when a satellite customer can't get a local signal. Under it, some 
satellite customers aren't legally permitted to receive network 
programs, yet they can't get a decent picture from their local 
station with an antenna. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said even though this standard  
``makes no sense,'' the political reality is that trying to change 
it would kill the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters said they don't like the committee's bill, but  
stopped short of saying they'll try to kill it. It's not clear when 
the bill will be voted on by the Senate. Similar legislation is 
moving through the House. Some satellite companies and consumer 
groups support the Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 303.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Sign Fullback Jon Witman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers have re-signed backup  
fullback Jon Witman to a three-year $3.2 million contract, choosing 
to keep him over starter Tim Lester. 
</P>
<P>
	Witman began the 1998 season as the Steelers' starting fullback,  
but gave way to Lester six weeks into the season after Lester 
returned from a shoulder injury. After the season, running back 
Jerome Bettis said he would be very unhappy if the team didn't 
re-sign Lester, his best friend and team blocker. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelers director of football operations Tom Donahoe said that  
after talking to Lester's agents, Lamont Smith and Peter Schaffer, 
Witman was the more ``signable'' of the two fullbacks. The deal all 
but assures that Lester will not return to the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is trying to say it is one versus the other,''  
Donahoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't look at it that way. We try to sign as many of our  
guys as we can. Some are easier to sign than others. Some are more 
willing to sign than others. We talked to Tim's guy early, and he 
didn't act like he wanted to talk. We were talking to Jon and it 
worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis has not yet said what he thinks.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's not happy,'' said Schaffer. ``Jerome feels Tim  
is the best blocking fullback in the NFL, not to take anything away 
from Witman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lester, 30, is considered the better blocker but the Steelers  
consider Witman, 26, better at running and receiving. 
</P>
<P>
	Witman's style of play may better suit the offense that new  
coordinator Kevin Gilbride is installing. The Steelers have used 
Witman not only at fullback, but also on the wing near the line of 
scrimmage.

<HEADLINE> Broken Freighter Pulled to Sea Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALDPORT, Ore. (AP) -- One way or another, the Navy is determined  
to make sure the oil-laden bow of the freighter New Carissa never 
reaches shore again. 
</P>
<P>
	The freighter's broken bow section -- which twice ran aground on  
some of Oregon's most pristine beaches -- is again being towed out 
to sea for burial, along with its 130,000 gallons of thick bunker 
fuel, in water 12,000 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard cutter had been scheduled to use its deck gun to  
scuttle the floating derelict. Later, the task was assigned to the 
destroyer USS David R. Ray and its 5-inch guns. 
</P>
<P>
	But today, the Navy said it plans to sink the hull by placing  
demolition charges on board. That likely would entail putting 
people back on board the New Carissa, something Coast Guard 
officers said Monday they hoped to avoid. There was no immediate 
explanation for the change of plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Air strikes also are an option, said Navy Lt. Cmdr. William  
Fenick. 
</P>
<P>
	By 6 a.m. today, the bow section was 90 miles offshore, on its  
way to a burial spot 250 miles from land. 
</P>
<P>
	A temperature of about 34 degrees on the ocean floor is expected  
to further thicken the oil, already near the consistency of 
asphalt, and prevent it from doing any more environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, the tow cable between the bow section and the tug  
Sea Victory was snapped in a storm about 50 miles offshore. The 
wreck washed ashore at Waldport, 80 miles north of Coos Bay, the 
spot where the whole ship originally ran aground Feb. 4 and broke 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	It was pulled off the beach Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Worries ashore turned to the estimated 70,000 gallons of oil the  
New Carissa spilled while it was aground at Coos Bay. Much of it 
has yet to wash up, though tar balls have been seen as far away as 
southern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Biologists said 312 birds have died since the Japanese-owned  
ship first spilled oil Feb. 8. There was oil visible on at least 
139 of the birds. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship's 220-foot stern section still sits mired in the sand  
at Coos Bay. Salvage crews have yet to decide what to do with it.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Get Glen Rice From Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The retooling of the Los Angeles Lakers  
was completed Wednesday. Now, it will be determined if the makeover 
results in the championship they so badly desire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, believing they were in need of an accurate outside  
shooter, acquired one of the NBA's best in Glen Rice from the 
Charlotte Hornets along with forward J.R. Reid and reserve point 
guard B.J. Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the Hornets receive All-Star guard Eddie Jones and  
center Elden Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the respective rosters, the Lakers waived  
reserve forward Corie Blount and the Hornets waived forward Joe 
Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	The blockbuster deal, rumored for over a month, was made on the  
eve of the league's trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very difficult thing to trade such good players, and  
especially so when they are such quality people,'' said Jerry West, 
the Lakers' executive vice president for basketball operations. 
``But in Glen Rice, we feel we've acquired the best shooter in the 
NBA and also one of the league's best players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this takes us one step closer to our ultimate goal of  
having an NBA championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, who reached the Western Conference finals last May  
before being swept by the Utah Jazz, are going for their first 
championship since 1988 and the days of Showtime, orchestrated by 
Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	They won five titles during the 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
	The 25 percent turnover of their roster followed by two weeks  
the firing of coach Del Harris and hiring of Kurt Rambis as his 
successor, as well as the signing of forward Dennis Rodman, the 
NBA's leading rebounder for the last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Shaquille O'Neal, the NBA's No. 2 scorer, had said he  
hoped to be joined by a thuggish rebounder and pure outside 
shooter. Now, he's gotten both. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, 31, hasn't played this season following surgery to remove  
loose particles from his right (shooting) elbow in late January. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-8 forward, Rice has averaged 20.8 points and 4.8  
rebounds in nine NBA seasons, six with Miami and the last three 
with Charlotte. He averaged 22.3 points last season to rank sixth 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	He figures to step in at small forward for the Lakers, with Kobe  
Bryant moving from that spot to shooting guard, replacing Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers reportedly were willing to give Rice a new contract,  
although terms were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time All-Star, Rice has made 1,216 3-point shots, third  
in league history, and is 101 points shy of the 15,000-point mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, 30, was Charlotte's No. 2 scorer this season, averaging  
14.5 points in 15 games. The 6-foot-10 Reid was taken immediately 
after Rice in the 1989 draft -- fifth overall -- and has career 
averages of 8.7 points and 5.2 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 31, was the 18th overall selection in the 1989 draft  
and has averaged 10.2 points and 3.4 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade comes three days after the resignation of Hornets  
coach Dave Cowens, who was unhappy with his salary. Charlotte won 
over 50 games each of the last two seasons and made the playoffs, 
but was just 5-11 this year entering Wednesday night's game at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets general manager Bob Bass pointed to the team's injuries  
in making the move. Rice is one of three starters either out for 
the year or sidelined for significant stretches due to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all of our injuries this season, this trade really gives  
our team two quality starters and a chance to compete for a playoff 
spot,'' Bass said. ``It has greatly improved our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-6 Jones, an All-Star the last two years playing in his  
fifth NBA season, has established himself as one of the league's 
better 3-point shooters and defenders and was one of the most 
popular Lakers players, often eliciting the chant of ``Ed-die, 
Ed-die'' from fans at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 27, led the Lakers in steals in each of his first four  
seasons, and ranked seventh in the NBA in 3-pointers last year, 
when he also was placed on the league's all-defensive second team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jones is a premier scorer and defender in this league,'' Bass  
said. ``We are excited to get this all-star caliber player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' name came up in several trade rumors the last couple of  
years, and he wasn't shy about saying how sick he became because of 
the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, after scoring 16 points in a 103-99 victory over the  
Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night, he said, ``If it (a trade) 
doesn't happen, it (speculation) will just start up again on July 1 
(the first day of the free-agent signing period). ... It's been 
mentally draining, the whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, 30, a 7-footer who played college ball at Clemson, has  
shown flashes of brilliance since the Lakers made him a first-round 
draft pick in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he was one of the most unpopular Lakers, due mainly to  
inconsistency and, perhaps, because of a seven-year, $49 million 
contract signed before the 1996-97 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Many have thought a trade of Campbell would be addition by  
subtraction, but it was speculated that few teams would be 
interested in his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Campbell has been at his best in the last couple of  
years when getting a chance to start regularly at center, which 
happened when O'Neal missed substantial playing time due to injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, for example, he averaged 10.1 points and 5.6  
rebounds in 81 games, but 15.5 points and 7.0 rebounds in the 28 
games he started. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets coach Paul Silas, who replaced Cowens, said before the  
game at Philadelphia he was ``elated'' with the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will make us a lot more athletic,'' Silas said. ``The  
biggest plus is Elden Campbell is our center, and Derrick Coleman 
will now play (power forward). We have a real good starting lineup 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie Jones can play forward or guard, and he wants to be  
here. That's a big plus. I've known him for years, and he's a fine 
young man. To get an All-Star like him is just great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets said Jones will play his first game for them Friday  
night in Washington, and Campbell will make his Charlotte debut 
Sunday at New York against the Knicks.

<HEADLINE> Glitches in Army Parachute System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) -- Some Army paratroopers have stopped  
using a new kind of backup parachute after it failed to open during 
tests on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 28,000 members of the 18th Airborne Corps who  
are stationed at Fort Bragg are using an older backup parachute 
while Army safety officials examine the new one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we continue to see this as a fairly short-range  
situation,'' Lt. Col. Rick Spearman said Wednesday. ``Our only 
concern right now is for us to do the prudent thing, the right 
thing -- not place soldiers at unnecessary risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Bragg officials said there are no known cases of it failing  
during a jump. Paratroop units at other Army bases, including Fort 
Benning, Ga., continue to use the new model. 
</P>
<P>
	Airborne units began using the Modified Improved Reserve  
Parachute System in November. It has a spring-loaded mechanism to 
help it open. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Fort Bragg scaled back use of the parachutes March  
3 after a soldier pulled his reserve rip cord while on the ground 
and nothing happened. Safety investigators then examined 10 
parachutes and found six did not deploy when the rip cord was 
pulled. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin Aerospace, the manufacturer, said the new parachute has  
saved six lives since Fort Bragg began using it last year.

<HEADLINE> Professor Wins Religion Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ian Barbour, whose ``Issues in Science and  
Religion'' influenced a generation of theologians studying science 
and scientists exploring theology, today won the $1.24 million 
Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour, 75, a professor at Minnesota's Carleton College, won  
the world's richest annual award for his work on the dialogue 
between science and religion. He has also examined ethical issues 
raised by technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Templeton Prize was established by mutual funds entrepreneur  
John M. Templeton to cover a category omitted by the Nobel prizes. 
Past winners include Mother Teresa, the Rev. Billy Graham, author 
Alexander Solzhenitsyn and prison evangelist Charles Colson. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour's pioneering book was published in 1965. His recent  
works include ``Ethics in an Age of Technology'' (1993) and 
``Religion and Science: Historical and Contemporary issues'' 
(1997). 
</P>
<P>
	``There is evidence that interest in religion is growing today  
among a significant minority of scientists,'' Barbour said in 
remarks prepared for his acceptance speech. ``Many scientists also 
hold that the applications of science raise ethical questions that 
science itself cannot answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour defined four ways of looking at science and religion --  
conflict, strict separation of the two domains, spiritual 
dimensions of science and dialogue between the two fields. 
</P>
<P>
	He contended that the latter is ``the most promising approach.''  
</P>
<P>
	Barbour, a layman in the United Church of Christ, said he will  
give $1 million of his prize to the Center for Theology and the 
Natural Sciences, affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union in 
Berkeley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Beijing, Barbour is the son of a Scottish Presbyterian  
father and a U.S. Episcopalian mother. He studied physics at 
Swarthmore, Duke and the University of Chicago, where he did 
studied under Enrico Fermi, co-developer of the first atomic bomb. 
He also earned a theology degree from Yale Divinity School. 
</P>
<P>
	After chairing the physics department at Kalamazoo College in  
Michigan, he was hired by Carleton in 1955 to teach physics and 
religion. In 1981, Carleton named him a professor of ``science, 
technology and society.''

<HEADLINE> D'Amato To Pen 'George' Column </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They say politics makes strange bedfellows, but  
the publishing business can create odd couplings as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato announced he will be  
penning an advice column for George magazine, whose editor-in-chief 
is John F. Kennedy Jr., nephew of Democratic stalwart Sen. Ted 
Kennedy of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	And his first piece of advice was to JFK Jr., saying in a news  
conference Tuesday that Kennedy might soon ``be ready to lead the 
city of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's response? ``Really, uh, not today, certainly.''  
</P>
<P>
	The suggestion came as the two men announced that D'Amato will  
be writing a political advice column, ``Ask Alfonse,'' for 
Kennedy's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Amato, who spent 18 years in Washington before he was defeated  
by Democrat Chuck Schumer last year, has not exactly been a friend 
of the Kennedys. 
</P>
<P>
	In his autobiography, ``Power Pasta and Politics,'' D'Amato said  
``Kennedy's dual standards never ceased to amaze me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he treated his future boss much more kindly in suggesting  
Kennedy has what it takes for public office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kennedy is doing it just the right way,'' D'Amato said. ``He's  
got that electricity. He's go that persona. This is a great 
magazine he's put together ... He can do and be whatever he 
chooses, and he will choose in the fullness of time to pursue 
public service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To which Kennedy responded: ``This magazine has always been an  
exploration of political issues. ... It isn't politics but it bumps 
up against politics. This is what it is now, but if it changes into 
something else -- and I'm not being coy here -- but if it changes 
into something else in a number of years, great.''

<HEADLINE> $2B in Farm Disaster Aid Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers counting on $2 billion in  
congressionally approved disaster aid will have to wait until June 
to get it, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent Tuesday night to Senate Agriculture Chairman  
Richard Lugar and House Agriculture Chairman Larry Combest, 
Glickman said administering the aid is ``far more complex than past 
natural disaster assistance programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the agency is inundated with aid disbursements  
during this tumultuous farm year, including assistance packages of 
$50 million for hog farmers and $200 million for dairy farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting these payments out as expeditiously and as fairly as  
possible is a top personal priority for me,'' Glickman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Combest, R-Texas, fired back that the delay was  
``unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are now billions of dollars that should already be in  
the hands of farmers and ranchers,'' Combest said, noting that 
farmers need the money as they go into the planting season. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in Congress have complained that USDA is moving too slow in  
administering aid to farmers. Congress approved the money as part 
of a $6 billion emergency package late last year amid free-falling 
commodity prices. Prices have done little to rebound since then -- 
making some members of Congress angry at the slow dispersal 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Barrett, R-Neb., this month accused the agency of  
``foot-dragging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To see delay after delay stack up while our producers are in  
need of assistance is unacceptable,'' Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said one of the things complicating the disbursement is  
that it covers farmers who have suffered crop losses over several 
years before 1998 or who had losses only in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``USDA must go through one additional step of determining which  
will pay the applicant more before issuing final payments,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol, meanwhile, spent  
Wednesday looking at ways to overhaul a crop insurance program for 
farmers, even while acknowledging an uphill battle for money. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA unveiled details for between $2 billion to $2.5 billion  
worth of reforms, including raising coverage, making higher-level 
coverage more affordable and covering multiyear disasters as well 
as livestock. Several lawmakers have introduced proposals as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our proposal is specific and it is designed to fill the most  
glaring crop insurance voids,'' Glickman said in a statement. ``It 
will make crop insurance more affordable and worth buying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it won't be easy as Congress faces pressure to use budget  
surpluses for Social Security and Medicare. ``I've got to figure 
out what the tide will bear,'' Lugar, R-Ind., said of attempts to 
get money. 
</P>
<P>
	About 79 GOP lawmakers sent a letter to House Budget Committee  
Chairman John Kasich this week urging him to address crop insurance 
in his committee's budget resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Many farmers don't have crop insurance and those who do complain  
that it is too expensive and inadequate. With low prices expected 
to continue much of this year, lawmakers have said it is critical 
to strengthen crop insurance to have an adequate safety net for 
farmers, who lost decades of government subsidies as part of the 
1996 farm law.

<HEADLINE> Saudi: Oil Production Deal Nears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUB AL KHALY, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- The world's oil producers are  
close to an agreement to cut production to shore up prices, a Saudi 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments in advance of an OPEC meeting helped push up oil  
prices today, adding to gains from the previous two days. 
</P>
<P>
	There is an agreement that will be reached between members of  
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC 
members before the Vienna meeting on March 23, the official said on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments came after the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia,  
Kuwait, Oman and Qatar met in the Rub al Khaly desert for the 
official opening of the Shaiba oil field nearly 600 miles southeast 
of the capital Riyadh. 
</P>
<P>
	The official refused to provide details of a proposed production  
agreement. But a statement issued after the ministers' meeting said 
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar will work ``in intensive 
consultation with OPEC members and outside it to take all the 
necessary measures'' to bring about a production cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important measures will be to deal with ``cutting  
production in quantities to be reckoned with, that will ensure the 
withdrawal of excess supply from the market which will lead to a 
rise in prices,'' the statement said. It did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for April  
delivery was up 48 cents at $12.04 a barrel in afternoon trading in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	A glut of oil on world markets, a result of overproduction and  
reduced demand in the wake of financial crises around the globe, 
had depressed petroleum prices on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, average retail gasoline prices last month  
were at an all-time low, when adjusted for inflation. Prices edged 
up less than half a cent in the latest Lundberg Survey last week, 
the first increase since September, to nudge back above $1 a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	But while falling prices have helped consumers, the ministers  
said the large supplies of oil and the drop in crude oil prices to 
20-year lows threaten to curb oil development and investment, 
something that could endanger future supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Low world oil prices have taken an especially heavy toll on the  
Gulf countries that depend heavily on petroleum revenues.

<HEADLINE> Time Reporters Break Award Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time magazine's Donald L. Barlett and James B.  
Steele have won their record fifth George Polk Award, this time for 
a series that showed how taxpayer incentives to companies rarely 
pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	Barlett and Steele were honored this year in the national  
reporting category. They also won a Polk Award in 1971, 1972, 1988 
and 1991 for work with The Philadelphia Inquirer. The award breaks 
a tie with Seymour M. Hersh, the only other four-time winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal's Alix M. Freedman won the Polk Award  
for international reporting for ``Population Bomb,'' an 
investigative report about more than 100,000 women in Third World 
countries who were sterilized with a carcinogenic chemical, often 
without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polk book award went to Philip Gourevitch, for his harrowing  
account of genocide in ``We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We 
Will Be Killed with Our Families: Stories from Rwanda.'' Much of 
the material in the book first appeared in Gourevitch's articles in 
The New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired New York Times columnist Russell Baker, who amused  
readers with his gentle humor for 36 years, won a Polk career 
award, his second Polk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polk Awards were established in 1949 to honor George Polk, a  
CBS reporter killed while covering the Greek civil war. The 13 
awards announced Tuesday will be presented on April 14. Each winner 
receives a plaque. 
</P>
<P>

about the racial divide in the United States.

Sullivan, The Washington Post, for ``Shattered Lives,'' a series 
about the Asian financial crisis.

Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., for a report on the black lung

Globe, for an expose about experiments conducted on patients in

series of stories about federal judges who ruled on cases in which 
they had economic interests.

stories about political contributions that sparked federal 
investigations into the campaigns of two state officials. 
</P>
<P>

Radio's ``Democracy Now,'' for a story about how Chevron's use of

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Stocks Open Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher with the Dow  
Jones Industrial Average up five points in this morning's early 
going. Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 7-to-5 lead 
over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 14 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up nearly two points. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks appear to have a little bit of wiggle room here, but  
market-watchers don't expect to see much of a move higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern is a familiar one -- corporate earnings.  
</P>
<P>
	Yesterday's about-face, which led to small losses on the  
session, came after rumors swirled about weakness in the high-tech 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Asian markets were solidly higher overnight. But  
European markets are narrowly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices are fairly steady.

<HEADLINE> Eastman Resigns From Washington St. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Kevin Eastman resigned as basketball coach  
at Washington State on Wednesday, saying ``common sense and 
reality'' dictated the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Rick Dickson made the announcement a day after  
firing women's basketball coach Harold Rhodes and four days after 
the men's team finished the season in the Pacific-10 Conference 
cellar at 4-14. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotion didn't even play a part in this thing ... common sense  
and reality did,'' Eastman said of his decision. ``And reality is 
recruiting would been very difficult under the circumstances, and 
recruiting is the lifeblood of any program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickson said he hoped to have replacements announced for Eastman  
and Rhodes around the time of the men's NCAA tournament Final Four, 
which begins March 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman said he gave Dickson a list of possible successors and  
acknowledged that Gonzaga coach Dan Monson was on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickson said he hadn't yet contacted any prospective coaches for  
either job but had begun assembling a campus panel to help conduct 
the searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at the NCAA regional tournament in Seattle, Monson said  
he would assess his opportunities after the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any interest in any job right now. I've got a  
great one,'' Monson said. ``I love it at Gonzaga. I haven't thought 
of any other job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman, 43, said he resigned rather than face the ``heavy,  
heavy scrutiny and, maybe, some craziness'' in the final year of a 
five-year contract that was extended for a year after the Cougars' 
1996 NIT appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted to avoid hurting the chances of his returning  
players because of poor recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were getting hit pretty hard this year in recruiting,'' he  
said. ``We were getting hammered big time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman said he called the coaches or parents Tuesday night of  
four prep recruits who committed early to Washington State to tell 
them of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickson said Eastman agreed to step down after a meeting Tuesday  
to evaluate the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``In that process, Kevin and I came to the agreement on exactly  
the status of our program and where we were,'' Dickson said during 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not ask for his resignation,'' Dickson said. ``At his  
estimation, this was the best direction to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman said the team's recent disappointments led to his  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``With some of the knocks we took this year both on the floor  
and in other areas, and what maybe surrounds the program because of 
those knocks, recruiting would have been very difficult,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want our guys to be very successful. I think we are quite  
close to having the type of season we would want to have. ... 
However, we are not there yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to really think about those you're leading,  
and I think you have to make decisions based on what's best for 
them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about a firing have been rampant this season, the  
Cougars' second in a row with a 10-19 record. 
</P>
<P>
	During Eastman's first two years in Pullman, with predecessor  
Kelvin Sampson's recruits, Washington State made it to the NIT in 
1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman, who struggled to keep players and recruits during his  
first four years, said he would encourage his former players to 
remain at Washington State, rather than transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman's record was 69-78 overall and 31-59 in the Pac-10.  
</P>
<P>
	He had a year left on his contract. His salary package pays  
about $225,000 per season. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman did not discuss his future, saying he wanted to do all  
he could to aid the transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``To tell the truth, I'm the least of my worries right now,'' he  
said. The (assistant) coaches and the team have to be my main 
concern now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickson said the annual contracts of Eastman's assistants expire  
June 30.
