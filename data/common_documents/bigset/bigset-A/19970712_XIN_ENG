<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Central Bank Forced to Float Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- After fighting speculators for one
week, the Philippine Central Bank today finally decided to allow
the market to determine the exchange rate between the country's
currency peso and the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Since the depreciation of the Thai baht on July 2, the peso has
been under intense pressure amid rumors that the currency will be
the next to devalue since the two economies have many
similarities.
</P>
<P>
To keep the exchange rate in a narrow range, the Philippine
monetary authorities had been forced to dip into its foreign
reserves and spiral up its overnight borrowing rate.
</P>
<P>
But under snowballing pressure from the speculators, the
Central Bank decided today to stop defending the embattled
currency.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said in a statement that
the bank will allow the exchange rate to "move within a new wider
range consistent with significantly changed market conditions" as
of today.
</P>
<P>
Singson said he expected this can remove the incentive for
speculation against the peso and allow a gradual reduction in
interest rates which is crucial for sustainable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said a more flexible exchange rate will conserve the
country's international reserves and normalize interest rates to
levels compatible with the needs of the fast growing economy.
</P>
<P>
But Singson also said the bank will again intervene in the
foreign currency market if necessary, adding that he expected the
volatile market will calm down some time after the float of the
peso.
</P>
<P>
The move to float the peso was backed by President Fidel Ramos,
who said this is necessary to sustain economic growth, control
inflation and protect the country's international reserves.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also reiterated that the country's economy will not
follow the lead of Thailand since it has sound fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the peso was also widely welcomed by
economists, businessmen and stock traders.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said the devaluation of the peso was expected
since the currency is overvalued and the cost for the Central Bank
to continue to buy the peso is too high.
</P>
<P>
They said the country's export sector has been less competitive
than some of its trading partners because the peso overvalues the
currencies in these countries.
</P>
<P>
A weakened peso will boost the country's exports, curb imports
and thus reduce its swelling trade deficit, they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economists said a continued high interest rate
will affect corporations' economic activities, hurt the stock
market and slow down the economy.
</P>
<P>
Because of a high interest rate, investors had flocked to fixed
income equities like treasury bills which are offering higher
yields than the stock market. As a result, the local stock market
had tumbled 11 percent since July 2.
</P>
<P>
But the local bourse today reacted actively to the floatation
of the peso, with its composite index (Phisix) soaring 189.99
points, the biggest single-day gain in five and a half years, to
close at 2,701.14.
</P>
<P>
Some other analysts, however, expressed concern that the float
of the peso will adversely affect those companies which depend on
imported raw materials.
</P>
<P>
At the close of today's currency market, the peso-dollar rate
rose to 26.45 from 26.40. Most analysts estimated the peso will
finally settle down at 27.50 to one dollar by the year end.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Report Terms NAFTA Impact Modest Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The formation of the
three-nation North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has had
a modestly positive impact on American jobs and incomes, the
Clinton administration said today.
</P>
<P>
In its first formal assessment report, the administration
contended the NAFTA has been a positive contributor to this
country's economic growth in spite of the fact that U.S. trade
deficits with Mexico and Canada have grown fourfold during that
time, a fact it blamed on economic forces not related to NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
"This report provides solid evidence that NAFTA has already
proved its worth to the United States during the three years it
has been in effect," President Clinton said in a letter
transmitting the document to Congress. "NAFTA is an integral part
of a broader growth strategy that has produced the strongest U.S.
economy in a generation."
</P>
<P>
But NAFTA opponents, including such traditional Democratic
constituencies as organized labor and environmentalists, were not
impressed with the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
America's trade balance with Mexico has gone from a surplus of
1.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, the year before NAFTA went into
effect, to a record deficit of 16.2 billion dollars last year. The
imbalance with Canada went from 10.8 billion dollars in 1993 to
22.8 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The official report attributed the big deficits to unrelated
factors such as the 1994 peso crisis in Mexico that triggered a
severe recession in that country and argued that without NAFTA the
deficit situation would have been worse.
</P>
<P>
The report also cited studies that it said showed the overall
impact of NAFTA has been positive on a U.S. economy that is
enjoying its lowest unemployment rates in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
"Several studies conclude that NAFTA contributed to America's
economic expansion," the report said. "NAFTA had a modest positive
effect on U.S. net exports, income, investment and jobs supported
by exports."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Turkey to Improve Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 11 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi newspaper today called
upon the new Turkish government to take measures to improve its
relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in an article by Al-Thawra, mouthpiece of
the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party, to the new Turkish
government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who came to power after
last month's resignation of his Islamist predecessor Necmettin
Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
The article urged the new Turkish government to adopt policies
which respect Iraq's sovereignty and security.
</P>
<P>
The paper asserted that the trade relations between Iraq and
Turkey can not be developed at a time when the Turkish
territories are still used as a "spring board" for the U.S. and
British planes, and when the Turkish military incursion into
northern Iraq has not ended.
</P>
<P>
On June 27, the Turkish parliament renewed for another six
months the mandate of the U.S. and British forces based in
southern Turkey and entrusted them with protecting the Kurds in
northern Iraq from attacks by Iraqi government troops. The move
was strongly criticized by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Ankara sent about 30,000 troops into northern Iraq in mid-May
to wipe out rebels of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), who use
the region as a base to launch attacks against Turkish civilian
and military targets in an attempt to establish an independent
Kurdish state.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the two events, the newspaper said that Iraq
absolutely rejects the fact that its security and sovereignty fell
prey to Turkey's special relations with the West, in particular
the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Iraq won't tolerate that its territories are used as a yard for
solving Turkish security problems, added the paper.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra affirmed that Iraq has actually taken practical
measures to benefit the Turkish economy, but Ankara did not
reciprocate in view of the Iraqi policy.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has begun selling Turkey 3.6 million tonnes of oil under
an agreement signed last December.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two countries also signed an initial agreement
in mid-May to build a 1,300-kilometer pipeline to supply Turkey
with Iraqi gas.

TOKYO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan has decided to dispatch three
military planes to Thailand in preparation for evacuating Japanese
nationals trapped in Cambodia after the recent fightings.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto ordered the Air Self-Defense

<HEADLINE> HK's Prosperity, Stability Based on Four Points: Zhou Nan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Director of the Xinhua News
Agency Hong Kong Branch Zhou Nan has clarified four tasks to be
fulfilled to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
They are fully implementing the "one country, two systems"
principle, cooperating more closely between Hong Kong and the
inland areas, gaining support from Hong Kong compatriots and being
free from foreign interference, he said in an article to be
carried by the July-August edition of the Hong Kong-based Bauhinia
Monthly.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to China, principles and policies such
as "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and a high degree of autonomy are implemented, the Chinese
official said.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to keep the previous social and economic systems and
way of life intact, keep the laws previously in force basically
unchanged and maintain Hong Kong's status as an international
financial, trade and shipping center and a free port, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
These principles and policies fully accord with the interests
of the Chinese people including Hong Kong compatriots and have won
the wholehearted support of Hong Kong people from all walks of
life, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The principles and policies, guaranteed by the Chinese
Constitution and the Basic Law, have become China's long-term
state policy and will never be changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we have a comprehensive and accurate understanding
of these principles and policies and consistently and fully
implement them," he said, "Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and
stability are guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
On cooperation with the inland areas, Zhou said, China's reform
and opening-up policy and modernization drive have played a
decisive role in the prosperity Hong Kong enjoys currently.
</P>
<P>
In the future, political stability and a sustained, healthy and
rapid economic growth in the inland areas will also be a powerful
guarantee for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he noted, further strengthening mutual cooperation
between Hong Kong and the inland areas will promote the common
development of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Support from Hong Kong compatriots is indispensable to
maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the transition period, many Hong Kong residents who love
Hong Kong and the motherland actively participated in a variety
of social affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the final lap of the period in particular, they were
actively involved in making preparations for the establishment of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, creating conditions
for "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, if the principle of "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" continues to be carried out, the
implementation of "one country, two systems" will be guaranteed
and Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability will be
ensured.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Zhou stressed the importance of preventing foreign
intervention and maintaining Hong Kong's status as an
international economic center.
</P>
<P>
He quoted President Jiang Zemin as saying recently: "If there
is no foreign intervention, we firmly believe that 'one country,
two systems,' 'Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong' and a high
degree of autonomy will proceed smoothly."
</P>
<P>
It is obvious to everyone that if external forces meddle in
Hong Kong affairs under this or that pretext, if their
intervention turns Hong Kong from an international economic center
to a center of political fighting, Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability are bound to suffer.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Trade Policy Remains Unchanged: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue the free
 trade policy and its established trade policy remains unchanged,
a local trade official announced today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar organized by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council, Assistant Director-General of Trade of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government Patrick
 Nip stressed that the implementation of "one country, two
systems" policy in HKSAR means the continuation of Hong Kong's
established trade policy.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of the free trade policy and other important
ingredients for Hong Kong were enshrined in the Sino-British Joint
 Declaration and the Basic Law, Nip explained.
</P>
<P>
In line with the autonomous trading status Hong Kong will
continue to enjoy, there will be no merging of Hong Kong and
inland areas of China's textiles quotas, no change in the "Made in
 Hong Kong" label, and no merging of Hong Kong and inland areas of
 China's trade statistics, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stated, "Hong Kong will continue to be a full and
separate member of the WTO (World Trade Organization), using the
name 'Hong Kong, China,' and we will continue to implement
faithfully our obligations under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and
 Clothing."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "we take our multilateral and bilateral obligations
very seriously; We remain fully committed to maintaining the
utmost vigilance over any attempt to abuse the origin rules," Nip
stressed.

Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the delegation
was headed by Lebanese Minister of Economy and Trade Yassin Jaber
and Minister of State for Financial Affairs Fuad Sinyoura.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Offer Services for Peace in Cambodia: Malaysian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian nations will
not act as "international police" to dictate on Cambodia,
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
will offer its services for resolving Cambodia's problems through
talks, said Abdullah, who is ASEAN Standing Committee Chairman.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah made the remarks in Malaysia's northwest state of
Pulau Pinang after attending an investiture on the occasion of
State Sultan Hamdan Sheikh Tahir's 76th birthday anniversary there.
</P>
<P>
As quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernathe, he
said the ASEAN Foreign Ministers Special Meeting here on July 10
decided to send a delegation to work on the Cambodian issue.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian, Philippine and Thai foreign ministers therefore
plan to meet Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk, First Prime
Minister Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah hoped the ASEAN move could play a role in helping
bring about peace and stability in the strife-torn Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"We will not put forward any proposal to the (Cambodian)
leaders because it may be misconstrued as interfering in
Cambodia's internal affairs," Abdullah said.

<HEADLINE> Leading Oil Companies in Biding for Bangladesh's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 international oil companies,
staking claims to Bangladesh's hydrocarbon-rich geological
structures, are expected to participate in next week's bidding for
15 open oil and gas exploration blocks, said informed sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources in the Energy Ministry, an evaluation
committee, comprising officials and international consultants of
the government, is expected to examine the offers from the
international companies participating in the bidding which will
close on July 15.
</P>
<P>
It will take a few weeks to evaluate the offers and the awards
are expected to be finalized by mid-November, the sources
indicated. The new production sharing contracts (PSC) are expected
to be signed by December 16, coinciding with the country's
independence day.
</P>
<P>
In recent times, world oil majors have turned their sights on
Bangladesh after some companies struck major reserves of natural
gas in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government called the second round of bidding
on March last year for the country's remaining 15 out of a total
23 exploration blocks, inviting foreign oil companies to come with
offers for the PSC.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that such oil giants like Exxon, Total, Shell,
Cairn, Mobil, Amaco, Marathon, British Petroleum, Union Texas and
Murphy had already shown keen interest in Bangladesh's exploration
blocks.
</P>
<P>
Under the first round of bidding held in the early 1990s, six
foreign companies were awarded the PSCs for eight exploration
blocks.

<HEADLINE> New Magazine Carries Taiwan Affairs Officials' Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The first issue of the magazine
"Cross-Straits Relations" carries comments by leading Chinese
officials in charge of Taiwan affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
State Council, points out that the relations between Hong Kong and
Taiwan have become a special component of the relations between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits following the return of Hong
Kong to the motherland July 1.
</P>
<P>
The proper handling of Hong Kong-Taiwan relations will be
conducive not only to the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong
and giving full play to the exemplary role of the "one country,
two systems" policy but also to the further development of the
relations across the Taiwan Straits and the final reunification of
the motherland, Chen says.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Council's policies, Chen continues, the
central government will itself handle or authorize the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to handle issues concerning
 national sovereignty and relations across the Taiwan Straits
which concern the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, deputy executive chairman of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, pointed out recently that
political discussions between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits
should be held as soon as possible based on the principle of one
China, especially when it comes to talks about officially putting
an end to hostilities or other political topics of mutual concern
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Only such talks, Tang said, can remove the political obstacles
in the way of the development of relations across the Taiwan
Straits and lay a solid foundation for favorable interaction and
the steady development of relations across the Straits.

ALGIERS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
Mediterranean Forum today called for partnership between Europe
and south Mediterranean countries, and strengthened security and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came as the 11 ministers of the member countries
were winding up the forum's fifth conference here today. The
participants reviewed the Middle East peace process, regional
security and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They also probed the possibility of including into fold
countries such as Libya, Cyprus, Israel, Bosnia and Albania,
sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The forum, set up in July 1994 to develop cooperation and
partnership among nations in both sides of the Mediterranean,
consists of Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Portugal, Spain, France,
Italy, Malta, Greece, Turkey and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting also focused on a number of political,

<HEADLINE> India to Decide whether to Import Wheat from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- India is yet to decide whether
to go ahead with its planned import of one million tons of wheat
from Australia after an earlier consignment from that country was
found to contain a variety of weed seeds, Press Trust of India
(PTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
"The first shipment (of the contract) should have gone in
June-July, but it is now awaiting Indian government's decision
whether to go ahead with the contract or not," Arvind Pol, branch
manager of state trading corporation of India, told PTI.
</P>
<P>
An Indian technical team, which visited Australia last month
following complains that the wheat sold to India previously
contained weed seeds capable of introducing new types of weeds
into Indian agricultural land, has yet to give its assessment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from Melbourne, Australia, Pol said the fate of the
contract now rested on the team's report.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta to Screen for Anti-Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierre
Leone said today that it will "increase its screening operation"
of all people wanting to return to the west African state "so
that only genuine people would be allowed to enter."
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the U.N. Security Council decision on the
present political stalemate in Sierra Leone, a spokesman said,
"We are not depriving those who have genuine business in Sierra
Leone."
</P>
<P>
"We only want to ensure that anti-government elements would
not slip in to cause chaos," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. decision, said the spokesman, shows that "there is
still room for discussions and we are still open for dialogue as
our main aim is to sustain the peace we have already achieved."
</P>
<P>
Officials of international relief agencies said, about 2,000
people, many of them Sierra Leoneans who fled after the June 2
naval bombardment by Nigerian warships#,are already massing
around the border with Guinea, trying to return.
</P>
<P>
On Friday four buses of the state-owned Road Transport
Corporation brought in about 250 Sierra Leoneans stranded in
Guinea free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Many residents in the capital were beaming with smiles today
over the U.N. decision.
</P>
<P>
"We can sort out our problems ourselves," said a 45-year-old
dentist, adding, "there is indeed no need for any harsh action to
be taken.''
</P>
<P>
A trader in the capital, who lost her son in the June 2
bombardment, said, "Nigeria should get off our backs. Why are
they so keen to adopt a military intervention in Sierra Leone? "
</P>
<P>
"Even Cambodia which has been plagued by persistent wars have
rejected military intervention in their own country," she noted.
</P>
<P>
A university professor of international law criticized what he
called "the persistent Nigerian action", saying, "there is a
growing mood for Sierra Leone to get out of ECOWAS because of
Nigeria's hostile stand."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian troops lead in the West African Peace-keeping force
sent by the West African States of Economic Community (ECOWAS).

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Speech on Deng Xiaoping's Theory Highly Appraised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The 14th issue of the magazine
"Seeking Truth" carries a commentary on the speech Jiang Zemin
made on May 29 at the Party School of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, and calls for earnest study of it.
</P>
<P>
The speech, made at the commencement ceremony of a training
class for provincial-level cadres, is a thorough, profound and
scientific exposition of the basic issues concerning the future of
socialism in China, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It fully demonstrates the resoluteness and faith of the third
generation of the collective leadership of the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core to carry into the 21st
century the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, which
was pioneered by Deng Xiaoping, it says.
</P>
<P>
The speech is of great realistic and historic significance, and
will have a far-reaching bearing on and play a great role in
guiding the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics
both at present and in the long run, it notes.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics must be used to guide all our work in the new era
of socialist reform and opening-up, and the modernization drive,"
Jiang stressed in the speech. "It is a theory the Party has
devised after summing up the lessons of history and reality."
</P>
<P>
The commentary calls on the whole Party, in particular Party
leaders at all levels, to follow Jiang's instructions, hold high
the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory, unite around the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, and work relentlessly to
build China into a powerful, democratic and modernized socialist
country.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Turkish Coalition Government Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's newly formed
pro-secularism coalition government won a vote of confidence in
the parliament here today, thus ending the months-old political
crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government, formed by the center-right Motherland Party
(ANAP), Democratic Left Party (DSP) and Democratic Turkey Party
(DTP), obtained 281 votes in the 550-seat parliament, which is a
clear victory for Mesut Yilmaz, the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, chairman of the Motherland Party, was assigned by
President Suleyman Demirel to form a coalition on June 20, two
days after the pro-Islamic Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan
resigned under pressure from the military.
</P>
<P>
In today's vote, 256 deputies from the Erbakan's Welfare Party
(RP), conservative True Path Party (DYP) and the Grand Unity Party
(BBP) voted against the government. However, two deputies in this
bloc abstained as a sign of support to the new government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, nine DYP deputies did not attend the the balloting
to express their opposition to DYP leader Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Ciller and Erbakan were about swap premiership when President
Demirel named Yilmaz as prime minister in a drastic move to
prevent the country from inching toward Islamism. They accused the
president of helping Yilmaz to take power.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz promised anti-Islamist measures, including an extension
of secularist education, when he read out his government program
in parliament Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government has said that it will hold early elections next
year, well before polls are due in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Coal-Electricity Complex To Be Operational (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JUNGAR, INNER MONGOLIA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A giant coal
producer is ready to go into operation in October in north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of an electrified railway line early this
month, the first phase of the Jungar Coal Mine, near this small
town in central Inner Mongolia, is ready to produce 12 million
tons of low-sulphur coal each year.
</P>
<P>
A coal-washing plant that can dress and wash 12 million tons of
coal annually will become operational simultaneously with the
open-cut coal mine.
</P>
<P>
A thermal power station with an installed capacity of 200,000
kw has already been put into use.
</P>
<P>
This is China's largest coal-electricity complex. It is
composed of 30 major facilities for coal production, dressing,
transportation and power generating, according to Song Hanfeng,
general manager of the Jungar Coal Industry Corp.
</P>
<P>
He said the project is one result of the country's endeavors to
tap the abundant coal resources in its central and western areas,
in a bid to meet the country's sharply-increased demand for energy.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rapid development of its oil industry and
hydropower stations, coal still dominates China's energy-supply
structure. Experts predict that coal will account for 90 percent
of the nation's energy consumption by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The country has decided to raise its annual coal output to 1.45
billion tons by the end of this century -- from 1.38 billion tons
last year.
</P>
<P>
The central and western areas of the country, which boast rich
coal resources, are expected to play a key role in the future of
China's coal industry.
</P>
<P>
Covering 1,365 sq km, the Jungar Coal Mine is estimated to have
some 26 billion tons of coal reserves.
</P>
<P>
Lu Lian, chief engineer of the Jungar Coal Industry Corp., said
the mine can provide coal for the next 115 years if it produces 60
million tons of coal each year, a target the company plans to
reach by the year 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the Jungar mine was made a key project of the coal
industry ten years ago, construction of the first phase has been
completed, at a cost of more than ten billion yuan (about 1.2
billion US dollars) in government investment and overseas loans.
</P>
<P>
"It is the most expensive project in the history of China's
coal industry," said Zhang Shengli, an official in charge of
capital construction at the Ministry of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
The 264-km electric railway line linking Jungar with Datong
City in north Shanxi Province can carry coal from Jungar to
Qinhuangdao Port, China's largest coal terminal, via the
Datong-Qinhuangdao Railway.
</P>
<P>
"The simultaneous development of the coal mine, thermal power
station and railway at Jungar has set up a new model for China's
large coal mines," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The coal-electricity-railway complex can make optimum use of
resources and greatly reduce the waste of coal, since good-quality
coal can find markets while low-grade coal is burned to generate
electricity.
</P>
<P>
In addition, transmitting electricity generated by coal at
Jungar to industrial bases and big cities that are thirsty for
energy is not only more profitable, but also beneficial for the
environment, Song said.
</P>
<P>
The company is planning to expand its installed capacity to
800,000 kw in future, and the construction of new coal mines and
thermal power stations will be conducted at the same time, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The coal-electricity model points the way for the future
development of China's big coal mines," Zhang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) the total
installed capacity of thermal power stations at China's coal mines
will increase to 2.1 million kw, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pak-UN Efforts for Peace in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the United Nations
have intensified their diplomatic efforts to bring the warring
Afghan factions to the negotiating table in a new bid to restore
peace in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Iftikhar Murshed, Pakistan's Additional Foreign Secretary, left
for Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 km northwest of Kabul, to discuss
with northern anti-Taliban alliance the proposal of setting up a
political commission.
</P>
<P>
The visit is the follow-up of Pakistan's latest shuttle
diplomacy to try to help evolve a fresh political settlement to
the intricate Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
The senior Pakistani diplomat has already secured the agreement
of the Islamic militia Taliban to discuss the establishment of the
commission during his visit last Tuesday to Kandahar, Taliban's
southern headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"I would inform the northern alliance that the Taliban have
responded positively to consider their proposal of setting up a
political commission," Murshed said before leaving here today to
Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who control two-thirds of the Afghan territory,
have reportedly agreed on the formation of the commission which
will declare ceasefire, ponder into the issue of exchange of
prisoners and to decide the future government of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
But the Islamic militia rejected the proposal of
demilitarization of Kabul and suggested the political commission
should meet in Islamabad while reiterating their demand for the
release of their high-ranking officials being held prisoner in
northern Afghanistan before negotiating an end to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The idea of forming a political commission to discuss the
formation of future Afghan government was put forward recently by
the leadership of the anti-Taliban alliance led by Uzbek warlord
Abdul Malik and former Afghan military chief Ahmad Masood.
</P>
<P>
The Mazar-e-Sharif based alliance proposed that the political
commission should meet in Kabul for which the capital should be
demilitarized. However, they have reservation about the exchange
of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Murshed's on-going visit in Mazar-e-Sharif took place after UN
Special Envoy Nobert Holl's tour to the Afghan northern major city
during which he held extensive talks with the northern alliance
leaders on prospects of peace in the embattled country.
</P>
<P>
Although Holl was not available for his post-visit comments, he
is believed to have suggested an early agreement to a ceasefire.
The ceasefire, as Holl put it, is "the first step" to establish a
broad-based government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure from Mazar-e-Sharif, the UN envoy
announced Thursday that he "will travel to Kandahar and also talk
to the Taliban".
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that "everybody agrees that new efforts have
to be undertaken to stop bloodshed and to bring the two sides
together under the auspices of the United Nations".
</P>
<P>
Since the middle of May, the situation in northern Afghanistan
has returned to an old seesaw pattern of military engagement
between Taliban and its northern rivals.
</P>
<P>
In the last few weeks, fighting in Afghanistan has been raging
on several fronts, north of Kabul, in northern Faryeb province and
in the northern province of Kunduz. However, neither Taliban nor
the northern opposition forces have made major territorial gains.
</P>
<P>
Though the impact of the Pak-UN peace efforts in Afghanistan is
still waiting to be seen, it is safe to say these efforts will
help create an healthy atmosphere conducive to a solution to the
protracted Afghan conflict.

<HEADLINE> Two Arrested For Killing Sri Lankan Tamil MP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Police today arrested
two persons suspected of having assassinated Tamil Parliamentarian
A. Thangathurai and five others at Trincomalee last Saturday,
according to official radio here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Neechandran alias Nijan, one of the two suspects had been
employed as a security officer of the Trincomalee Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
Another man who is identified as Sivaprakashan Akila Rupan is
believed to be a member of the Tamil rebels who had reportedly
followed Thangathurai for several months. He had tried to
assassinate the MP in Trincomalee several months ago but called
off the attempt when the police arrived, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the police authorities have arrested nine suspects in
connection with last Saturday's assassination.
</P>
<P>
Five other suspects of Tamil rebels were arrested by police on
July 8 in Trincomalee Town, about 250 kilometers from Colombo.

<HEADLINE> 14 Iraqi refugees Died in Boat Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 14 Iraqi refugees were killed
Wednesday when a boat carrying them capsized in the Aegean off
Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the Turkish Navy has located 14 bodies of
the Iraqi refugees from fatal boat journey that set out for Greece
from Karaburun near Cesme in the Aegean of Turkey Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 40 refugees, who fled their homes in northern Iraq,
on the fatal boat, only six have been rescued and the other 20
people including women and children are still missing in the
Aegean, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The small boat, which was packed beyond capacity, capsized and
sank soon after it set out.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted one of the survivors Samman Rauf as saying
that the boat had been organized by a man named Sih Taha in
Istanbul and they had paid 1,000 U.S. dollars each for the journey.
</P>
<P>
The rescued and taken to local hospitals Thursday were
discharged from the hospital Friday and handed over to the
Gendarmerie.
</P>
<P>
Because of chaos caused by war between government troops and
Kurdish rebels and between the rebel factions in northern Iraq,
many Iraqis have been fleeing out of the country onto Turkey and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1990, 20 Iraqi refugees lost their lives when
the boat carrying them sank near the Kusadasi coast, western
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Six people were killed in the boat accident in the same region
on September 8, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three northern Iraqis died in two boat accidents near
Cesme in the Aegean respectively on September 14 and October 30,
1992.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-six people were killed in five sea accidents when
they tried to go to Greece for immigration from 1994 to the
first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai-Hong Kong Service Sector Cooperation Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- As Shanghai becomes a major
destination for investment from Hong Kong, its service sector now
accounts for an increasingly large part of the economic
cooperation between the two places.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that a total of 356 Hong Kong firms in
the service trade sectors have invested 5.04 billion US dollars in
Shanghai's Pudong New Area, an emerging trade and financial
district separated from the city proper by the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
These firms account for 40 percent of all Hong Kong firms with
investment in Pudong, with their combined investment making up 31
percent of the total volume from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
An analysis shows that the service sector accounts for 75.4
percent of all contracted Hong Kong investment in Shanghai, which
covers commerce, real estate, public facilities, transportation,
consultancy, catering, science and technology, public health,
culture, sports and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to cooperation between Shanghai and Hong Kong in the
service sector, Shanghai's service trade has grown considerably in
recent years, with its output value proportion to the gross
domestic product hitting 42 percent last year; it is expected to
top 60 percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong trade official said earlier that the all-round
development of Pudong will boost Shanghai's efforts to become an
international financial, commercial and trade center, and will
create more opportunities for Shanghai-Hong Kong cooperation in
the service sector.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls for Steps to Minimize Impact of El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today urged government departments to minimize the impact on the
Philippines of a new El Nino phenomenon through efficient water
management and conservation, watershed protection and water
recycling.
</P>
<P>
As the nation braced itself for another warm episode that
weathermen say could be more devastating than the dry spell in
1982-83, Ramos also called on the private sector and the public to
heed the warnings of the authorities on the new El Nino episode.
</P>
<P>
In a handwritten memorandum released by the presidential
office, Ramos stressed the importance of water conservation in the
face of the expected reduction of rainfall in the Philippines this
year and next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and
Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), El Nino has started
to cast prolonged drought in central and eastern tropical Pacific
countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, Australia
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"These warnings need to be heeded by all national departments,
agencies, by the concerned private sector and the
public-at-large," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, which is hit by an average of 19 typhoons per
year, will experience rainfall below normal levels by at least 40
percent, according to PAGASA.

<HEADLINE> Three Died in Northeastern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Three men died of suffocation
and 11 others are in serious condition in the northeastern
Somali town of Bossasso Friday.
</P>
<P>
A field VHF radio reported today that the men were among a
number of suspected bandits rounded up by the local authority
security forces early in the week.
</P>
<P>
They were locked up in an air-tight room where three died from
lack of oxygen. The 11 others who were on the verge of death were
rushed to a hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the temperature in the town has
exceeded 48 degrees centigrade during their confinement in the
room.
</P>
<P>
Security forces of the town controlled by the Somali Salvation
Democratic Front (SSDF) faction of Majerten clan have launched an
operation in which they rounded up more than 65 suspected
bandits, who were reportedly engaged in banditry activities in
and outside Bossaso for the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The deaths inside the room have terrified people in Bossaso
and raised questions about who will be held responsible for them.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of central authority in Somalia for the past
six years, the northeastern region has been enjoying relative
peace and stability under clan-based local authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two people were killed and seven others wounded
Friday afternoon when opposing militiamen exchanged gunfire in
Afgoe District, 30 km south of the Somalian capital of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the shoot-out was triggered by a
quarrel between gunmen supporting Hussein Mohamed Aidid over tax
collection in the town.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has forced traffic between Afgoe and Mogadishu to
halt temporarily, said a witness.
</P>
<P>
Security officials of the town have made several arrests
including seven militiamen believed to have masterminded the
armed confrontation, before normal order restored today.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Leaves for Hamburg Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina is scheduled to leave here midnight today for Hamburg,
Germany, to attend an international conference on adult education,
reported official news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS).
</P>
<P>
Hasina will deliver the key-note address at the United Nation's
conference on "adult learning", beginning from July 14 on the
German city.
</P>
<P>
Besides delivering the key-note speech, the Prime Minister will
 also call on German President Roman Herzog. She will also seize
the opportunity to explain investment scope in Bangladesh to some
representatives of German industrialists and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
After ending her visit to Germany, Sheikh Hasina will be going
on a private tour to the United States from July 16 to spend about
two weeks with her daughter who is living in Florida.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the Prime Minister, Hasina
applied for an official leave of 15 days to President Shahabuddin
Ahmed. But, as there is no precedence of taking official leave by
a Prime Minister, the President just gave an unofficial consent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Awami (people's) League on Friday
appointed Abdul Mannan as acting president of the party in the
absence of party President Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said that Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad
would officiate Hasina in the cabinet in her absence. As there is
no official provision regarding this kind of leave, an executive
order will be issued to grant Hasina's leave.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic sources here said that the Prime Minister
is likely to put off her visit as her country is facing a severe
flood, which has killed at least 32 persons and marooned millions
of people around the country.

</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry director-general Ilan Biran was quoted as

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Participate in Palestinian Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is to send an 80-member
delegation to a Palestinian expatriate business conference to be
held in Gaza and Bethlehem on July 21-24, Jordan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian delegation will group leaeding businessmen and
economists. The meeting will be organized by the Palestinian
Ministry of planning and international Cooperation, the
semi-official Jordan Times quoted Haidar Murad, Chairman of the
Federation of Jordanian Chambers of Commerce as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian delegates will be selected from the chambers of
commerce, trade unions, other organizations and the private
sector, Murad said.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which will be held under the patronage of
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, offers a great opportunity to
the Jordanian business community as well as representatives of the
private sector to promote cooperation with the Palestinians in
trade, economy and joint ventures, according to Murad.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Jordanian government has been eager to further
promote its ties with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA),
Palestinian institutions and people.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is ready to cooperate with the Palestinians and offer
them aid in constructing a strong economic infrastructure to
benefit the Palestinians as well as the Jordanians, he said.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Palestinian and Jordanian businessmen
announced a 100-million-U.S. dollar fund to be invested in Arab
East Jerusalem in a bid to counter Israeli settlement plans in the
occupied territories and help the Palestinians shake off poverty
and unemployment resulted from Israeli closure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Demonstrators pelted stones on
police and trains as sporadic violence marred a strike in India's
Bombay (Mumbai) which brought normal life in the suburbs of the
metropolis to a complete halt, Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Bombay, capital of Maharashtra, the strike also
gripped almost all major cities and towns in the southwest Indian
state.
</P>
<P>
The strike was organized by the Republican party of India in
protest against the killing of 10 people in police firing
yesterday in northeast Bombay.
</P>
<P>
The people were gunned down when they were protesting against
the desecration of the statue of B.R. Ambedkar, author of the
Indian constitution who was hailed as a heroic figure by the
minority community in the city.
</P>
<P>
All opposition parties in the state are supporting the strike.
</P>
<P>
Business and movement of vehicular traffic and trains came to a
standstill in the suburbs of Bombay during the strike, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
However, life in downtown Bombay city remained largely
unaffected with almost all businesses and markets open although
vehicles were much less than usual, PTI added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan Places Population Control on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government, while
giving top priority to economic revival, has vowed to curtail the
country's fast growing population, which is becoming increasingly
an impediment to economic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
"During the next five years, we hope to bring down the
population growth rate from 2.7 percent to below 1 percent," Syeda
Abida Hussain, minister for population welfare, declared at the
National Population Convention held on Friday on the occasion of
the World Population Day.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government, which has vowed to
make Pakistan an "Asian Tiger", is formulating feasible strategies
to ensure effective implementation of policies on population
control.
</P>
<P>
Fast population growth, which is nullifying Pakistan's economic
and social gains, has became the most crucial factor retarding the
country's development.
</P>
<P>
Unless Pakistan applies firm brakes on its run-away population,
its efforts for development and progress will largely go
unrewarded, population experts here warned.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a galloping annual growth rate of about 3
percent, Pakistan, with a population of around 130 million, has
now moved up to the world's seventh most populous nation from the
ninth position it occupied two years ago.
</P>
<P>
If the present speed of population growth continues, Pakistan
could overtake the United States and Indonesia by the middle of
the next century to become the third largest country in the world
in terms of population after China and India.
</P>
<P>
Facing an estimated 3 million annual increase in population,
the government finds it difficult to provide adequate food, water,
jobs, education and medicines from its limited resources, since
every effort to develop additional resources to improve the lot of
the people is being outstripped by faster growing population, the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's present gloomy state of the economy, the worrying
law and order situation, corruption, illiteracy, poverty and
scarcity of essential food items are directly attributable to
excessive population growth, they said.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of Pakistan's high population growth is widely
believed to be the high fertility rate which goes along with
poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to the Economic Survey of the 1995-1996 fiscal year,
Pakistan's total fertility rate -- the average number of children
a woman can expect to have -- is 5.9 and infant mortality is 95
per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's galloping population growth is closely linked with
the relatively low contraceptive prevalence rate, which shows that
family planning and reproductive health services are still not
available to, or used by, the majority of people who need or want
them.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the United Nations Fund for
Population Activities showed that contraceptive use in Pakistan
rose from 11.8 percent in 1990-1991 to 17.8 percent in 1994-1995.
But it is still the lowest in South Asia and much remains to be
done to raise the level to where it can make a significant impact
on the population growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Most population experts suggest that the first and foremost
step towards solving the problem is to create awareness among
people, especially in rural areas, about the snowballing crisis
and explain to them the advantages of family planning.
</P>
<P>
Another factor for the rapid population increase is Pakistani
women's low education level. Female literacy in Pakistan stands
at an alarming 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Persistent efforts are needed to improve literacy and increase
employment opportunities for women so as to raise their social
status and control the fertility rate, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Defends Killing of Civilian in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel today argued that the
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers had killed a 17-year-old
Lebanese civilian "accidentally" in south Lebanon, according to a
report of the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Military sources were quoted as saying that the boy was
spotted by an IDF unit late Friday night in what they called a
suspicious area where there were only terrorists.
</P>
<P>
An IDF tank fired a round of shells on the boy and killed him
instantly.
</P>
<P>
An initial investigation, carried out by the IDF unit
commander, showed that the soldiers followed operation procedures
and did not veer from their orders, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that the killing of the civilian was unintentional
and expressed regret over the incident.
</P>
<P>
However, a U.N. peace-keeping officer said that the boy had
been cutting grass to feed his cows near his home village inside
the Israel-occupied "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops have been widely described as trigger-happy in
dealing with Arabs. During the Operation of Grapes of Wrath in
April last year, more than 100 Lebanese civilians who took refuge
in a U.N. office in south Lebanon were killed by Israeli
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Israel tried hard to defend the atrocity, saying that
it was not intentional.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 ostensibly to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The civil servants in Kaduna State,
northern Nigeria, have called off their near one-month strike to
embark on new negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a new conference in Kaduna, chairman of the
negotiation council Abdulkarim Ibrahim said the suspension of
strike on Friday was to enable effective dialogue and on the
conditions that all charges and legal action against labor
leaders and union members be withdrawn and dropped.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if an amicable settlement was not reached
within two weeks, the strike will resume.
</P>
<P>
The 34,000 civil servants in the Kaduna State went on strike
on June 16, demanding the payment of increased salaries and
allowances promised by the government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
State Administrator Lieutenant Colonel Hameed Ali has ordered
the dismissal of all striking workers three days ago but dropped
the order following intervention from traditional rulers and
religious leaders.

<HEADLINE> US, ECOMOG Want Success in Liberian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- As some Liberian political parties
called for another postponement of the July 19 polls due to lack
of fund, the United States said it would offer 7.4 million U.S.
Dollars for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The money was sent through non-governmental organizations in
Liberia to promote free and fair elections, State Department
Spokesman Nicolas Burns announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has trained 500 Liberian police officers
to reinforce security during the elections in addition to the
supply of medical and administrative support to ensure a
hitch-free election, he said, quoted by a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the U.S. has been working with Liberia's
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) to ensure the conduct of credible
elections.
</P>
<P>
"We do feel an obligation to do what we can to help the people
of Liberia," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Liberia, Africa's first independent republic founded in 1847
by African returnees from America, has long been in close
relation with the United States.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as
ECOMOG, has allayed fears of the safety of voting materials in
the July 19 general elections.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, sent by ECOWAS for peace-keeping operations in Liberia
in 1990, is mandated by the sub-regional organization to be
responsible for security and relative jobs to ensure successful
conduct of free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
According to ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu,
the voting materials printed in Cote d'Ivoire under strict
security have been escorted back to Monrovia, capital of Liberia,
by a contingent of ECOMOG force.
</P>
<P>
Malu's words came against the backdrop of allegations by some
of the political parties that the electoral process is fraught
with some irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Twelve political parties called last week for the postponement
of the elections, alleging irregularities in the registration
exercise. They also said the rains might disrupt the successful
conduct of the the elections.
</P>
<P>
But IEC Chairman Henry Andrews dismissed the call, saying the
elections would go ahead despite widespread misgivings about its
success.
</P>
<P>
He said only ECOWAS leaders, who have put off the polls from
May 30 to July 19, can change the dates of the elections.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 6,000 electoral officers have been sent to
various parts of the country in preparation for the elections.
Also 60 tons of voting materials have reportedly been seen to
various voting centers across the country.

<HEADLINE> World Optimistic About HK's Future: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Politicians and business
executives of many countries in the world share the common views
that Hong Kong will have a brighter future with continued
stability and prosperity after its return to China, a major Hong
Kong newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po said in a commentary that the synergy of Hong Kong
and China's inland areas will not only be conducive to their
common prosperity, but will also help in the economic development
of the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The commentary quoted Malaysia's Foreign Minister Abdullah
Badawi's recent remarks that Hong Kong's status as an
international business and financial center will be further
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will maintain its close trade, economic and cultural
links with Hong Kong, Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch, a world-famous investment bank, was also bullish
 about the prospects of Hong Kong as an international financial
hub and an entrepot.
</P>
<P>
The first six months of this year saw more than 20,000
newly-registered companies in Hong Kong. Among them 324 were
foreign companies, up 12 percent from last year, one of the
investment bank's senior vice-presidents said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong business people's enterprise and Hong Kong's
proximity to the Chinese inland areas are among the factors
justifying people's confidence in Hong Kong's rosy prospects, the
vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
There have been frequent economic contacts between Hong Kong
and other economies in the Asia-Pacific region, making Hong Kong
an important bridge between the region and the rest of the world
in terms of economic development, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that in the early half of the 1990's,
trade between Hong Kong and other members of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum grew by an average of 17 percent
 annually, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Hong Kong's trade with other APEC economies accounted
for some 80 percent of its total external trade.
</P>
<P>
A great amount of capital from Western Europe, Singapore, the
Middle East and other areas has been pouring into Hong Kong, the
region's key capital market, and has been supplied to other
countries and places in the region, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the biggest external investor in the Chinese
inland areas and is the second largest foreign investor in Vietnam
 and Indonesia, it said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President of the European Commission Sir Leon Brittan has
said that the European Union (EU) will work hard to ensure that
both the EU and Hong Kong benefit from their relationship marked
by Hong Kong's entry into a new era.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the EU's tenth largest trading partner, and home
to some 250 regional headquarters of EU firms as well as over 100
EU companies engaged in financial services.
</P>
<P>
In view of Britain's substantial business interests in Hong
Kong, the new government of the Labor Party which came to power in
 May is expected to give top priority to Hong Kong in its external
 policy, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to the motherland is also a great
encouragement to the developing countries. As the Zambian
ambassador to China put it, Hong Kong will continue to play a
significant role on the world arena and inject vitality into the
global economy.

<HEADLINE> Several Hurt in Northern Belfast Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Five members of a joint Police-Army
patrol were injured in an attack in northern Belfast as Ulster
braces for a weekend of Orange marches, said reports from Belfast
today.
</P>
<P>
The attack came shortly after 2200 GMT. Witnesses said four men
in a white Sierra car stopped at the checkpoint, Two got out and
opened fire while a third threw the bomb.
</P>
<P>
Although there was no immediate claim of responsibility, police
sources said the attack was almost certainly the work of the IRA
(Irish Republican Army) or INLA (Irish National Liberation Army).
</P>
<P>
It appeared to have dashed any hopes that the republican
movement would respond positively to the Orange Order's decision
to cancel or divert four contentious parades due to pass through
Roman Catholic areas today.
</P>
<P>
The surprise move by the Orange Order to re-route or cancel
four Twelfth of July marches had earlier provoked a fierce
backlash from hardline loyalists and led to calls for Unionists to
withdraw from political talks.
</P>
<P>
Today's parades had threatened to lead to an escalation of
violence when last weekend's Drumcree Orange parade was forced
through the nationalist Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
A decision by police chiefs to allow the Orange Order to march
along Garvaghy Road sparked several days of the worst violence
seen in Northern Ireland for many years.
</P>
<P>
Republicans reacted cautiously to the Orange initiative,
demanding that other parades be re-routed and promising to oppose
marches in several small towns.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, President of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein,
said: "It is very significant and welcome but if the Orange Order
keeps overselling it they will undermine the significance of their
own gesture."

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Get Huge Aid From Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will get a total of 435
million U.S. Dollars from donors, according to Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a two-day consultative group meeting on Zambia
on Friday held in Paris, the donors assured of releasing the fund
in balance of payment support and project assistance for this
year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement the donors said they are happy with the Zambian
government's commitment to dialogue with the Opposition.

The statement said, "premised on satisfactory economic and
governance performance, Zambia's external partners indicated
plans to make available in 1997 at least 150 million Dollars in
balance of payment support, plus an additional 285 million in
project assistance."
</P>
<P>
Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza briefed the consultative
group meeting on the positive developments that have bolstered
the macro-economic stability of his country since the last group
meeting in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Discussion between Zambia and its donors on additional support
to be provided in 1997 and 1998 have reached an advanced stage,
the local newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> C'wealth Suspends S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of Nations has
suspended Sierra Leone from the organization as a punitive
measure against the military government of Major Johny Koromah
who came to power after the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Emeka Anyaoku announced
this in London Friday after a two-day meeting of the Commonwealth
Ministerial Action Group (CMAG).
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Anyaoku demanded the immediate and
unconditional restoration of the democratic government of
President Ahemd Kabbah, which was toppled in the coup.
</P>
<P>
The suspension would expel Sierra Leone from any Commonwealth
meeting and deprive it of any technical aid from the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone is the second country that has been suspended
from the Commonwealth. In November 1995, Nigeria was suspended of
its membership for executing Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni
minority activists.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG also met with the National Democratic Coalition and
other non-government organizations in Nigeria on the political
and human rights situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to another statement by Anyaoku, the information
gathered from the meeting will be added to those from Nigerian
government agencies to enable the CMAG to make recommendations to
the Commonwealth on further actions on Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Though the CMAG would not make its decision until September,
Nigerian observers feared that the group would maintain Nigeria's
suspension, given the division within the Commonwealth on the
sincerity of Nigeria's transition to civil rule program and new
tense between Nigeria and the British Labor government.

TIRANA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
Friday urged people of all ethnic groups in the country to remain
calm and avoid clashes over the removal of Albanian flags from a
local city hall.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov, returning to Skopje, capital of Macedonia, after a
NATO conference in Madrid, urged his citizens show respect for the
emblem of the country and safeguard the nation's territorial
integrity and independence, saying that it is both the right and
the responsibility of all citizens.

<P>
Hundreds of ethnic Albanians clashed with Macedonian police in
Gostivar on Wednesday when police officers removed Albanian flags
from the city hall.

Macedonian officials said two people were killed and more than
30 others were injured in the clash. Police arrested over 300
suspects, including four Albanian citizens.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia's constitutional court ruled in May that the Albanian
flags must be removed from Gostivar's city hall and police were
sent there Wednesday to enforce the ruling.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Business Leaders Support Peso's Floating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Business leaders in the Philippines
today reaffirmed their support for the Central Bank's new policy
of allowing the exchange rate between the peso and the U.S. dollar
to float.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, in a conference with Trade and Industry Secretary
Cesar Bautista, also said the country's strong economic
fundamentals will cause the exchange rate to settle down in a
short period of time.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank announced Friday the de facto depreciation of
the peso after taking futile measures to defend the Philippine
currency. On the same day, the peso at one point devalued by 11
percent to a record low of one dollar against 29.45 pesos at the
Philippine Dealing System.
</P>
<P>
However, the business leaders viewed the devaluation as
temporary, adding that after the initial fluctuations, the rate is
expected to settle to a new parity while interest rates will also
go down.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the business leaders also believed that the
bank's decision would give companies relief from high interest
rates and reduce their costs.
</P>
<P>
To protect the peso from speculative attacks after the floating
of the Thai baht on July 2, the Central Bank has raised its
overnight borrowing rate for the fourth time until it rose to a
record high of 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the business leaders also said they would
think twice before changing their marketing and pricing policies.

<HEADLINE> Dar Plans To Build 12 Primary Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Dar es Salaam City
Commission has planned to build 12 primary schools to reduce
congestion in existing schools, the local paper Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Charles Keenja was quoted as saying the
construction of 12 schools, which would be built in three
districts, would start immediately.
</P>
<P>
He noted part of the cost would be met by the residents
through fund-raising to facilitate the construction of more
classrooms and ease the shortage of desks.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that many schools are now accommodating up to
5,000 pupils, a figure which is greater than those accommodated
in Tanzania's universities and other institutions of higher
learning.
</P>
<P>
The commission targets at 1,500 pupils at each primary
schools.
</P>
<P>
Keenja further said as a result of the shortage of classrooms,
a teacher has to give lessons to 300 pupils or more in one
classroom.
</P>
<P>
The commission has ordered primary schools with congested
pupils to introduce double sessions to reduce the number of
pupils in each classroom.
</P>
<P>
"The city has few primary schools compared to its population,
and we must reduce the congestion in the classrooms if we want to
attain the required standard of education," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam has only 163 schools at the moment, serving the
population of about 3 million.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week all
lower.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals market ended the week lower due to refiners'
aggressive cash selling despite a slight recovery in the futures
market at the week's close.
</P>
<P>
July-South settled the week at 1,167.50 ringgit (about 467 U.S.
dollars) per ton against last week's close at 1,207 ringgit (about
482.8 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
Refiners let flow the crude palm oil in the open market as they
were reluctant to hold on to heavy stocks in fear of rising
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Palm oil stocks are expected to hit 1.01 million tons by the
end of September, according to a report released by the United
States Embassy here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Palm oil private forecaster, Ivan Wong, also estimated stocks
to increase, releasing June stock figures at 795,000 tons against
711,841 tons in May.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), against last week's
close, the tin price was down 20 sen to 13.52 ringgit (about 5.408
U.S. dollars) per kg, triggered by heavy selling activities.
</P>
<P>
The week's accumulated turnover also narrowed to 526 tons
against 590 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
The metal on the KLTM is likely to rise next week as it had
been oversold during the second half of the past trading week.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a price correction next Monday, as the price
had dropped quite low," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Players, however, are advised to trade cautiously, and trading
is expected to be in a very tight range.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market finished the week easier also.
</P>
<P>
August RSS-One was 15 sen lower to 228.00 sen (about 91.2 U.S.
cents) per kg while SMR 20 dropped 5.50 sen to 232.00 sen (about
92.8 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber market is expected to hold steadier next week,
with the International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) expected
to come into the market to ward off the current bearish prices.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania PM Urges Prevention of Unwanted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye has said preventing unwanted pregnancies should be the
main concern of Tanzania's Family Planning Program.
</P>
<P>
He made this statement in Dodoma Friday at a rally to mark the
World Population Day, saying that Tanzania's population growth at
above three percent was too high compared with the country's
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimated at 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The premier added that the increasing population meant rapid
depletion of resources.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye challenged Tanzanian families to bear the number of
children they could feed and care for their well beings in the
wake of the prevailing economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "the notion that each child is born with its fortune
is false."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "Abortion should not be associated with
family planning because it is illegal."

<HEADLINE> Iran Intends to Form Bloc with Syria, Iraq: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry today
revealed its intention to form a bloc with its strategic ally of
Syria and even former enemy of Iraq to neutralize threats from
the U.S., Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Malaki said at a press
conference here that "Iran, Iraq and Syria may form a bloc to
counter recent U.S. plots in the region."
</P>
<P>
Malaki said that the suggestion has been put forward by Arab
intellectuals and politicians.
</P>
<P>
"There have been suggestions in this area put forward by
(Arab) intellectuals, politicians and parties in the region that
cooperation should begin between Iran, Iraq and Syria," he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the Iranian senior official to talk
about Iran's intention of forming military bloc in the region in
the face of growing military threat to Iran.
</P>
<P>
On July 4, Major General Mohsen Rezaee, Commander-in-Chief of
the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), warned Muslim
countries of a new plot by the United States and Israel in their
recent joint maneuvers in the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
He noted "the joint military maneuvers by the U.S., Israel and
Turkey in the Mediterranean Sea and cooperation between the
Turkish army and the Israeli regime inside Iraqi were part of an
elaborate plot against Muslim states."
</P>
<P>
A military training agreement signed by Turkey and Israel in
February 1996 has generated fears among the Middle East countries
that Turkey is aligning itself with the Jewish state against the
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Malaki said that both Tehran and
Damascus supported territorial integrity of Iraq against the
recent Turkey's military incursions into northern Iraq to attack
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said "we strongly condemn Turkish military invasion of
northern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"During the recent trip of (Iranian) First Vice-President
Hassan Habibi (to Syria), Iranian and Syrian officials discussed
ways to prevent the partition of Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the relations between Tehran and Baghdad, the
two former enemies that fought a bitter eight-year war starting
from 1990, have also improved.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Health Minister Ali Reza Marandi traveled to Iraq last
month to extend an official invitation to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to attend the eighth summit of Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) in Tehran in December.
</P>
<P>
"Iraqi territorial integrity is very important for us. We are
one of the few countries that have embassies in Baghdad," Malaki
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "we respect the United Nations
resolution on Iraq."

ADDIS ABABA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and the U.N. African Economic Community (AEC) will
organize a forum on financial market integration and development
in Mauritius from July 15 to 17.
</P>

According to the latest issue of the weekly ''OAU Fact
Sheet'', the forum will focus on promoting dialogue between the
regulators and operators in the financial markets so as to enable

and advisers who have also been invited by the OAU and AEC to
share their experiences with their African counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The OAU publication said, this forum will be hosted by
Mauritius due to its commitment to the OAU's ideals of African
unity through the promotion of economic and financial market
integration.
</P>
<P>
It also expected to facilitate the exchange of experiences
among the participants and those involved in daily financial
market operations in African countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will begin a two-nation state visit to Indonesia
and Thailand Monday, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who ended his four-day official visit to Britain
Friday and left for Indonesia, is expected to spend a weekend on
the popular resort island of Bali in Indonesia, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The planned three-day state visit, to kick off Monday when
Mandela is expected to arrive in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia,
is aimed at boosting economic and trade relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will be the host country to the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) summit in 1998, and the preparation for the
upcoming summit is expected to be the main topic during Mandela's
talks with Indonesian leaders.
</P>
<P>
The three-day tour to Indonesia is Mandela's second visit to
that country, but his first as South African President. He
visited Jakarta in 1992 in his capacity as chairman of the
African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is also scheduled to leave Indonesia on Wednesday and
fly to Thailand for his first state visit to that country.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Thailand, Mandela is expected to hold talks
with Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Prime Minister Chaowalit
Yongchaiyudh.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Ruling Party to Discuss Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Kenya African National
Union (KANU) will soon call a National Delegates Conference and
the Governing Council meeting to deliberate on constitutional
reforms, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted President Daniel arap Moi as saying at Kisii
in Western Kenya Friday that he is not a dictator and promised to
effect whatever decision is agreed on at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan head of state noted that the suggestion by
opposition parties in the country that he alone held the key to
the reforms was untenable since he could not dictate to Kenyans
what reforms they wanted in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He said that constitutional reforms as proposed by the
Opposition did not accommodate the views of parliamentarians who
had the mandate to effect changes through the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
As Moi was announcing plans for KANU top organs to discuss
constitutional reforms, a group of opposition Members of
Parliament (MP) said yesterday that they intended to disrupt the
coming General Election if the desired changes were not effected
in advance.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, opposition Ford-Kenya Vice-Chairman James
Orengo and nine other MPs stated that in order to force the KANU
government to effect changes, Kenyans should use all necessary
means to ensure that the elections are not held before reforms
are effected.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Receives 150,000 Anti-Crime Postcards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- About 150,000 postcards were
delivered over the weekend to South African President Nelson
Mandela as part of an anti-crime protest.
</P>
<P>
Of all the postcards, 70,000 were dumped by sky divers who
jumped from helicopters above the Union Buildings, the working
place of the cabinet in Pretoria. Another 80,000 postcards were
transported in a seven-ton truck onto the lawns in front of the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The postcards depict a South African national flag with three
over-sized bullet holes and bear a message to Mandela on the back
imploring him to respond to the country's crime epidemic.
</P>
<P>
South African Police Commissioner George Fivaz was on hand to
witness the event and was handed a memorandum, petitioning the
government to take responsibility for the crime epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"We acknowledge the gross injustices of apartheid, but blame
can no longer be a hiding place. It is the present government's
responsibility to take action to eliminate crime.
</P>
<P>
"It is the nation's impassioned plea that President Mandela
personally takes up leadership in the fight against crime, "
managing director of the protest Ashna Noriskin said.
</P>
<P>
Fivaz said the anti-crime protest was a laudable effort to
sensitize communities and the government about the seriousness of
crime, adding that he would convey what was written on the
postcards to Mandela when he meets him next week.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is travelling abroad, which include Britain, Thailand
and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that South Africa is suffering from
increasing crimes with rape, robbery and hijacking cases standing
on the top.
</P>
<P>
According to a police survey, at least one thousand women were
raped every day with an overall increase of 19.7 percent from
1994 to 1996. More than 107,000 vehicles were reported stolen in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Some city centers in South Africa, including the country's
biggest city, Johannesburg, have become extremely dangerous after
dark because of violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
As crimes become rampant throughout South Africa, many
businessmen have stopped making investment in crime-ridden
central business districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has been ruling South Africa since May 1994, has
identified fight against crimes as one of the top priorities for
the country.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Acts to Stem Shilling Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The pressure on Kenya's foreign
exchange market is easing and expected to stabilize next Monday
after the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) intervened in the market,
the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the bank yesterday intervened to stop
further depreciation of Kenyan currency of Shilling by providing
29 million U.S. Dollars into the market.
</P>
<P>
CBK Governor Micah Cheserem was quoted as saying here
yesterday that the CBK is standing by to meet any demand on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Shilling rate versus the U.S. Dollar had
eased to as low as 61.50 from around 55 at the beginning of the
week.
</P>
<P>
By the evening of Friday, the Shilling had stabilized to about
58 to U.S. Dollar, said CBK Chief Banking Manager Reuben
Marambii, adding that "the worst is over and we expect the market
to stablize."
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that it was the largest amount of Dollars the CBK
has sold to calm a jittery market for several years.
</P>
<P>
Marambii said that some banks had exhausted their stock in the
morning because of panic buying triggered off by speculators.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan currency has also losing ground against all the
other major currencies trading at a mean rate of 97.26 Shillings
to the Sterling Pound yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling has suffered significant loss during the past
week because of the unrest throughout the East African country on
July 7 organized by opposition parties to press for
constitutional reforms before the coming General Elections.

<HEADLINE> Gold Slide, Disaster to S. Africa: Analysts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is facing its
worst social crisis with the recent sliding gold prices
threatening an unwanted surge in enemployment, said a source here
today.
</P>
<P>
The source quoted analysts as saying that more than 50,000
South African miners could loss their jobs if the gold prices
fall below the current 12-year low of about 320 U.S. Dollars an
ounce.
</P>
<P>
"It could be the worst thing the country has ever seen. This
gold crisis is the last thing the country needs right now," said
an analyst.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not just miners, mostly Blacks, who are
threatened by poverty, most of South Africa's gold mines are the
only source of income for many small towns, which could become
ghost towns, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices have recently fallen to the lowest since 1985 on
world market, pinching an already squeezed industry.
</P>
<P>
South African deep-level gold mines have suffered falling
output since the 1970s, falling from more than 1,000 tons in 1970
to 496 tons in 1996 and an expected 500 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African gold industry has already cut
mine jobs from around 530,000 in 1987 to around 350,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
With the continuing falling of the gold prices, more mines are
being flung into the marginal camp and more jobs are on the line
as producers seek to cut costs further to guarantee
profitability.
</P>
<P>
With one third of the country's work force unemployed and many
thousands more underemployed, further cuts would be a severe blow
to a government struggling to reverse the trend since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Deputy FM on Relations with Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
expressed reservations whether the new secular government in
Turkey would gain the vote of confidence from Turkish
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Malaki said at a press
conference here that "I very much doubt that Mesut Yilmaz
government will gain the vote of confidence."
</P>
<P>
"About the Turkish government, we will express our opinion
after it gains the vote of confidence from the Turkish
parliament," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz became the new Turkish prime minister after President
Suleyman Demirel approved the new cabinet list submitted by Yilmaz
on June 30. A vote of confidence in Parliament is scheduled for
today.
</P>
<P>
However, Malaki refused to comment on the latest statement by
Yilmaz to the effect that Turkey was no longer in danger of
being influenced by Islamism from the countries such as Iran.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Tehran and Ankara were strained last
March when the two countries recalled their ambassadors and
reduced political ties to the level of charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
The tension between the two neighbors began in February after
Iranian Ambassador to Ankara Mohammad Reza Baqeri called on
Turkish people to follow Iran's lead and establish an Islamic
government.
</P>
<P>
But Malaki said that, despite the diplomatic feud, the
economic ties between Turkey and Iran had not been damaged.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the recalling of the ambassadors, our economic ties
have continued to persist," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Qualitatively speaking, our ties with Turkey have not been
reduced," he said, adding that in fact, in international area,
Iran has increased its cooperation with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Malaki said that Iran would not comment in domestic issues in
Turkey but was opposed to Turkish foreign policy in such areas
as Turkish military presence in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We have not made any comments about Turkish domestic scene
but we strongly condemn Turkish military invasion of northern
Iraq," Malaki said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Urged to Be Restrained on Pay Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Industrial Relations
Association (ZIRA) has appealed to employers and workers to keep
restraint and negotiate over pay rise and working conditions
improvement in good faith.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Friday deploring the use of firearms and other
weapons of violence against unarmed striking workers, ZIRA urged
all parties to the current bargaining exercise to respect one
another.
</P>
<P>
''Violence is a manifestation of backwardness, loss of ideas
and creativity regarding the issues at stake,'' ZIRA Secretary
Arnold Sibanda said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda said destruction of property and harassment of members
of the public did not serve to justify one's case or attract
sympathy for it.
</P>
<P>
The general manager of a Harare security company has been
arrested after he shot and injured at least 18 guards who were
striking for more pay.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda also cautioned that there should be no non-negotiable
positions in any bargaining exercise.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is currently in the grip of strikes as workers
nationwide take industrial action to press for better pay and
working conditions.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia happens to be the biggest
supplier and source of marijuana into Botswana, which leads to
the daily arrests of Zambians for drug trafficking, Zambia Daily
Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Botswana Deputy Commissioner for Operations
Edwin Batishu as saying that his country cannot grow marijuana
because of the climate and some Zambians are taking advantage of
that.
</P>
<P>
Batishu said, "Our country is now saturated with marijuana
</P>
<P>
... we are no longer just a transit point but consumers as
well."
</P>
<P>
Batishu, however, said that his country is trying hard to
contain the problem.
</P>
<P>
On his part, The Zambian High Commissioner to Botswana Wilted
Phiri said, "It is very embarrassing for my embassy to read
stories in the newspapers almost everyday about the Zambians
being caught."
</P>
<P>
The Drug Enforcement Commission was set up in Zambia years

trafficking and drug abuse.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan's Income Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The quality of life in Uganda
today is better than that of 10 years ago, reported the local
daily ''the New Vision''.
</P>
<P>
President Y. Museveni was quoted as saying Uganda's per capita
income has risen from 150 U.S. Dollars in 1989 to 240 Dollars
today and that Uganda is no longer among the 10 poorest countries
in the world.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read for him by Serapio Karashani, an official of
Kampala at celebrations for the World Population Day here
yesterday, Museveni said the infant mortality rate in the country
has reduced from 122 per 1,000 live birth in 1987 to 97 per 1,000
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But he regretted that maternal mortality rates had risen from
100 per 100,000 mothers in 1960s to 506 per 100,000 today.
</P>
<P>
Museveni attributed this to the high rate of teenage
pregrancies, and Uganda tops African countries in teenage
pregrancies.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is committed to implementing favorable
and strong population polices to improve the citizens' quality of
life.

TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Three transport planes of Japan's
Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) left for Thailand this morning to
prepare for possible evacuation of Japanese nationals from
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Japan has dispatched military aircraft on
an overseas mission that is not a training flight since the end of
World War II.

The three C-130 cargo planes, which have been on standby in
Naha, capital of Japan's southernmost prefecture of Okinawa, since
Wednesday, are scheduled to arrive at a Thai naval base in
U-Taphao. They will fly on to Pochentong airport in Phnom Penh if
an evacuation is ordered, Kyodo News said.

The planes will stand by at the Thai naval base while the
government monitors the situation in Cambodia, where political
uncertainty continues, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
If dispatched to Cambodia, the three cargo planes will be the
first aircraft to evacuate Japanese nationals abroad.

SEOUL, July 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's National Red Cross
today proposed high-level talks with its counterpart in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea to discuss food aid programs.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Li Song-ho, acting chairman of DPRK's Red Cross
Society, Kang Young-hoon, president of the South's National Red
Cross, said most of the 50,000 tons of food aid for DPRK has been
shipped since the two sides met in Beijing, China, in May and new
talks are needed to discuss more aid to the flood stricken North.
</P>
<P>
Kang proposed that the two sides meet at the secretary-general
level on July 22 either at the border village of Panmunjom or
somewhere in the South.
</P>

But twice in May, DPRK rejected South Korea's proposal to hold
Red Cross talks at Panmunjom. At DPRK's insistence, the talks were
held at last in Beijing, resulting in an agreement on sending
50,000 tons of food aid to DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka's Tamil Moderates Face New Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's moderate Tamil
politicians are risking their lives as they show their willingness
to cooperate with the major Singhalese government to search for a
peaceful solution to country's ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
The slaying of a popular Tamil parliamentarian last week in the
north- eastern city of Trincomalee, some 250 kilometers from
capital Colombo, has raised fears of a new wave of violence
against moderate Tamil politicians.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarian A. Thangathurai was killed along with five
others, including a high school principal, at a public ceremony
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Thangathurai's funeral was held under
unprecedented security in Trincomalee, a sea port symbolic of Sri
Lanka's ethnic diversity with almost equal proportions of three
main communities -- the Singhalese, Tamil and Muslims.
Seven government ministers attended the funeral.
</P>
<P>
Though no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, it is
widely believed to be "another operation" by the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) which has been fighting to set up a separate
state in Sri Lanka's North and East.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga said that the assassination of
Thangathurai had been committed by "frustrated and desperate
persons to discourage right-minded persons from seeking a lasting
peace."
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga is now spearheading a political campaign to canvass
the support of the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil
communities for her government's efforts to solve the ethnic issue
in the island country.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said the murder poses problems not only
to the government and parliamentary Tamil parties, but also to
several anti-LTTE Tamil groups who have returned to mainstream
politics from separatist armed movements in Sri Lanka's turbulent
North and East.

<HEADLINE> Thai Currency Slides 20 Percent Since Floated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai currency weakened to 31
baht against the US dollar on Friday as a result of heavy
volatility in Southeast Asian currency trading.
</P>
<P>
The baht's value fall on the domestic market was equal to a 20
percent depreciation since the float was announced on July 2. The
mid-rate on June 30 was 25.75 baht to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The baht opened trading at 29.25-29.45 against the dollar, and
weakened steadily on heavy dollar demand. The baht dropped to as
low as 31 baht against the dollar before picking up in the
afternoon to close at 30.50-30.80.
</P>
<P>
One dealer said most of the demand stemmed from commercial
clients, primarily importers seeking dollars for delivery on their
trading contracts.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi said the
volatility of regional currencies on Friday affected trading of
the baht.
</P>
<P>
The floating of the baht had put some pressure on the foreign
exchange systems of regional neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Both Indonesia and the Philippines Friday announced changes to
their currency systems to deter speculation.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's central bank widened its trading bandwidth for the
rupiah from 8 percent to 12 percent, while in the Philippines,
authorities announced a halt to trading after the peso fell 11.5
percent against the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Condemns SFOR for Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Bosnian
Serb Republic of Srpska today condemned the Multinational
Stablization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia for exceeding its power by
arresting Serbian war crimes suspects.
</P>
<P>
A letter from Bosnian Serbs to Korply Simpson, deputy commander
of the SFOR, said the action taken by the British soldiers in the
SFOR went beyond the SFOR mandate in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The British troops on Thursday shot dead a former Serb local
police chief and seized a Serb local hospital director in Prijedor
district, in the Bosnian Serb Republic. The two Serbs are war
crimes suspects, and the arrested man is now jailed in the Hague
for trial by the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
On December 12, 1996, the U.N. Security Council authorized the
deployment of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) led
multinational stabilization force in Bosnia for 18 months to
maintain peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The letter to Simpson said that the U.N. did not empower the
SFOR to arrest any citizens of the Bosnian Serb Republic of Srpska.
</P>
<P>
The citizens killed and arrested by the SFOR did not take any
actions against the SFOR, which would lead to the use of force by
the SFOR, it said.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Bosnia Serb Republic of Srpska also
accused the SFOR of making use of the "so-called" secret list of
suspected war criminals to remarkably change its policy in
Bosnia.

</P>
<P>
The anchor is easy to operate and maneuver, and is ideal for
heavy-load mooring at depths of up to 300 m.
</P>

<P>
BRASILIA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will still be world's
fifth most populous country as its population jumps from today's
158 million to 186 million in 2010.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazil's population growth will slow down in the next
century when the average growth rate will be reduced to 1.4
percent a year, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons for the slowdown: more women are
using birth control or sterilization and Brazilians are getting
older.
</P>
<P>
After 2000, Brazilian women will have an average of 1.8
children. Today they have an average of 2.4.
</P>
<P>
Improvements in medical care have enabled the Brazilians'
average life span to jump from 41 years in 1935 to 65 years in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The men's average life span in 1996 was 61.1 years and woman
69.8 years.
</P>

Brazil's population is biggest after China, India, the United
States and Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Russia Still Opposes NATO's Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Valery Serov today reiterated Russia's negative attitude towards
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Serov told a press conference in the Russian Foreign Ministry
that European security should have been safeguarded by promoting
mutual-trust among regional countries instead by NATO's
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
During NATO's Madrid summit held from July 8 to 9, the alliance
decided to invite Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join
the military alliance. The three countries hope to become new
members in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Facing NATO's eastward expansion, Russia will not set up new
alliances with Central Asian countries or other Asian countries in
a bid to avoid fresh confrontation, Serov noted.
</P>
<P>
Russia also favors the NATO-Ukraine Charter formally signed in
Madrid during the NATO summit. Serov said the signing of the deal
would not have a negative impact to the security and stability in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Just two days after the signing of the NATO-Russia Founding Act
in Paris, NATO and Ukraine agreed, on May 29, on a security accord
setting out terms for their future relations.
</P>
<P>
The accord enables NATO and Ukraine to establish a joint
commission for consultations on European security and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The commission is regarded as a lower-key forum than the
permanent joint council to be established between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Serov said the Russia-NATO and Ukraine-NATO pacts will
complement each other in safeguarding security and stability in
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Driver Gets Sentence Over Party Leaders' Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali driver held responsible
for the death of two leaders of the CPN-U ML party four years ago
got a lenient sentence Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Nepal Friday overturned earlier decisions
of the Chitwan District Court and the Appellate Court to impose
life imprisonment on Amar Lama, altering them to two more years in
jail and a fine of 500 rupees (about nine U.S. dollars), the local
press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The division bench of the court opined that based on the
circumstances of the accident, intention to kill of the driver
could not be established.
</P>
<P>
It regarded the case as one of reckless and careless driving.
</P>
<P>
It has decided to refer its decision to the full bench of the
court, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Lama has already served four years term in jail on charges and
conviction of intentionally causing the deaths of two leaders of
the then opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist and
Leninist, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
In May 1993, the jeep Lama was driving fell into the Marsyangdi
Trishuli River, some 100 kilometers west of Kathmandu, killing
both of its passengers -- General Secretary of the CPN-UML Madan
Bhandari and its politburo member Jeev Raj Ashrit.)
</P>
<P>
However, Lama survived.
</P>
<P>
The accident remains a mystery to date.

MOSCOW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of the Belarus Security
Council, Viktor Sheiman, said today that his country had presented
a draft charter of relations with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization in hope of developing cooperation with NATO in
politics, economy, science and military affairs.
</P>
<P>
Interfax News Agency reported that Sheiman told a news
conference that Belarus hoped, above all, to participate in the
enactment of international laws, and was interested in cooperation
with NATO in switching military production to civilian, and in
national defense.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's decision to invite Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic to join the western alliance, Sheiman said Belarus
worried about NATO's plan of eastward expansion and deemed it an
"historic error."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that some people wanted to impose a new
European security model on Belarus, which was "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Sheiman said that the establishment of an all-Europe security
model in 21st century should have the participation of all
countries concerned, and take into account their interests.
</P>
<P>
Sheiman said after Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic join
NATO, NATO will expand right to the border of Belarus. Therefore,
Belarus would "take all necessary steps" to ensure its national
security, and avoid making its western borders the new dividing
line and the forward position of confrontation.

Sheiman led the Belarussian delegation to NATO's Madrid summit
on July 8-9.

SHANGHAI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Commodity prices in this leading

half of this year, compared with a 13.7 percent growth rate in GDP
at the same time.
</P>

7.9 and 6 percentage points from the same period in 1996,
according to the Municipal Statistics Bureau.

Experts attributed the declining prices to the influence of the
market and the improving economic conditions in the country as a

Good harvests, together with the local government's efforts to

to fall to 102.5 and less than 100, respectively, during the

Guangzhou, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The economically booming
province of Guangdong in south China is seeking scholars from
interior areas and abroad to enhance local universities' academic
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of recruitment, which plans to take in 36

Each recruit will get an apartment of 85 to 100 sq meters in
living space and a handsome sum of money to kick off research
projects.

<P>
The number of universities in the region is growing, but not
the quality of their faculties, with most heads and senior
researchers becoming too old to carry out research projects, said
officials in charge of higher education in the region.

The public recruitment is part of their efforts to improve the
faculties, in addition to bringing up local young talented people,
the officials noted. "We need to keep the province's competitive

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Banana Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's banana
exports, during the first five months of the year, brought about
206.7 million dollars, a 14.7 percent increase over the same
period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sales abroad of the fruit register good international prices
and better conditions in the banana producing zone of Uraba, in
the northwestern department of Antioquia, said the Colombian
Banana Producers Union.
</P>
<P>
Uraba, where most of the banana for export is produced, is
undergoing a stage of relative peace after being the scenario of
confrontations between the guerrilla and paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
Colombian banana exports this year were 80 million 18-kilo
boxes, a 12.6 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Union, the price of a box of bananas to be
sold abroad, not including transportation costs, was 6.06 dollars
during the first five months of 1997, as against 5.75 dollars
during the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The organization admitted that the banana industry is one of
the most indebted of the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
Colombia is the third biggest banana producer in Latin America,
behind Ecuador and Costa Rica. The exports of the fruit yield for
Colombia 402 million dollars a year.

<P>
NANJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province has
witnessed a stable development of animal husbandry over the past
18 years, with the annual output of meat and eggs reaching 3.2
million tons and 1.9 million tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The output value of animal husbandry accounts for nearly 29
percent of the province's agricultural total, and more than one
third of the local farmers' net income comes from this sector. In
the province's southern economically developed area more than 40
percent of the farmers' income increase comes from animal
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu is one of China's important grain producers, and
farmers have the tradition of raising animals besides growing
grain. The province supplies meat and eggs to Shanghai and many
southern cities.
</P>
<P>
Liu Liren, deputy-director of the provincial agricultural and
forestry department, said that the province attaches great
importance to the dissemination of advanced technology in
developing animal husbandry, with more than 20,000 technicians
devoted to the work.

WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Nevada passed a law on Friday
to allow the state to allocate various fines to unsportsmanlike
boxers in the rings.
</P>
<P>
The measure was pushed through the Legislature following the
June 28 heavyweight title fight between Holyfield and Tyson, who
was disqualified for biting the champ's ears.

The Nevada State Athletic Commission on Wednesday revoked

<P>
If Tyson could have lost all 30 million U.S. dollars, he might
have thought twice about biting Holyfield, Gov. Bob Miller said in
signing the bill.
</P>
<P>
Miller said he decided to rush the signing of the bill when he

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Wayne Ferreira broke
Spaniards' domination in the quarter-finals at the Swiss Open
tennis tournament in Gstaad, Switzerland on Friday as second seed
Alex Corretja and two compatriots reached the final four.
</P>
<P>
Displaying the devastating form which has already earned him
two tournament wins this season, Corretja needed just 65 minutes
to book his place in the semifinals with a thorough 6-4, 6-0 win
over seventh-seeded compatriot Alberto Berasategui.
</P>
<P>
Corretja will now meet fellow Spaniard Juan Albert Viloca, who
swept aside Germany's Nicolas Kiefer 6-4, 6-3 to reach his first
semifinal this season.
</P>
<P>
Viloca, who registered his first victory over a top 10 opponent
with a second round win over world number nine Marcelo Rios, will
have to clear a tougher hurdle in the form of his sixth-ranked
compatriot if he is to reach the first final of his career.
</P>
<P>
A winner in Estoril and Rome and a finalist on two other
occassions, Corretja has been the dominant clay-court player this
season, winning 28 matches -- more than any other player.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Felix Mantilla, who lost last year's final to Albert
Costa, became the third Spaniard to advance with a 6-4, 6-3 win
over compatriot Javier Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
Mantilla, searching for back-to-back tournament wins after his
victory in Bologna, will now take on eighth-seeded Ferreira.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old South African, producing what he described as
his best tennis in a disappointing year, overcame local favourite
Marc Rosset 7-5, 7-6 (12-10) to reach his first semifinal this
season.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan Sheep Stock Diminishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Uruguayan sheep stock at
the close of June 1997 underwent a 6 percent drop compared with
the same period of 1996, when it went from 19.6 million heads to
18.4 million, according to Uruguayan Wool Secretariat (SUL)
sources.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account a per head wool productivity slightly
inferior to the one reached during the previous shearing, the
Uruguayan wool output will be some 75 million kilograms dirty base
of shorn wool, against the 81.8 million kilograms of the previous
season.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the Uruguayan sheep stock was caused by the fall in
the price of wool, which did not satisfy the expectations of the
producers, which forced many of them to continue diminishing their
sheep stock.
</P>
<P>
The descent is also attributed to an increase in the export of
sheep on the hoof.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- German rider Erik Zabel was first
across the line in Friday's sixth stage of the Tour de France but
was later disqualified for dangerous sprinting and Dutchman Jeroen
Blijlevens named the winner.
</P>
<P>
Zabel, who won Tuesday's third stage, sprinted clear in the
final straight and eased home ahead of Blijlevens and Djamolodine
Abdujaparov of Uzbekistan, who was later announced disqualified
for failing a doping test. Cedric Vasseur of France retained the
yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sanction Zabel moved up to second place in the
overall standings ahead of Italian Mario Cipollini as he was only
placed last in the lead group -- losing just the bonus time he
picked up for winning the stage.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old German aimed a head butt in the final 400
meters at Frenchman Frederic Moncassin, who ironically had been
disqualified from this season's Dauphine Libere for headbutting
Zabel's teammate Rolf Aldag.
</P>
<P>
It was the third year running that the 25-year-old Blijlevens
had won a stage in the Tour.
</P>
<P>
The controversial final sprint was also marked by Tom Steels,
the Belgian national champion, chucking his bottle of water at
Moncassin after becoming irritated when Moncassin charged in front
of him.
</P>
<P>
Steels was subsequently thrown out of the Tour de France
for 'violent behaviour towards others in the peloton'.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, Uzbek Djamolidine Abdoujaparov was disqualified
for failing a dope test.
</P>
<P>
Abdoujaparov, a former winner of the Tour points standings was
thrown out of the tour for failing a test at the end of the second
stage between St. Valery-en-Caux and Vire last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Organisers did not immediately say what substance was found in
the rider's urine but his Lotto team director Jean-Luc
Vandenbroucke said two banned products had been detected.
</P>
<P>
Vandenbroucke added that a member of his staff had given
Abdoujaparov the banned substance and had been sacked.

NEW YORK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a more than
five-year high against the mark in New York today and surged in
most other dealings.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the rebound to a reassessment of the
comments by Germany's central bank, healthy U.S. economic data,
and new signs of German economic weakness. Sterling's rally
propelled it to the strongest level against the mark in more than
six years and indirectly helped pull the dollar higher.
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 1.7744 marks, its high for the day and
strongest level since December 1991, up 1.3 percent from its
1.7515-mark rate Thursday and up 15.1 percent for the year. The

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Sierra Leone to Restore Constitutional Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
today called again for the immediate and unconditional restoration
of constitutional order in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out by Council President Peter Osvald, the
Security Council expressed deep concern about the continuing
crisis in Sierra Leone and its negative humanitarian consequences
on the civilian population including refugees and internally
displaced persons and in particular, the atrocities committed
against Sierra Leone's citizens, foreign nationals and personnel
of the Economic Community of the West African States (ECOWAS)
monitoring group since the military coup d'etat on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the view that the attempt to overthrow the
democratically elected government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah
was unacceptable, the council was concerned about the grave crisis
in Sierra Leone which endangered the peace, security and stability
of the whole region, in particular, about its possible negative
impact on the ongoing peace process in neighboring Liberia, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed strong support for the decision
of the 33rd Summit of the Organization of African Unity held in
Harare from June 2 to 4 and full support for the objectives of the
efforts as set out in the final communique issued at the meeting
of the Foreign Ministers of the ECOWAS held in Conakry, Guinea, on
June 26.
</P>
<P>
Calling upon those who had seized power to cooperate fully with
these efforts, the council would continue to follow closely the
progress aimed at the peaceful resolution of the crisis and stood
ready to consider appropriate measures if constitutional order in
Sierra Leone was not restored without delay.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council's meeting on Sierra Leone was requested in
a letter dated July 9 addressed by Nigeria's permanent
representative to the council president. The letter states that
the deterioration of conditions in that country since the May 25
coup d'etat against President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah had led to a
meeting of the ECOWAS foreign ministers in Conakry on June 26.
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, a Committee of Four -- Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana,
Guinea and Nigeria -- was formed to ensure the implementation of
the measures adopted. In their final communique, the ECOWAS
ministers expressed their decision to work towards the
reinstatement of the legitimate government by a combination of
three measures, namely, dialogue, imposition of sanctions and
enforcement of an embargo, and the use of force. They stressed
that no country should recognize the regime that overthrew
President Kabbah, and called on the international community to
support ECOWAS initiatives on Sierra Leone.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said here today
that the work of the Preparatory Committee has laid a sound
groundwork for the successful operation of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 10th plenary session of the Preparatory
Committee for the Hong Kong SAR, he said the Preparatory Committee
has fulfilled its tasks assigned by the country and the National
People's Congress in the past one year and a half.
</P>
<P>
"Reviewing the course we have covered, though it was filled
with difficulty at each step, we should feel doubly proud and
relieved, because each step we took marked a period of deep-going
and far-reaching history," Tung, who was also vice-chairman of the
Preparatory Committee, said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he was pleased to win the people's trust, and be
nominated and appointed the first chief executive, noting that the
way of election was the first just, fair and open one in the
history of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The experience of the Preparatory Committee members greatly
inspired me to take office as chief executive. I deeply feel that
the Preparatory Committee has laid a solid foundation for the SAR
and its government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung voiced his hope that the Preparatory Committee members
would continue to support the work of the SAR, adding that he
believed that through the people's concerted efforts and on the
basis of the "one country, two systems" policy, Hong Kong will
have a better future and will contribute more to China's
rejuvenation and reunification.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Preparatory Committee Holds Tenth Plenum in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Preparatory Committee for the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) wound up here
today, having completed its historic missions.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen made the announcement at the 10th
plenary session of the Preparatory Committee here today.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, extended cordial thanks to the committee
members for their contributions to the smooth transition of Hong
Kong, on half of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The NPC and its standing committee attached special importance
to the smooth transition, prosperity and stability of Hong Kong,
Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to safeguard the authority of the Basic Law
and actively support the work of the HKSAR in an effort to promote
the development of Hong Kong in every respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, who presided over the meeting, noted
that the establishment of the HKSAR and smooth transition fully
proved the scientific validity of the "one country, two systems"
concept and its vitality.
</P>
<P>
He said the formation of the Hong Kong SAR was a process which
put the "one country, two systems" concept into practice. It was
also a process of implementation of the Basic Law, which made the
majority of Hong Kong people masters of their own destiny, he
said, attributing the success to the leadership of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, as
well as the supports of the six million Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee-hwa, the first HKSAR chief executive, and Rita Fan,
president of the Provisional Legislative Council, also made
speeches at the plenary session.
</P>
<P>
As the Preparatory Committee has completed its tasks, its
secretariat and the secretariat's office in Hong Kong were to
close following the meeting, said Lu Ping, vice-chairman of the
Preparatory Committee, in a work report.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Calm After SFOR Raid on War Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- International representatives
today said Bosnia has been calm after the NATO-led Stablization
Force (SFOR) raided on two Serb war crime suspects on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication of problems in any part of the
country, ...the situation on the ground remains calm," SFOR
spokesman Major Chris Riley said.
</P>
<P>
In an operation coded "Tango," NATO troops stormed the
Serb-controlled town of Prijedor and captured Milan Kovacevic,
director of Prijedor hospital. Another suspect, former local
police chief Simo Drljaca, was shot dead while resisting the
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Both men were secretly indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal
for their alleged roles in genocide against non-Serbs in the
Prijedor region in 1992 and 1993 at the beginning of the 3
1/2-year war.
</P>
<P>
Riley said SFOR has deployed sufficient forces in the region
after the incident, to monitor the situation carefully and react
appropriately in any given circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the International Police Task Force, Alexander
Ivanko, said, "it is business as usual" for the U.N. police
monitors in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
But the envoys of U.N. High Commission and the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe said their staff members have
been advised to take certain precautions.
</P>
<P>
Riley said the "Tango" operation, the first of its kind carried
out by SFOR, did not mean any change of the forces' policy of not
hunting down war crime indictees.
</P>
<P>
The move was "in accordance with our original mandate and
policy," which included detaining suspects when "the tactic
situation permitted," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Step up Coop With Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Rwanda
today signed a declaration of intent aimed at strengthening
cooperation in the fileds of finance, trade and industry, energy,
education, security and defense matters.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, South African Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad told reporters in Pretoria that the visiting
Rwandan delegation led by Vice President Paul Kagame had
strengthened the already good relations between the two states.
</P>
<P>
The South African government would do everything possible to
ensure the declaration of intent was implemented, Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of South African arms sales to Rwanda,
Pahad said the departments concerned have been discussing the
problem, saying that a decision on this matter should be taken
shortly.
</P>
<P>
South Africa suspended its arms sale to Rwanda in November
last year pending the return of the stability to the central
African region. The decision was taken after indications that
Rwandan armed forces made cross-border incursions into former
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
At that time, South Africa said the suspension would be
reviewed once cross-border violations by Rwanda ceased and a clear
understanding emerged that its armed forces were using weapons
for self-defense only.
</P>
<P>
Pahad pointed out that Rwanda had become in a position to
protect itself.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda has to deal with the return of well over one million
refugees and the challenge to the government is tremendous. What
we have to look at is the need for the Rwandan government to be
able to protect its country, its sovereignty as well as the aid
agencies in Rwanda," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, the South African government
would shortly be providing Rwanda with more humanitarian
assistance.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes British Plan on Easing Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's (EU)
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler has given a cautious
welcome to new British proposals aimed at easing the world-wide
ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The British Agriculture Ministry on Tuesday committed itself to
a twin-track approach of modifying a scheme to allow cattle from
herds that have not suffered from the mad cow disease to be
certified safe for export and drawing up proposals to permit the
export of animals born after a certain date at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the British plan at a conference in Wales today,
Fischler said: "Although the devil always tends to be in the
detail, this idea seems, on the face of it, to have the merit of
simplicity."
</P>
<P>
Fischler noted that important progress had also been made in
examining Britain's request for exports from certified herds,
saying "We shall then have to see whether on a scientific level
the scheme can be given a green light."
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, all the practical aspects of a staged lifting of
the ban need to be examined thoroughly by the scientific experts.
This takes time," he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef exports in March
1996 when British government admitted possible links between mad
cow disease and its human equivalent Creutzdfeldt Jacob Disease.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Foresees Bumper Harvest for Winter Wheat, Soybeans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Agriculture Department
forecast today a bumper harvest of winter wheat and soybeans this
year.
</P>
<P>
The department's forecast for winter wheat output of some 1.78
billion bushels, up 11 percent from last month's prediction, is
driven by record yield of 42.8 bushels (about 1,166 kilograms) per
acre, 5.6 bushels (153 kilograms) per acre better than 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, spring-planted wheat production nationwide is
estimated at 569 million bushels (15 million metric tons), down 17
percent from 1996. Durum wheat, which is used to make pasta, is
forecast at 80.9 million bushels (2.2 million tons), a 30
percent drop from last year.
</P>
<P>
Overall wheat production is estimated at 2.43 billion bushels
(66.2 million tons), a seven percent increase from 1996, and total
yield is forecast at 38 bushels (1.035 tons) an acre. Prices are
projected at between 3.10 and 3.70 U.S. dollars a bushel, which is
equivalent to some 27.24 kilograms for wheat, down significantly
from last year.
</P>
<P>
Production of oilseeds, the majority of which are soybeans, was
estimated at a record 83.2 million tons, an 11 percent increase
over last year. Soybean plantings this spring totaled 70.9 million
acres, the highest in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
The soybean output is expected to reach 2.7 billion bushels
(about 73.5 million tons), up from 2.4 billion bushels (65.3
million tons) last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase, prices are expected to hold steady at
between 5.40 and 6.60 dollars a bushel, which is equivalent to
about 27.216 kilometers for soybean.
</P>
<P>
The nation's corn crop is projected at 9.7 billion bushels
(about 246.6 million tons), a reduction of 140 million bushels
(3.56 million tons) from last month's forecast in view of the less
planted acres in corn than originally projected this spring.
</P>
<P>
The corn price is estimated an average of five cents a bushel
higher this year to between 2.30 and 2.70 dollars a bushel, which
is about 25.42 kilometers for corn.
</P>
<P>
The cotton harvest is expected to reach 18 million bales (about
3.9 million tons), down almost one million bales (218,000 tons)
from 1996.

<P>
LUANDA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The South Command Headquarters
today accused the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) of deploying 3,500 fighters in the southern
province of Huila, attacking civilians there.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan News Agency quoted press officer Joao Carvalho as
telling newsmen in Lubango that the fighters have come from the
amassing zone in the province set up by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA men, led by two generals, are marching on some towns
of the province and their motive is not known, said Carvacho.
</P>
<P>
He accused UNITA of using some military bases in the province
once again.
</P>
<P>
Carvacho claimed that UNITA has taken military action
recently, shelling government positions twice, ambushing cars,
mounting raids on villages on three occasions and disrupting
transport.
</P>
<P>
The last attack on a village on Tuesday resulted in 14
villagers killed, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On its part, UNITA accused government troops of breaking
agreements and launching attacks on its positions in the
northeastern diamond-mining area, saying the Angolan peace
process is in danger.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Further Rise in Rates Causes Anger Among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England's decision to
raise quarter-point interest rate has been greeted with anger and
disappointment by British industrialists and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The Bank raised the rates yesterday, which was the third rise
in three months prompting them to blame Gordon Brown, the
chancellor, for letting consumers off too lightly in last week's
Budget.
</P>
<P>
The monetary policy committee which enjoys "operational
independence" to set interest rates, said it had raised rates
because the economy could not sustain growth at well above its
long-term trend rate.
</P>
<P>
It also conceded that "the combination of rapid expansion of
domestic demand led by consumption and the further appreciation of
sterling has sharpened the dilemma for monetary policy".
</P>
<P>
City economists believe that consumer spending is being driven
by growth in personal incomes, which are being boosted by
"windfalls" from building society flotations.
</P>
<P>
Business groups said rising interest rates were further
boosting the value of the pound and harming their export
prospects.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the Budget
earlier this month should have been tougher on consumer spending,
to reduce the need for the Bank to tighten interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
"Last week's Budget did not do enough to offset the immediate
inflation pressure," said Adair Turner, the CBI director general.
</P>
<P>
"But we would stress that further interest rate rises in the
short-term would be unwelcome. The weakness of prospective EMU
currencies, and higher UK interest rates, have pushed Sterling up
to have a severe impact on UK exporters," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ian Peters, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce, warned that further rate rises might be needed.
</P>
<P>
Attacking the Budget as one "in which political expediency took
precedence over the country's economic well-being", Peter said
more rises would cause more cuts in export earnings, and damage
investment and jobs.
</P>
<P>
In the face of criticism of both the interest rate move and the
shortcomings of last week's Budget, the Chancellor and the Bank of
England expressed their mutual support.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Brown blamed the need for a third-rate increase on the
failure of the previous government to act fast enough to control
the economy.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the measures I have taken and the measures
taken by the Bank of England are necessary measures to restore
balance to an economy that was in danger of becoming seriously out
of balance as a result of the mistakes of the previous
government." he told the Commons.
</P>
<P>
Heolen Liddell, the Economic Secretary, also said that the
strength of the pound was the fault of the Tories' loose monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
"We are very conscious of the impact of the failure to act on
the part of the previous government on the strength of the pound,"
she said, "and indeed we are very conscious of the impact that has
on exports."
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed that the continued rise of the pound is
putting unremitting pressure on Britain's export performances.
</P>
<P>
City economists argue that it is a far cry from the early
1990s, when Britain's exports soared after the pound's 16 percent
fall in the wake of its 1992 exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
With the global economy recovering from recession, UK export
volumes jumped 10.8 percent in 1994, followed by increases of 7.3
percent and 6.7 percent respectively in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, it is becoming increasingly evident that some of those
companies that dived into exports three years ago can no longer
compete in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Exporters had hoped the new Labor government would heed their
cries for help more than the Tories. But they were disappointed in
the Budget, which did little to tighten the economy and so left it
to the Bank of England to damp growth by raising interest rates.

<HEADLINE> BBC Announces Investment in News Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The BBC announced an investment of
15 million pounds (24 million US dollars) in news-gathering here
today -- an increase of more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move is a further step towards realising the company's
recent pledge to become a world player in the global news market
with a distinctive range of high quality services.
</P>
<P>
The investment will come from substantial savings in production
costs. These are the result of the exploitation of new technology
and the merging of previously separate news organizations for
radio, television and World Service.
</P>
<P>
Until now, 60 percent of the BBC's journalists were engaged in
production. The changes mean that this will be reversed so that 60
percent are out in the field, gathering news, according to the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined that BBC News will stand head and shoulders
above the competition when it comes to making sense of the complex
world we live in," said Tony Hall, the BBC News Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
Following the unification of BBC News on April 1 this year,
Tony Hall now leads the largest news organization in the world
with 50 bureaus and some 2,000 journalists.
</P>
<P>
BBC World reaches 50 million television homes in 175 countries
and areas. This autumn BBC News will launch a round-the-clock news
channel for the UK and a Internet news service bringing the total
number of BBC News channels to twelve.

<HEADLINE> First African Governance Forum Opens in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The U. N. Economic Commission
for Africa (ECA) and the U. N. Development Program (UNDP) held
the first forum here today to discuss Africa's Governance.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session, K.Y. Amoako, ECA Executive
Secretary who is also U.N. Under Secretary General, said this
conference is part of the U. N. system-wide special initiative on
Africa.
</P>
<P>
''The special initiative is a 10-year plan launched by the
U.N. in March 1996 to coordinate, leverage and consolidate the
work of U.N. agencies, including the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, in Africa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Amoako said, an important feature of this initiative is the
promotion of governance, adding that the governance program
includes activities designed to help African nations expand their
transparent, reliable, and effective governance, establish a
capacity to contribute to national development, which includes
peace-building.
</P>
<P>
In his address, OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim
stressed that ''Africa is clearly committed to promoting
democracy good governance and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
He recalled that African leaders adopted in 1990 the ''African
charter for popular participation in development and
transformation'', recognizing the imperative need ''to put in
place of strengthened measures intended to support and sustain
efforts toward the building of good governance in Africa''.
</P>
<P>
The ECA chief told the participants that ''it is important to
promote and support dialogue between and among all groups, be
they ethnic, religious, or regional'', adding, ''this is a
prerequisite for building democracy and good governance,
particularly in our African countries which are characterized by
their ethnic and cultural diversities.''
</P>
<P>
He hoped African leaders to ''continue to place national
interest before self or group interest'', saying that ''power
must not be seen as an end in itself, but rather as a means to
promote the wider interests of the people.''
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian speaker of the house of people's representatives
Dawit Yohannes said at the session that ''the struggle to build a
prosperous and democratic society in Ethiopia, as indeed
everywhere in africa, has barely begun and a long and difficult
journey lies ahead of us all.''
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to learn from each other's experience on
good governance.
</P>
<P>
In his special message to the forum, U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan described ''good governance'' as ''one of the
conditions for sustainable development''.
</P>
<P>
''We Africans have over the last decades paid a high price for
the absence of good governance in many parts of the continent,''
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Annan concluded that the establishment of this forum ''is an
auspicious testament to the desire for a better, more prosperous
future for all of afirca's people''.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is chaired by the ECA Executive Secretary
and UNDP Administrator James Gustave Speth and attended by most
African countries and a number of U.N. agencies.

<HEADLINE> UK Financial Services' Overseas Earnings Reach 22.7bn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Net overseas earnings by the
British financial services sector increased almost ten percent
last year to a record 22.7 billion pounds (37.7 billion US
dollars), according to a survey published today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by British Invisibles, the private sector
body which promotes services exports, said that the record
overseas earnings provided a huge boost to Britain's balance of
payments last year.
</P>
<P>
The main contribution came from investment income, which
increased by 1.8 billion pounds to 9.8 billion pounds and now
accounts for 43 percent of total overseas income.
</P>
<P>
Then comes the banking sector, with its net overseas earnings
rising from 5.9 billion pounds (9.8 billion US dollars) in 1995 to
7.1 billion pounds (11.8 billion US dollars) last year, which is
slightly higher than the previous record of 7.05 billion pounds
recorded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Securities dealers also enjoyed a strong performance, with
overseas earnings rising 432 million pounds to 2.19 billion
pounds.
</P>
<P>
Commodity traders, bullion dealers and money market brokers'
earnings reached a new record, up 16 percent from 1995 to 776
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
However, the insurance sector fell back from 1995's record of
6.9 billion pounds to 6.1 billion pounds last year, mainly because
a big drop in the overseas earnings of Lloyd's, which fell from
1.6 billion pounds to 508 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
The survey pointed out that "further growth in its overseas
earnings reflects the consolidation and strengthening of London's
leading position in many financial markets."

<HEADLINE> World Gold Prices Forecast to Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- World gold prices would continue to
fall although they have consolidated slightly in the past few
days, according to a report in today's Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
The report said that following the big drop of gold prices
triggered by news last week that Australia's central bank had sold
two-thirds of its reserves, the gold market remains tense with
more weakness to come.
</P>
<P>
The main reason, according to the report, is a profound change
of heart among central banks over how they view gold.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the US Federal Reserve Bank issued a
recent technical discussion paper which concluded that governments
have no need to hold gold as part of their foreign exchange
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The report cited one gold consultants as estimating that if
most countries were to cut their holdings of gold to 10 percent,
that would release 618 million troy ounce on to the market, which
is almost the same as eight years' new mine supply.
</P>
<P>
If this happens in the gold market, the price will certainly
plunge, the report argues.

<HEADLINE> True Story Behind Gold Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Gold price has fallen about 50
U.S. dollars an ounce so far this year to about 320 U.S. dollars,
and experts are busy looking for stories behind the gold plunge.
</P>
<P>
The mostly talked reason is a huge gold sale by Australia. The
Reserve Bank of Australia said July 3 that it had sold 167 metric
tons of its gold bullion reserves, according to a report of the
Investor Business Daily today. That's two-thirds of its holdings,
amounting to 5.37 million ounces, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The sale renewed worries that central banks around the world
will unload the metal, forcing down prices further, it said.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts said the Australian sale isn't such a big
deal. There were old sales, for forward delivery, according to one
analyst. The Australia deal calls for delivery between June and
September.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the sale wasn't a signal that a fresh deluge
of central bank sales was imminent. Australian gold reserves
stood at 19 percent of its foreign exchange reserves before the
sale. The average among central banks runs from 5 percent to 8
percent. So Australia's gold holdings were heavy, and the sale
brought it in line with the norm, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Australia, the Netherlands early this year announced it
sold 300 tons last year, and Belgium sold 200 tons last year.
Central banks in Portugal and Greece also sold modest amounts of
their gold holdings.
</P>
<P>
But the Group-7 countries have been careful in selling or
leasing gold. They do not want to destabilize the market,
according to the report. Some of those central banks have special
rules regarding the gold selling.
</P>
<P>
There is no need to be panic about the gold selling over the
past year, during which gold price has kept on falling, according
to analysts. Since the G-7 countries have not joined the game and
the demand surge is coming from emerging markets, gold price is
not likely to plunge too much, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says It Will Meet Budget Target for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
said today that Germany will meet the strict budgetary target
required for joining the single European currency, the Euro,
despite its financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Waigel told reporters in Bonn that Germany's public sector
deficit would add up to 110 billion marks (63 billion U.S.
dollars) this year, or 3.0 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
That would put Germany in line with the budgetary rule of the
European Union's Maastricht treaty which requires countries
wishing to join the Euro to bring budget deficit to three percent
or less of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The EU is targeting to launch the Euro on January 1, 1999.
Earlier next year, countries will be selected to join the club
based on their 1997 economic data, with the budgetary target as
the key benchmark.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Athletes Blocked to Attend Beirut Pan-Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi athletes were prevented
today from entering Lebanon to participate in the eighth Pan-Arab
Games that will open here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of the Iraqi delegation comprising 97
athletes, officials and journalists, arrived at the Masnaa
crossing between Lebanon and Syria earlier this morning and was
made to wait there throughout the daytime for the entry.
</P>
<P>
The delegation threatened to stage a protest on the border.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Central News Agency reported that the Lebanese
authorities concerned banned members of the Iraqi delegation from
entering the country after Lebanon had refused to give them visas,
putting the Iraqis in a dilemma at the cross, some 75 kilometers
east of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
</P>
<P>
No reports on official version of the entry refusal are
available.
</P>
<P>
The games is to be opened by Lebanese President Elias Hrawi at
8:30 p.m. local time (17:30 GMT) Saturday in the presence of
Esmat-Abdul Meguid, secretary general of the Arab League (AL), and
Juan Antonio Samaranch, chairman of the International Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Asil Tabr, deputy chairman of the Iraqi Olympic Committee and
head of the Iraqi delegation, announced that he will organize a
sit-in in protest at the Lebanese position and said that he
felt sorry for the incident.
</P>
<P>
He stressed he was waiting for an official notification from
the Lebanese authorities on their refusal of his team's entry,
asserting that the Iraqi delegation was not satisfied with the
refusal.
</P>
<P>
"We came here at invitations to us from the Arab League, the
Lebanese ministry of youth and sports as well as the organizing
committee of the games," the Iraqi official noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that a second batch of the Iraqi delegation
consisting of 22 persons is scheduled to arrive in Beirut Sunday
and the last group of 25 persons will reach here next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi athletes will take part in 13 events if they are
allowed to enter Lebanon, he added.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony is to be held in the Beirut Sports City
Stadium, the reconstruction of which was funded by Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia. The two donor countries have repeatedly requested
to keep out the the Iraqis from the games.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahd Al-Sabah, head of the Kuwaiti Olympic
Committee, whose father was killed in the 1990-91 Gulf War to end
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, had warned that if Iraq attended the
games, the emirate's 227-member delegation would boycott the
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Beirut Thursday, Meguid said that he had
consulted a few days before with the Lebanese government, hoping
to win an approval on Iraq's admission to the games.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we remain captives of the polarization that
resulted from the Gulf War," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis also were not invited to the 7th Arab Games in
Syria in 1992. This time, the Al did not exclude Iraq from its
general invitations to its 22 members, which Baghdad sees it as
its right to take part.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to suspend its
diplomatic relations with Sao Tome and Principe as of July 11
because the latter "established diplomatic ties" with the Taiwan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The charge d'affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Sao
Tome and Principe, Yang Naiqian, made serious representations in
Sao Tome on July 11 to Sao Tome and Principe on the issue of Sao
Tome and Principe "establishing diplomatic ties" with the Taiwan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed out that Sao Tome and Principe's such act goes
against the relevant principles laid down in the joint communique
on establishing diplomatic relations between China and Sao Tome
and Principe and against the solemn commitment made by Sao Tome
and Principe on "recognizing the government of the People's
Republic of China as the sole legal government representing all
Chinese people." Such act has brought serious damage to the
foundation for friendly relations and cooperation between the two
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the government of the People's Republic of China
therefore had lodged a strong protest against the Democratic
Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and decided to suspend its
diplomatic relations with Sao Tome and Principe as of July 11. The
implementation of all agreements between the two governments would
stop immediately, yang added.

regions where population clubs have been established.
</P>
<P>
"Today, not only are population offices established in all
regions, but population programs that are based on the objective
local conditions and needs have been drawn and are under
implementation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the second largest population country in
sub-Saharan Africa with a population of 55 million. The annual
growth rate was about three percent in recent years. The
Ethiopian goveent launched a national population policy in

<HEADLINE> UN Reports Massacres and Violences in East Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Many innocent civilians,
particularly children, women and the elderly were killed and
wounded during the indiscriminate attacks on refugee camps in
eastern Zaire, according to a UN report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The report of the joint mission charged with investigating
allegations of massacres and other human rights violations
occurring in eastern Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo) was
transmitted by the UN Secretary-General to the General Assembly on
July 2.
</P>
<P>
The report said that savage attacks were launched early on in
the war against the camps housing both Rwandan and Burundi
refugees at Uvira on October 22 and 23; Bukavu on October 29 and
the following days; Goma on November 3 and on the outskirts of
these towns. There were also attacks on the Shabunda camp in
mid-January 1997 and the Tingi-Tingi and Amisi camps in February.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, the clashes and attacks were followed
by massacres of refugees and murders of non-combatant civilians,
almost all of whom were Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Of 1.2 million refugees who settled in Zaire in or after July
1994, 1.15 million were still in the refugee camps when the
conflict began in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the rebels and the attacks on the camps prompted
some 600,000 Rwandan and 100,000 Burundi refugees to return to
their countries at their own risk. By May 6, 183,000 refugees had
been repatriated to Rwanda by UNHCR. Some 120,000 refugees fled to
Kisangani, Ubandu and Masisi, and a further 2,100 took refuge in
Tanzania. There was no news of some 140,000 refugees hiding in the
forests or lying low in some locality.
</P>
<P>
The blockading of humanitarian assistance was a common
occurrence, particularly in the days immediately following the
conquest or "liberation" of an area. Lack of access to
humanitarian assistance had extremely serious consequences: the
mortality rate in the camps was between 5 and 25 deaths a day per
10,000 refugees, in at least one case, 89.5 deaths a day per
10,000 refugees, (in disaster situation, even a rate of one death
a day per 10,000 persons was considered excessive). Nearly half
the victims were children under the age of five.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission recommended to the Democratic Republic of
the Congo that it publicly condemn the atrocities described in the
report, put an immediate end ot the blockade of humanitarian
assistance intended for refugees and displaced persons, guarantee
the security and the right to life and physical integrity of
anyone in the territory, cooperate with the mission and ensure its
unimpeded access to the territory, promote the rule of law and
establish a genuine civil service.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission also recommended to the UN and the
international community that the Security Council could envisage
the immediate dispatch of military and/or police observers to
areas where there is little or no security; the necessary steps
should be taken to ensure that the investigation of massacres and
other human rights violations could be carried out in cooperation
with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Urges Indefinite Freeze of U.S Aid to Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Prince Norodom Ranariddh on
Friday urged the United States to indefinitely suspend its aid to
Cambodia beyond the 30 days as had been announced by the U.S.
State Department.
</P>
<P>
"I expressed my relative satisfaction for the stand made by the
U.S. administration to freeze aid for 30 days," the First Prime
Minister of Cambodia told reporters after his meeting with members
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "I think that 30 days
is not enough."
</P>
<P>
The State Department said on Thursday it would suspend aid
program to Cambodia for 30 days, and after a 30-day review, it
would resume the program of humanitarian aid. But the aid program
that directly or indirectly support the Cambodian government would
not be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh was ousted as the first prime minister by Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen after two days of fighting in Phnom Penh
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He started his international campaign at the United Nations not
to recognize any government formed by Hun Sen after driving him
out.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, who arrived in Washington on Friday seeking U.S.
support, told reporters that he found a "very positive" reception
in his meetings with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman
said his committee would do whatever they can to support
Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
The Senate panel also urged the Clinton administration to
condemn Hun Sen's action of ousting Ranariddh as a coup d'etat.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Introduce Value Added Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania Revenue Authority
(TRA) has decided to introduce Value Added Tax (VAT) in the
country, a government source said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Revenue Authority Commissioner General Mellkizerdeck
Sanare said at a one-day seminar today that the concept of
introducing VAT was initiated by the government several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"It is purely a government decision and had never been
pressurized by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as
claimed by some people", Sanare noted.
</P>
<P>
The VAT, which is self-policing and already established in the
neighboring east African states of Kenya and Uganda, is scheduled
to become effective on July 1, 1998 in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on bureaucratic procedures within the tax regime,
he said the TRA was taking proper measures to rectify the
shortfalls for speeding up tax collection and to create an
enabling environment to the tax payers.
</P>
<P>
"We want to ensure that tax payers are comfortable in paying
the tax," said Sanare.

<HEADLINE> German Cabinet Approves Budgets for 1997, 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
cabinet today approved a supplementary budget for 1997 and a 461
billion mark (265 billion U.S. dollar) draft budget for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the supplementary budget for 1997, the German government
would raise new borrowing to 71.2 billion marks (40.9 billion U.S.
dollars) from the 53.3 billion (30.6 billion dollars) envisaged at
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The total government expenditures for 1997 would total 458.6
billion (263.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under a separate draft budget for 1998, government expenditures
would increase by 0.5 percent to 461 billion marks (264.9 billion
dollars), but new borrowing would drop to 57.8 billion marks (33.2
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government on Friday also gave the long-awaited green
light for the controversial Eurofighter warplane project by
earmarking 850 million marks (488.5 million dollars) for its
funding in the 1998 budget. The Eurofighter jets are to be jointly
built by Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Both budgets as well as the Eurofighter spending will have to
be approved by parliament in September.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Government Stops New Borrowing, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has stopped
new borrowing for the first time in 25 years, issuing no new bonds
a year earlier than expected, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
The government has reached the point of no longer needing to
issue new debt to finance its operations, according to a report
released today by investment dealer Nesbitt Burns Inc..
</P>
<P>
Data from the Bank of Canada indicates that the Canadian
federal government has been running a financial requirement
surplus for the past two months.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has been talking about the looming shortage of new
bonds in Canada," Nesbitt's senior economist David Rosenberg was
quoted as saying by Canada's leading newspaper the Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
The federal deficit should be about 5 billion Canadian dollars
(3.6 billion USD) for the fiscal year that began April 1, compared
with the official prediction of 17 billion dollars' (12.4 billion
USD) shortfall.
</P>
<P>
This year's sudden pickup in Canada's consumer spending is the
most likely reason for the improved federal financial situation,
the economist noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the improved picture, the government will still have to
roll over a stock of existing bonds now valued at 304 billion
dollars (221 billion USD), the report noted.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Urges US Troops Pullout From Bosnia by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate strongly urged
but did not require the U.S. troops out of Bosnia by mid-1998,
making President Bill Clinton flexible on the peacekeeping
mission.
</P>
<P>
In a voice vote, the Senate passed a non-binding resolution
calling for a pull-out of some 8,000 U.S. troops from Bosnia by
June 30 next year as promised by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
"United States ground combat forces should not participate in a
follow-on force in Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 1998," the
amendment said, adding that Western European allies should be on
notice as of now that they will have to step in with a follow-up
force as necessary
</P>
<P>
The House has voted to cut off funds for the troops on June 30,
1998, despite the Clinton administration's arguments that a
mandatory date could threaten U.S. troops and their mission.
</P>
<P>
The House and Senate positions will have to be reconciled in a
conference
</P>
<P>
"We should send a message that our troops on the ground in
Bosnia should be out by next June," said Democratic Senator Carl
Levin, who proposed the resolution.
</P>
<P>
But he added, "We should do so in a way which will not
undermine the flexibility of our commanders in the field. The
funding cutoff was too rigid, too inflexible."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration had lobbied strenuously against a
sterner, binding proposal which would have cut off funds for the
deployment after next June.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Senate earlier this week, Defense Secretary
William Cohen and Chairman John Shalikashvili of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff expressed their opposition to a "statutorily mandated
withdrawal" of the U.S. forces by any specific date.
</P>
<P>
They said that a cut-off date "would completely change the
dynamic on the ground and could undercut troop safety."
</P>
<P>
The House voted for a cut-off by June 30 as a majority of the
legislators argued that without a fixed date, the U.S. troops may
have to stay there longer.
</P>
<P>
The non-binding sense of the Senate amendment was part of a 268
billion U.S. dollar defense spending bill. The bill was approved
by the Senate with a vote of 94-4.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Population Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's population was estimated
to have risen from 21.4 million in 1989 to 27.5 million in 1995,
local press reported today when Kenyan Vice President George
Saitoti presided over the celebrations marking the World
Population Day.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya's population growth rate declined from 3.8
percent in 1979 to 3.3 percent in 1989 and further to about three
percent in 1995 due to improved health and economic status, said
the reports.
</P>
<P>
At the celebrations held here, the Kenyan vice president
launched Kenyan family planning projects, logos, as well as the
National Information, Education and Communication (IEC) advocacy
strategy for sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The total fertility rate in the eastern African country was
7.7 children per woman in 1984 but declined to 6.7 in 1989 and
5.4 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The level of mortality in Kenya declined steadily during the
four decades prior to 1989. Infant mortality declined from 184
deaths per 1000 live births in 1948 to 62 deaths in 1989,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy increased from 39 years to 60 years in 1989 in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 percent of Kenyans are under the age of 15 by middle
1995.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is the first country in sub-Sahara region officially
adopting the national family planning policy in 1967.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- World software giant Microsoft
Corp. is researching how to incorporate Java technology into its
office software, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company is doing so just in case the new programming
language soars in popularity and threatens its software dominance,
according to a senior Microsoft official.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has consistently denied rumors that it is developing
a Java-based version of its office software.
</P>
<P>
Frank Glegg, Microsoft vice-president for Canada and the
central United States, said at the Comdex Canada computer show
that he would be "astonished" if his company was not examining how
to create Java-based office software.
</P>
<P>
Such study would allow Microsoft to decide whether to proceed
with a full-blown development of Java-based office software, the
official noted.
</P>
<P>
"I've got to believe somebody's looking at it," he was quoted
by the Globe and Mail newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Any early Microsoft move to introduce Java software would be a
severe blow to Canada's Corel Corp.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa-based software maker is hoping that its head start
in Java-based office software will help it pry customers away from
its archrival Microsoft.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun Adopted New Elephant Management Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A national elephant management
plan has been drawn up and adopted in Cameroun, aimed at curbing
the persistent conflict between the elephant and man, local paper
"Cameroun Tribune" reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the plan was set at a two-day
workshop which ended last week in Mbalmayo of Central Province.
</P>
<P>
During the workshop, participants held discussions and made an
important decision to draw up the new elephant management plan
that gives a new status for the largest living mammal and curbs
the persistent conflict between the elephant and man.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the management plan, a national action plan was
therefore drawn up following a number of strategies: the
collection of information on the species, improvement of
protection methods, and increase in revenue from elephant use.
Above all, human-elephant conflicts will be reduced to the barest
minimum.
</P>
<P>
The elephant population in Cameroun's three national parks is
estimated at 1,260 heads and about 360 elephants live out of
these protected areas.
</P>
<P>
The participants took their decisions within a backdrop of the
adverse situation of the sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
They expressed regret over that after some industrialized
nations have suspended the importation of ivory from Cameroun,
the issue of elephant trophy hunts still threatens the existence
of the animal species.
</P>
<P>
Other handicaps, including change in hydrological conditions
especially in the northern parts of the country leading to
elephant movements and conflict with the population, were also
discussed at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 experts and environmentalists from Cameroun's
non-governmental organizations and the Ministry of Environment
and Forest attended the two-day workshop which was sponsored by
the World Wild Fund for Nature (WWF).

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
today urged flexibility of both sides of the Mideast peace
process, especially Israelis within the signed agreements to tide
over the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here that the stalemate in the peace
process, which was resulted from Israel's hardline policy and
aggravated by the construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem three months ago, can undermine the future of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, making a stopover here on way to Algiers for the
Mediterranean Forum meeting, singled out the stiffness of the
peace process, disrespect of Palestinian rights and confiscation
of Palestinian lands as negative issues to the whole region.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt will continue to make efforts to attain a
balanced peaceful settlement and to close the file of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, one of the two Arab countries which have made peace with
Israel, now plays a major mediator's role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The peace we seek... is based on the principle of land for
peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
On a proposed Arab summit dedicated to the peace issue, he said
there exists a general desire for holding it and there is no
opposition to it, adding good preparations are needed so that it
may bring about the desired results.

<HEADLINE> US Official Meets Ranariddh on Cambodia Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Acting Secretary of State
Thomas Pickering today urged Cambodia's leaders to resolve their
political differences peacefully and to abide by the principles of
the Paris Peace Accords, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Pickering expressed to Prince Norodom Ranariddh "profound
concern" at the violence in Cambodia, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh arrived in Washington earlier today to seek support
from the United States after he was ousted as the first prime
minister by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen following several days
of fighting in the capital of Phnom Penh and other places.
</P>
<P>
Pickering reaffirmed the U.S. stand on Cambodia when he met
with Ranariddh at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
"Acting Secretary Pickering emphasized that the apparently
deliberate and planned use of force to overturn the results of the
1993 United Nations-sponsored elections in Cambodia was
unacceptable to the United States," spokesman Nicholas Burns said
at a briefing today.
</P>
<P>
"The principles of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords should be
upheld, and certainly, the ability of the political party of
Prince Ranariddh to play a role in Cambodia should be sustained
and should reflect the fact that the political party of Prince
Ranariddh won the most votes during the 1993 elections."
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States was opposed to having senior Khmer
Rouge leaders play any kind of a role in Cambodian politics, which
was responded by Ranariddh who said: "I have nothing to do with
the Khmer Rouge, and I will not bring them into position of
power."
</P>
<P>
Burns told reporters, "Needless to say, that is a welcome
commitment by Prince Ranariddh because we firmly oppose any
participation by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodian politics."
</P>
<P>
Burns called the meeting between Pickering and Ranariddh "a
good exchange of views" and said the United States welcomed
Ranariddih's statement on the Khmer Rouge.

<HEADLINE> Waigel: Germany Will Make Grade for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
said today that Germany will reduce its budget deficit enough by
the end of the year to qualify for the planned single European
currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Waigel told reporters in Bonn that the German government plans
to generate a 10 billion mark (5.7 billion U.S. dollar) profit
this year by selling part of its 74 percent stake in the telecom
giant, Deutsche Telecom AG. Some 1.5 billion marks (852 million
dollars) will also come from the sale of government holdings in
the German airline Lufthansa.
</P>
<P>
An additional 2 billion marks (1.1 billion dollars) has been
saved through spending cuts imposed by Waigel on all government
ministries earlier this year. Some 400 million marks (227 million
dollars) will be also raised this year by selling off part of
Germany's strategic crude oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
According to Waigel's projection, Germany's public sector
deficit at year-end would total 110 billion marks (63 billion
dollars), which would amount to 3 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
That would put Germany in line with the budgetary rule of the
European Union's Maastricht treaty which requires countries
wishing to join the Euro to bring the budget deficit to 3 percent
or less of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Economists in Germany however remain skeptical, saying that
Waigel's deficit forecast, which relies heavily on the one-time
sale of state assets and the optimistic assumption that the German
economy would grow by a robust 2.5 percent this year, had been
intended to keep pressure on other European countries for fiscal
discipline.
</P>
<P>
The EU is targeting to launch the Euro on January 1, 1999.
Early next year, countries will be selected to join the club based
on their 1997 economic data, with the budgetary target as the key
benchmark.

<HEADLINE> Dan Quayle to Decide on Presidential Bid in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Vice President Dan
Quayle said today he is considering a run for president in 2000,
but won't make his decision until after the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
"I have been traveling all over the country. I have a message
that I will continue to take to the American people," The
Associated Press quoted Quayle as saying in Cincinnati. "If there
is a reception for the message, to my ideas, then I obviously will
strongly consider it and make the decision in 1999, accordingly."
</P>
<P>
Quayle spoke at an Ohio Senate Republican Caucus fund-raising
breakfast. He said Republicans in Congress should debate the White
House more aggressively on budget priorities, without worrying
about whether the government occasionally shuts down for lack of
funding.
</P>
<P>
"Now, folks, let us return to the debate of the issues," he said.
