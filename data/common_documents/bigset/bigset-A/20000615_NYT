 &HT;    The American dream of the day laborer
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Jaime is a carpenter from Veracruz, working
during the week as a framer for a local builder. He's been here a
year, and his wife and two children still live in Mexico. Jaime
lives with a roommate in a tiny frame home down a pothole-pitted
dirt driveway on the south side of town. He's going back home in
November to visit his family, which he's obviously looking forward
to.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime knows a fair amount of English for having been here a
relatively short time. That, and my limited knowledge of Spanish,
make it possible for us to converse fairly extensively, though we
both hit pockets of no comprendo and have to move on to another
subject.
</P>
<P>
   I've hired Jaime on a Sunday morning for $6 an hour to clean out
flower beds and do other light yard work. Despite the light
drizzle, about a dozen Mexican men come heading toward my Jeep as I
pull into the day-labor area near downtown, jostling each other to
be first to the vehicle. I hold up a single finger _ one worker
only needed _ and Jaime wins the short footrace. The others trudge
back to where they can stay somewhat dry under the canopy of the
pecan trees, waiting for the next potential employer.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime loves the Jeep, points to the stick shift and says,
``Standard. That's good.'' in a thick accent. He doesn't have a car
yet, and when I try to ask if it's because he doesn't have a green
card _ tarjeta verde, I say in my pidgin Spanish _ he gets nervous,
especially when I say immigracion in an attempt to make him
understand what I'm asking. I'm just curious and have no intention
of turning him over to the INS. Time to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   I show him what to do and he gets to work, but the clouds decide
to open up. I offer him the option of quitting, but he takes the
poncho I dig out and works in the pouring rain while I go back to
building a chair out of black walnut in the woodshop.
</P>
<P>
   The rain slackens for a while, but then a real trash-hauler
ensues, and I tell Jaime to come in the shop and forget the flower
bed, which at this rate may be under water soon. I show him the
chair I'm building, and that sets him off talking about how houses
are constructed in Veracruz _ concrete blocks and adobe _ and about
his friend who was a master woodcarver in Mexico. Then he starts
talking about hurricanes and how wooden houses can't withstand the
wind, but a concrete-and adobe house will do just fine, even if
it's flooded.
</P>
<P>
   He's a talker, Jaime is, gesturing expansively as he walks
around the shop, admiring the tools and giving the Spanish names
for them _ torno for the lathe, for example, which makes eminent
sense. After all, a lathe turns wood. I tell him the English
equivalent, and he repeats the word several times, committing it to
memory.
</P>
<P>
   I hire day laborers a few times a year when I need someone to do
things I'm too old or lazy to do, or when I simply need a strong
back to help me. A few months ago I hired Davy to help me put in
some sod and move dirt around. He lives a few houses down from
Jaime and works during the week as an auto mechanic at a shop out
in the country. He was from near Monterrey, as I recall, with a
wife and two kids living here. While not quite as loquacious as
Jaime, Davy also showed an aptitude and desire to learn English,
worked hard with rare breaks, was unfailingly polite and
conscientious about doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other Mexican day laborers I've hired over the
years, young and middle-aged men who work on weekends to supplement
what they make during the week doing whatever it takes to get by _
working at poultry farms, fixing fences, cutting brush. Some work
harder than others, but all of them are doing jobs nobody else
seems willing to do. Unemployment in these parts, after all is next
to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   These men and women are trying to support families either here
or back home. The dream, if their families still live south of the
Rio Grande, is to eventually move them to America. To a man, each
one when asked has told me they love living in East Texas. They pay
taxes on their income, on what they buy and indirectly on the homes
they rent.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not the American dream, the guiding principle upon
which this country was founded, then what is?

 &HT;    Truths from days of old
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Ever wonder why a threshold is called that? Or
where ``dead ringer,'' ``graveyard shift'' or ``saved by the bell''
comes from?
</P>
<P>
   Nope? Me either. But friends who e-mail me on a regular basis
and have access to a wide range of useless information have shared
with me some little known facts from 14th century England.
</P>
<P>
   While these explanations seem to be perfectly logical, it make
was placed at the entry way, hence a ``thresh hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Those with money had plates made of pewter. Food with a high
acid content caused some of the lead to leach onto the food. This
happened most often with tomatoes, so they stopped eating tomatoes
_ for 400 years. Most people didn't have pewter plates, but had
trenchers _ a piece of wood with the middle scooped out like a
bowl. Trenchers were never washed and a lot of times worms got into
the wood. After eating off wormy trenchers, they would get ``trench
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bread was divided according to status. Workers got the burnt
bottom of the loaf, the family got the middle, and guests got the
top, or the ``upper crust.''
</P>
<P>
   England is old and small and they started running out of places
to bury people. So, they would dig up coffins and would take their
bones to a house and reuse the grave. In reopening these coffins,
one out of 25 coffins were found to have scratch marks on the
inside and they realized they had been burying people alive. So
they began to tie a string on their wrist and lead it through the
coffin and up through the ground and tie it to a bell. Someone
would have to sit out in the graveyard all night to listen for the
bell. Hence on the ``graveyard shift'' they would know that someone
was ``saved by the bell'' or he was a ``dead ringer.''

   TV-WEEKEND _ Phil Kloer's weekly TV viewing guide for the
weekend. Sunday is Father's Day and the conventional TV wisdom is
that the medium's portrayal of dads is a classic case of reverse
evolution, from Ward Cleaver to Homer Simpson _ Father Knows Best
to Father Knows Squat. There's some truth in that but there's more.
Actually, TV's portrayal of fathers today is richly diverse, from
loving, anxiety-riddled Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) on ``NYPD
Blue'' to struggling , deeply flawed Jake Manning (Jeffrey
Nordling(CQ)) on ``Once and Again.'' Ray Barone on ``Everybody
Loves Raymond'' is a weak but caring dad while Ken Titus on
``Titus'' is strong and uncaring. (Kloer, Atlanta

   TV-WEEKEND _ Phil Kloer's weekly TV viewing guide for the
weekend. Sunday is Father's Day and the conventional TV wisdom is
that the medium's portrayal of dads is a classic case of reverse
evolution, from Ward Cleaver to Homer Simpson _ Father Knows Best
to Father Knows Squat. There's some truth in that but there's more.
Actually, TV's portrayal of fathers today is richly diverse, from
loving, anxiety-riddled Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) on ``NYPD
Blue'' to struggling , deeply flawed Jake Manning (Jeffrey
Nordling(CQ)) on ``Once and Again.'' Ray Barone on ``Everybody
Loves Raymond'' is a weak but caring dad while Ken Titus on
``Titus'' is strong and uncaring. (Kloer, Atlanta

 &HT;    The show must go on without Gov. Bush
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON, Texas _ The rap from the Democrats nationally _
particularly the camp of Vice President Al Gore _ is that Texas
Gov. George W. Bush may not have the gear to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will have a chance to decide for themselves during the
election campaign this fall. But at least Bush is smart enough not
to appear at the Republican state convention here this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The official reason is that Bush is expected to carry the state
so easily in November that it makes no sense for him to waste
valuable time at the convention. He and the party are much better
off if he's campaigning in swing states, where his presence might
make the difference between winning and losing some electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   That said, it's also not unreasonable to suggest that Bush's
camp views an appearance before the Republican Party of Texas a bit
like legendary University of Texas football coach Darrell Royal
used to view the forward pass: When you throw the football, three
things can happen, and two of them are bad.
</P>
<P>
   During the state Democratic convention last week, some speakers
had fun with Bush's planned absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you notice,'' asked Democratic state Sen. Gonzalo
Barrientos of Austin, ``how during the presidential primaries there
was not a right-wing leader or institution anywhere in the country
that Gov. Bush did not visit and address?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that he needs to move to the middle, what is the first
far-right group he has declined to visit and address? That's right
_ the Texas Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party of Texas represented at the state
convention in recent years has been significantly more influenced
by religious conservatives than is the Republican Party at large,
and certainly more than the state and national electorate.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty easy for Barrientos _ and Bush _ to remember that
the Texas Republicans at their convention four years ago chose to
deny their governor the honor of heading the Texas delegation to
the national convention in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they picked party chairman Tom Pauken. Neither
Barrientos nor Bush have forgotten that Pauken wouldn't have been
party chairman, or the delegation chairman in 1996, without the
significant help of the party's religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to remember that the same bunch that year almost
denied Texas U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison the ability to attend
that national convention as a delegate because of her failure to
endorse the absolutist anti-abortion view the religious
conservatives have written into the party's platform.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the fact that Bush was re-elected with almost 70
percent of the vote in 1998, it's easy for the Bushies to remember
that some of those absolutists still showed up at Republican
precinct conventions this year and worked their way to the state
convention.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the game, Bush has lots of national media types
trailing him around _ though the crowd has thinned out a little,
for now, since the hot battle with John McCain in the primaries
ended early in March.
</P>
<P>
   Does it make sense now, when Bush is trying to appeal to a broad
national electorate, to go to an event where at least reporters
might ask him nasty questions such as why he thinks the platform
plank on abortion in his home state's Republican Party should
remain unchanged, even though he doesn't agree with it?
</P>
<P>
   Might he worry about being asked whether it made sense last year
to insist on a $1 billion property tax cut that few felt because of
rising property values rather than spend the money on education?
</P>
<P>
   Does Bush worry how he'd explain why he now says it was a good
thing to expand the number of Texas kids covered under the
Children's Health Insurance Program, when he wanted fewer kids
covered back when the Legislature was considering the issue?
</P>
<P>
   Bush probably would be warmly cheered at the convention. His
wife, Laura, is scheduled to appear, and she'll probably be warmly
cheered. It might have been completely harmless for Bush to go to
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But if you were George W. Bush, and you wanted to be president,
would you?

 &HT;    Proposed restrictions on legal abortion pill make no sense
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Terrorism, harassment, anti-choice policies. To
exercise her right to a politically charged medical option, a woman
can run a gauntlet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, add bureaucrats to the picket line?
</P>
<P>
   An important innovation is on the runway that can de-acidify
much anti-abortion vinegar in America and spoil some in-your-face
theatrics: early abortions without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   RU 486 _ mifepristone _ has worked safely for more than 500,000
European women in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. (Key point:
The drug has not increased the number of abortions in its home base
of France, only the percentage done without surgery, and early.)
</P>
<P>
   In February the Food and Drug Administration notified Danco
Laboratories, which plans to market the pill here, that final
approval was near.
</P>
<P>
   However, reports indicate the possibility of self-defeating FDA
conditions. Most troubling would be to allow only doctors certified
in surgical abortion to prescribe the abortion pill. Providers also
would be placed on a national registry.
</P>
<P>
   This would destroy one of the benefits of RU486, which is to
make it impossible for packs of proselytizers to know where
abortion happens.
</P>
<P>
   The only apparent medical reason for the FDA's proposed
regulation is that if the pill fails to work, surgical abortion
would be necessary and entrusted to the physician who prescribed
the drug. But that's a contingency for which a patient can be
referred.
</P>
<P>
   If this pill is safe as France has demonstrated and as the FDA
is set to pronounce, then any physician should be able to prescribe
it. And there is no more need for a registry of such providers than
there is for those who prescribe birth-control pills.
</P>
<P>
   SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS
</P>
<P>
   The FDA requirement effectively would mean no availibility in
regions that have few or no abortion providers. That problem
continues to get more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, between 1992 and
1996 the number of abortion providers fell 14 percent, to 2,042
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-six percent of American counties had no known abortion
provider at that point. One third of all women of reproductive age
live in these counties.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE IS THE TRAINING?
</P>
<P>
   Harassment, physical violence and threats aren't the only
factors contributing to the shortage of these physicians. Another
factor is that fewer and fewer medical schools are teaching the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of medical schools that train in obstetrics and
gynecology, only 12 percent routinely train in abortion techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how common it is for obstetricians to have to
perform medically necessary abortions, this is a serious deficiency
for which those who teach medicine need to answer.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000-member Medical Students for Choice has formed to
confront this, as well as the tendency for reproductive health to
get a short shrift from medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Anderson, executive director of the group, is critical
of the proposed FDA restrictions on who could prescribe RU 486.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense among physicians of, `I'd be willing to do
medical (non-surgical) abortion even if I don't do surgical
abortion,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under this proposal, that would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is a friend of reproductive rights in
every way _ with the president having supplied the slogan that
speaks for most Americans: ``Early, safe and rare.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``rare'' we make possible by assuring that contraception and
sex education are fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   The administration must not let someone's bureucratic zest
undermine this non-surgical means by which ``early'' and ``safe''
become fundamental as well _ more choice, fewer women running
someone's gauntlet.

ONLY THING `DEADLOCKED' IS THE LOGIC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use on or after June 18 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; `tonight' refers to June 18.) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since any disciplined explanation would kill this thing right
off the bat, ``Deadlocked'' dispenses with the dramaturgy. As the
film opens, a young African-American (Jo D. Jonz) is found guilty
of raping and murdering a high-society white woman, and his father
(Charles S. Dutton) takes the jury hostage, insisting the
prosecuting attorney (David Caruso) find exculpatory evidence in 24
hours, or there'll be a body count.
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course, given that the defendant hasn't spoken a word
to anyone since his arrest, your first move as someone charged with
freeing a convicted killer would be to get his story. But of
course, that would be too easy. So ``Deadlocked'' lopes through its
motions in the usual fashion _ dramatically charged but logically
leaden, with gratuitously seamy flashbacks _ before its
all-too-predictable finale. And both Dutton's and Caruso's
characters get time to bond meaningfully, schematically and
allegedly touchingly with their sons before the final reel's
pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton imbues his character with far more conviction than you
might imagine (he seems to honestly believe that the film really
is, as it somewhat cavalierly posits, about how the wealthy can buy
justice and the poor can't buy anything but misery). Caruso isn't
bad, but carries a certain actorlike swagger in his performance.
``Deadlocked'' moves serviceably, but it should come with a caveat:
No thinking allowed. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The show: ``Deadlocked.'' &QL; 
What: Courtroom thriller in which a father kidnaps the jury that
convicted his son of murder. &QL; 
The stars: David Caruso, Charles S. Dutton, Jo D. Jonz. &QL; 
Where: TNT. &QL; 
When: 8, 10 and midnight tonight; also Monday, Tuesday, Saturday

WHEN GIVING TIES, DON'T FORGET THE BOW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use after June 18 by by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: goes with men's tie feature) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We don't normally refer to bow-tie wearers as wild men, but
among tie guys, that's what they are. Nobody will blink if you wear
one to a formal occasion with a tuxedo. But strap on a bow tie
during daylight hours and you're pretty much guaranteed to have
people think you're an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 million to 200 million ties sold in the United States
each year, approximately 3 to 5 percent are bow ties, according to
market research conducted by Beau Ties Ltd. of Vermont, a
specialist in bow ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who wear them are generally a little more on the
individualistic side, a step or two out of the mainstream,'' says
Gerald Andersen, executive director of the Neckwear Association of
America. ``A major inhibiting factor to their sale is that most men
don't know how to tie them.''
</P>
<P>
   The bow tie seems to be most popular with university professors,
lawyers and judges. Pediatricians sometimes favor bow ties since a
young patient can't grab them by the tie if it's way up there on
the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts insist that even though the bow tie is smaller than
a typical four-in-hand, it can be made to look quite decorative.
Beau Ties Ltd. sells 150 different styles of bow ties, more than
you'll find in any menswear store in existence, says company
president Bill Kenerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're dedicated to wearing them, you'll find your own
source,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kenerson's grandfather was an avid bow-tie wearer. When the
younger Kenerson got a job on an assembly line, he tried one of his
grandfather's relics for safety. He's been wearing them ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I got razzed for wearing a bow tie _ and that was
enough for me to continue wearing them,'' Kenerson said. ``I don't
even have a four-in-hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the more celebrated bow-tie wearers: President Harry
Truman, Winston Churchill, Orville Redenbacher and Louis
Farrakhan. &QL;

IS `NO NOOSE' GOOD NEWS?

<P>
   You can bet neckwear manufacturers everywhere breathed a
collective sigh of relief when some wardrobe consultant decided
Regis Philbin didn't need to go for the casual look in his hosting
duties for the phenomenally successful ABC show ``Who Wants to be a
Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   No sweaters or priest collars for Reege. Instead, his choice of
wardrobe practically guaranteed that children everywhere would have
a new spin on the traditional Father's Day gift option at their
fingertips. Pardon me, Mr. Department Store menswear specialist, I
want the ``Regis Look'' for my dad.
</P>
<P>
   Right this way, young sir or miss. You'll need a colored shirt,
and, of course, a matching single-toned satin ...
</P>
<P>
   Necktie.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the tie, aka the cravat, ascot, foulard _ known
colloquially as a noose or arrow. Once a mark of military
distinction and forever the bane of casual dressers and young
children (``Aw, do I !ital!have to wear one?''). The centuries-old
device, always more decorative than practical, has seen its
popularity wane with the rise of business casual attire and young
entrepreneurs who won't work for a company that forces them to
cinch themselves on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   But as unpopular as ties might seem, they never go away. In
fact, manufacturers say despite the business casual trend, the tie
remains a popular item.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Blame shifting fashion trends. And these days, blame Regis
(whose neckwear, by the way, is manufactured by Philips-Van Heusen
and sold at Macy's).
</P>
<P>
   ``Regis has had an effect. He has made people think about
neckties as a way of dressing up,'' says Stuart Nifoussi, publisher
of Men's Retailer (MR) magazine. ``What we're seeing is necktie
sales have been stagnant. Now they're starting to move up again.
People are investing in better neckwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, it's probably more appropriate than ever to buy
your father a tie, since they probably won't get as many as the
year before,'' Nifoussi added. ``The average casual man's tie
wardrobe is probably getting pretty old.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're looking for a useful Father's Day gift, go
with a razor or something for the tool box. Long gone are the days
when the necktie, regardless of its material, served any function.
We don't use them as neck-warming devices anymore, and, despite the
popularity of ``ham and eggs'' models in the 1940s _ that
supposedly guaranteed spills wouldn't be noticed _ there are
certainly more effective napkins than a $150 Hermes purchased in
Beverly Hills. Besides, most men simply don't like to wear ties,
finding them uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   So why a tie? Who invented it, and for what reason? There are
about as many theories as there are knots, and many seem to
contradict each other. If, as psychologists claim, the male species
is more inclined to blend in than stand out, why on earth would he
stick a vertical line down the center of his chest with the tip
pointing arrowlike to the genitals?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because as decoration goes, the tie is the man's only
option. Women have jewelry, various types of head gear and scarves;
men have ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only wardrobe accessory men have,'' says Gerald
Andersen, executive director of the Neckwear Association of America
in New York. ``It's what makes that blue or gray shirt look
different from the last time you wore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is its front-and-center placement accidental, says Andersen.
Long before they started fussing with Windsor knots or ruffles, men
looked for ways to draw attention to their chests. The tie is just
a logical extension of ceremonial beads, tattoos, war paint and
scars. Apes scare each other off by pounding their chests; human
beings break out a showier power tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tie is a showcase window, drawing the eye to that area,''
says Anderson ``and it has always been fraught with masculine
symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   But why make such a symbol so blasted uncomfortable, wonders
Christopher Morganstern, curator of the Judith Tamkin Fashion
Center at Woodbury University in Burbank. Why not a badge, or
something that doesn't have the power to strangle you?
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you very subservient and vulnerable,'' said
Morganstern, whose collection at Woodbury includes more than 1,000
pieces of vintage clothing, including several boxes full of ties.
``If somebody grabbed you by the tie, they could literally strangle
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Morganstern compares the tie to the woman's high-heeled shoe, an
item that wouldn't save any woman in the event of an attack. The
tie, instead of being an item of power, is a self-regulating
device.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called civilization,'' Morganstern says. ``Civilization
is all about restricting those impulses. It's the same reason we
don't carry swords and guns to restaurants and start cutting each
other up. The civilizing impulses strip men of the possibility of
being violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Tie lore has it that the first male neckwear to serve as a means
of identification occurred in the early part of the 17th century,
when Louis IV of France adopted the decorative silk scarves worn by
Croatian mercenaries. The term ``cravat'' supposedly derived from
the French word for ``Croat.'' By the time of the French Revolution
a century and a half later, neckwear had taken on a political
significance as Republicans wore large colored neckcloths _
fittingly called ``incroyables'' _ to proclaim their allegiance. It
eventually made its way to England, enjoying great popularity in
the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The tie as we know it evolved in the 1920s, known as a
``four-in-hand'' because the knot approximates the knotted reins
used by a coach driver to control a team of horses. American tie
manufacturer Jesse Langsdorf patented the all-weather, wrinkle-free
tie. Langsdorf cut against the thread to achieve the maximum
stretch effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research I did shows that neckties for business were worn
during the industrial revolution when managers wanted to set
themselves apart from their workers, give themselves a little more
authority,'' says Sherry Maysonave, author of ``Casual Power: How
to Power Up Your Nonverbal Communication and Dress Down for
Success.'' ``It's a vertical shape, that adds that touch of power
to the man, and allows him to have some color.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 20th century, the tie has seen its appearance
widen, shrink and widen again, often to coincide with the shifting
sizes of coat lapels and shirt collars. We've gone from the 5-inch
``belly warmers'' of the 1940s to the skinny slim-Jims of the
1950s, from the '80s power tie to the limited-edition Nicole Miller
designs and the constant knock-offs.
</P>
<P>
   As designers continue to demonstrate, you can put absolutely any
motif on a tie _ your school colors or military regiment to a
repeated pattern that associates you with a specific club or
organization. Feeling more whimsical? How about dental X-rays,
Betty Boop, the logo of your favorite sports team or a single big
old ugly trout? In the 1940s, surrealist Salvador Dali put his
melting clocks on a line of ties. Forty years later, Grateful Dead
frontman Jerry Garcia got into the act, creating colorful
art-inspired ties. During the 1992 presidential race, candidates
Bill Clinton and Al Gore donned Garcia ties on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Think you know what will be hot next? Get out there and slap it
together. You might be surprised at what catches on with the
clothes-buying public.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had that big explosion of floral ties in the late '80s
and early '90s, that's one I wouldn't have predicted,'' said
Michael Jacobs, president of Jacobs &AMP; Roberts tie manufacturers in
Los Angeles. ``Even now, that solid satin that Regis Philbin is
wearing, that also would have been difficult to predict.'' &QL;

COOL RAWLS, HOT JAZZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   Long known as the personification of cool, velvety crooner Lou
Rawls can make a love song simmer with barely restrained passion.
</P>
<P>
   Rawls says his sauve style evolved naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to Nat Cole, Billy Eckstine and, of course,
Sinatra. I think the primary thing about them that was so
attractive was you always understood what they were singing, their
diction. That influenced me. I've heard a lot of records and I
don't always know what they're actually singing.''
</P>
<P>
   None other than Sinatra once said Rawls has the ``classiest
singing and silkiest chops in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on Chicago's South Side, Rawls began singing in his church
choir at the age of 7. Inspired by doo-wop, gospel, jazz, blues and
r&AMP;b, the singer moved to Los Angeles where he signed with Capitol
and issued 20 records in the '60s alone.
</P>
<P>
   Famous for such soulful pop-r&AMP;b smashes as ``You'll Never Find
Another Love Like Mine,'' ``Love is a Hurtin' Thing,'' ``Dead End
Street,'' ``Your Good Thing (Is About to End)'' and ``A Natural
Man,'' Rawls brings a sophisticated and jazzy delivery to soul
music.
</P>
<P>
   Rawls, 64, headlines the second day of the 22nd annual Playboy
Jazz Festival today at the Hollywood Bowl. With a career that spans
four decades, numerous gold and platinum records and 13 Grammy
nominations, those in the stands will no doubt be excited to hear
Rawls and his five-piece band perform many of the hits that made
him famous.
</P>
<P>
   He is proud of his choice of stellar session musicians who often
back him on his albums. Session greats such as r&AMP;b guitarist
Cornell Dupree and saxophonists Stanley Turrentine and David
``Fathead'' Newman have helped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for players that really feel the music,'' Rawls said.
``People that aren't just playing notes on paper. See, a lot of
musicians just play the music but don't give anything to it. People
like Dupree, the written notes are just a guide, but they put
themselves and their own feeling into it.''
</P>
<P>
   For his Playboy set, he could've chosen to use a full orchestra,
but he's aiming for a more intimate experience by fronting a
quintet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the intimacy comes in,'' he said. ``An orchestra
wouldn't give me the feeling I'm after.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also features Celia Cruz, Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra
with Wynton Marsalis, Ruben Blades &AMP; Editus, Elvin Jones Jazz
Machine, Bela Fleck &AMP; the Flecktones, the Cos of Good Music V,
Norman Brown and the David Sanchez Sextet.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, for those who will miss the festival, jazz radio
KLON-FM (88.1) will broadcast the entire event on July 3 and 4. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rock biographer Peter Guralnick, whose Elvis Presley books
``Last Train to Memphis'' and ``Careless Love'' are considered
essential examples of the genre, turns his attentions to the man
who discovered the King in ``Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented
Rock 'n' Roll,`` a new A&AMP;E ``Biography.''
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick serviceably hits all the high points. These include
Phillips' early radio career and his opening the Memphis Recording
Service (which would soon become Sun Records) in 1950. There's the
discovery, in addition to Presley, of Howling Wolf, Johnny Cash,
Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis; the impromptu
million-dollar session which included most of the above-mentioned
artists; and, finally, the selling Presley's contract for $35,000
and, a dozen years later, the Sun catalog for $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Guralnick also mines the quirkier elements of Phillips'
career: Starting up WHER, the first all-woman radio station; his
early investments in Holiday Inn, which really made him a wealthy
man; and his friendship with a pro wrestler and avid segregationist
named Sputnick Monroe. Curiously, he brings up an affair Phillips
once had without eliciting comment from the producer or his wife,
who both participated in the project and speak at length on other
subjects _ it's like an editorial rap on the knuckles, followed by
a winking silence.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Phillips remains an engaging raconteur. He and
other interviewees display lingering enthusiasm, and the
well-chosen archival pieces _ old songs, home movies, TV clips and
audio transcriptions _ are given ample air time to convey their
glorious essence. ``Sam Phillips,'' as well as almost any document
out there, captures the energy, excitement and pure joy of those
early days of rock. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
The show: ``Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock `n' Roll.'' &QL; 
What: ``Biography'' on the legendary producer. &QL; 
Who: Narrated by Billy Bob Thornton. &QL; 
Where: A&AMP;E. &QL; 
When: 8 tonight. &QL;

&HT;     SCIENTIST EXAMINE LINK BETWEEN DIABETES, DEPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By NICOLE FOY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ When a diabetic is depressed, it may not be just a
case of the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists studying the link between the two conditions long
have been fascinated with how one feeds off the other, tending to
make things worse for diabetics. But little has been done to
translate such knowledge into successful treatment options for the
depressed diabetic.
</P>
<P>
   A new study detailed this week at the American Diabetes
Association's 60th annual meeting represents a step in that
direction. Research indicates diabetics experience decreased
depression and improved blood sugar levels after only eight weeks
of treatment with the popular anti-depressant fluoxetine, or
Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lustman, a psychologist at Washington University School
of Medicine in St. Louis who conducted the study, said it
highlights the importance of doctors recognizing symptoms of
depression in diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got both (conditions) and you treat both, then both
will improve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lustman spoke during the nation's largest gathering of diabetes
specialists, which drew more than 7,000 doctors and researchers to
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Depression often goes undiagnosed in diabetics, who face twice
the risk of developing the mood disorder, Lustman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that managed care has constrained the time of a
primary care visit to about five minutes,'' he said. ``So
unfortunately, it falls back to patients to mention it specifically
to their doctors, because it's a very treatable condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Lustman's study, published in the most recent edition of the
American Diabetes Association journal, Diabetes Care, followed 60
patients, some with Type 1 diabetes and some with Type 2. Patients
were separated into two groups of 30, and one group was given a
daily dose of Prozac. The control group was given a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of eight weeks, the group receiving treatment showed
a depression remission rate of 48 percent, compared with the
control group's 26 percent, Lustman said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients receiving Prozac also demonstrated a significantly
greater improvement in blood sugar, or glucose, levels, he said.
The use of an anti-depressant likely improves glycemic control
because it dampens the body's response to the hormone cortisol,
which is released during times of stress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies also have shown depression is associated with
hyperglycemia and an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Type I is insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, formerly called
juvenile onset diabetes, for which an insulin injection is
required. Type II, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,
formerly referred to adult onset diabetes, can be controlled by
dietary restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in finding therapies that help diabetics with
depression is increasing, Lustman noted. This summer, the National
Institutes of Health will convene a panel of doctors and behavioral
scientists to help identify which clinical trials to pursue in an
attempt to improve the treatment of depressed diabetics.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another study presented at the diabetes conference considered
the much-debated question: Does depression cause diabetes or does
diabetes cause depression?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Kaiser Permanente's Center for Health Research in
Portland, Ore., looked at 1,680 diabetic members of its health
maintenance organization. They found that when compared with
nondiabetics, those with diabetes were more likely to have been
treated for depression within six months before their diabetes
diagnosis, said Gregory Nichols, a Kaiser researcher who conducted
the study.
</P>
<P>
   About 84 percent of those diabetics also reported a higher rate
of earlier depressive episodes than those in the control group, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the data did not show a causal link, Nichols said the
study suggests depression frequently precedes the onset of
diabetes, rather than vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at it in terms of causation may not be the right way
to do things,'' he said, noting the two conditions may be linked
rather than directly related.

&HT;     RESEARCHERS TRY TO UNRAVEL OBESITY HOMONE MYSTERY

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Scientists caused a stir five years ago when they
announced they could cause fat mice to lose weight by giving them
leptin, a weight-regulating hormone secreted by fat cells.
</P>
<P>
   But producing the same results in humans has proven infinitely
more complex. Obese people, it turns out, have lots of leptin
circulating in their systems, but somehow have lost the ability to
respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   Unraveling the leptin mystery is a key target of diabetes
researchers. Obesity is strongly linked to Type 2 diabetes, a
serious disease affecting some 15 million Americans that is
characterized by the body's inability to use blood sugar.
Untreated, diabetes can cause deteriorating eyesight, kidney
failure, heart disease and death.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and researchers attending the American Diabetes
Association's 60th Annual Meeting and Scientific Sessions in San
Antonio this week got an update on the state of leptin research,
including the puzzle of leptin resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of leptin-related studies have been done in the past
five years. While progress is being made, scientists also cautioned
that they are a long way from understanding the complex interaction
between fat cells, leptin, the brain and appetite.
</P>
<P>
   But working with laboratory animals, researchers at the Harvard
University School of Medicine say they have identified two
potential brain pathways that influence leptin resistance. They
found sites within the hypothalamus, an area deep inside the brain
that contains the body's appetite control center, where leptin
causes different reactions in thin mice than in fat ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know the identity of some of the potential sites of the
problem,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Flier, and endocrinologist and
professor of medicine at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But other sites also likely exist, he said, and identifying each
will fill in just one piece of the complex chain of chemical
reactions taking place when people eat food or expend energy.
</P>
<P>
   Leptin, dubbed the ``anti-obesity hormone,'' is a protein fat
cells secrete that is supposed to tell the brain it's time to stop
eating. The brain, in turn, sends out messages to the body,
controlling everything from fat storage to the attractiveness of
food to hunger pangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be the problem of getting leptin to the area of the
brain where it needs to be,'' Flier said. ``There can also be a
defect in the ability of the brain to activate the correct signal
pathway for talking with the cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know some of the potential sites of the problem in the
hypothalamus.''
</P>
<P>
   The studies have involved only animal brains, which may be
vastly different from humans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to treat human obesity with leptin have been
disappointing. But once scientists understand this relay system
between leptin and the brain, other ways of treating obesity could
be possible, Flier said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists may be able to manipulate the leptin reaction in the
brain, or target some of the downstream systems it influences
through the brain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the hope,'' he said. ``But all these hopes don't
always turn into drugs.''

&HT;     ON-LINE INFORMATION FOR VACATIONERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   I was impressed to read recently that travel has been proclaimed
the No.
</P>
<P>
   1 ``legitimate'' source of on-line commerce.
</P>
<P>
   And not so impressed to find that it still lags behind
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   But today's focus isn't on Web sites that sell (at least not as
a reason for being); it's about new and updated enterprises that
can help in planning our summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some Web sites that are worth exploring:
</P>
<P>
   At www.medicineplanet.com, visitors can obtain free
health-related information pertaining to countries throughout the
world. Searches can be made by destination or for specific
diseases, risks or immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   Separate content areas focus on issues affecting women,
children, seniors and adventure travelers. Another segment features
travel-related articles authored by leading physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Browsers who register as a member (at no charge) can create a
health profile and receive information targeted to individual
needs. Members also can submit questions and participate in chat
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   An on-line health store (no surprise there) is included.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control continues to expand its site at
www.
</P>
<P>
   cdc.gov/travel. It, too, offers specific information for
travelers with children, for pregnant travelers and for travelers
with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccination recommendations are provided, as are tips on how to
avoid illness from food or water.
</P>
<P>
   This is the place to look for sanitation reports on individual
cruise ships. I was disappointed at first glance to note that the
most recent listing was for November 1999, but by clicking on
``Search database of inspection scores for all cruise ships,'' I
accessed up-to-date inspection scores.
</P>
<P>
   A new site, www.officialtravelinfo.com, eases the process of
searching for destination information.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the International Association of Convention and
Visitor Bureaus, this venture links the official tourism sites of
more than 900 tourism agencies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are links for weather information, local newspaper
reports, passport and visa information, U.S. State Department
travel warnings and public announcements, currency conversion,
world time zone specifics and maps and driving directions.
</P>
<P>
   Not new but recommended, too, as a good source for pinpointing
tourism bureau sites is www.towd.com (tourism offices worldwide
directory).
</P>
<P>
   Search by U.S. states or foreign destinations.
</P>
<P>
   To order free brochures, access www.wwb.com (another
long-standing site) where more than 15,000 travel guides, maps and
brochures are available.
</P>
<P>
   Just fill out the form as instructed, and the literature you
request will be sent by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for families that travel internationally,
www.travelforkids.com offers suggestions for ``fun things for you
and your kids to do'' in eight European countries, four South
American nations, five Asian destinations, Mexico, Costa Rica,
Cuba, British Columbia, Australia and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The site, launched by Globetracks, is stronger in some areas
than others. I didn't learn much about the Yucatn Peninsula _ the
only region of Mexico covered for now _ that isn't available in
guidebooks and newspaper articles. But the section on France caught
my fancy.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers who visit Notre Dame, the site points to ``a
charming little play area on the south side of the church, with a
great sand toy and park benches. Any exhausted parent can sit
peacefully to watch the boats on the Seine while the kids play
under the shadow of this great cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   Another useful feature is a directory of English-speaking
pediatric doctors, dentists and orthodontists aboard. For now, this
segment covers 16 nations.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers with disabilities and mature travelers are the focus
of www.access-able.com.
</P>
<P>
   Included are recommendations on travel agencies that specialize
in working with those who have special needs, a list of accessible
cruise ships and cabins, tour recommendations, suggested
literature, articles submitted by travelers with disabilities, TTY
and voice telephone contacts and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the quest is heli-hiking in Canada's Purcell Mountains
or self-guided cycling in France's Provence, adventure travelers
have found a new on line home at www.adventureseek.com.
</P>
<P>
   Listings are provided for adventure-oriented trips worldwide.
Other prominent features include safety information and forums to
share experiences. Trips and gear can be purchased here, too.
</P>
<P>
   As experienced browsers know, literally thousands more sites
cater to travelers _ and many provide important trip-planning
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Here are just a few at the top of my list: www.travelocity.com,
www.expedia.com and www.previewtravel.com (for a wide range of
general information); www.digitalcity.com and www.citysearch.com
(for information about specific cities); www.nps.gov (for links to
National Parks sites); www.cruising.org (for links to most but not
all major cruise lines); www.travel.state.gov (for U.S. State
Department travel warnings, public announcements and Consular
Information Sheets and also for passport and visa information);
www.customs.gov/travel/travel.htm (for U.S. Customs Service ``know
before you go'' information); www.astanet.com (to find a travel
agency in your area); www.mapquest.com; www.weather.com and
www.accu-weather.com; and www.xe.net/currency (for currency
conversions).

&HT;     ANGRY EDGE MARKS LEWIS BLACK'S COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MIKE McDANIEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Lewis Black may be one of the funniest people on the
planet. He certainly is one of the angriest.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting laggards, phonies, injustice or incongruity sets Black
into poisonous motion, with a rage reminiscent of Lenny Bruce,
Richard Pryor and George Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   Stand back and beware the spew.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if it's about politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes me mad about George W. Bush is the fact that
Republicans seem to like him because he reminds them of George
Bush,'' says Black, on the phone from Chicago. ``If they're so
enamored with George Bush, get him. Compared to George W. and Al
Gore, he's Winston Churchill. How sad is that? ``I've said time and
again I'd take a dead Hubert Humphrey over these guys. When people
want to talk to the president, you send them to the grave site and
let them deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Black took time off from his gig as political commentator on
Comedy Central's The Daily Show With Jon Stewart to play the Laff
Stop in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Better bring him Valium.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Black says he's in control of that black edge that
earmarks his comedy. In other words, don't worry about him stroking
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I'm in those modes. Where I go, `I'm taking this a
little too seriously.' I'm in pretty much control of it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the Valium.
</P>
<P>
   But bring Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Black on Elian Gonzales and U.S.-Cuba relations: ``That makes me
livid. Fidel Castro has driven every president psychotic. Why
didn't they just give him a baseball team? How tough was that? If
they had asked him to join the National League, there would be no
problems. And I mean that.''
</P>
<P>
   On polls: ``I don't believe them. A sample of 1,675 people can
tell you everything that's going on in this country? That's
patently absurd.
</P>
<P>
   It's insane.''
</P>
<P>
   On Bosnia: ``I don't understand how a Slovak and a Croat and a
Muslim can tell each other apart. Does one group wear suspenders?
Does one group have teeth on the top and another teeth on the
bottom?''
</P>
<P>
   Black may be familiar to Houston audiences for his work as
playwright.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. He's collaborated on some 40 plays, including The
Czar of Rock &AMP; Roll, which played the Alley in 1990. Chronicle
theater critic Everett Evans labeled the show ``scattershot
satire.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Black says he's still writing plays, but his experience
here ``really drove me into becoming a full-time comic. It's not
just the Alley. The regional theater experience, which is terrific
for reaching people, can be brutal if you're a writer. I don't
think there's a play I've produced, except for maybe a couple of
times, where I didn't have to give back part of my salary to get
what I wanted in terms of either set or acting.''
</P>
<P>
   So there were some lean times?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, till about last Thursday,'' he says. ``I was stone
broke because I refused to do anything except what I wanted to do
for a living. I ran a club (a theater-bar) in New York City for
eight years and was earning about 500 bucks a week, which in New
York City .... I mean, I had a bank account, but I never had
anything in it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he ``found'' stand-up, ``I started going on the road; I
started making a living.''
</P>
<P>
   That living includes some acting stints, too, including roles as
the sports announcer on Showtime's Hoop Life, Bernie on The Days
and Nights of Molly Dodd and bit roles on Homicide, Mad About You
and in such movies as Hannah and Her Sisters and Jacob's Ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Today he's more high-profile than ever, thanks to his The Daily
Show appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's meant a career,'' he says of the Comedy Central gig. ``I
had a career, but it gave me access to a wider audience. I was
wandering wondering around this country like some Willy Loman.''
</P>
<P>
   Black, 51, says his early comedic influences were Jonathan
Winters, Bob Newhart and Shelley Berman. He also recognizes in
himself a bit of Lily Tomlin, Bruce, Pryor and Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin is on record as saying Black is one of the few comedians
whose work he consistently enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant a lot to me (to hear about that), and it meant a lot
more to my mother, who was ecstatic over this,'' Black says. ``And
he left me a very nice message on my phone machine, and this was
very early on in The Daily Show, before I'd gotten any recognition.
I thought, `Wow.' I felt like I was doing something right, because
he's someone who really had an effect on me. He's somebody I look
up to.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, people looking for humor are looking up to Black.
He's got so much support now that should a heckler create grief,
``It's like if you tell the audience, `Kill,' they would go, `OK,
we'll get him for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Heady times. Gigs galore. Money in the bank. Sometimes it pays
to be angry.

 &HT;     ELLEN DeGENERES HITS THE ROAD WITH COMEDY TOUR  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MIKE McDANIEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ This is the nature of the TV beast. One day you're on
top of the world, making history, pulling in big numbers. Next day,
you're meat. A star with no fire, no future. In danger of slipping
into the black hole of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid to come out. Then coming out. Then hit in the face with a
banana creme pie. Pink-slipped. Rejected. Dismissed. Fired.
Unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, this was Ellen DeGeneres. Declaring herself gay
in national magazines as well as on her ABC sitcom, ``Ellen,'' she
encountered/embraced/endured a period of celebrity that was too
white-hot to maintain. And when her show began to take on a
preachy, gay-centric and often unfunny tone, even her biggest
admirers came out against her. She was out in April 1997, off the
air by May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She never quite left our consciousness _ there were a couple of
movies she made before the sitcom died, and girlfriend Anne Heche
cast her recently in HBO's If These Walls Could Talk II. She and
Heche would show up at celebrity events together.
</P>
<P>
   But DeGeneres wasn't working, and that was not acceptable to
someone with workaholic tendencies. It drove her back into a
closet. Maybe not the one dealing with sexuality, but one that had
some of its elements.
</P>
<P>
   She felt confused, undesired, paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some people's minds, it may seem like I didn't disappear,
but those movies (EdTV, Goodbye Lover) were done before my show was
canceled, except for The Love Letter, which was immediately
after,'' the 42-year-old comedian said. ``But it's been three years
since I've done anything except for the HBO piece, and the only
reason that happened was because Anne wrote and directed it for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she's back, and she's taking the route that made her a star
_ stand-up. Her eight-week, 35-city bus tour (yes, bus tour)
stopped in Houston and eventually she'll wend her way to New York,
where her show will be taped for a July 23 HBO special.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, she's playing it straight, so to speak. The show
is not about her being a lesbian. It's not a forum for civil
rights. It's about funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want this to be a big show about me being gay,'' she
said. ``I wanted to blend everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a big gaping hole if I didn't address at all my
life for the last three years. So I do talk about it in the
beginning, just to get it out of the way, but I do it in a funny
way. I don't really talk about so much as show you _ and that's all
I'll say.''
</P>
<P>
   She's proud she came out, she says, but the rejection she
suffered when her show got axed tapped into feelings of
worthlessness and rejection gay people fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``During that time, yeah, I was wounded, I was like an open
sore.
</P>
<P>
   Anything affected me. Anything. There was a period of time I
couldn't turn on TV without being a sketch on Saturday Night Live
or the butt of a joke in a monologue. Whatever. It just got to be
too much. That was my first glimpse of, wow, this is such a
negative world, and it's every arena: it's television, it's press,
it's just people talking, it's sitcoms. You don't notice it until
you are the recipient of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started seeing that everybody is making fun of somebody
else. There's a joke at someone else's expense. Or it's a cynical
sense of humor or critical and I thought, `That's not what I've
ever done. My comedy has been nice, and it's always been gentle and
lots of silence and pauses, and I need to bring that out to the
world. That's missing right now.'
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I'm a comedian. One of the reasons for the tour
is I wanted to refocus everyone on what I do. Yes, I'm gay, and
everybody knows that. Now let's get beyond that and remember how I
got here in the first place. I was a comedian; people did like me;
and if I left some audience members along the way, that's more
about them than it is about me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to remind people about who I am as an artist,
that I'm funny and love giving people joy. I became a
representation of someone who's gay and kind of became a symbol
instead of an artist, and now I hope I'm a representation of
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   The critical buzz of those who've seen her on this ``comeback
tour'' has been good and strong, just the affirmation DeGeneres
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was a risk,'' DeGeneres said of her return to the
stage. ``What if they say I'm not as funny as I used to be? What if
I'm not as funny? What if I can't write anymore? All these what-ifs
started creeping in, and you can paralyze yourself like that. I
just finally decided that `They win then. They stopped me.' I can't
send that message out. It's not the way I want to live my life, and
I can't stay down, I've got to get back up.''
</P>
<P>
   She never intended to be gone this long. When the pink slip came
from ABC, she immediately starting thinking about stand-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, I can't just disappear,'' she said. ``I'm a shark,
in a sense; if I'm not moving constantly, I die. That's been my
life. I've always been a workaholic. So I thought I should get
right back and do stand-up and I made the deal with HBO, and then I
got scared out of my mind and pulled it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into a deep depression and didn't do anything for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   Then I came out of that thinking I should do the HBO special and
was trying to push, but I was not ready and pulled it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now by this time HBO is getting aggravated, right? So I
finally started writing again and felt confident enough that if I
just set a date, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is in two parts: one part stand-up, the other audience
participation. For the latter, DeGeneres takes questions from the
audience, and sometimes calls out Heche from backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Heche is filming a behind-the-scenes documentary of the tour.
(She's also making a movie, so it is not known whether she will be
here Friday or in Vancouver for the film.) The documentary may
become a theatrical release or could go straight to video. It's not
part of the HBO special.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, being made with two touring buses, has been a return
of the bump and grind for the road-tested DeGeneres, who last
performed stand-up seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared of flying, and it's such a big tour,'' she said.
``We have such a big crew and so much equipment, it just seemed
easier (than flying).''
</P>
<P>
   Yet reality is setting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're sleeping on top of a motor _ or not sleeping. It's
really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But here is the reward: DeGeneres is doing what she was born to
do: making people laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Her optimism peaking, she will start work on a variety show for
CBS immediately after the tour ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to put on the good old-fashioned variety shows, like
Carol Burnett, where things were funny because they were, not
because they were meanspirited or too hip or too edgy and pushing
the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   She said CBS president Leslie Moonves has advised her to have a
show ready by October. He's given the green light for six episodes.
And in a throwback to Burnett, DeGeneres will talk off-the-cuff
with the studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   And in another bow to Burnett, Tim Conway has signed on as a
cast member, along with Sean Cullen (Cop Land) and Jennifer Irwin
(Harlan County War).
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a risky show,'' said the woman who knows what risk is.
``Nobody's doing a show like this, and they haven't in a long time.
People have tried and failed. I just really believe I can do it,
and I believe there are people out there that are ready to see that
kind of comedy come back.''

TEENS WARM UP TO SOME COOL SUMMER FLICKS

 By JANE RINZLER BUCKINGHAM   
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe you've watched the movie previews or read the critics'
opinions, but when it comes to what movies young people actually
want to see, you may not have heard from the experts _ teen-agers
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I gathered a group of teens in New York, L.A. and
Chicago and showed them descriptions of some summer movies to see
what the true authorities had to say about the potential
blockbusters. Here are their picks for the biggest hits.
</P>
<P>
   'SHAFT'
</P>
<P>
   While the 1980s might be back in fashion, the 1970s are ruling
the silver screen. Teens are jonesing for Jackson _ Samuel L.
Jackson _ who plays the title character in a re-creation of the
1971 ``blaxploitation'' classic that inspired two sequels and a
short-lived television series.
</P>
<P>
   As one 17-year-old male from New York summed up, ``Shaft's just
so cool. He's got an awesome job, he gets the girls and he's out
for justice. You just know he's gonna be a badass and there will be
a lot of action, but he's the good guy. They don't make shows like
that anymore.'' No they don't; but if the movie does as well as
these teens expect, there will, undoubtedly be a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   'THE PERFECT STORM'
</P>
<P>
   While both teen males and females are looking forward to this
film, the appeal comes from places as different as a sunny day and
a stormy one. Males are interested in the action, the story and the
cool effects (``How do they DO that wave thing?'' asked one
15-year-old male in Chicago). Females, on the other hand, have
their eye on George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg rather than the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, females who aren't even that interested in the
film expect to ride out the opening tempest. As one 16-year-old
girl from New York explained, ``I know all my guy friends are gonna
want to see it the night it opens, so I'd go see it just to hang
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   'LOSER'
</P>
<P>
   Together again, teen sex symbol Mena Suvari and teen jokester
Jason Biggs may be just the right match to bring in the young
audience. But while the two stars grabbed the groups' attention,
previews and word of mouth may ultimately decide the film's fate.
</P>
<P>
   As one 16-year-old male in Chicago said, ``There are so many
movies about teen-agers today. Lately most of them suck. It's like
they (movie studios) think we'll see anything, but that's not true.
If I hear a film sucks, I'll skip it or wait till it comes out on
video.''
</P>
<P>
   'COYOTE UGLY'
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Cocktail,'' think ``Flashdance,'' think ``Footloose'' or
``Dirty Dancing.'' Every generation needs its shamelessly sexy,
coming-of-age movie under the guise of female (or male)
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry that these films are corrupting the minds of
tomorrow's leaders. As one 17-year-old female summed it up, ``Come
on, we don't take these films seriously. They're hysterical _ but
they've got great music It's a world you wish really existed and
some stupid romance that you know winds up with a happy ending My
life is hard enough. I don't mind a good escape for a few hours.''
</P>
<P>
   'CHICKEN RUN'
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers today know the difference between a Disney cartoon
meant for their younger siblings and the more sophisticated and
often racier animation of ``The Simpsons'' and ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens expect ``Chicken Run,'' an animated feature that tells the
story of some chickens trapped in a World War II-like prison camp,
to be entertaining and innovative. As one 16-year-old girl in L.A.
said, ``It's just going to be a funny, easy movie I'd see with my
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   'GIRLFIGHT'
</P>
<P>
   While this film showed more limited appeal, it did reveal the
love for the independent spirit we see among teens. It also
demonstrated how savvy teens are about indie films, not just
blockbusters. A surprisingly large number were familiar with the
fact that ``Girlfight'' won a Grand Jury Prize at The Sundance Film
Festival. In addition, both males and females liked the premise of
a female boxer.
</P>

&HT;     VIDEO REVIEWS OF `THE GREEN MILE,' `BICENTENNIAL MAN'

<P>
   ``The Green Mile''
</P>
<P>
   In serial form as six thin paperbacks, Stephen King's The Green
Mile was a breeze of a read. As a film, it's a three-hour epic.
</P>
<P>
   Blame Tom Hanks' star power for such excess, or blame
writer-director Frank Darabont. After the huzzahs for his work on
King's The Shawshank Redemption _ a prison yarn which ran 40 fewer
minutes _ perhaps he got carried away.
</P>
<P>
   But video does offer intermissions on command, and on any screen
Mile offers ample rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Those unfamiliar with the novel will be engaged by its surprises
as the tale slowly unfolds. Those who know the story should be
pleased that Darabont is faithful to it.
</P>
<P>
   Mile also is impeccably cast. Each actor seems born to play his
part, and none shines more brightly than deserving Oscar nominee
Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   He portrays John Coffey, a hulking, uneducated, gentle man who's
unjustly convicted of killing two girls in Depression-era
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   When he's locked in a cell on a prison's death row (whose green
floor lends the tale's title), things get interesting.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Coffey has unexplained supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   With a touch, he can read minds, transmit his thoughts and _
most importantly _ draw suffering into himself with healing
inhalations.
</P>
<P>
   His benign powers spark dramatic events involving the ailing
chief guard (Hanks), the desperately ill wife of the warden, a
maniacally murderous inmate and an amazingly obedient mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned the film also has horrific executions (one of which is
marred by twisted Creepshow gore), and its heart-rending tragedies
can be too much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Most are triggered by two characters: a condemned man (Sam
Rockwell) who's gleefully vicious, and a cowardly guard (Doug
Hutchison) whose insidious hatred sparks the most appalling scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mile isn't engulfed by woe. It has a strong sense of
humanism if not almost serene spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, it's an absorbing prison story in which
monstrousness resides on both sides of cells. At the most, it's an
allegory for humanity's worst episodes of cruelty, offset by
moments of forgiveness and grace.

<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man''
</P>
<P>
   In his 20-year film career, Robin Williams has created a virtual
genre.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``hand-wringing dramas whose high-minded pathos never
compensates for submerging Williams' comic talents in a sea of
sentimental tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, he's entitled to stretch as an actor and play dramatic
roles, which rightly won him an Oscar for Good Will Hunting. But
for years it seems that's all he's done, and he just won't quit.
</P>
<P>
   In stand-up-comic parlance, take this movie _ please.
</P>
<P>
   It is as leadenly earnest and weepy as far too many Williams
efforts, from Patch Adams and What Dreams May Come to Jakob the
Liar and Jack.
</P>
<P>
   He plays a household appliance _ that is, a humanlike robot of
the future, purchased by a wealthy man (Sam Neill) for his family.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to many complications _ some comical, others serious
_ as the family adjusts to the robot and the machine assimilates
human qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Through new technology and preachy advocacy of biological
glories, he progresses (if that's the word) toward a true human
state.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this is the old Pinocchio character arc, which Brent
Spiner played on Star Trek: The Next Generation for seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's an arc Williams plays with the same old touchy-feely
sensitivity, wearing his heart on his sleeve like a romantic
schoolboy who's just discovered Deep Thoughts. He's got comic bits,
to be sure, but they're buried in fields of corn.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the world's greatest comedian again squanders the gift of
laughter. Robin, you're robbin' us.

&HT;     TRACY BYRD IS TRUE TO HIS COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN GOODSPEED  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Like a lot of guys, Tracy Byrd loves hunting,
fishing and country music.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a lot of guys, Byrd is building successful careers with
his hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   So if the easy-going smile the good-natured singer wears during
his performance Friday night at the Far West Rodeo seems broader
than usual, consider this:
</P>
<P>
   _ A new record label, RCA, which allowed the country
traditionalist more creative control than ever before on his
seventh album, ``It's About Time,'' which was greeted by more
critical acclaim than any of his previous efforts.
</P>
<P>
   _ A top-10 single from that album, ``Put Your Hand in Mine,'' a
touching song about a child who keeps his parents from breaking up.
It marks Byrd's departure from his prior label's pigeonholing as a
novelty hitmaker with such tunes as ``Watermelon Crawl'' and ``I'm
From the Country.''
</P>
<P>
   _ His sophomore year as host of TNN's block of weekend outdoors
shows, which draws 8 million viewers a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ A just-released RCA album, ``Wonders of Wildlife'' _ spawned
from Byrd's recent TNN special of the same name to support wildlife
conservation _ features hits from fellow country stars who share
his love of the outdoors. It also has a new song from Byrd, ``Pass
It On,'' which concerns handing off to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who has sold more than 5 million albums and is known for
such No. 1 hits as ``Keeper of the Stars'' and ``Holdin' Heaven,''
fell in love with the outdoors before country music, and his
grandmother Mavis Vaughn was the matchmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nana started taking me fishing when I was about 4 and hunting
when I was about 6, and I've been doing it ever since,'' the native
of the far Southeast Texas town of Vidor said, adding they hunted
and fished together regularly until he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   They still do on occasion. Two springs ago, Byrd took Vaughn on
her first turkey hunt. The outing was taped for TNN's ``Hunting the
Country,'' and Byrd called up three gobblers at daylight. Vaughn,
in her 70s, shot the one with the smallest beard _ 9 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was pretty fired up about it anyway,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   Like on the song ``Pass It On,'' Byrd hands off what he learned
from Vaughn to his daughter, Evee, 5, and son, Logan, 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've both caught fish and they love it,'' Byrd said.
``They're just not quite old enough to hunt yet. I grew up in the
woods and on the water, and I want my kids to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outdoors offers a great education for a child. Above and
beyond everything else, it teaches them respect for nature and the
power of God to create something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, 33, keeps his roots solidly planted in Beaumont, Texas,
where he moved when he was 19. When in Nashville, Tenn., he stays
in an apartment in his office building on Music Row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in Nashville for business and that's about it,'' Byrd
said. ``I like living in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd is proud that his album ``It's About Time'' reflects his
Texas roots, with an old Johnny Bush hit, ``Undo the Right,''
written by Willie Nelson and Hank Cochran, and famous fiddler
Johnny Gimble of Tyler playing on several tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'd ever showcased my vocal ability and really
got some songs with some real meat to them, really great
traditional country songs,'' Byrd said. ``That's what I set out to
do on `It's About Time.'''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Byrd wants to host his own outdoors TV show,
although his touring schedule prevents him from taping the
necessary 16 episodes. But his music exposes fans to the outdoors,
too _ sometimes in unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tons of my lady fans now sit down with their husbands to watch
TNN Outdoors,'' Byrd said. ``I've had husbands say, `My wife used
to gripe all the time about not being able to watch what she wanted
on TV on Saturday mornings and Sunday nights. Now I can't get her
to quit watching it with me because you're on there.'''

<P>
   BEIJING _ Unlike most Westerners, Roger Barrett doesn't think of
North Korea as a weird, hermetic country on the edge of disaster.
To him, it's a business opportunity just waiting to be seized.
</P>
<P>
   ``(North Korea) is very willing to do business with the rest of
the world,'' he says. ``The rest of the world doesn't realize
that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, while the rest of the world wonders just how many hundreds
of thousands died in its recent famine and hopes it stops work on
its long-range missile program, Barrett is running a business
association for companies looking to trade and invest in the
world's most isolated country.
</P>
<P>
   With the conclusion this week of a historic summit between North
and South Korea in which the reclusive and enigmatic leader Kim
Jong Il showed himself to be a likeable and competent statesman,
``there'll be increased levels of interest . . . and a mindset that
(North Korea) might be a place to do business,'' Barrett believes.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to that potential fire, U.S. officials quickly began
working to lift sanctions against North Korea following the
three-day summit in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced in September the easing of a
half-century of restrictions on trade, travel and banking against
North Korea, as a reward for agreeing to a moratorium on testing of
long-range missiles that could strike U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   With the summit ending in an atmosphere of unprecedented
goodwill, U.S. officials said on Thursday they would announce soon
the procedures for implementing Clinton's decision _ perhaps as
early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Barrett helped form the Foreign Business
Development Association in Beijing, which now boasts more than 30
members, including three American companies. With the blessing of
the authorities in Pyongyang, the association, run like a chamber
of commerce, promotes some government projects while helping member
companies navigate the nuances of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, a British businessman who has been working in Asia
on-and-off for 18 years, couldn't be more enthusiastic about the
potential for profit in a country with a Stalinist political
climate and perpetual shortage of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   He proudly displays glossy photos of a clean and modern-looking
downtown Pyongyang. He points to President Kim Jong-Il's unexpected
appearance at the airport Tuesday to greet South Korean President
Kim Dae-Jung.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I mean about willingness and openness,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, North Korea has recently shown a desire to emerge from
its shell, establishing diplomatic ties with Australia and Italy
earlier this year and inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin for
a visit next month.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to details of actual business deals, Barrett is
almost as secretive as the North Koreans. He won't say which
companies are members of the association, how much they've invested
or what kind of projects they're exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Members demand confidentiality, he said, partly for competitive
reasons and partly because of North Korea's image problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American member said to me, 'Americans are led to believe
they'd either be shot or eaten if they go (to North Korea),'''
Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States frequently refers to North Korea as a ``rogue
state.'' Although Washington may soon lift many investment and
trade sanctions, ``if it's known (a public company) is involved in
North Korea, that has an adverse affect on the share price,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett claims that ``tourism is set to grow.'' In fact, a Hong
Kong developer has built a luxury hotel and casino in a trade zone
near the Chinese border. Barrett imagines Chinese tourists flocking
to the Emperor Casino to gamble and enjoy the nearby beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few companies willing to admit membership in the
association are Allied-Pickford, the American shipping firm, and
Millizer and Munch, a Swiss forwarding company.
</P>
<P>
   Uwe Behrens, director of Millizer's joint-venture in Beijing, is
much more frank about the business climate in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any successful investments or joint
ventures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean conglomerates have long been the biggest investors
in the North, but it's difficult to assess how they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Behrens' company is managing to make a small profit by
transporting goods into and out of North Korea, mostly shipping in
foreign aid. The outbound traffic is supplied by the few North
Korean factories still exporting, namely some textiles, a machine
tools company and a piano factory, Behrens said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it has been 10 years since he started his company's
operations in North Korea, he believes it's only a matter of time
before business starts to boom there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are considering that if there comes a certain opening, . .
. then from overseas comes a lot of cargo,'' Behrens said. ``So for
this time we are ready.''

   Tired of those summer reruns?
</P>
<P>
   When coleslaw, chips and salsa, frozen yogurt, tuna sandwiches
and hot dogs start to fade in appeal, it's time to switch to
something more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Let us suggest ... beans.
</P>
<P>
   Not exciting? Well, perhaps interesting, delicious, affordable,
versatile and easy to prepare are better words to describe beans.
Dress them up, coax them into bolder roles, find a better cast of
supporting characters and you might just stage an unexpected hit.

   Lately, beans have come into their own as a ``trendy'' food. Hot
new cooking styles, such as Nuevo Latino, not only give beans star
billing, they also use them in salsas, sauces and garnishes.
Growing numbers of vegetarians don't just like beans, they revere
them as reliable, delicious sources of protein. And never before in
history has a bean received so much press as the soybean has in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   With the obesity rate in the United States rising, cutting back
on fat and introducing more fiber into the diet is of special
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Beans are one of the ideal foods for doing this, says Patricia
Parker, a registered, licensed dietitian and certified diabetes
educator with the Texas Diabetes Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're high in soluble fiber, which is one of the types of
fiber that is important for lowering cholesterol,'' she says.
Soluble fiber is especially good for people with diabetes. Because
it takes longer to digest, it slows down the time it takes for food
to enter into the bloodstream, which helps normalize blood sugar
levels. It prevents constipation and helps keep you feeling fuller
longer. ``So you'll have less snacking later,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to get between 25-30 grams of fiber a day. You
aren't going to get this with a slice of bread,'' says Parker.
Bread may have between 1-2 grams of fiber, or up to 3 grams if it
is whole grain. A half cup of kidney beans has 9 grams; for the
same amount of pinto beans, it's 5 grams and for black beans, 7
grams.
</P>
<P>
   Also, says Parker, beans are high in protein and iron as well as
isoflavones, nutritional substances that have been shown to have
important cancer-fighting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If the family doesn't care for beans, says Parker, there are
ways to slowly introduce such foods into the diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as a dietitian, I had to learn to eat beans. And it was
probably one of the hardest things I had to learn. I used to
swallow them like you would a pill. Now I can eat a whole bowl-full
at a time and I love them.''
</P>
<P>
   How did she learn to love them?
</P>
<P>
   ``One bean at a time,'' says Parker, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Parker says that in her experience children like beans best when
they are mashed and served over something, like rice. To get them
(or adults) accustomed to eating more beans, ``add them as a
garnish or in a salad where they're not the main ingredient,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, where pinto beans, black beans and black-eyed
peas are popular, the challenge is to cook them without too much
added fat but to make them flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's us,'' says Roy Holley, a cook at La Fiesta Patio Cafe.
The flavor secret of La Fiesta's beans is olive oil, a more
healthful, monounsaturated fat. No bacon, no lard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a tad of olive oil is all you need, then regular spices
and seasonings,'' says Holley.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is a perfect time to give beans a chance _ and there are
many colorful, flavorful varieties from which to choose. Here are a
few tips from Parker, ``The Nutrition Bible'' (Morrow, $30) and the
American Dry Bean Board for using beans:
</P>
<P>
   Soaking dry beans: To soak or not to soak is a frequently asked
question. The answer is yes, soak. First, it softens and returns
moisture to the beans and reduces cooking time. Second it allows
some of the gas-producing substances to dissolve in the soaking
water.
</P>
<P>
   How to soak: For every pound (2 cups) of beans, add 10 cups hot
water. Heat the beans and water to boiling, then turn off the heat,
cover and set aside for 1 to 4 hours. For every pound of dry beans,
you'll get 6 cups cooked beans.
</P>
<P>
   Discarding water: The longer beans soak and the more soaking
water you pour out, the less gas-producing beans will be. Yes, some
nutrients are lost when soaking water is poured out, but so are
some of the gas-producing properties.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking beans: Boil the beans for about 10 minutes, then simmer
them until tender, usually 1 to 2 hours. Never add anything acidic
while the beans are cooking, such as tomatoes, vinegar, wine or
citrus juices. Add these after the beans are tender. Seasonings
such as garlic, onion, oregano or parsley can be added while
they're cooking. After cooking, beans may be refrigerated for 4 to
5 days, or they may be frozen if packaged in moisture- and
vapor-proof containers.

IN MEXICO'S TIGHT RACE, VOTER INTIMIDATION FEARED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Two leading presidential candidates warn of
trouble if next month's vote is close. Mexico's currency dips to a
15-month low. And the country's Roman Catholic Church is urging
members not to ``vote out of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   It's little wonder, then, that Mexican voters, with less than
three weeks to go before the closest presidential election since
the Great Depression, are starting to feel nervous about July 2.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that most opinion polls show is a statistical tie
between the ruling party and the conservative opposition, voters,
analysts and observers are complaining that the candidates and
their respective organizations are trying to intimidate voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a campaign of fear that we've seen lately by certain
groups that is creating an anxiety among people,'' said Jaime
Cardenas, a board member of the Federal Electoral Institute, the
independent agency coordinating the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers say the jitters emerged last month when Vicente
Fox Quesada, the 57-year-old former Coca Cola executive and
candidate for the center-right National Action Party, said he would
question the election results if he lost by less than 10 percentage
points. He has backtracked a bit since, maintaining that he would
accept the results if they are endorsed by the electoral agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's earlier comments were matched by those of governing party
candidate Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who envisioned ``problems in
the country, demonstrations and disturbances,'' if he didn't win by
a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   Several financial analysts blamed both statements for the quick
fall of the Mexican peso last week. It dipped slightly over 10 to
the US dollar, its lowest point in more than a year, raising fears
of an economic crisis similar to that during the last transition of
power six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone tells us that the economy is much better now and not
to worry,'' said Rogelio Parra, who manages a photo studio in the
Polanco neighborhood of Mexico City. ``That's what the government
told us six years ago, but they lied. You can't blame us for being
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the Mexican jitters is the uncertainty over
how desperate the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party,
known as the PRI, will be to win next month's vote. Many observers
and experts worry that the party, known for past fraud and
vote-buying schemes in maintaining 71 uninterrupted years of power,
may be returning to its old ways.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs that the old PRI machine may be humming
away. Last week, members of an opposition party in Quintana Roo
state discovered a warehouse of 300 brand new bicycles, allegedly
bought by the state's PRI organization and intended as gifts for
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent vote-buying stories disclosed by the watchdog group
Alianza Civica on Tuesday include 500 washing machines, bags of
cattle feed, water for rural communities and new drainage systems
for villages hard hit by recent rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Observers also worry that the government's 3-year-old welfare
program known as Progresa, which provides assistance to parents who
make sure their children stay in school, may be more vulnerable to
political manipulation by officials who allegedly warn recipients
that their support will be cut off unless they vote for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church, which was banned from political affairs in
Mexico for decades until reforms were passed in 1992, has also
expressed concerns about pressuring voters and possible fraud.
Church officials are posting messages in 7,000 parishes telling
members that ``to collaborate directly or indirectly with
electorial fraud is a serious sin that harms human rights and
offends God.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI leaders and the government have gone to great lengths to
insist that this year's elections will be the cleanest ever, mostly
because they are being organized for the first time by a
nonpartisan agency.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the electoral institute, created four years ago, say
they have so far received 12 formal complaints of vote-buying and
intimidation tactics, 10 of them against the PRI and two against
the Alliance for Mexico leftist coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the agency has been broadcasting radio and
television commercials reminding voters that vote-buying and
coercion are illegal. But electoral officials know that detecting
fraud and punishing violators will be hard to do unless they are
given more resources and more enforcement powers against everyone _
even the president.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, the agency sent a letter to Zedillo demanding
his government stop broadcasting pro-government ads on television
because it amounted to a PRI campaign commercial. Zedillo did not
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our chief of state and should be an example,'' one
electoral official said this week. ``He says he's committed to
transparent elections, but we still have no answer from him.''

HOW MANY MILES PER GALLON? IN A BENTLEY, WHO CARES? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what do I know from labels?
</P>
<P>
   Black Labels, in cans, on ice in a galvanized bucket, at the end
of the dock on a hot day of fishing. Those labels I know.
</P>
<P>
   Red Label, Green Label, winged and affixed to the hoods of
motorcars that cost upward of $200,000? Not in the little town in
New Hamphshire where I grew up. Yuppies there drove Volvos and
Saabs, not Bentleys. We drove mostly fourth-hand Chevys.
</P>
<P>
   So when my pal Bugsy _ who can best be described as my pusher
when it comes to the cars I end up testing every week _ called to
see if I'd like a Bentley Arnage over Memorial Day weekend, the
internal debate lingered as long as spit on a hot woodstove.
</P>
<P>
   I did not ask, ``Red Label or Green?''
</P>
<P>
   I got the Red, which is by far the peppier of the two lumbering
sedans _ nearly three tons of steel and aluminum and leather (so
much leather you have to count it in the overall curb weight) that
can, with amazing wonder, screech off the line and hurtle down the
highway _ all as you relax inside in quiet comfort. Hey, you can
barely hear the horn when you blow it, so insulated is the Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   Its presence caused no small dilemma over the long holiday
weekend. What shall I drive, I found myself muttering whenever I
had to go to the town recycling center, one of my kid's baseball
games, off to a barbecue, or out to dine at a restaurant. The
turbocharged Bentley or the supercharged Jaguar XKR convertible?
</P>
<P>
   Three-hundred-thousand dollars worth of cars, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the small rear seat of the Jag holds baseball
gear just fine. The trunk of the Bentley holds five plastic bags of
garbage, a bag of cans, a bag of bottles, a stack of cardboard, and
a week's worth of three different newspapers. Either will get you
to chow and back.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Bentley that had the oddest effect on folks.
They'd gawk. They'd ask to just sit in it. They'd ask what it was
and what it cost, gasping at the answer to the latter.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Monica was so touched by the experience of traveling
to dinner in such luxury that she suggested that she and my wife
pop up through the open sunroof and perform as though they were at
a rave concert at Foxboro Stadium, and I'm not talking moshing. She
was dissuaded.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner, our quartet arrived just behind a couple. The maitre
'd asked the couple what they needed, nodded, and then turned to
us. The gentleman in the couple, worried that we might edge ahead,
asked if we had arrived before them _ implying we had no business
asking for a table before he was seated.
</P>
<P>
   Before I could point out that we had reservations, Monica told
him that, no, we were not there ahead, and then advised him, ``But
we came in a Bentley.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bentley Arnage Red Label, stronger brother of the Green
Label, was unveiled to the world at the 1999 Frankfurt auto show.
It was Volkswagen's attempt (yes, VW had purchased Bentley) to show
that it could crank out power with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   And crank it out it does.
</P>
<P>
   In turbocharged form, its 6.75-liter V-8 produces 420
horsepower. More than respectable. But it also manages something
over 630 lb.-ft. of torque. I've seen tow trucks with less torque
than that. I could haul both the Suburban and the ski boat I tow
with it with the Red Label.
</P>
<P>
   The Arnage is named for a famous, tortuous turn at LeMans, in
reverence for the long ago days when Bentleys won the 24 Hours of
LeMans five times.
</P>
<P>
   I guess the folks who made the Green Label didn't think it quite
lived up to that heritage, so they crammed this bigger, more
powerful engine into the Arnage and named it Red. As in, Right On,
Red.
</P>
<P>
   When I say crammed in, I mean crammed in. Pop the hood and you'd
be hard pressed to get a piece of dental floss to travel cleanly
from the top of the engine compartment to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But should you own a Bentley, you probably shouldn't have to
look under the hood anyway. Grease and other yukky things might be
found there. Stains silks, ruins finger sandwiches at picnics.
</P>
<P>
   You belong back inside the car, where select people go. Riding
smoothly, free from the noise and bumps of the outside world.
Independent suspension, automatic height control, load
compensators, automatic stability control, even self-leveling
headlights, and thicker insulation than you find in a refrigerator,
protect you from the vagaries and insults of the open road.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame Monica her, shall we say, ``enthusiasm''?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, even the ceiling in the Bentley is coated with leather.
Cream leather everywhere, thick leather on the seats, dash,
steering wheel. Seats in the front as big as easy chairs and
probably more comfortable than the easy chairs most of us normally
sit in.
</P>
<P>
   The split sections of the rear seat move back, on their own,
when you open a rear door. Easy egress if you ever want to get out,
which you almost always do reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   Nice parchment color to the gauges. Wonderful retro chrome
pull-knobs that open and close air vents. Carpeting thick as an old
forest floor. Miles per gallon? Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Next time, Monica drives. I rise through the sunroof and there
is no stopping me. I lift my shirt . . . because I'm in a Bentley.

FATHERS AND THE ADOLESCENT DAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking across the dance floor at a friend's child's bar mitzvah
party not long ago, Sam Osherson found himself
</P>
<P>
   admiring a young woman. He had two thoughts: ``Oh, how
attractive!'' and then ``I'm old enough to be her father!''
</P>
<P>
   As the girl turned around, he realized he was her father.
</P>
<P>
   Osherson, a psychologist and author whose specialty is parents'
development, had reached a milestone he long anticipated as a
father, that uh-oh moment when you recognize that your daughter is
a sexual being. Despite his years of research, it took Osherson by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're her father,'' he says, ``but you're also a male. It can
be very disconcerting.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a father isn't aroused by his daughter's budding
sexuality, he is usually at least made uncomfortable by it, says
Joe Kelly, executive director of Dads and Daughters, a national
nonprofit organization that works to help strengthen
father-daughter ties. ``It's OK to have the feelings,'' says Kelly.
``They're normal and natural. It's never OK to act on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the typical father doesn't. Instead, bewildered by
his thoughts and worried he's a bad person for having them, he puts
emotional and/or physical distance between himself and his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal couldn't come at a worse time in a girl's
development, says psychologist and researcher Elizabeth Debold, a
specialist in gender development. ``This is a time of transition. A
father's distance leaves a daughter fundamentally insecure,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   As Osherson and Kelly know first hand (Kelly is the father of
19-year-old twin girls; Osherson's daughter is 14), a girl's
demeanor with her dad can have a coquettish edge even at 4 or 5.
``When she's sitting on your lap, there are times you'd swear she's
flirting with you,'' says Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   She isn't, but even at 4 or 5, a girl is subconsciously testing
out notions of what it means to be female. This is healthy and
normal, says psychologist Lise Motherwell, who has researched
fathers and daughters. ``It's one way a young girl builds her sense
of herself as an appealing person whose femininity is acceptable,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   By age 6 or 7, the coyness practically disappears, replaced by a
sense of mastery in the world. For the next few years, the
father-daughter relationship is at its most comfortable:
affectionate, close, and straightforward. But between 9 and 11,
conflicts surface. Before, she idolized you. Now she criticizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the separation process,'' says Osherson. ``She's
wondering things like, `Can I be good in math like Dad and still be
feminine?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, changes in her body can alternately make her shy and
modest around you or coy and provocative. Debold says a girl's
mixed signals are a sign she's moving back and forth between
wanting to be an independent grown-up and wanting to be a protected
little girl: One night, she'll recoil at your arm on her shoulder,
the next, she'll curl up in your lap; one day she'll flit about the
house scantily clad, the next, lash out at you because you saw her
wrapped in a towel after her shower.
</P>
<P>
   In a subconscious way, she's asking the same questions as in the
preschool years _ ``Am I worthy of your admiration?'' _ only now
she's provocative, not just cute, and she knows it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's testing,'' says Osherson. ``She wants to know what gets
the attention of the opposite sex and she's trying it out on the
first man in her life.'' Osherson is the author of ``The Hidden
Wisdom of Parents'' (Adams, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   The daughter whose father removes himself physically by suddenly
no longer being available to shoot hoops or help with Spanish may
be tactile hungry, says Osherson: Just because a girl eschews
standard offerings of affection, she still needs some physical
closeness, even if it's just sitting side by side at the table
while you look at her homework.
</P>
<P>
   The girl whose father withdraws emotionally may be in bigger
trouble. It can feed into her insecurity, perhaps affecting future
relationships as well as her sense of efficacy in the larger world,
which Dad may represent. ``It makes a girl think, `There's
something wrong with me. Dad doesn't like what's happening (to my
body); it's shameful/bad/ugly,' '' says Debold.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, fathers don't have much wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, you need to stay emotionally close and
affectionate,'' says Motherwell. ``On the other hand, you don't
want to be intrusive or inappropriate sexually.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution is to take your cues from your daughter.
</P>
<P>
   On the physical side, stick to a routine such as a goodnight
kiss until she tells you not to. ``It's better to err on doing it
for too long than to cut it off too soon,'' Osherson says.
Additionally, after stopping a ritual for a while, re-initiate it.
``She may not want a goodnight kiss for a year, then, all of a
sudden, want it again,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme is a daughter who overdoes physical
closeness, falling all over you in a way that's arousing. ``Create
a boundary without making her feel badly,'' says Motherwell. For
instance, if she crawls in bed on a weekend morning and it gives
you an erection, rather than throw her out of bed or tell her
harshly she's no longer welcome, create a new ritual: Get up early
and suggest you take a run together, or make pancakes. If she
parades around in panties and bra, rather than gruffly sending her
to her room or telling her to ``put some clothes on!'' consider
what's going on developmentally:
</P>
<P>
   --At 9: ``She's likely unaware of her impact,'' says Motherwell.
Either ignore it or, if you're afraid of being aroused, tell her
simply, ``Why don't you put on a robe?''
</P>
<P>
   --At 13 or 14: Now, says Motherwell, ``ignoring it doesn't get
her need met.'' In other words, she's asking a question _ ``Am I
attractive?'' _ and needs an answer. Osherson tells of one father
whose daughter's clothes kept getting more and more flimsy. Finally
he said to her, ``Do you know, you look absolutely beautiful? But
these clothes are too grown-up for you,'' and she stopped wearing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls need to hear from their father,'' says Debold. You can
even use the word ``sexy,'' she says, as long as you desexualize
your relationship: ``You are sexy to other people; to me you are my
daughter, and I find you beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ways to ease this passage for your and your daughter:
</P>
<P>
   --Be a good listener. Girls 11 to 14 tend to go into great
detail about many things, which can drive fathers up a wall.
``Instead of jumping in to problem-solve or cutting a girl off _
`What's the big deal here?' _ learn to just listen,'' says Debold.
</P>
<P>
   --Look for areas of mutual interest to stay engaged. If you're
not comfortable with activities that used to work, find new ones.
Motherwell tells of a sculptor who invited his daughter and her
friends to his studio and helped them weld stilts. ``He brought her
into his world at her developmental level,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   --Find appropriate ways to tell her she is beautiful. As she's
going to a party, tell her, ``You look beautiful,'' not ``I wish I
was going to this party!'' If she's flirting with you, ``That's not
the time to say it at all,'' says Debold.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a daughter becomes a young woman, many fathers, of course,
are terrified of a girl's vulnerability in a culture that is toxic
to women. For Kelly, this means working hard to counteract the
cultural messages that tell girls their looks are more important
than their values.

   ``I would tell my daughters they were beautiful, but I was very
intentional and out loud about telling each one how unique she was
and talking about her internal gifts,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly would also frequently tell stories about his own
adolescence. Not only did that give his daughters a window into how
boys think but it also helped him stay engaged with them. When Nia
announced she was dyeing her hair orange, his first instinct was to
say, ``Oh no, you're not!'' Instead, he remembered a girl who had
to cancel a first date with him because her hair had turned green
when she bleached it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me how important appearance is at this age,'' says
Kelly. ``The next thing I knew, I was helping Nia dye her hair and
her sister was taking pictures of us.''

FACING THE FATHER-DAUGHTER DILEMMA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The typical adolescent daughter may alternately bristle at a
childhood endearment or welcome it. When she bristles, apologize
and move on; don't take it personally.
</P>
<P>
   --When it seems as if you can do nothing right, tell your
daughter: ``I really love you and I want to spend time with you,
but it seems like everything I suggest is wrong. I'm just a human
being _ can you help me out?''
</P>
<P>
   --When it's clear that your daughter is pouting and whining in
an effort to manipulate you, tell her, ``I can't hear you when you
do that. Come back when you're ready to talk'' or ``Give me a list
of reasons you think this makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   --Be sure your daughter sees you being appropriately romantic
with your wife _ bring her roses, use endearments _ and avoid
behaving toward your daughter in ways that could be construed as
romantic: For instance, take her to dinner, not on a date, not even
when she's 5.
</P>
<P>
   --Even when you feel stung by a daughter's criticism, be clear
you are still available to her. Don't grumble and take it
personally. This is especially important for single fathers.
</P>
<P>
   --Contact Dads and Daughters at www.dadsanddaughters.org or Box

</P>
<P>
   --Even when your daughter is 4 or 5, point out examples of
sexism when you see it: ``I hate it when a movie makes it seem as
if the only important thing about a woman is the size of her
breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   --Girls whose fathers desert them are more likely to act out
sexually as a way to get Dad's attention, according to research.

THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING 
RESENT TO ACCOMMODATE SAN BERNARDINO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANGELA LEMIRE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, Dawn Wright was sedated for 45 minutes as a
doctor, using an ultrasound probe, removed 12 or so eggs from her
uterus _ far more than the usual single egg normally released
during ovulation.
</P>
<P>
   To get to this point, she had spent a month injecting herself
with 2-inch needles: three weeks of Lupron in the stomach to stop
that month's production of reproductive eggs; one week of Metrodin
and Pergonal, egg follicle-stimulating hormones, in the hip; then a
single injection of another hormonal mixture as her ovaries swelled
to nearly the size of grapefruits.
</P>
<P>
   She did all this voluntarily, despite the medical risks and side
effects such as hot flashes, nausea, fatigue, water retention and
cramping.
</P>
<P>
   She did it to make pregnancy possible for a woman she would
never meet; a woman who, most likely, had already exhausted years
and up to $30,000 on previous infertility treatments before
considering third-party in vitro fertilization, or egg donation.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Wright, now 29, says she felt blessed to have her
own son _ now a healthy, active 5-year-old _ and wanted to share
her gift with someone who truly wanted motherhood, even a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt others should be so lucky,'' says Wright, a Santa
Clarita resident. ``I thought, `It's just so hard for so many
couples. It's not always so easy to adopt.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Lieber Wilkins, a West Los Angeles psychotherapist, was
only 33 when she became pregnant using anonymous donor eggs. Three
years earlier, she had learned she could not conceive a child with
her own eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're facing that a part of your body has failed you and
you're not able to create a child with your partner in the way you
always imagined,'' says Wilkins, who now has a 12-year-old son from
that process, and later adopted another son. ``You're also getting
over the fantasy that you're going to having a little you, your own
genetic offspring. But once you get past that, you should look at
(egg donors) as a great option, because it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, more infertile women and couples have
opted for third-party in vitro as success rates improved to a
remarkable 70 percent and risky multiple-birth rates decreased,
according to Dr. Paul Greenberg, a fertility expert whose practice
is based at Encino-Tarzana Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Also making the process more appealing is the greater
availability of donors who come forward either for the monetary
compensation, humanitarian desires or both.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Greenberg's practice, which he once shared
with retired partner Dr. Sheldon Schein in Thousand Oaks, was among
a handful in Greater Los Angeles to offer various types of in vitro
procedures. They performed only two or three egg donor transfers
per year in the early 1990s. But by last year, egg donation
transfers had become so commonplace that they accounted for 20
percent of the 70 in vitro fertilizations Greenberg performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that third-party in vitro, or egg
donations, is the fastest-growing industry in the medical
profession,'' says Karen Synesiou, co-owner and director of the
Center for Surrogate Parenting &AMP; Egg Donation Inc. in Beverly
Hills, one of Los Angeles' busiest egg donation clinics. Egg
donations have increased from roughly three successful cycles per
year in the early 1990s to more than 300 last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to National Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
statistics updated through 1997, California's 33 clinics _ about 10
percent of nationwide egg donor clinics at the time _ reported more
than 2,300 successful donor cycles in 1997. Industry insiders since
then have pinned nationwide estimates for annual egg donor cycles
at up to 15,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Linda (not her real name), a San Fernando Valley resident in her
early 50s, conceived a son with anonymous donor eggs eight years
ago. She opted for the procedure after a miscarriage 12 weeks into
a pregnancy two years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have gone to any length to get pregnant,'' Linda
recalled. ``I had achieved my career goals, I had traveled all over
the world, and could still do those things if I wanted to, but I
was suddenly willing to put it all aside to have my child. I don't
know of any other way to describe that longing to others who
haven't felt it.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been considering adoption when she learned of egg
donation, then a new and little-known procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great blessing for me that someone did this,'' says
Linda of her anonymous donor. ``I got it all: I got pregnant, I got
to nurse, I got motherhood. And my husband, too, is genetically
connected to our child.''
</P>
<P>
   ---Money motivates some donors &QL; 
Aside from women who assist infertile friends or relatives in
getting pregnant, medical professionals and donors say money is, to
some degree, a prime motivating factor for most egg donors.
</P>
<P>
   Donor fees _ which technically compensate women for time,
inconvenience and medical risk, not the eggs _ are typically
between $2,500 and $5,000 in California, and $5,000 to $8,000 on
the East Coast, where fewer donors are available.
</P>
<P>
   The well-publicized online auctions for fashion models' eggs and
$50,000 offers for specific donor traits are rare, experts say, and
most donors are of average appearance.
</P>
<P>
   A divorced mother with a young son, Wright figured she could put
the donor fee toward emergency savings. And the $2,500 she received
eventually came in handy when costly car repairs came up
unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she insists her primary motivation was more humanitarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really go into it just looking at the money or it's
not going to be enjoyable for you to have to go through all that.
Mentally you can't handle it,'' says Wright, recalling the daily
injections and physical discomfort afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Money) was definitely some part of it, but I was more
interested in the medical part.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Derrick, a 29-year-old West Los Angeles resident and
free-lance writer, has undergone nine donor cycles in the last four
years. The money she received has helped to pay off her college
education and enabled her to take a vacation in South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about the money,'' she says of her first donation. ``It
still is.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 10th donation, she vows, will be her last. Financially,
she's doing well enough between writing and working as a personal
trainer that she no longer needs the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other concerns, she admits, like health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be connected to any one thing like that _ you
know, that puts your body through so many changes,'' Derrick says.
``And I know there's risks.''
</P>
<P>
   She has recently begun thinking more about times like her ninth
donation, when she had to take birth control pills to regulate her
hormones. She detested the unsettling mood swings that came over
her.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, she's reminded of the risk of hyperstimulation, when
hormone injections cause ovaries to produce an unusually large
number of eggs. Doctors retrieved about 30 eggs _ more than double
the amount usually harvested _ and she went through two weeks of
cramps, nausea, bloating and severe fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   She swore she'd never donate her eggs again, but changed her
mind four months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, you get used to what you have to do,'' says
Derrick. ``And it doesn't seem like a big deal after a while _ even
the needles.''
</P>
<P>
   It is encouraging that she's helped someone in the process, she
says, particularly people who've already tried previous fertility
treatments and want children so badly. Every now and then, she's
reminded of that by personal thank you notes or gifts she receives
from her egg recipients.
</P>
<P>
   California's open donor policy gives recipients and donors the
option to meet or make contact and enables recipients to get more
personal information about donors, such as academic records and
hobbies _ even pictures. Anonymous programs _ the prevailing
practice on the East Coast _ forbids contact or exchange of more
personal information, including names.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Derrick, ``They're all winners in this. I think if (the
recipients) go through all that effort to have a child, and they'd
be good parents, they should.''
</P>
<P>
   ---It's not the best option for everyone &QL; 
Wilkins, whose own experience as a recipient now guides her in
counseling couples and women coping with grief, cautions that
third-party egg donation is not the only answer to the infertility
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because there's a high success rate doesn't mean this is
the right choice for everyone,'' says Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   Before even considering other family-building alternatives,
women must grieve ``the loss of a genetic child,'' she says, adding
that it takes time to mourn, accept and make peace with one's own
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Egg donor in vitro is not recommended for women whose moral or
ethical beliefs might pose insurmountable issues, she says, or for
those who would feel embarrassment or shame, or who anticipate that
grandparents and other relatives would not accept the children, or
who feel coerced into having the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   And a woman who opts for egg donations in vitro must also decide
how to explain her decision to the child. Wilkins advises parents
to explain it to children in simplistic terms at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not genetically connected, but I'm biologically
connected,'' says Linda, anticipating the explanation she'll likely
give her own son in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he's going to react. But I hope the love we
have given him will outweigh any concerns about any part a third
person has played in this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' she says. ``I have no precedent for this.'' &QL;

PEBBLE BEACH A TRUE AMERICAN BEAUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The answer is as clear as the wind on
your face as you stare out at a Pacific Ocean that is unrelenting
in its force, yet rhythmic in its soothing roar. This, you tell
yourself, is why they have journeyed here for all these years,
sparing no cost, seduced not by the game, but by the splendor that
intoxicates the senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty. I think everybody who thinks about Pebble Beach,
the first thing they think about is not that it is a par-72 golf
course,'' said Tom Watson. ``They think about the beauty of this
place because that is what it represents.''
</P>
<P>
   The 100th United State Golf Association's Open championship is
being played over 18 historic holes that are unrivaled, but for
most of the 156 contestants, the event began weeks, perhaps months
ago when Pebble froze their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pebble is Pebble,'' said Brad Faxon. ``It's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest place in the world,'' said Brett Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like no other golf setting anywhere,'' said Bobby
Clampett. ``Like no other golf experience you can have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course has always had a special place in my heart,''
said Tiger Woods. ``One, for its pristine beauty, another for its
mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the thoughts of today's golfers, but they were the
thoughts of yesterday's golfers. Go back to the days of primitive
travel and a game too few people could play and you can hear
Scotland's Jim Barnes: ``It's too dom beautiful, I ken not keep my
mind on the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Translated years later by Jack Nicklaus: ``I've always said that
if I had one round of golf to play, I'd go to Pebble Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he has returned _ again. This is where he won his second
US Amateur (1961) and his second US Open (1972). Perfectly fitting
then that he has, by all indications, chosen this venue to bring
down the curtain after his 44th US Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I smell the flowers?'' Nicklaus laughed. ``No, I'd
probably sneeze too much. But will I enjoy this week? Yes, because
it's Pebble Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he was in his 90s, Jack Neville would still come around the
Lodge, walk part of the course, and one day in 1975 Bill Spence had
the chance to meet him. ``I remember sitting there,'' said Spence,
now at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., but back then the
young superintendent of Pebble Beach, ``and thinking, `This is the
guy who created this golf course.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Neville _ who was hired along with fellow amateur golfer Douglas
Grant in 1916 to design Pebble Beach for New England native Samuel
F.B. Morse _ told Spence of the days when sheep would graze the
fairways and how God had truly created Pebble Beach. Morse wanted a
course modeled after Pinehurst, and to preserve the majestic
coastline property, he shrewedly bought back the lots so that
Neville had a natural setting with which to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I've always loved about Pebble,'' said Spence. ``It
has maintained the old style, a ruggedness that Tour courses don't
have today.''
</P>
<P>
   More than that, Pebble Beach has established itself as an
American landmark, a place held in such reverence that the prices,
no matter how high they soar, refuse to deter golfers. A round of
golf costs $300 for those who are staying at Pebble Beach Lodge,
where rooms are in the neighborhood of $400. Can't move into that
neighborhood? No problem, because some daily tee times are set
aside for walk-ons, for $325, though you best call ahead because it
is booked months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Mind-numbing numbers, for sure, though they strike at the heart
of Pebble's appeal. Which is: You are as welcome there as the next
guy, even if that next guy is a dot.com disciple who can string
together seven zeros next to a 1 when he buys a home on the golf
course. It is a public golf course, and though they don't exactly
use the old ball-in-the-ballrack method, an endless string of
everyday people have for years counted their rounds at Pebble Beach
as a near-religious experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many people have come up to us at the end
of the day and thanked us, and left with a smile,'' said Bill
Perocchi, CEO of Pebble Beach Co. and a native of Lawrence, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   They go away happy, no matter if the round took 125 shots, a
dozen golf balls, six hours, and three crisp $100 bills. It is a
small price to pay for sharing in an American story that has no end
to its appeal. Every morsel of information about Pebble Beach is
important, nothing is trivial, because it belongs to everyone. Most
likely they will never set foot on Augusta National or Pine Valley
or Shinnecock Hills or Winged Foot or Seminole or any of the other
shrines of American golf. But Pebble Beach? That belongs to the
public, a different breed of golf course and to mess with it is to
mess with a slice of America.
</P>
<P>
   All of which explains, perhaps, that at this US Open more than
others, course set-up and condition are topics of intense
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Most serious is the decision by the USGA to turn the second hole
into a par 4. Normally it plays as a par 5 and players are
virtually unanimous in their displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the life me, I've never understood why you change that,''
said Nicklaus. ``It doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   His fellow competitors agree, almost unison in their annual
charge that the USGA is simply determined to keep the winning score
as close to par as possible, and lowering it from 288 to 284 does
just that. But the USGA cites an entirely different rationale
behind the decision: pitch canker.
</P>
<P>
   That's the name of the disease that claimed two large Monterey
pines at the left side of the second green, leaving players free to
flail away with no obstacle in their way. Make it a par 4, the USGA
reasoned, and hit away.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch canker also threatens two Monterey pines down the right
side of the 18th fairway, noteworthy signatures on perhaps the most
famous hole in American golf. Resigned to the inevitable, golf
course personnel have planted two Cypress trees, which grow quickly
and in the near future will dominate the landscape at that point of
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Some will shed tears over the change in complexion, but those
who hold Pebble Beach near and dear to their hearts will remind you
that the glory has lived on in spite of past shifts.
</P>
<P>
   --For instance, the 18th hole was originally designed as a par 4
before being changed in 1922 into the classic par 5 that it is. Not
long ago, it was stretched even longer, to 543 yards when the tee
was moved out over the water.
</P>
<P>
   --Neville, said Spence, had one regret: ``He was never able to
purchase the land to put the fifth green along the cliffs.'' So the
hole turned inland, the ``only dogleg par 3 in the world,'' and was
perhaps the only hole that players disliked. Then, a few years ago,
the land was secured and Nicklaus redesigned it, moving the green
near the cliffs where players must now negotiate 188 yards with
genuine concern for losing a tee shot onto the beach.
</P>
<P>
   --The infamous Kikuyu, so thick and nasty and impossible to hit
out of, was eradicated in 1990 _ two years before the US Open was
to return for its third appearance _ and replaced with perennial
rye. It was a huge gamble, but the decision has paid off because
the course condition has reached magnificent standards never before
seen.
</P>
<P>
   --Twice, Pebble Beach has been owned by Japanese interests _
Minuro Isutani, who paid $840 million in 1990, and Taiheiyo Club
Inc., which took control for a mere $500 million two years later.
The former ownership was a nightmare, but the latter is given
credit for pumping money and life into Pebble Beach before choosing
the ideal American partnership (Peter Ueberroth, Arnold Palmer,
Clint Eastwood et al) to sell to in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the changes, the people have continued to pour
through the course, hundred-dollar bills in their pockets, visions
of grandeur in their minds. That isn't likely to change, not with a
program that allows course owners to use reclaimed water to keep
things green; not with a robust economy that keeps money in
people's bank accounts; not with the level of golf reaching
dizzying heights.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always like this, said Spence, who was on board from
1975-78 during which time a serious drought left the place brown
and hard. The ``ugliest PGA championship ever,'' he said, was here
in 1977 because ``we couldn't water.'' Only parts of the fairways
were green.
</P>
<P>
   When you turn on your TV today, you'll see no such problem.
Plush shades of green will jump out at you, until the camera
shifts, that is, and shows you the different tones of Pacific blue.
``The scenery couldn't be more spectacular,'' said Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Mickelson and 155 others, the scenery is not
why they have come to Pebble Beach. There is golf to be played and
no one is predicting that the golf will match the splendor of the
view, because the rough is up, the greens are fast, the fairways
hard, and wind is in the forecast, a combination that produces
visions of bogeys and long, frustrating rounds.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Spence, is what makes Pebble Beach ``the best Open
site'' available when June comes around. ``It doesn't rain and the
temperatures and fog allow you to do anything you want with the
grass. It's always different everytime you play it.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the USGA a long, long time to bring an Open here, but
after Nicklaus won in 1972, the returns were swift _ 1982 (Watson)
and 1992 (Tom Kite). ``And in each case,'' said Spence, ``Pebble
Beach never failed to identify the best player.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is only fitting for America's best public course.

TUNING IN TO THE VIRTUAL ACCORDION FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cliff Furnwald would be the first to admit that he has a sort of
wacky passion for all things accordion. Right now, he's sitting at
his computer producing the Third Annual Free Reed Festival, a
month-long celebration of the accordion being held exclusively on
the Internet. To Furnwald, this seems like a perfectly logical
endeavor, but to the uninitiated, the idea of a virtual accordion
festival raises a lot of questions. As in, why, why, and why?
</P>
<P>
   But the real burning question is: What do you wear?
</P>
<P>
   Do you pull out the lederhosen and dust off the dirndl? Or do
you rent a polyester tuxedo, something in the style of, say,
Lawrence Welk?
</P>
<P>
   ``When people think of the accordion, they think of the guys in
the powder blue suits playing the birthday parties,'' says
Furnwald, a freelance music critic and founder of rootsworld.com,
which is hosting the festival. ``We're going to surprise the hell
out of them. They expect oompah, oompah, oompah, and there will be
none of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival will feature articles, reviews, and recordings
contributed by 30 artists from all over the world. The site is
updated with new material every day, and judging from some of the
artists featured so far, this isn't about your typical polka band.
For instance, a group called the Edge City Collective plays bizarre
improvisational music that proves that even the accordion can be
totally inaccessible. On the other hand, the avant-garde duo of Guy
Klucevsek and Alan Bern create a fascinating sound that is nothing
like anything you have ever heard on this instrument; at times,
Klucevsek bangs on the instrument and makes the thing sound like a
drum. On the more traditional side, there is Mats Eden, a Swedish
musician who recorded waltzes and reels in his kitchen, offering a
pure interpretation of vintage accordion tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this stuff is an acquired taste, but Furnwald says
that last year's festival attracted about 25,000 visitors each
week. The whole affair has the sort of quirky grassroots flavor
that used to define the Internet before it got commercial. Furnwald
doesn't make any money on the festival: He just does it because he
can. ``You could never pull this off before the Internet,'' he
says. ``Maybe you could do a worldwide Mariah Carey festival, but
you couldn't do a festival featuring avant-garde duets on the
accordion.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are those who would be happier with the guys in
the powder blue suits (there's one in every crowd). One visitor to
the festival message boards wrote: ``Forget about all the Finnish
nonsense, and Senegalese bongo drums, and whatever else this
festival thing is all about. What the world needs is more Lawrence
Welk.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Does the world really need another entertainment Web site
offering TV-style programming? The answer is an emphatic maybe _
especially if they're offering programs for college-educated
zombies. (Trust me on this one.)
</P>
<P>
   The latest entry to the online entertainment field is
Icebox.com, a site staffed by writers and producers with credits on
such shows as ``The Simpsons,'' ``Seinfeld,'' and ``The X-Files.''
Icebox is producing animated shorts for the Internet, with the hope
that one or two of these shows will be picked up by a major
network.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they might as well get in line.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Hollywood is trying to figure out how to exploit
this new medium, and so far, there have been some pretty dramatic
failures. DEN and Pixelon folded last month after burning through
piles of money. Other companies that offer short liveaction videos,
like iFilm.com and Atom Films, have yet to attract a mainstream
following.
</P>
<P>
   But still, everyone wants to produce the next ``Blair Witch
Project,'' so the sites keep launching. Icebox cofounder Howard
Gordon says the idea was born ``out of the ashes of despair.'' The
former executive producer for ``The X-Files'' had just finished
writing a 13-episode show called ``Strange World''; it ran briefly
on ABC before it was yanked from the air. ``I didn't want to be
restricted by time slots and ratings,'' Gordon says.
</P>
<P>
   Icebox recruited an impressive staff of writers to produce a
roster of irreverent material. ``Our two mandates are no porn and
no hate,'' says Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, animation is far superior to live action video,
but Icebox still has some kinks in its technology. It crashed my
browser eight times in an hour, and sometimes the sound didn't
work. ``The bugs will be ironed out,'' Gordon says. ``They better
be, or we are doomed.''
</P>
<P>
   And a show has to be really compelling in order for folks to put
up with computer bugs. Here's the Icebox lineup, saving the best
for last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hidden Celebrity Webcam'' _ Imagine a camera in the freezer
of, say, President Clinton or Calista Flockhart. Not exactly food
for thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior House'' _ Geezers fight the evil landlord. Kidney jokes
abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superhero Roommate'' _ A slacker gets up off the couch to
throw out the garbage, and he turns into a superhero. As plot-free
as ``Seinfeld,'' without the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heaven'' _ ``Cheers'' with dead presidents, princesses, and a
laugh track. Featuring the great Shakespearean actor, Kato Kaelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard Drinkin' Lincoln'' _ The great emancipator stars as a
raging alcoholic; like Kenny in ``South Park,'' he dies in every
episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garbage Island'' _ A promising show about a world where it's
Christmas every day. A little boy tries desperately to hold onto
his old rag doll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zombie College'' _ The story of Scott and Zelda, two
all-American kids who end up at a university where the undead
mingle with the zombies. The humor is dead-on funny; when our hero
announces that he was attacked by a zombie, his girlfriend asks,
``Was she prettier than me?'' Over in the 24-hour snack shack, the
students devour livers and other organs; these fun-loving kids
enjoy munching on eyeballs, and the show just might attract enough
eyeballs to establish a following for Icebox.
</P>
<P>
   But first they have to iron out the bugs _ or maggots.

DE LA HOYA PLANS A SURPRISE PARTY FOR MOSLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shane Mosley has boxed more than 60 rounds with
Oscar De La Hoya, sparring with him repeatedly during their
formative years in Los Angeles when each was an amateur champion
hoping for a moment like the one that awaits each of them Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Out of those many rounds, Mosley believes he has learned all
there is to know about the WBC welterweight champion he will fight
for glory (and $4.5 million) at the Staples Center. Mosley believes
he understands De La Hoya's speed of hand and foot and how they
work against an opponent. Mosley believes he understands how De La
Hoya's mind works. Mosley believes he understands how De La Hoya's
sets up a fighter and how he destroys one after he has set his
trap.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley believes, in other words, that nothing De La Hoya can do
to him will surprise him Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the amiable business partner, De La Hoya didn't want to
disagree with his foil Wednesday. Instead, he merely pointed out
that in eight years a few things may have changed that Shane Mosley
will learn about the hard way, the same hard way most lessons in
boxing are learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's seen everything, he certainly hasn't felt it,'' De La
Hoya said of the undefeated former lightweight champion's opinion
of him. ``My power is stronger. I'm not the same fighter I was at
19. And it's not the same feeling when you're wearing 8-ounce
gloves (rather than 20-ounce training gloves). My punches hurt a
lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has made that point to 26 of his 33 opponents,
knocking them all flat while running up a 32-1 record and winning
world championships in four weight classes. It is a point he
intends to make once again at Mosley's expense. He has promised to
fight four times and produce four knockouts this year. To do it, he
must knock out a fighter who is 34-0 and claims to have never even
been knocked off his feet in 20 years in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   This knockout promise is all part of the latest version of De La
Hoya, who seems to repackage himself every year or two. The ``new''
De La Hoya is actually a resurrection of the old one who knocked
people out with a nasty left hook and a nastier uppercut when he
was fighting at 130 and 135 pounds. The problem is, as he's made
his way up to 147 (winning four world titles along the way), his
punch seems to have taken the road less traveled and that has made
all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Or so Shane Mosley believes.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has knocked out fewer and fewer people as he has
moved up. He has beaten people into submission, to be sure, but
since he became a junior welterweight in 1997 De La Hoya has gone
the distance five times and was unable to stop Pernell Whitaker,
Ike Quartey, or Felix Trinidad, arguably his three toughest
opponents at 147 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them, Whitaker and Trinidad, were never even hurt by him.
So one wonders if the power he says Mosley will feel is still with
him.
</P>
<P>
   To try and preserve it, De La Hoya has gone on a specially
designed eating plan formulated by the people from Met-Rx, the
supplement kings of professional sports. Dr. Scott Connelly,
founder of Met-Rx Engineered Nutrition, designed a program he
claims is specifically built to overcome the problems Mosley poses,
problems that will require De La Hoya to have both increased power
and muscle endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the guy has never had 6 ounces of fat anywhere on his
body, it's difficult to see how nutritional changes will produce
noticeable changes in De La Hoya's power or its effect on Mosley,
although Connelly insisted Wednesday, ``His endurance and power
have increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but De La Hoya was working with the Met-Rx people
before his fight with Trinidad. By the end of it, he claimed he
could barely raise his arms and fought like it, hence one has to
wonder. But De La Hoya insisted Mosley may have his own things to
wonder about once the fighting begins, the biggest one being that
some things never change. Another is that he was better than Mosley
in 1992 and he's better than him today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we fought (when De La Hoya was 11 and Mosley 12),''
De La Hoya said, feigning ignorance of it all. ``I have no idea. If
he won, great! Good for him. He was older. He was heavier. He
should have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Colorado Springs (when they were training for the 1992
Olympic team), we'd stay in the same building, but he was always on
the `B' team and I was on the `A' team, so I don't really know him
much.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya smiles the assassin's smile as he slips that stiletto
in. The truth is Mosley was on the ``A'' team at 139 pounds, as was
De La Hoya at 132. But when the Olympic Trials came, only De La
Hoya survived, going on to become the United States' only gold
medalist in Barcelona. Mosley, who failed to defeat Vernon Forrest
in the Olympic Trials, became a struggling six-round professional
for a time, while De La Hoya became boxing's Golden Boy from his
first pro fight.
</P>
<P>
   Although De La Hoya says it subtly, he says it all the same.
When their first big night came, only one of them delivered. Shane
Mosley knows that, too, as De La Hoya tries to make clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a great fighter to bring out the best in me,'' De La
Hoya said. ``Maybe Shane Mosley is the one. Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``He says the first round could be like (Marvin) Hagler-(Thomas)
Hearns. Fine. I can take a punch and I know I can bang with
anybody. What I trained for is to throw combinations and come
forward. If he's in my way, you'll see a hell of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to talk. It's always more difficult when the event
comes, especially a big event. You can talk the talk, but can you
walk the walk? That's a question I always ask my opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has been asked that question by several opponents who
have knocked him down, including Quartey. His response has been to
get up and return fire, knocking Quartey flat in the final round to
carry the night in a tough fight against a tough opponent, the kind
Mosley knows nothing about because he has never faced such a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Not until Saturday night at least, when he will walk into the
ring thinking he knows all there is to know about a guy who
believes he has a few surprises left in him for an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience brings a lot to the table,'' De La Hoya said.
``Every great fighter has been knocked down and had to get up. It's
hard. I don't know how he'll react if it happens. Neither does he.
He doesn't know how that feels yet.''
</P>
<P>
   No he doesn't, but if Oscar De La Hoya is true to his promise,
Shane Mosley will get the chance to learn something new about him .
. . and perhaps something new about himself as well.

MARTINEZ'S TALENT HIDDEN BY OTHERS' EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some days you go to work, put in your time, and leave
with a single thought: People are crazy. Wednesday in the Bronx,
Red Sox employee No. 45 finished his six-inning shift and nearly
had the thought himself.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old employee's name is Pedro Martinez. He is good at
what he does. Maybe he is at the point where he is so good that
people don't recognize how good he really is. His work is done in
stadiums, while standing on a raised mound of dirt. But he has
flourishes of genius that make you think the mound is actually an
elevated stage at the Apollo or the Village Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday at Yankee Stadium, you could say he was in
business-casual mode: six innings, one run. He was rewarded with a
no-decision in the 2-1 loss to the Yankees. If another pitcher has
a day like that, reporters sidle up to them afterward and request
details on the brilliant day. Martinez, though, asked if his
performance disappointed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I? A robot?'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, he stood in the middle of the visiting
clubhouse, still confused by the question. Disappointed? Why would
someone think that? ``I'm telling you, 80 times out of 100 _ well,
I'm not going to say 80. I'll say 90. Ninety times out of 100, if
you have a pitcher give you six innings and one run he's going to
win the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He still had the faint smile as he walked away. It must be true.
People are crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like people expect him to be Michael Jordan every time or
something,'' said coworker Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Another coworker, Carl Everett, was more blunt: ``When you're as
good as he is, people are going to ask you stupid things. Who asked
him if he was disappointed? That was dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he wanted to, Pedro couldn't be the new Jordan. There's
not enough patience for that. Jordan was scheduled to perform 82
times per season, which means that a few ``off'' nights _ which
really weren't true, Acie Earl off-nights _ were expected. Martinez
hasn't had 82 starts in his Boston career. (He has made 74.)
</P>
<P>
   Each time he takes the mound, he is shrouded with a torrent of
expectations. Baseball fans see his 0.99 ERA and praise him as one
of the few men capable of stopping the Home Run Plague that has
swept through the majors. Dominicans in Boston and New York wave
flags when he pitches. There is a Cuban restaurant in Boston where,
on the wall, a smiling Pedro is pictured with the owner. (Pedro is
so good that he is good for business.)
</P>
<P>
   I am sure, even subconsciously, the Sox have unrealistic
expectations for him. They always expect him to be the man who wins
a series or stops a losing streak. They depend on him too much.
They have given him eight runs in his last four starts, so it's
amazing that he has a 2-1 record and one no-decision in that span.
He can't be the employee who covers everyone's shift.
</P>
<P>
   The easy thing to say after Wednesday's loss was that the team
could use Sammy Sosa. Not true. This season Sosa has struck out 70
times, an amount that comes close to equaling the combined
strikeout totals of Nomar Garciaparra and Everett. The Sox could
use a high-average, high-contact, low-strikeout hitter more than
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   They could also use a non-Tim Wakefield type to finish off
Martinez's starts. Nothing against the knuckleballer, but
Martinez-to-Wakefield is not what I consider a secure relay
combination. Wakefield is Norman Rockwell to Martinez's Jean-Michel
Basquiat: Both are fine artists, but combining the two doesn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   When Wakefield entered Wednesday's game in the seventh, I
immediately empathized with thousands of nervous Sox fans who I
imagined screaming, ``No, Jimy!'' at their televisions. Wakefield
gave up the winning home run to Tino Martinez in the eighth, even
though lefthander Rheal Cormier was available.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the ending anyone expected on Pedro Day. At times, he
was so good that he was able to be pitcher and analyst. He looked
at Roger Clemens in the first and wondered, ``What's wrong with
Roger?'' He said the Yankee starter looked ``awful.'' He was right;
Clemens had a strained right groin and left the game after an
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also didn't look good early. After the first inning, an
inning in which he walked in a run for the first time since 1998,
he was surrounded by a Sox tribunal on the bench. Joe Kerrigan, Jim
Rowe, and John Cumberland circled him, wondering about the shaky
first.
</P>
<P>
   Four innings later, Martinez was laughing on the mound. It made
you wonder if there was a portable DVD player tucked in his glove,
showing his favorite comedy. But he was giggling at home plate
umpire Dan Morrison's call of ``ball'' on a pitch that rested over
the middle of the plate. Chuck Knoblauch got a reprieve on the
call. A brief reprieve. Martinez eventually struck him out.
</P>
<P>
   There were 54,834 fans in the Bronx, but you could sense
individual disappointment when Martinez left after six innings.
Everyone wanted a little more, which is always the case when you
regularly produce greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Did Martinez want to keep pitching?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just an employee,'' he said. ``I work here. They tell me
what to do. I'm an employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on days like Wednesday, he is the best employee in the
majors.

&HT;     GETTING AHEAD AT WORK WITH AN END RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you look back at Steve Young's years with the
San Francisco 49ers, you can learn a lot about your own career,
even if you don't know the difference between a safety blitz and a
cheese blintz.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that Young has played his last game (you can never be
too sure about an athlete's retirement), his years as the 49ers'
star quarterback were not as glorious as he deserved. Young's
career was more bittersweet, just like your average Joe's.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few things you can learn from it:
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   It took Young's series of concussions to knock some sense into
49er fans. Until then, a lot of them didn't appreciate just how
talented he was.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happens when you follow Joe Montana. Young was one
of the greatest quarterbacks in football history, but he didn't win
the four Super Bowls that Montana did. He won only one, which is
still one more than a lot of other great players.
</P>
<P>
   When you are interviewing for a job, find out whatever you can
about your predecessor. Was she universally loved and respected, or
were even the atheists tempted to say ``thank God'' when she walked
out the door? Did he leave because of a logical move up, or did he
just quit in frustration?
</P>
<P>
   This is a time when networking can be a huge help. If you can
talk to people who worked with your potential predecessor _ or,
better yet, to the predecessor _ you will know what you are getting
into. You'll also have a better grasp of the job, which can help
you give better answers during the interview.
</P>
<P>
   If your network is no help and you are not desperate to land the
job, ask your interviewer about the predecessor. If the answer
seems vague or unresponsive, ask to speak with him. If you get some
mumbled answer about not knowing how to reach him, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   Young knew what he was getting into, of course. He chose to take
the challenge, and you might, too. You just don't want to get
blindsided.
</P>
<P>
   Managers also have to make sure they don't show the same lack of
appreciation that 49er fans often did. If you replace a terrific
salesperson with one who is also terrific, it's easy to take the
second one for granted. You won't realize your mistake until the
second one feels unappreciated and leaves, and you find yourself
hiring someone who is only average.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes you have to yell to get your boss's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 1994 season, as the 49ers were getting clobbered by
the Philadelphia Eagles, then-coach George Seifert pulled Young out
of the game. The normally low-key Young screamed on the sidelines,
feeling like the scapegoat for a miserable team effort.
</P>
<P>
   He and Seifert soon worked things out, and the Eagles loss
became the turning point of the season. The 49ers went on to win
the Super Bowl that year.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming at your boss is rarely a good idea, but sometimes you
have to resort to extreme measures to get your voice heard. Even a
confrontation often is better than being miserable in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Before any confrontation, though, think about what you hope to
gain, and whether the potential damage is worth it. Is the issue
something that will haunt you for years, or will it blow over in a
week?
</P>
<P>
   Young's anger drew so much attention because it was so rare. If
you get a reputation for bellyaching, though, you'll never be able
to scream loud enough to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand what makes you special.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your predecessor was a superstar, you can still
distinguish yourself if you emphasize those things that you do
spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   Young was a terrific passer, of course, but his most famous play
was probably a 49-yard touchdown run against the Minnesota Vikings
back in 1988. You didn't know who would pass out first: Young or
announcer Lon Simmons, trying to describe the play on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   It was Young at his most spectacular, eluding defenders,
breaking tackles and going through a ``Perils of Pauline'' routine
before finally staggering into the end zone. It showed his speed,
his elusiveness and his stamina, but most of all it showed his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   No other Super Bowl-winning quarterback could have made that
run. Not even Joe Montana.
</P>

 &HT;    An old-fashioned romantic comedy in college attire
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the young leads of ``Boys and Girls'' had ever watched ``When
Harry Met Sally,'' they could've saved us at least an hour. Ryan
(Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Jennifer (Claire Forlani) spend most of
their movie's running time ignoring the fact that, as the most
photogenic and articulate of the screen characters, it's their
Hollywood imperative to quit bantering and get into bed.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiarly old-fashioned romantic comedy trapped in college
clothing, ``Boys and Girls'' throws in one innovative switch by
reversing gender roles. Here it's Jennifer who's the casual
one-night-stander and Ryan the near-virginal ingenue who natters on
about having ``to work at love if you want it to last.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie predictably trashes this switcheroo by making Jennifer
change her ways. In the last reel it's the girl who chases the boy,
proving her love by giving up her plans for travel and further
study. Gee, maybe in the sequel we'll get to watch Jennifer make
Ryan breakfast or clean their condo while he goes to his important
job in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The two meet as cute young adolescents, airplane seatmates en
route from New York to their hometown, Los Angeles. Feisty Jennifer
explains that she almost missed the flight because ``I got my first
period.'' It's a brusque little intro that actually doesn't reflect
the rest of the movie's squishy dialogue. You might wish for some
of the grosser excesses of ``Road Trip'' or ``American Pie'' just
to stay awake.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer and Ryan keep running into each other, first in high
school, then in college at Berkeley, which seems to have been
chosen primarily for its proximity to pretty San Francisco. These
kids never study. They spend their time walking around scenic spots
in the Golden Gate city, drinking coffee in cool cafes and checking
out the dance clubs. Though neither of them appears to own a car,
they hang out around the Marin County headlands across the bay,
miles from campus; that's probably because its scenic view is
almost as pretty as their movie star faces.
</P>
<P>
   Prinze is charming but bland; he can't fill in the blanks that
shortchange his character. It's surprising that none of Ryan's
classmates speculate that this handsome, non-dating dude might
actually be gay. Forlani, who has the wittier role, also scores the
livelier performance.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Detmer makes an impression as Forlani's live-wire
roommate, though the script never decides whether she's just wacky
or seriously in need of psychotropic medication. As Prinze's
roomie, Jason Biggs of ``American Pie'' plays a buffoon who lies to
impress girls. Like Detmer, he suffers from having to play a
character who's never developed beyond easy comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Heather Donahue, of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' as
a very brief romantic interest for Ryan. In this flick, she doesn't
scream or cry, but shows some skill at playing comic neurosis.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, her appearance might finally hush those
gullibles who still think she really did disappear in those
Maryland woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys and Girls''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Claire Forlani. Rated PG-13 for
sexual content. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A predictable romantic comedy for the Clearasil
set.

 &HT;    Horrific stories tell how POWs won their war
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't matter which side you were on during the Vietnam War.
Hawks and doves alike will be amazed by the emotionally compelling
documentary ``Return With Honor.'' And honor is the operative word
here. This movie is a record of honorable behavior by honorable men
under unspeakable circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   What Academy Award winners Frieda Lee Mock and Terry Sanders
(for the documentary ``Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision'') have done
is interview 20 or so American pilots who were shot down during the
war and spent anywhere from four to eight years as prisoners of
war. Interwoven into their testimonies are remarkable archival
materials: North Vietnamese newsreels documenting their captivity;
drawings made from memory by one of the former prisoners;
television clips from the era showing everything from raging
politicians to raging anti-war protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The most astonishing _ and disturbing _ stuff is the footage
made available by the now-friendly Vietnamese government. Much like
the Nazis, the North Vietnamese believed in recording their actions
for posterity as potent propaganda fodder. We see them parading
their ``catches'' through an enraged civilian population, like
trophies brought home from a hunt. We watch as these battered men
are ushered into a makeshift TV studio to tape speeches, prepared
by their captors, for world consumption. (One POW outsmarted them
by blinking ``torture'' in Morse code.)
</P>
<P>
   The interviewees, who include Sen. John McCain and former vice
presidential candidate Jim Stockdale, are now middle-aged men,
looking incongruously content in their golf shirts. They speak with
the measured discipline and strength of character that enabled them
to survive the ``Hanoi Hilton,'' as they dubbed their prison. Their
stories are frankly horrific: beatings, torture, solitary
confinement. Yet these men can also be emotional and, at times,
even wryly humorous about their ordeal. Everett Alvarez, the first
pilot to be shot down and captured, figured that he would be
protected by the Geneva Convention, which set up international
rules governing the treatment of POWs. Then he was told he wasn't a
POW; he was a war criminal. Says Alvarez: ``I remember thinking,
`Whoops, what do I do now?'''
</P>
<P>
   As their numbers grew, they developed survival tactics. A
complex series of taps, coughs and sniffles to communicate.
Exercise regimens designed for a 6-foot cell. An annual Christmas
service consisting of the Lord's Prayer and the Pledge of
Allegiance. Their tacit agreement _ their slogan, if you will _
became the movie's title. They would return with honor. That is,
they would do nothing they would be ashamed to talk about once they
made it home.
</P>
<P>
   Both the men and the movie are remarkably apolitical, especially
considering that Vietnam can still be a flash point 30 years later.
What these heroic men seem to say is that the protesters and the
politicians were equally culpable. One pilot recalls being told by
his guards that the war would be won on the streets of New York
(cut to a huge anti-war march). Another recalls President Johnson
announcing to the world that the United States was going to resort
to air strikes right before his squadron left on its mission. ``We
took off knowing the Vietnamese knew we were coming.'' And then
there's the brave and tenacious cadre of POW wives, who had to
fight Congress tooth and nail to make their husbands' plight
public.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of listening to some 50-ish men talk about torture
and survival, pus and cockroaches, sounds grueling at best. But
``Return With Honor'' is anything but. Rather, it's a truly
thrilling picture, one that blasts all the special-effects heroics
of the summer blockbusters to vapid dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return With Honor''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by Frieda Lee Mock and Terry Sanders. Not rated,
but there are intense descriptions of torture and POW life. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Don't miss these amazing profiles in courage.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``8 1/2 Women'' Not rated (contains nudity
</P>
<P>
   and perverse sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Standing.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most devoted Peter Greenaway fans may feel he's lost
his grip with this aesthetic hogwash about a father and son who
turn Dad's fancy Swiss mansion into a fantasy brothel. The
occupants range from a nun (Toni Collette) to an equestrian (Amanda
Plummer). The usual Greenaway fetishes are here: nudity, numbers,
perversion, eroticism so chilly it's anti-erotic. (ERG)1 hour, 56
minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``28 Days'' PG-13 (profanity, substance
</P>
<P>
   abuse and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Viggo Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
   The cinema's chipper girl next door (Sandra Bullock) goes clean
and sober in an addiction and rehab movie that, thankfully, isn't
an appalling clinical ``comedy'' like ``Patch Adams.'' It's a
professional, appealing comedy-drama, but in trying to be all
things to all viewers (to beer-loving Bullock fans as well as
devoted 12-steppers), it never really comes into focus. (SM) 1
hour, 43 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time'' G
</P>
<P>
   3-D Imax film
</P>
<P>
   about New York City.
</P>
<P>
   History comes alive visually in this 3-D Imax movie focusing on
New York City. It's full of big, gloriously detailed ``stereoview''
photographs depicting immigrant life at the turn of the century.
(Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Beefcake'' Unrated (simulated sex
</P>
<P>
   and lots of nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Daniel MacIvor
</P>
<P>
   and Josh Peace.
</P>
<P>
   A cheerful, campy but empty-headed look at homoeroticism.
Writer-director Thom Fitzgerald (``The Hanging Garden'') takes us
to the world of Hollywood in the 1950s. It's a place where
handsome, wide-eyed wannabes could find themselves ushered into a
poolside wonderland of well-muscled men wearing nothing but
teeny-tiny posing pouches. (SM)1 hour, 36 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Kahuna'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey,
</P>
<P>
   Danny DeVito and Bob Facinelli.
</P>
<P>
   Well worth your time for the terrific acting. Three salesmen _ a
corrosive cynic (Kevin Spacey), a resigned old-timer (Danny DeVito)
and an eager-beaver newcomer (Bob Facinelli) _ wait in their
version of hell, i.e., a hospitality suite in Wichita, for the
chance to land that one all-important client. Spacey and DeVito's
performances are bracing and brainy. (ERG) 1 hour, 31 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' PG-13 (crude humor, sexual,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence
</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   It's one super-sized Martin Lawrence. As an FBI agent on a
neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious bank robber, Lawrence
dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to impersonate a 325-pound,
small-town granny in Cartersville (the movie, however, was filmed
in Los Angeles). The results may be predictable, but with
Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also occasionally quite
funny. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bossa Nova'' R (profanity
</P>
<P>
   and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Amy Irving.
</P>
<P>
   A friendly bit of romantic fluff starring Amy Irving as a widow
who teaches English in Rio de Janeiro and is courted by a charming
attorney (Antonio Fagundes). This is both a beguiling advertisement
for a vacation in Brazil and a valentine to Irving from her
director/husband, Bruno Barreto. Think of the film as being a bit
like falling in love: light-hearted and a little silly. (ERG)1
hour, 35 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys and Girls'' PG-13 (sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
</P>
<P>
   and Claire Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiarly old-fashioned romantic comedy trapped in college
clothing, the movie throws in one innovative switch by reversing
gender roles. Here it's the girl (Claire Forlani) who's the casual
one-night-stander, and the guy (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who's the
near-virginal ingenue nattering on about having ``to work at love
if you want it to last.'' (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Center Stage'' PG-13 (sexuality and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Stiefel,
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Schull and Zoe Saldana.
</P>
<P>
   An old-fashioned show biz fantasy for teenagers with leotards
and plies, ``Center Stage'' is a kind of movie that gets retooled
every 10 years or so. Its antecedents include ``Fame,'' ``Dirty
Dancing,'' ``The Turning Point'' and even ``Flashdance.'' It's the
female version of a sports movie: Sweat and inspiration lead to
love and brief heartache, but ultimately growth, self-worth and
even stardom result. (SM)1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Paradise'' PG (thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   In Persian with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohsen Ramezani
</P>
<P>
   and Hossein Mahjub.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of a young sightless boy, it's a gorgeous meditation on
blindness, both physical and spiritual. Filled with dread and
beauty, director Majid Majidi's film summons the power of a fable,
suggesting that those with sight can be the blindest of all.
Stunningly shot by Mohammad Davudi, the film puts an emphasis on
the boy's hands stretching out into the natural world. (SM)1 hour,
30 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   D.B. Sweeney, Della Reese
</P>
<P>
   and Julianna Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Leapin' lizards! The prehistoric critters in Disney's
years-in-the-making, $200 million-plus computer animation do more
than leap. Alas, the plot is worth about two cents _ something
about an iguanodon raised by lemurs who helps a herd of dinosaurs
find a fabled nesting ground after a disastrous meteor shower.
Parents be aware: While most of the movie is Barney-tame, the scary
parts are quite scary. (ERG)1 hour, 24 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' R (bloody violence and raw language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Devon Sawa,
</P>
<P>
   Ali Larter and Kerr Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' aims for young audiences with an
``X-Files/The Wonder Years'' science/suspense plot about a kid who
escaped death from a plane crash and learns more than mortals
should about death. Our hero (Devon Sawa) and six others find
they're still targeted for death. The Grim Reaper, feeling cheated,
has plans for them. (Chris Hewitt, Knight Ridder Newspapers)1 hour,
33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones
</P>
<P>
   in Viva Rock Vegas'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mark Addy
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Yabba-dabba-don't. A new, needless, live-action ``Flintstones,''
with Mark Addy as Fred, Stephen Baldwin as Barney, and the
courtship of Wilma and Betty as the plot. Inoffensive and mildly
amusing in spots, but hardly worth a trip to the theater. (Stephen
Whitty, Newhouse News Service)1 hour, 29 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dennis Quaid
</P>
<P>
   and Jim Caviezel.
</P>
<P>
   John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) hears dead people. Specifically, he
hooks up to his dad's old ham radio set in 1999 and finds himself
talking to his dad (Dennis Quaid) in 1969. More crucially, John
knows his dad, a fireman, will be killed in a failed heroic rescue
the next day. Although over-plotted, the sentimental film has that
``what if?'' fascination. It's also a mind-bender and especially
savvy about emotional button-pushing. (ERG) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG)2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief called
back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a
British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage,
``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes
the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be lost
while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM)1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Iben Hjejle and Jack Black.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly dumped by his longtime girlfriend, record-store owner
Rob (John Cusack) rhetorically asks himself, ``What came first _
music or the misery?'' In other words, does he listen to songs
about heartbreak because he's miserable, or is he miserable because
he's listening to these songs? ``High Fidelity'' is as smart as it
is enjoyable. It's a great date movie about dating. (SM)1 hour, 54
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the Faith'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller,
</P>
<P>
   Edward Norton and Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, it's a sweet-natured hymn to love and longtime
friendship. Edward Norton (as a priest) and Ben Stiller (as a
rabbi) are pals whose childhood friend (Jenna Elfman) returns to
catch both their eyes in more than a friendly way. The first 90
minutes have charm, a sophisticated sexiness and some nice, offbeat
bits. Then things start to crash. (SM) 2 hours, 9 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Basketball'' PG-13 (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps
</P>
<P>
   and Sanaa Lathan.
</P>
<P>
   All's not fair in love or basketball is one of several themes in
this flawed but appealing romance. Q (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan) meet as kids and rival basketball players. They realize
throughout the film that they love each other as much as the game.
Director Gina Price-Bythewood (her producer is Spike Lee) may not
have scored a slam dunk, but she comes close thanks to her engaging
stars. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino)45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2'' PG-13 (intense sequences of violent
</P>
<P>
   action and some sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Thandie Newton.
</P>
<P>
   This underscripted sequel, directed by John Woo, is a
full-fledged Tom Cruise star vehicle as he battles baddies after an
ebola-like virus. The movie contains overamplified kung-fu fights
and a very long motorcycle chase consisting of quick, tight shots.
The sexy Thandie Newton holds her own in the film's first half, but
gets demoted to playing the Girl for the last act. She deserves
better. So do we. (SM) 2 hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) 22 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Return With Honor'' Not rated (contains intense descriptions
</P>
<P>
   of torture and POW life)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by
</P>
<P>
   Frieda Lee Mock and Terry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which side of the Vietnam War you were on, you won't
want to miss this compelling documentary that profiles 20 or so
American pilots who spent between four to eight years as prisoners
of war in the so-called Hanoi Hilton. Mixed in with their
interviews is some remarkable archival material. Listening to
middle-aged men talk about torture and survival may sound grueling,
but the movie is anything but. (ERG) 1 hour, 32 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Trip'' R (sexuality, crude humor,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Green.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Ivan Reitman (``Animal House,'' ``Ghostbusters''),
``Road Trip'' is about a quartet of guys who try to retrieve a
missent sex video. The trip has its share of gross-outs _ from
making fun of large women to doing something completely disgusting
with French toast. It's a witless, dumb and dumber version of
``Animal House,'' and its saving grace, MTV genius Tom Green, isn't
in it enough. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 31 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson,
</P>
<P>
   Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright.
</P>
<P>
   You can dig it. Sporting the original Oscar-winning theme song,
the ``Shaft'' 2000, starring Samuel L. Jackson, is one bad
I'm-messin'-with-your-head movie. While the plot is a trumped-up
trifle involving both a suspected racist killer (Christian Bale)
and whacked-out drug lord (Jeffrey Wright), the movie clicks
because of the performances. Wright steals the picture, directed by
John Singleton. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Noon'' PG-13 (action violence, some
</P>
<P>
   drug humor, profanity and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan
</P>
<P>
   and Owen Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Martial arts whiz Jackie Chan plays a Chinese imperial guardsman
who volunteers to head to the United States to rescue a kidnapped
princess. ``Noon'' lets Chan use moose antlers, horse shoes and
pine saplings as weapons, take a big fall from a mission bell
tower, and contend with a drunken horse. The film lassos all the
revisionist laughs and action scenes that last summer's ``Wild Wild
West'' botched. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tracey Ullman, Woody Allen,
</P>
<P>
   Elaine May and Hugh Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen remembers how to make us laugh in this comedy about
lightweight crooks who bumble into lots of cash. As Allen's
big-haired blond wife, Frenchy, Tracey Ullman is a pitch-perfect
character who can ground even her silliest role in genuine feeling.
Elaine May, who steals every scene she's in, plays Frenchy's cousin
May, easily the dimmest creature in a movie loaded with low-watt
bulbs. (SM)1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' PG (some cartoon violence)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore and Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a good sign when a `toon's backgrounds are more
interesting than the plot and characters. ``Titan'' is an animation
set in the 31st century after Earth has been destroyed. The human
race's only hope is a guy named Cale (voiced by Matt Damon) who's
the key to the missing Titan project designed by his dad. Like most
sci-fi flicks, this one is more of a super-deluxe episode of the
old ``Jonny Quest'' series. (ERG) At metro theaters. 1 hour, 30
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571'' PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey,
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton
</P>
<P>
   and Jon Bon Jovi.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey leads a reconnaissance mission to take over
a damaged German sub and capture the secret Nazi coding device
that's confounding U.S. efforts to win the war. Despite a
predictable script, blatant cliches and a penchant for
chest-beating fanfare music, ``U-571'' has plenty of furious
action, occasional suspense and lots of super-loud booms. It's no
``Das Boot,'' but it can suck you in. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 56
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin Suicides'' R (strong thematic
</P>
<P>
   elements involving teenagers)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst
</P>
<P>
   and Josh Hartnett.
</P>
<P>
   This shimmery, darkly comic adaptation of Jeffrey Eumenides
novel about five teen girls and the boys who obsess over them marks
the assured, often inspired feature debut from writer-director
Sofia Coppola. (Yes, that Sofia, who was unwisely cast by dad
Francis in his ``Godfather III.'') She takes a dreamy,
cinematically difficult book and creates a visually hypnotic movie.
(SM)1 hour, 36 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Heart Is'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natalie Portman
</P>
<P>
   and Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   A corn pone comedy-drama about a single mom, made with enough
polish to be a guilty pleasure. Natalie Portman plays the pregnant
teen who heads for California and winds up becoming the Wal-Mart
Mom in Oklahoma. She gets good support from Stockard Channing,
Ashley Judd and Sally Field. (SM)2 hours. C+

 &HT;    Dig those wild `Shaft' characters
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The defining moment in ``Shaft'' _ not the 1971 sex-machine
version where Richard Roundtree crashes through a window in
off-the-rack fly threads, but the new, nearly sexless one where
Samuel L. Jackson struts the center line of a busy downtown street
clad in an Armani trench coat _ has to do with instruction.
</P>
<P>
   In full-force New Age Shaftadelic law enforcement, Jackson wades
into a pack of laughing street hoods. He grabs the leader by his
no-account red clothing, pulls a menacing-looking gun and begins
pistol-whipping the punk's face. Whack! ``What's my name?!''
Jackson shouts. Whack! ``What's my name?!'' Whack!
</P>
<P>
   ``John Shaft,'' the hood finally sputters between spits of
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Well, go to the head of the class, my man.
</P>
<P>
   With good, sometimes even remarkable, performances and sporting
the fully intact, Oscar-winning original theme song, the 2000
``Shaft'' is one bad, at times ultraviolent,
I'm-messin'-with-your-head movie. Of course, while playing the
original John Shaft's nephew, who's also named John Shaft,
Jackson's favorite word to repeat over and over is ``mother-
</P>
<P>
   (shut your mouth).'' And Roundtree's extended cameo gives him
enough screen time to draw on a cigar, affectionately call a
co-worker ``dog'' and exit stage left with two luscious, fur-clad
chicks dangling from his arms.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is some kind of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of hard to figure out whether you're watching a new
movie or antique television. Director John Singleton goes for TV's
Quinn Martin Productions stamp, telegraphing most every plot twist
as if he's making a ``Barnaby Jones'' episode and even marking
scene changes with angling film cuts. Burt Reynolds' TV detective
Dan August seems as likely to show up onscreen as John Shaft.
</P>
<P>
   The story is also a trumped-up trifle. The film instantly plays
a race card, with Jackson investigating a filthy-rich white
blowhard (Christian Bale) who's suspected of hurling racial slurs
and then pummeling a black man with a steel pole. There's an eerily
uncooperative witness (Toni Collette of ``The Sixth Sense,'' in a
role that thoroughly wastes her talent); a whacked-out drug lord
(Jeffrey Wright); dirty cops; a funny, foul-mouthed driver (Busta
Rhymes); a tattooed squealer; and more ammunition, it seems, than
all three previous ``Shaft'' flicks put together.
</P>
<P>
   What really clicks are some of the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Bale's white-boy trash is as headstrong as the stalking killer
he played so well in ``American Psycho.'' And Jackson percolates
much of the power that moviegoers have come to expect from one of
this country's finest actors.
</P>
<P>
   But while the film does pack a couple of wild plot twists, its
biggest surprise is Jeffrey Wright (``Basquiat'' and Broadway's
``Angels in America''). As Dominican drug lord Peoples Hernandez,
he's terrific, strutting an affected walk, wielding a madman's ice
pick and effectively stealing the picture.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a hard thing to do when Jackson is shouting, ``What's
my name?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright.
Directed by John Singleton. Rated R for strong violence and
profanity. 1 hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: You can dig enough of it.

 &HT;    Animated `Titan A.E.' mostly lost in space
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give ``Titan A.E.'' credit for one thing. It certainly starts
with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   Some human-hating aliens called the Drej blow up good ol' Earth
in the first five minutes. Unfortunately, the movie is all downhill
from there.
</P>
<P>
   The picture, set in the 31st century, picks up 16 years later. A
few humans managed to escape the blast, but they're essentially
treated like the homeless of the galaxy (which, in a sense . . .).
Among them is a third-millennium dude named Cale (voiced by Matt
Damon), who's been slacking around a salvage station resenting the
fact that he never saw his inventor-father again after the big
bang. What Cale doesn't know is that his dad left him a bequest: a
map imprinted on his palm that reveals the location of his father's
Titan project, which has the potential to revive what's left of the
human race.
</P>
<P>
   Cale couldn't care less until some Drej try to kill him and he's
rescued by a space buccaneer named Korso (voiced by Bill Pullman;
prototype by Han Solo). Korso, who knew Cale's father, persuades
him to help find the Titan. So they set off, assisted on their
mission by Korso's motley crew: a gorgeous female pilot (Drew
Barrymore), an acid-tongued reptilian thingie (Nathan Lane), a
brainy Truman Capote-ish thingie (John Leguizamo) and a brawny
kangaroo-griffin thingie (Janeane Garofalo).
</P>
<P>
   Co-directed by animators Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, ``Titan''
mixes everything from ``Star Wars'' to ``Star Trek'' (especially
``The Wrath of Khan''). The obvious target is the teenage action
lover. But while much of the background animation is arresting _
fiery supernovas, a floating forest of hydrospheres, crystalline
ice rings that can crush a spaceship like a tin can _ the
characters look and act like leftovers from an old ``Jonny Quest''
episode. They're two-dimensional in every sense.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that 12-year-olds might show up for the first
weekend or two. But once word of mouth gets around, ``Titan A.E.''
is likely to be more tiny than titanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Drew Barrymore, Matt Damon and Bill
Pullman. Directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. Rated PG for
cartoon violence. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: It's not a good sign when a 'toon's backgrounds are
better than the plot and characters.

 &HT;    Visually rich story of blind boy tells a powerful fable
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bit of intentional irony, a blind boy named Mohammad
(Mohsen Ramezani) is the central character of a visually rapturous
movie. ``The Color of Paradise'' engulfs his small frame in a
landscape whose intense beauty he can't himself see.
</P>
<P>
   Not with his eyes, anyway, but he's adept at communing with
nature _ his fingertips forever coaxing meaning from the world. He
deciphers hidden Braille letters in the bumpy pods of wheat and in
the pebbly surface of a stream bed. The cries of nesting birds
represent a secret language he hopes to unlock. You could say he's
more appreciative of the physical world than those whose eyes it
fills every day. It's a mystery he wants to crack.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian writer-director Majid Majidi (``The Children of
Heaven'') begins his moving drama in a drab urban setting: the
school for the blind where 8-year-old Mohammad waits for his father
long after the other children have been picked up by parents for
summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   When his widowed father, Hashem (Hossein Mahjoub), finally
arrives, he regards his son with a mixture of guilt, helplessness
and revulsion. You fear that the worst will come to pass.
``Paradise'' is filled with a nameless tension, as Hashem takes
Mohammad home to the family farm in the rolling mountains of
northern Iran, where his doting grandmother (Salime Feizi) and two
sisters show him all the love his father can't, or won't.
</P>
<P>
   For Hashem, Mohammad's blindness represents a personal shame,
failure. He sees his son as an obstacle to the marriage he's
arranging with the daughter of a local family. Like a guilty
secret, Mohammad is whisked out of sight, to the workshop of a
blind carpenter who agrees to teach him the trade. But all Mohammad
can feel is sorrow, abandoned (he thinks) by his family, and by the
deity who has brought him sightless into the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reach out everywhere for God,'' Mohammad cries, in the
movie's most powerful scene, an emotional passage played
heart-rendingly by young Ramezani (in his film debut).
</P>
<P>
   Filled with dread and beauty, ``The Color of Paradise'' summons
the power of a fable, suggesting that those with sight can be the
blindest of all. Stunningly shot by Mohammad Davudi, the film puts
an emphasis on young Mohammad's hands stretching out into the
natural world. Director Majidi uses his palette of sloping meadows
and animal sounds to terrific poetic effect. It's a movie you feel
as much as see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Paradise''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohsen Ramezani and Hossein Mahjub. Rated PG for
thematic elements. In Persian with subtitles. 1 hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A gorgeous meditation on blindness, both physical
and spiritual.

 &HT;    Director lets self-indulgence color chilly `8 1/2'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time I took a pal to a Peter Greenaway movie _ ``The
Pillow Book'' _ the friendship almost ended. And I'm talking about
someone who not only endured but was actually intrigued by such
outer-limits fare as David Cronenberg's ``Crash'' and David Lynch's
``Lost Highway.''
</P>
<P>
   For myself, Greenaway has always been guilty perversion _ sort
of like a combination of a hidden heroin addiction and reading old
Archie comic books from the 1950s. I was knocked out by ``The
Draughtman's Contract,'' fascinated by ``Drowning by Numbers,''
admiring of ``Prospero's Books'' and even found something redeeming
in the immensely disturbing ``The Belly of the Architect.'' As for
Greenaway's relatively famous ``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and
Her Lover,''
</P>
<P>
   I always thought of it as ``American Pie'' for art-movie lovers:
a gross-out flick with bite.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is a lengthy prologue to admitting that even I gave
up on Greenaway's newest film, ``8 1/2 Women.'' An homage of sorts
to Fellini's famed phantasmagoria ``8 1/2,'' Greenaway gives us a
wealthy father (John Standing) and satyric son (Matthew Delamere),
both bereaved by the recent death of their wife-mother. They seek
solace in each other's arms (literally), which sparks a better
idea: Why not turn dad's fancy Swiss mansion into a kind of fantasy
brothel? Bring out the funk, bring on the girls.
</P>
<P>
   The son, who manages some gambling houses in Japan, imports an
in-debt player (Shizuka Inoh), a no-nonsense businesswoman (Vivian
Wu from ``The Pillow Book'') and a woman (Kirina Mano) who longs to
be as ultrafeminine as a female impersonator from the kabuki
theater. Other additions include a nun shaved from head to toe
(Toni Collette from ``The Sixth Sense''), an injured equestrian
(Amanda Plummer) who loves horses and her giant pig, and a knowing
British professional call girl (Polly Walker). And so on. And so
on. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled throughout are the director's usual obsessions:
numbers, nudity, eroticism so chilly it's anti-erotic. And,
naturally, the film looks exquisite, even when there's nothing
worth looking at.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Greenaway is starting to remind me of the late Andy
Kaufman _ creating less for an audience than for himself. It's an
annoying selfishness that renders the viewer superfluous. ``8 1/2
Women'' isn't juicy enough to be appalling or even truly offensive.
But it's often downright boring. And there's something about its
open disdain that's insulting. If you're a Greenaway fan, you may
have to try it, but otherwise, there are more rewarding
``difficult'' movies out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``8 1/2 Women''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Standing. Directed by Peter Greenaway. Not rated,
but contains nudity and perverse sexual themes.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 56 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Peter Greenaway loses his grip.

<P>
   Ask your average Super Bowl veteran to describe the worst injury
of his football career, and chances are, he won't answer quite the
way Mark Adickes did the other day:
</P>
<P>
   ``I tore my medial collateral, my anterior cruciate and my
posterior cruciate.'' That met with puzzled silence, so Adickes
elaborated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four main ligaments to your knee: the medial and
lateral collaterals outside, and two in the middle that criscross,
the cruciates,'' he said. ``If they pop, your femur _ the bone in
your thigh _ can actually slide forward over your tibia, the shin
bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Adickes, a former offensive lineman for the National Football
League's Washington Redskins, graduated from Harvard Medical School
last Thursday. This summer, seven years after retiring from the
NFL, he will begin an orthopedic surgery residency at the
prestigious Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., treating injuries like
the ones he suffered on the field.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 5 inches and 350 pounds, the 39-year-old Adickes still
looks every bit the lineman. But in a commencement speech that drew
raucous cheers, he thanked his professors, his 167 classmates, and
his wife Jackie for transforming him ``from a jock to a doc.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of his life, he said in the speech, his brain had
served mainly as ``ballast for a football helmet.'' Now, he raves
about his diverse classmates, his pulmonology professor, and the
awe he felt when he plunged his hand into the chest of a man in
cardiac arrest and massaged his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated school,'' he said in an interview. His father, a
Lutheran chaplain for the Army, moved the family from New York, to
Berlin and Munich, Germany, and, finally, to Texas. Adickes said he
studied ``just enough to stay out of trouble with my parents _
sometimes not even.''
</P>
<P>
   At Baylor University in Houston, he paid more attention to his
football scholarship than his business major, a strategy that paid
off financially, if not intellectually. In 1983, he was drafted
into the now-defunct United States Football League to play for the
LA Express.
</P>
<P>
   His first crushing knee injury occurred in his second pro game.
Playing left offensive tackle, he was busy blocking a Birmingham
Stallions' defensive end when his own teammate tried to block a
blitzing linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those guys fell into my knee,'' he said. ``It bent all
the way backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   That was when he stopped thinking that guys who writhed in agony
on the field were ``just being wimps.'' He also gained a deep
respect for his doctors and physical therapists. A seed was
planted. But Adickes was still focused on football.
</P>
<P>
   When the USFL went bust, he went to the Kansas City Chiefs as a
first-round draft pick. Five years later, he joined Washington,
just in time for its 1992 Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   Adickes likes to say that graduating from Harvard was a bigger
thrill than winning the Super Bowl. But, ever modest, he admits
that's partly because by 1992 he was a second-string player. It was
time to think about a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Three people inspired him to consider medicine: Roy Smythe, a
Baylor teammate who quit football and became a doctor; Pat Egoscue,
a physical therapist who eased his back troubles; and Adickes'
wife, Jackie, whom he met through Redskins quarterback Mark Rypien.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Adickes was planning to become a physical therapist.
But Jackie asked him, ``Why work for a doctor when you can be a
doctor?''
</P>
<P>
   He took two years of pre-med classes at George Mason University
in Virginia and got the best grades of his life. He scored in the
99th percentile on the MCAT, the standardized test for medical
applicants. Still, the University of Minnesota rejected him because
of his sketchy college grades.
</P>
<P>
   So the acceptance letter from Harvard came as a shock. He was
terrified they'd made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, Adickes remembered how intimidated he felt when
he first met his college teammates: bigger, stronger, bruising
All-Americans. Now, his nemesis was petite Neda Ratanawongsa, a
classmate who started medical school at age 19. Not only did she
seem to remember everything, she came up with complex answers while
he was still puzzling over the questions. He says he thought, ``If
this is how smart everybody is, I'm in the wrong place.''
</P>
<P>
   But he found his stride, enjoying the problem-solving of
Harvard's New Pathway curriculum, which asks students to budget
their time and help teach each other.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in the emergency room, he was even recognized as a
celebrity by a Redskins fan whose bashed leg he was assigned to
fix. For Thursday's commencement, he donned a cap and the largest
black gown Harvard could find. He brought his three children _
Sophia, 6, Micah, 4, and Gabriella, 2 _ on stage with him. They got
teddy bears; he got a diploma that read, in Latin, Universitas
Harvardiana.
</P>
<P>
   Adickes hopes to work with children, but also play a special
role, as a doctor who understands professional athletes. He knows
their constant fear of a sudden career-ending injury. And he has
felt their pain. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different surgeons have different skill levels,'' he said. ``I
don't know where I'll rank, compared to some of the guys I saw
operate. But a lot of diagnosing is just being able to talk to
someone and know what happened. And from that perspective I think I
have a leg up.''

   Once upon a time, guys like this might have been trying to crank
out the great American novel. Or peddle a screenplay in Hollywood.
Ken Levine, in fact, actually was a scriptwriter for a while. But
now the 33-year-old programmer is creating characters for a
much &UR;  &LR; smaller screen, although not necessarily a smaller audience.
Ken Levine's got game.
</P>
<P>
   Levine is one of a gaggle of video-game entrepreneurs, former
gameboys and an occasional gamegirl who hunkered down circa 1980
with a joystick and, say, an Atari 2600. Today, they're working
long hours and bucking longer odds to create the computer and
console game hits that dot a chancy and changing business. But high
risk can mean high yield: video games have grown to rival the movie
industry as a cash cow _ $6.1 billion in US sales
</P>
<P>
   last year.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, who spent a short time as a Hollywood scriptwriter after
graduating from Vassar in 1988, is the majority owner of Irrational
Games in South Boston, which is developing two game titles with
seven-figure production budgets. Come nightfall he goes home, works
some more, and, yes, often fires up a game or two. ``I was up until
3 o'clock playing `Mario Golf' the other night,'' he sheepishly
declared on a recent afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go off somewhere else and make more money,'' added
Levine, who was sitting inside new office space that is semi-filled
with about 20 programmers, designers, and artists. ``But I'm part
of a technology/art form that's still trying to find itself. I'm
helping to define it. It's like the movie industry at the turn of
the century. It's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Herein the standard bio for many such grown-up vidkids:
</P>
<P>
   Eager gamer spends youth jockeying Atari, Nintendo, family
computer, etc. Teaches self computer programming. Continues gaming
in college, graduates (maybe), latches on with game company as
tester. Eventually becomes game designer, meets kindred worker who
shares view that employer's games suck. Pair decides to make games
that rule. Jump-start own development company, land contract with
game publisher (maybe), spend three years producing their first
game. Survive mainly on caffeine and pizza.

   Adam Levesque, at 33, knows the scenario well. When Levesque was
a teenager, his grandfather took a personal loan to buy him a
Commodore 64 computer. He also cut his gaming chops on Atari and
Nintendo, dropped out of Boston College after less than a year, and
eventually found his way to Papyrus Design Group in Somerville,
Mass., a hothouse for game developers tha thas made its name
producing auto-racing titles.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Levesque met 31-year-old Princeton graduate
John Wheeler, a programmer with whom he would later form Blue Fang
Games in his basement. One attempt to produce a game never got off
the ground, but Blue Fang recently moved its growing cadre of nine
employees into spiffy honest-to-God office space _ leaving their
backyard touch-football games behind _ and Levesque says the
company is very close to cutting a deal with a major publisher for
a computer strategy game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of game gene in us that just kind of takes
off,'' Levesque says of game players who grow up to be game makers.
</P>
<P>
   (There are two types of video games. PC games are played on
computers and tend to attract a somewhat older audience than
console games, which are played on hardware such as the Sony
Playstation. Local developers tend to make PC games, although
Irrational Games is currently creating ``The Lost'' for the
Playstation.)
</P>
<P>
   Creating video games involves what Jonathan Adams calls the Cool
Factor. Adams, a freelance game designer and developer who teaches
interactive design at Boston University, talks about the response
he gets from folks when they learn he creates games and gets paid
for it: ``Ahhhhhhhhh, that's cooooooool.'' It's definitely not like
telling someone that you cook up word processing programs for a
living. ``People are passionate about this stuff,'' Adams says.
</P>
<P>
   They'd better be. Making games for small screens involves more
than long hours, plastic bottles of Jolt, and window shades drawn
to prevent screen glare. The chances of becoming the next Sid
Meiers or John Carmack _ respectively, the creators of the
mega-hits ``Civilization'' and ``Doom,'' and thereby major heroes
within the genre _ are computer-chip slim. Most games lose money,
and many game ideas never see a screen. Last month, local
developers were startled to learn of the shuttering of
Cambridge-based Looking Glass Studios, which had 60 employees,
produced the popular System Shock series of action games, and was
considered an area role model. Reason given: out of money.
</P>
<P>
   And money is what's needed. The multimedia complexity of today's
games means that an outfit such as CogniToy, literally a
mom-and-pop enterprise located in a small wooden 19th century
building in Acton, Mass., is considered to be operating largely on
a prayer. After all, only $500,000 was put into the six-person
company's first game, ``MindRover,'' which CogniToy has
self-published on the Internet since November. Most game budgets,
meanwhile, run into millions of dollars. Development involves
programmers, designers, artists, and sound engineers. With so much
money at stake, hit-driven video game publishers _ think of them as
being like book publishers, while game developers are like authors
_ are reluctant to invest in developers who don't have a track
record. Meanwhile, the sands are shifting beneath an emerging
generation of console games and the expected increase of computer
gaming on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   CogniToy is the child _ they also have two of the
flesh-and-blood variety _ of Kent and Kim Quirk, a pair of
Dartmouth graduates who originally hit it off when they discovered
that they each owned a programmable calculator on which games could
be written. Some two decades later, they hired their babysitter, a
high school student, to help develop a prototype of ``MindRover.''
The Quirks can't yet afford such luxuries as paying themselves
salaries. ``We draw some cash,'' Kent Quirk says, ``but basically
just enough to pay for the mortgage and groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Blue Fang's Levesque: ``If you really look at this, you'd
say that we're all crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that the subculture of start-up game developers is
a kind of loose community. Many of them _ along with a few wannabes
_ even meet once a month via an informal group known as Post
Mortem, downing beer and burgers while fluently speaking the
language of games. (Sims, RPGs, maps, deathmatch levels, expansion
packs) It's a gathering wherein Meiers is an idol because he made a
great game, not because he made great money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What functions in this is passion,'' Levine contends. ``You
have to love games. The dot-com model doesn't work, because this
isn't a place where people think about an exit strategy. They do
this for the product, not to figure out how and when the company is
going to be sold.''
</P>

   Mathew Williams say he's doing this ``to create the job I want
for the rest of my life.'' The 24-year-old Harvard College alumnus
and his 23-year-old partner, Babson College grad CP McBee, are
holed up in Williams's apartment with a half dozen like-minded
denizens. They are living in no small part on home-cooked Mexican
food and takeout Dunkin' Donuts while working on ``Prelude to
Darkness,'' a 3-D role-playing game they hope to release via the
Internet this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grew up on a cattle ranch in west Texas, while McBee,
the son of jazz bassist Cecil McBee, was raised in New York City.
The two former kid gamers met three years ago while working at
Impressions Software Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the games we were testing there, we thought they were
awful,'' says McBee, singing a familiar song. Solution: start up
Zero Sum Software, a shoestring operation that nevertheless belies
its name via the $100,000 invested in the company by what McBee
describes as ``the rich father of a high school friend.''
</P>
<P>
   No one at Zero Sum is over 25. One employee hails from India,
another from South Africa, another from Canada. ``Sometimes we
sleep, and sometimes we don't,'' says Williams. ``Sometimes we play
`Starcraft' all night,'' he adds, referring to the hugely
successful alien-versus-alien game that was published two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two miles away in Cambridge, 38-year-old Rick Goodman
and 40-year-old Dara-Lynn Pelechatz operate in a different kind of
environment. Stainless Steel Studios was founded by the pair three
years ago after Goodwin and his brother, Tony, had collaborated on
the hit strategy game ``Age of Empires'' (more than three million
copies sold.) Now SSS is spending three years developing ``Empire
Earth'' (``Lead a fledgling civilization through 500,000 years of
human history!'') for the PC via a seven-figure budget. Goodman and
Pelechatz have landed a top publisher in Sierra Studios, espouse a
highly disciplined approach to their craft, and employ a couple of
dozen young techies who work in a comfortable 4,000-square-foot
space on the fringe of MIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots and lots of stories about game developers
starting in garages, but that's getting harder and harder to do,''
says Goodman, a former board-gamer-cum-PC-gamer who is the
company's lead designer. ``When `Civilization' came out in 1991, it
cost $175,000 to produce. Now we're talking games that easily cost
10 times that amount. But I think everyone who's a gamer still
thinks of himself as a potential game developer.''
</P>
<P>
   And everyone who's a game developer thinks of himself as a
gamer. Consider Levesque, who spent hours upon hours playing video
games as an urban teenager. Today he's married, has two kids, lives
in the suburbs, and is Blue Fang Games' CEO and head creative
honcho. Much has changed, but one thing hasn't. ``I still buy every
game that comes out,'' muses the once and future gameboy.

IN '92, MONTGOMERIE CAME SO CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ When _ or if _ he prevails in a major
championship, Colin Montgomerie figures he has a sense of how it
will feel. After all, he experienced the sensation for a short
while when the US Open was played at Pebble Beach in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I holed a very good putt at the last hole, a 5-footer
left-to-right and I must admit, I felt over the putt that it was to
win the tournament,'' said Montgomerie, who was making his US Open
debut that year. The Scotsman converted the par-saving putt to
close with a 2-under 70 and finish at even-par 288, which observers
felt would be good enough given the winds had kicked up
ferociously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happened to play the first six holes without much wind,''
said Montgomerie. ``Six clear holes that the leaders didn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Tom Kite's 3-under total would plummet once he got into
the teeth of a wind that was howling at a steady 35 miles per hour.
None other than Jack Nicklaus offered congratulations to
Montgomerie, who finished as Kite was playing the fifth hole. It
proved to be a jinx of a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give credit to Tom Kite,'' said Montgomerie, not at all
haunted by the fact that Kite put together a 72 to finish at
3-under 285 to win his only major championship. ``And also to Jeff
Sluman (71_287), who played very, very well to take second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things. It could have happened, and it
just didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   It did, however, set him off on a wonderful run of US Open
appearances. He has made the cut in all eight of his starts, with
that third in 1992 alongside a second in 1997, a T-2 in 1994 when
he lost a playoff at Oakmont with Ernie Els, and a top 10 in 1996.
Only once has he finished outside the top 30.
</P>
<P>
   But Montgomerie knows that great players are measured by major
titles and on that count he is empty. He knows that, but tries to
keep things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there's slightly more pressure on the situation, but it
won't affect me in any way, shape or form if I do happen to win a
major. I've just been unfortunate at the end that someone has done
better than me, and that's the way of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike 1992, Montgomerie does not come in here an unknown
entity. For seven straight years he has led the Order of Merit
(European Tour money list) and racked up 24 victories. As Seve
Ballesteros and Nick Faldo have faded from the world stage,
Montgomerie is the pride from across the pond, an exquisite
ball-striker and virtual top-10 lock every time he tees it up. No
doubt, he said, he's a much better player than the last time he
walked these links.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm stronger, I'm mentally stronger than I was, and
feel I can cope with the situation better than I could in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation in 1992 was such that no one would like to see a
repeat of it. Players such as Hale Irwin claim the final round that
year was ``over the top'' and virtually unplayable. USGA officials
do not disagree, but the problem was not course set-up, but a fluke
of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three days that year we had clouds and fog,'' said Tim
Moraghan of the USGA. ``Then, on Sunday, the winds whipped up and
dried out greens that were not very good to start with. The greens
now are totally different and that wouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Sindelar remembers standing on the tee at the 106-yard
seventh hole and watching Nick Faldo hit his shot over the green.
``Then I hit a 6-iron and heard the crowd go crazy. I didn't know
why until I found out I was the first guy in something like 20 to
put a ball on the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman said he had a long putt up a slope to the pin at the
back of the 17th green, but when he came up short, the wind blew
the ball right back at him. ``I had a 30-footer for birdie and a
40-footer for par,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kite stood to make a sure bogey at the seventh but his chip
across the green hit the pin and dropped for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   It's all just part of the mystique of golf, said Montgomerie.
``I've been through enough to learn and to cope with any situation
that's thrown against me. I just hope Lady Luck throws in a shot or
two to my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he is owed it?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think you're owed anything. You make your own luck
and your own game. But I'm a great believer that the winner has
never stood up and written a speech and said he was unlucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite true, though there was that time once when the third-place
finisher was congratulated on his victory.

HERD MENTALITY RIDES ROUGHSHOD OVER SOME FIDELITY FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes `Losing ground' text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stockbrokers have an old saying about the market: The trend is
your friend. The people who sell mutual funds at Fidelity
Investments might be less sanguine on fashions of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Fund investors have been buying with a herd mentality for years
now. Aggressive growth funds are getting most of the new money on
the table today. Not long ago, the same winner-take-almost-all
psychology was pushing the chips into index funds.
</P>
<P>
   The trend of the moment has turned Janus Capital Corp. into a
powerhouse at the expense of most other mutual-fund companies.
Before Janus, the Vanguard Group soared on the popularity of
indexing.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Fidelity, so big it has funds of every stripe
investing serious amounts of money. The span of investments, more
than 250 funds, guarantees Fidelity will be simultaneously in and
out of favor as long as trends drive so much of America's
investing.
</P>
<P>
   The fund industry's giant appears locked in the middle of the
pack with no obvious way to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, the world's biggest fund company, ranked seventh in
net sales through April, according to Financial Research Corp.
Those sales figures ranked third in Boston, trailing results at
Putnam Investments and MFS Investment Management.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has some big sales hits in its portfolio, principally
its two most visible aggressive growth funds and a handful of
sector funds. But the lion's share of those sales gains are
canceled out by money exiting less popular Fidelity funds,
particularly growth and income vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   No one is crying for Fidelity. It still pulled in nearly $3.7
billion in net new money through April and that figure increased to
more than $5.1 billion by the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
   But trend investing has created a mutual fund world with one
sales leader and a crowd of followers somewhere in the dust. Janus
and its pack of wildly popular growth funds pulled down more than
$32 billion through April, more than its next five competitors
combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just a growth shop like many of our competitors,''
said Fidelity spokeswoman Anne Crowley. ``If you look just at our
growth funds, which is what happens when you look at Janus, you
would see sales that are significant and competitive with others
focused just on that market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's growth funds and sector funds, the parts of its
investment roster that would be compared head to head with Janus,
recorded net sales of $26 billion by the end of May. But start
subtracting elsewhere and you're back to that $5.1 billion
company-wide total.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor pushing Fidelity into the middle of the sales
pack: Most of its biggest funds aren't generating very much new
business.
</P>
<P>
   Calculate sales activity and investment performance among
Fidelity's 10 largest retail mutual funds and you will discover
seven of them managed less money by May 31 than they did at the
start of the year. As a group, they managed $16 billion less than
they did last Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The three largest funds, all a bit smaller now, are competing at
a disadvantage because they are technically closed to new
investors. But millions of customers can buy at least some of three
funds _ Magellan, Contrafund, and Growth and Income _ because they
remained open to existing shareholders and participants in some
retirement plans at the time they were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's biggest sales winners, its Growth Company and
Aggressive Growth funds, appear to have generated net new sales in
the range of $13 billion through May and can compete dollar for
dollar with nearly any fund sold by Janus. They ranked second and
third through April, trailing only Janus Worldwide in net sales.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes a lot of sales to make up for the investors who are
giving up on value or growth and income oriented investment
products. Fidelity's Growth and Income fund alone has shrunk by
more than $6.6 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of actual investment performance, Fidelity can go head
to head as well. James Lowell, editor of Fidelity Investor, an
independent newsletter, said Fidelity's leading aggressive growth
funds are delivering better results than comparable Janus products
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to Fidelity's business, selling mutual funds,
the industry giant seems stuck in the middle of the pack as long it
offers big funds for every fashion in a world that has lost its
taste for diversification.

&HT;     WARRIORS NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GAIL BENSINGER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 21st century has barely begun, and already
it promises to be just as bloody and war-raddled as all the others
that have gone before.
</P>
<P>
   Names many of us would be hard-put to find on a map _ Congo,
Sierra Leone, Colombia, Sri Lanka _ continue to yield a ghastly
toll in body counts and interrupted lives and failed governments.
</P>
<P>
   And yet war, like other human institutions, has evolved.
Consider this fact: During World War I, at the beginning of the
20th century, 90 percent of those who died were wearing uniforms.
Many of them died of something other than actual warfare _ bad
medicine or influenza or accidents _ but the overwhelming number of
victims were combatants.
</P>
<P>
   At century's end, however, 90 percent of the victims in the
collapse of the former Yugoslavia were civilians, intentionally
turned into targets as former neighbors turned murderous. The
century that began with ``the war to end all wars'' moved on to
``genocide'' and ended with ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way we acquired verbal shorthand for the slaughter of
noncombatants: the Holocaust, of course, but also Dresden and
Hiroshima and the Blitz, My Lai and the Khmer Rouge, the intifada
and the contras and the disappeared, Northern Ireland and Rwanda
and East Timor. General populations became the targets, not the
``collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Two types of warfare are waged these days, high-tech and
low-tech, and civilians are at risk in both.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech warfare, obviously, belongs to the United States and
the other industrialized nations capable of conducting assaults
without ever having to see the whites of the enemy's eyes. Kosovo
was the most obvious example, but so are Chechnya and the
continuing bombardments of Iraq. Precision bombing and missile
technology are the chief weapons in such arsenals. The point is for
the country waging such a war not to lose any troops on the ground,
or indeed even to have any troops on the ground until after the
shooting stops and the post-war ``peacekeeping'' begins.
</P>
<P>
   Low-tech warfare is far messier, both to combatants and to the
general population. Very occasionally, as in Ethiopia and Eritrea,
such a war involves two opposing armies. More common is for one
side _ or both _ to be some sort of insurgency movement with a
loose sense of organization, and much of the killing is up close
and personal.
</P>
<P>
   The byproducts of such a war are horrific: rape camps, child
soldiers, mutilations, forced removals of entire populations,
intentional starvation, land mining, destruction of farmland and
livestock, decimation of religious and cultural monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to this insidious stew is the economic system that
sustains such warfare. Arms are easy to get in the international
bazaar, but they are expensive. Governments of impoverished nations
at war don't pay for health care and education and clean water and
other things that would make civilians' lives better. Insurgencies
raise money through illegal sales of commodities that find plenty
of customers in the First World _ diamonds, emeralds, oil, timber,
gold, drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet alongside the evolution of warfare from dueling armies to
endangered civilians, another 20th-century idea has developed:
accountability. The Geneva conventions and all the other pacts and
treaties that comprise the growing body of international
humanitarian law, or IHL, set out the rules for warfare and the
treatment of combatants and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The codification of such law does not prevent war or keep it
from taking its terrible toll. But the existence of rules and
war-crimes tribunals to try the people who break them gives the
world a methodology for making sure those responsible do not get
away with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon pays attention to IHL in its planning for high-tech
warfare. Troops get briefings on war law and war crimes as part of
combat training. In planning each action, military lawyers versed
in IHL sit in command centers next to officers selecting targets
for high-tech sorties. Such vetting didn't prevent such spectacular
lapses as last year's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
but attention is being paid.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of televised war and instant information,
investigations of possible war crimes have been speeded up, too.
Rather than wait until unconditional surrender, as was the case in
the Nuremburg trials in Germany after World War II, investigators
now begin collecting evidence while the shooting is going on.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, refugees were interviewed as soon as they came over
the border for information that could lead to the pursuit of war
criminals _ for example, possible sites of mass killings and
descriptions of those conducting forced removals.
</P>
<P>
   Two international tribunals are pursuing war criminals from
Bosnia and Rwanda. Both courts are slow and bureaucratic, and many
of the worst perpetrators have yet to be arrested, much less tried.
But both have full dockets, grinding away at crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent Rome-based tribunal, known as the International
Criminal Court, was approved in 1998, although it is yet to get
under way. That court is seriously hampered by the fact that the
United States refuses to participate, on grounds that it never
wants to see any of its own soldiers tried by foreign jurists.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the United States participate in a number of other
international protocols for curbing war's excesses, such as child
soldiers (the Pentagon recruits 17-year-olds, and the accord sets
18 as the minimum age) and land mines (the United States still uses
them).
</P>
<P>
   Such tribunals and conventions setting out the international
rules of warfare probably have little effect on the mayhem caused
by wars waged on TV screens or out of public view. But the people
pulling the strings are as aware of the rules as the Pentagon
commanders sitting in war rooms with lawyers at their sides.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that in agreeing to a peace deal he had no
intention of observing, Sierra Leone insurgency leader Foday Sankoh
negotiated himself an amnesty for the war crimes he had already
committed. He watches CNN and listens to the BBC, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunals are imperfect ways to pursue justice, but they are
certainly better than just sweeping war crimes away with the debris
of history. Other experiments _ South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission and the legal pursuit of former Chilean
strongman Augusto Pinochet _ demonstrate a hunger for
accountability once the shooting stops.
</P>
<P>
   And the shooting will stop someday, in every war, everywhere.
War is not the normal state of affairs, even in places where armed
thugs are right now taking potshots at neighbors or whacking off
their limbs or forcing their women into sexual slavery.
</P>
<P>
   We shouldn't assume, ever, that since war is so prevalent, the
world can do nothing about the particular crimes of people who
cause these things to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting will stop. And somewhere else, sometime soon, it
will start again. Every time that warfare spills beyond the bounds
of international humanitarian law, the transgressors should be held
accountable.

THE CRUELTIES OF THE ESTATE TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For naked class warfare, it is hard to beat the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to give a prize for the single worst idea to come
forward from a group that's been rife with them, it would be
this,'' fumed US Rep. Barney Frank as the House voted by a healthy
margin to phase out the federal tax on inheritances. ``Their idea
is this: `Let's make the tax code of America better for very rich
people. Let's give substantial tax relief to the richest people we
can find.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Does Frank really believe that? ``The richest people we can
find'' don't pay death taxes, and neither do their heirs. They hire
estate planners and take advantage of the Internal Revenue Code's
loopholes to make sure that most of their wealth does not go to
Uncle Sam when they shuffle off this mortal coil. So well known is
this effect among economists that two prominent ones _ the
Brookings Institution's Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell of Boston
College, a former member of President Clinton's Council of Economic
Advisers _ have actually described estate taxes not as taxes but as
``penalties imposed on those who neglect to plan ahead or who
retain unskilled estate planners.''
</P>
<P>
   The super rich, and those whose families have long been wealthy,
can always arrange their affairs to minimize the tax bite. But it
is a particular cruelty of the estate tax to fall most heavily on
those whose wealth is newly acquired, or who may not even have
realized they were ``rich.''
</P>
<P>
   By way of example, Kerri Houston of the Institute for Policy
Innovation describes a farmer, land-rich but cash-poor, who lives
modestly and works hard. At his death, he passes to his children
his only meaningful asset _ his land. ``Although our farmer eked
out an income of just $40,000 last year, he had the misfortune of
purchasing his land a quarter-century ago,'' Houston writes. ``It
is now worth $800,000, and Uncle Sam wants $56,500 of it. Now.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a nightmare scenario for small business owners. A 1995
survey on the impact of estate taxes found that 51 percent of
family businesses would have trouble surviving the death of a
principal owner, largely because of taxes. Thirty percent of
respondents said they would have to sell all or part of the
business to pay the tax bill; 14 percent said they would have to
shut the business down.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the heirs who suffer, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the death of our founder,'' says W. J. Grundy, the former
chairman of Jomac Inc., a manufacturer of protective gloves, ``we
spent over $3 million to redeem stock so estate taxes could be paid
and control of the company could be maintained. This was $3 million
not available for operations, and the division in trouble was sold
_ reducing our employment by about 30 employees and our sales by
about $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   It may please the class warriors to imagine that death taxes
sting only the rich. Those 30 laid-off Jomac employees know better.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton promises a quick veto if the estate tax repeal
reaches his desk. (A Senate vote hasn't yet been scheduled.) ``The
House has jeopardized our fiscal discipline'' with its ``costly,
irresponsible, and regressive plan,'' he said after the vote last
week.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the tax nets the Treasury almost nothing. It brings in
just $23 billion a year, or a little more than 1 percent of federal
revenues. Of each dollar raised, more than 65 cents is eaten up in
``compliance costs'' _ the expenses of collection and
administration. If the estate tax were wiped out tomorrow, the
Treasury would barely hiccup. Which is not to say repeal wouldn't
cause some pain: The 16,000 members of the American Bar Association
who specialize in trust, probate, and estate law would doubtless be
very sorry indeed if Americans no longer had to spend lavishly to
protect their families from the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the estate tax should be abolished not
because of finances or economics, but as a matter of simple
decency. It rewards the worst kind of behavior, while punishing
parents for doing something admirable and deeply rooted in human
nature: leaving the fruit of their labor to their children.
</P>
<P>
   A multimillionaire who wants to avoid all death taxes can
readily do so without even hiring a lawyer: He can simply spend all
his wealth before he dies. A recent bestseller _ ``Die Broke'' _
advises doing just that. The estate tax cannot reach the wealth of
someone who uses it to finance a life of luxury and indolence,
spending instead of saving. A rational tax code would smile on
individuals who work hard, live simply, and save for the future.
Ours rewards the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the estate tax has been repealed in 20 states,
including such liberal bastions as Oregon, Vermont, and
Massachusetts. It has recently been abolished in Canada, Australia,
and Israel. It ought to be junked in America as well. Any tax that
penalizes people who provide for their families is immoral and
indefensible. One that does so at the very hour when those families
are bent with grief is not only senseless but sadistic.

IT'S NOT SO EASY GOING GLOBAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apart from the occasional dose of carpet-bombing, America hasn't
had much of a foreign policy since the Berlin Wall fell. But our
nation's big-time Internet companies are cobbling together their
own approach to international relations. They'd better. The rest of
the world is rapidly logging on to the Internet, and they have no
particular inclination for doing things the American way.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, watch out for those wily Europeans. ``They're
coming after us,'' warns Charles Baxter, president and CEO of
eTranslate Inc. of San Francisco. ``In the last four or five years,
they've all heard about how America can do no wrong... Their best
scientists, their best researchers, they're getting one-way tickets
to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Europe wants revenge. Ironically fortified with streams of
American venture capital, European companies are storming onto the
Internet. Their first goal is to secure dominance in their own
countries, hauling down the Yahoo flag and replacing it with
strange, alien banners like France's Wannadoo. After that, they can
copy America's playbook and begin to expand globally. The deal by
Spain's Terra Networks to acquire Waltham's Lycos Inc. is a good
example.
</P>
<P>
   The best defense for American Web firms is to intensify their
own international efforts. That's where companies like eTranslate
come in. They're in the tiny but promising business of Web
globalization. They make sure that a company's Internet message
doesn't get lost when translated into another language and culture.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a matter of translating the Drudge Report into
Urdu, either. The minute you switch languages, you introduce a raft
of Web design issues that the typical American never thinks about.
For instance, there's the problem of ``text swelling.'' According
to Baxter, the typical English sentence becomes 40 percent longer
when it's translated into German. That forces a complete rethink of
your page design.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a simple case. What happens when you go to Japan?
People there read text in two different directions _ from the top
down as well as left to right. In Israel, people read right to
left. Each national Web site has to take these issues into account.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's our casual assumption that people in the rest of
the world share our corn-fed tastes in symbols and images. ``The
AOL mailbox, that's a mailbox that comes straight off a farm in
Nebraska,'' Baxter says. Even most Americans don't have mailboxes
like that, but at least we recognize them. In other parts of the
world, the Mayberry look is totally alien. AOL uses the image of an
envelope on its French Web site, but sports the traditional mailbox
at AOL Japan. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Even colors are in play. Baxter notes that Web designers should
go easy on green backgrounds when creating sites aimed at Islamic
users, because the color green is a traditional symbol of that
religion.
</P>
<P>
   If you're selling online, how do you deliver the goods? ``In
Japan, few people are comfortable having goods delivered to their
homes,'' says Donald DePalma, vice president of corporate strategy
of Idiom Inc., a globalization firm in Cambridge, Mass. ``Instead
they have goods delivered to the nearest convenience store.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a company's marketing approach has to change. Ron
Sege, senior vice president at Lycos, says that his company's
Tripod free Web site service is used in America mainly by
hobbyists. But in southeast Asia, it's especially popular with
political activists, and so Tripod is marketed there as a way for
the little guy to have a say on the big issues.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even though America rules the desktops, wireless is
the wave of the future. International Data Corp. predicts that by
2004, 1.3 billion people worldwide will use cell phones with
browsers to visit the Internet. And obviously, most of them won't
be Americans. Already, the Japanese have leapfrogged us with a
technology called i-mode, that allows cell phone users to stay
connected to the Internet all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all American Web sites are designed for use on desktop
computer monitors. But the future of the Internet will be written
on screens just two inches wide. And there's a good chance it won't
be written in English.

SECURING PIPES SOFTLY WILL REDUCE RATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am getting a rattling sound in the pipe in one of my
bathrooms when I turn on the hot water. The bathrooms are stacked
on top of each other on three floors, but only one bathroom is
affected. How can I stop that?
</P>
<P>
   STEVE WEBLER, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a common complaint with plumbing: When water flows, it
tends to vibrate the pipe, and if the pipe is not properly secured,
the pipe may bump the wood stud or any other wood through which it
passes, or bump its anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Securing the pipe is the answer, which is difficult because the
pipes are hidden in the wall. But sometimes you can secure exposed
pipes, say in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   While it is important to secure the pipe, it is also important
to secure it firmly but gently. If it is held too tightly, more
noise may result, from flowing water or from expansion and
contraction. To gently secure the pipe, line the holder with a soft
rubber sleeve, which will cushion the blows of the bumping pipe.
Or, use foam-tube pipe insulation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The red cedar shingles on the north side of my house are not
curled or warped, but brother, they look horrible. They are
untreated and very dark. How can I make them new-looking again and
keep them new-looking?
</P>
<P>
   BARRY CARLE, Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Red cedar shingles do not weather very well, resulting
usually in a blotchy black, red, brown, tan, and gray combo.
Really, a mess. OK, to bring them back to new-looking and to stay
new-looking, apply a coat of CWF (clear wood finish), widely sold
in paint stores. This may turn the shingles to an orange color. If
you like that, fine.
</P>
<P>
   There is another way to get them better looking: Wash the
shingles with a solution of one part household bleach and three
parts water. This will kill and remove any black mold, but will
also bleach the shingles. Then let them continue to weather or
apply bleaching oil; only one coat is needed and in most cases no
future coats are needed. This oil will provide a uniform light-gray
color, and allow further weathering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I moved into a handsome Greek Revival farmhouse, and
discovered that someone put a layer of 1/4-inch-thick real brick
around the fireplace and chimney. It is ugly and very fake-looking.
Can I paint it?
</P>
<P>
   RUTH KAUMEHEIWA, Weymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can paint the thin brick because it is real brick. You
could do the same if it were plastic. To paint, apply a latex
enamel undercoat, then finish with an eggshell-finish latex wall
paint. You will probably need a second coat of the eggshell wall
paint. As always, thin coats succeed, thick ones do not.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, when you get tired of the paint, you can pry off that
thin stuff, sand or scrape off the adhesive, and put up the proper
thing, such as tile. You might even find real brick behind the thin
material.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In my house in Brewster, Mass. the winds blow so hard that my
oil burner flames out. I plan to put a cap on my chimney. Would
that help? If not, are there any other ways to prevent such
flameouts?
</P>
<P>
   SIDDIQ SATTAR, Avon, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. Brother, that is one helluva downdraft you have. A downdraft
that can blow out an oil-burner flame under pressure certainly is
powerful. I think a cap will help. If it doesn't, have your oil
burner serviceman check it out. He should be able to do something.
It may mean a simple baffle in the smoke pipe or nearby to keep
that downdraft from coming in directly against the flame, but don't
try anything like that yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to paint my wallpaper. Is that possible, or even
feasible? It is real paper, 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ANN WARD, West Roxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can paint wallpaper, and the same technque applies
whether the paper is vinyl-coated or not. If you use a latex paint,
you run the risk of the water in the paint softening the paste and
creating wrinkles. This happened to the handyman, so he knows it
can happen, but when the paint dried, the wrinkles went away for
the most part, enough to be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   OK, as for the technique: Sand the paper lightly, to roughen the
finish. Wipe off sanding dust, and apply a thin layer of latex
enamel. Finish with two coats of an eggshell-finish latex wall
paint. To avoid wrinkling, use oil-based Kilz (a primer) in place
of the latex enamel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My deck floor was replaced with fir boards, which I would
like to keep new-looking and allow to weather. I have thought of a
clear sealer to seal it. If I seal it, can I put on a stain in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL MONIZ, Roslindale, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You cannot keep the boards new looking and let weather. That
is impossible. But you can seal the boards, which will protect then
and allow them to weather to a gray color. But you have to apply
the sealer every year, which is kind of dumb, especially if you
have a huge deck. Instead, I suggest you apply a semitransparent
stain of a light gray color. You will get a similar effect and will
not have to repeat for three to five years. And only one coat is
needed at a time.
</P>
<P>
   If you seal the boards, you can't put a stain on them until the
sealer wears off, in a year or more. The stain will not penetrate
the sealer.

   PEDESTRIANS _ You think it's dangerous driving in Florida, try

sprawl, said the study by the Surface Transportation Policy
Project, a Washington think tank that opposes congestion and
sprawl. The group calculated a Pedestrian Danger Index factoring in
the number of pedestrians killed and the number of commuters who
walk to work. Cities with few walkers but many deaths rank highest.
That's why Palm Beach County, with 49 deaths over two years but few
walkers, is considered far more hazardous than New York City, with
869 deaths but many more potential pedestrian targets. Chart

<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTBOROUGH, Mass. _ Psychiatrist Aaron Lazare is on the
luncheon circuit, addressing the Westborough Rotary Club over
creamed chicken with potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The topic is not his academic work, although certainly it could
be. Lazare, 64, is chancellor of the University of Massachusetts at
Worcester and dean of its medical school. Nor does he talk about
his research interests, which include the healing process of
apology and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he talks about something much more personal: The fact
that he is father to eight children of three different races whom
he and his wife, Louise, adopted between 1966 and 1977. Now his
interest has gone beyond the personal and has led him to take
action on behalf of all children in need of adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I stop and can't go on for a few seconds, don't worry about
me. I recover quickly,'' he says to the group, his voice breaking.
``There is something powerfully moving about seeing your children's
lives flash so quickly before your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there are seven of them; their first child, Jacqueline, died
five years ago, from breast cancer. All are grown, ranging in age
from 23 to 34, and it is clear from his hourlong slide show that
the Lazares' three-decade adventure in parenting was not always
Brady Bunch-delightful. There were times _ like when seven of them
were teenagers at once _ that the kids ``pushed us to the wall,''
Lazare confesses. ``We have gone through stormy times with most of
our children. Some situations, at times, seemed overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the toughest work of fathering is done, and he can look
back, this Father's Day, and reflect on some of the lessons his
children taught him that he ``never could have learned from any
psychiatry textbook'' _ lessons that inform his stewardship of the
adoption research center the medical school opened three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He learned that the power of family life surmounts differences
in racial backgrounds. He learned that the joys and suffering of
adoptive families ``equals or exceeds those of biologic families.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he learned that children adopted at various ages are
more resilient than is often imagined. It's an important lesson for
these times, when the adoption of children from other cultures and
races is becoming more mainstream, when adoption is heavily
promoted as an antidote to the problems of the tens of thousands of
children in foster care nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Although they adopted their children decades ago, the Lazares,
who were unable to have biological children, serve as a model for
what social workers and reformers are preaching: adopting
difficult-to-place children at vulnerable points in their lives can
have a satisfing and joyous outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts like to say you take a great risk by adopting,
especially older children, and that their character is already
formed,'' Lazare says in an interview at the Newton home where he
and Louise raised their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we decided to take the risk, and maybe we were lucky, but
we didn't want anyone to tell us to be cautious. We made an ethical
and moral decision, not a scientific one. And yes, they were all
resilent.''
</P>
<P>
   His children are living productive lives, doing work that ranges
from music and acting to computer troubleshooting and carpentry.
Two daughters start law school in the fall. Four, including the
daughter who died, married, and another will marry next month. The
Lazares have five grandchildren, and another is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Lazare declined to speak publicly about his children.
But now that they are adults he does, often. ``I feel I have a
calling to enhance the idea that every child who needs to be should
be successfully adopted,'' Lazare says.
</P>
<P>
   And this includes interracially. ``People often ask me if our
children get along, and you know what they are really saying is,
`Do the different races get along?' Yeah, people can get along. We
didn't think about race when we were raising them. We just thought
about: how do you you raise eight children?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lazares never meant to adopt so many children. Nor did they
plan a multiracial family. They started conservatively enough, with
two traditional adoptions of Caucasian babies.
</P>
<P>
   The first child was Jacqueline, a 3-week-old baby from an
Episcopalian family, who arrived in 1966. Then came Sam, who came
at 2 weeks of age in 1968, and ``became Jackie's soul mate.'' He is
now a gifted pianist, enrolled at the Berklee College of Music.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, months before the assassination of Martin Luther King,
the Lazares learned that many children of color were going homeless
and decided they wanted an African-American child. ``The agency
social worker thought we were crazy and tried to discourage us,''
he recalls. Lazare's father sent relatives to his home to try to
talk him out of it.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work. Sarah _ whose mother was Caucasian and father
was African-American _ arrived at the age of 3 months. The extended
family relented and welcomed the little girl, a Smith College
graduate and starts law school in September at City University of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   By 1970, they were ready for one more. It was Thomas, a
10-month-old African-American boy, who had already lived in two
other homes. ``He cried so much for the first week I thought he'd
die of dehydration,'' Lazare says. ``He was shy and anxious for two
years and rocked himself to sleep each night.'' Now 29, Thomas is
an actor in Los Angeles. He's starring in ``The Promise,'' a film
that the Museum of Fine Arts screened last week.
</P>
<P>
   Hien came next, in 1973. The Lazares decided that the children
who seemed most in need at that time were Vietnamese- American
children fathered by American soldiers, and applied to an adoption
agency in Saigon. Hien, whose father was African-American, was 4
1/2 when she arrived, and ``looked like a sad, sad little girl,''
says Lazare. All her teeth were decayed. She hoarded food in her
bedroom and would not speak for several weeks. But the four Lazare
children helped her learn English and taught her games. ``In six
months she appeared to be a normal child,'' Lazare says. Hien is
now married and begins law school next year at Northeastern
University.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Robert and David from Vietnam, half-brothers with
different Caucasian GI fathers. The boys, who were 8 and 9 at the
time, ``were more than a handful,'' Lazare concedes. ``Having been
abandoned by their fathers, they were not sure how to relate to
me.'' Eventually, they joined the military and ``their respect for
me increased,'' Lazare says. Today Robert and David, both married,
live nearby with their children. Robert, his dad says, is a
``computer whiz,'' and David a master carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1977, Naomi arrived, a 6-month-old African-American
baby. The Lazares were finally done. ``We were too tired, too old,
and too much in debt,'' Lazare says.

RED SOX FAN'S PHILOSOPHY OF CAN'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything I need to know about life I learned from being a Red
Sox fan.
</P>
<P>
   Honesty is sometimes the best policy.
</P>
<P>
   Never put off until tomorrow what you can screw up today.
</P>
<P>
   If you must scratch a body part in public, act nonchalant.
</P>
<P>
   The Lord helps those who help themselves to as much money as
they can grab before their knees give out.
</P>
<P>
   Love your neighbor as yourself, especially if you want to build
a new ballpark in his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   To whom much is given, much is required, except for Mike
Greenwell.
</P>
<P>
   It's better to give abuse than to
</P>
<P>
   receive it.
</P>
<P>
   Never hurt anyone deliberately, unless he gets in your way.
</P>
<P>
   The grass is always greener in Joe Mooney's outfield.
</P>
<P>
   If absence makes the heart grow fonder, spring training makes
the heart grow fonder still.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get your story straight, stick to it.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever lives up to his full potential, except for Pedro and
Carl.
</P>
<P>
   Batting 300 is a lot harder than it looks.
</P>
<P>
   When the going gets tough, blame somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   You can take it with you, if you're traded with a guaranteed
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Where there's life there's hope, especially if you think you
have a shot at signing Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Divided we stand, united we fall.
</P>
<P>
   Actions speak louder than words, but words will do if you're on
the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Money is the root of all evil, especially when it comes dressed
in Yankee pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   Laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone,
unless you're a Red Sox fan, in which case you have plenty of
company.
</P>
<P>
   Where there's a Wil Cordero, there's no way.
</P>
<P>
   One rotten third baseman can spoil a whole infield.
</P>
<P>
   To err is human, but to err more than once in a game is stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who remember the past all too vividly are condemned
to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   Every cloud has a silver lining, except for the one that hovers
over Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The truth will out, but usually you can talk your way around it.
</P>
<P>
   Charity should never begin at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy world championships.
</P>
<P>
   It's not over till it's over, unless you're a Red Sox fan in
which case it's over before it's begun.
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity with the Red Sox breeds cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Ask not what you can do for the team, ask what your agent can do
for you.
</P>
<P>
   The best things in life are taxpayer-funded.
</P>
<P>
   A person who is good at making excuses is seldom good at
anything else, except playing in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Winning isn't everything. Some days just showing up is as good
as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Never judge a team by its coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Miracles can happen, even to the Red Sox, every hundred years or
so, give or take.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the sweet, but learn to take the bitter plain, straight
up, without a chaser.
</P>
<P>
   Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. You won't be
disappointed.
</P>

NATURE GIVES US TRUTH, AND HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My watercolor teacher, Carla Mattioli, has been sharing her
understanding of plants with us, her students, as we paint their
various stages in her Rockport studio. The seed, she explains, is
an indwelling of energy, like breathing in. The seedling, in
contrast, is an expansion into the radiance of the sun, like
breathing out. The bud is another contraction, the flower itself
another outward explosion, and thus the plant inhales and exhales
in alternating cycles just as we do.
</P>
<P>
   Then the flower wilts and dies. Is this its last breath and our
last class? No, says Carla, for our last painting on plant
metamorphosis will return again to the seed, which is not only the
end product of this glorious journey, but the first step toward new
life.
</P>
<P>
   It struck me that this process is a wonderful metaphor for the
idea of reincarnation. Or is it closer to the truth to say that
reincarnation is a possibility suggested to us by our observation
of plants?
</P>
<P>
   We like to think of Homo sapiens _ so wise, so intellectual _ as
somehow apart from everything else on this planet. Yet when you
look at our use of language, you see the way our minds depend upon
images from the natural world to express our deepest emotional
states: She was ``flooded'' with feeling; his spirits ``ebbed'';
her soul took ``wing''; his thoughts were ``clouded''; fear took
``root'' in her heart.
</P>
<P>
   No one would dispute that nature provides metaphors for our
inner states, yet we are loath to admit that nature may actually
create our inner life by giving form to the inchoate feelings that
surge through us. Without the vocabulary based upon our experience
of the natural world, our affect, I suspect, would be as flat as an
asphalt parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   We understand the long dark night of the soul because, sick at
heart, we have felt the moments after midnight crawl by. We hold on
because we have seen day invariably follow night and month after
month have watched the moon resurrect her full majesty from a tiny
sliver on the brink of extinguishment. How would we know the
feeling of awe if we'd never seen a sunset? How would we understand
the feeling of liberation if birds did not soar effortlessly on the
wind?
</P>
<P>
   Our Unitarian minister Mary Harrington recalled a bucket of
bulbs she had forgotten to plant. In the spring she found them in a
dark corner in her garage. ``To my utter astonishment,'' she said,
``the pail was filled with blooming hyacinths stretching upward out
of a most inhospitable place _ having had no light or water and
very little soil for a year.'' She continued, ``Similarly, in my
work and in my life I have met some amazing people who, even though
emotionally neglected or terribly mistreated, nevertheless found a
way to grow up and grow whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary concluded that just as her bulbs had within them an almost
invincible capacity to grow, human beings too possess that inner
spark, a vital life force that survives ``despite the things that
hold us back, keep us small, and thwart our full flowering.''
</P>
<P>
   How did she dare say that? And why did I allow her story to fill
me with hope? I think we know in our hearts that plants, stars, the
oceans, and all living creatures are vessels for the sacred, which
is always calling our attention to the deepest truth. By example,
they open us up to new possibilities. They shatter our limiting
beliefs. They comfort us. They give us the courage to persevere in
the face of overwhelming odds.
</P>
<P>
   In a world in which each river flows to its given destination,
why should we judge or fear events we neither want nor can control?
In a world in which water freezes, melts, and rises into steam, why
not trust the divine creation that reassures us, consoles us, and
abides within us? The rhythms of nature solemnly promise rebirth
and renewal, giving us reason to hope that we will survive the loss
of a job, the end of a love affair, or the death of someone we
love. We see the tide ebb and flow. We experience the endless cycle
of the seasons. How can we doubt that even our deepest
disappointments are impermanent?
</P>
<P>
   Nature is at work everywhere _ in the nests within the
birdhouses on my garage, in my garden, in my youngest daughter's
swelling womb _ offering us lessons on how to feel safe in a world
that seems increasingly competitive, conflictual, and cutthroat. To
those who are searching for answers, for encouragement, for support
in remaining true to themselves, the tiniest flower whispers,
(itals)Whatever exists in nature exists within your soul. There are
no endings, there is only change. There is no loss, there is only
innovation. There is no death, there is only transformation.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Do not be afraid.(unitals)

 WESTBOROUGH, Mass.: ... Lazare says.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were days, of course, when Lazare questioned what he and
his wife had undertaken, even though the bulk of the child care
fell to Louise, whom he calls ``a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise, for her part, says her husband ``is the person who read
stories to the kids, because he thought reading was very important,
and encouraged any kind of education. He was very in tune with the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Lazare felt his career suffered because of the
conferences he missed, the business trips he declined, in order to
be home with the children. ``I used to say, `God, if I could travel
I could really be a contender. I could be famous,' '' he
acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   He did not bank on the rebelliousness of his adolescents, of
runaway episodes and shoplifting escapades and court appearances
that taught him firsthand about humiliation and shame. ``We needed
to get outside help,'' Lazare admits. ``There were times when we
had what we came to think of as our live-in psychologist.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't count on the academic difficulties some faced, or the
subtle racism the African-American children would confront in
public school _ like the time Sarah was told she had the highest
SAT scores of any black child in her high school. He didn't expect
his youngest daughter to become a single parent.
</P>
<P>
   And surely he was not prepared for the death of his beloved
Jackie, just a year after her wedding, at the age of 29.
</P>
<P>
   But if anything convinced him that the effort of raising these
children had been worth it, it was the response of her seven
siblings to her illness.
</P>
<P>
   They surrounded her with love and kindness, he says. Hien and
Tom who had been planning to move out of the house, stayed to be
close to Jackie. Naomi gave constant nursing care. David, the
carpenter with whom she had frequently quarreled, completely
redecorated a bedroom for her. Sam quit his job and moved home to
provide 24-hour nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This experience of suffering transformed me and my entire
family,'' Lazare says in his speech to the Rotary Club. He adds:
``The adoption of children is an important social structure that
makes such interconnectness possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Now all the hard work is yielding benefits, one of which is his
joy at the upcoming marriage of his African-American son, Thomas,
to an African-American woman. Her parents invited the Lazares to
their 25th wedding anniversary celebration in Roxbury, and although
he felt initially awkward being the only white man present, he was
so moved by their warmth that he made a speech about how wonderful
it felt to be part of this interracial family. He and Louise
adopted Thomas 27 years ago, he told the group, ``and now I am
asking all of you to adopt us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He segues to his second favorite subject these days, the Center
for Adoption Research at the University of Massachusetts, of which
he is executive director. It is the first university-based center
in the country with academic resources dedicated to providing
practical responses to adoption issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks about how wonderful adoption is, but no one
studies it to figure out how to make it work right,'' Lazare says.
``The Adoption Center is the missing link.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Lazare's seven children, the home in Newton is the
ultimate adoption center. They come back often _ ``they move in,
they move out,'' Lazare laughs.
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews, the children say Lazare managed to
accomplish something exceptional in his parenting: He was able to
cultivate a special bond with each one of them. ``Instead of a
generic sweep of love, my dad (was like) a large feather who would
graze everyone individually,'' Sam Lazare says.
</P>
<P>
   For Thomas, the bond was around a mutual love of sports: ``He'd
take me to Celtics games.'' Sam shares his father's interest in
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was into athletics, and played softball and soccer,'' says
Hien. ``He'd always want to do the carpool.'' Sarah remembers ``a
relationship that was special to me.'' When she was small, he took
her to medical conferences at which he lectured ``and I was the one
who would give out the index cards for people to write down their
questions, and then collect them all. I remember feeling very very
special because I was the daughter of the man at the front of the
room.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Lazare says, when any of his kids phones him at
work, his secretary knows to interrupt immediately. Sarah, who
coordinates tutorial services at Smith College, says her father
comes to Northampton to tell her students about his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the students see us together they often say we look
alike,'' she says. ``It's not because we look alike. It's because
we listen alike. We communicate the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Father's Day, the Lazare children will acknowledge
their dad ``in our usual endearing way,'' Sam says. ``We'll
probably have a barbecue. It will be very casual. It will be very
chaotic.''

GLOBE SUIT HIGHLIGHTS NET USAGE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lawsuit against The Boston Globe filed by a group of the
paper's freelancers may well become a significant test case in the
battle over ownership of online content raging everywhere from
Napster to the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a coalition that includes The National Writers Union,
the Graphic Artists Guild, and the American Society of Media
Photographers, the freelancers' suit challenges a licensing
agreement that seeks their consent to allow the Globe to reproduce
their past and future freelance work in other forms, including
online, without additional compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the Globe the rights to distribute the material,''
said plaintiffs' attorney Ira Sills. ``What's the consideration and
benefit given to the freelancer for that? Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the suit ``without merit,'' Globe spokesman Rick Gulla
said the license deal only seeks freelancers' permission to ``use
their work under a Globe brand. We're not going to resell it to a
third party because they own the copyright.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulla pointed out that since Globe freelancers maintain their
copyright, they can sell their work to other outlets. The
plaintiffs counter that the paper's ability to re-use that work _
on Web sites or elsewhere _ depresses that resale market and
deprives them of a deserving paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of several large newspapers around the country
indicates that, at least for now, many freelancer arrangements
allow news organizations virtually unlimited reuse of their work
online or in other forms. The Globe's policy on freelancer reuse
seems to be roughly in line with that of other large papers.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying this dispute is the reality that cyberspace has
created thorny intellectual property issues certain to be hashed
out in the courts. In essence, publishers want to treat their
online sites as a natural extension of the company's brand while
freelancers see it as a separate medium with its own revenue pie
that ought to be shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that (freelance contributions) are valuable
commodities . . . in this new era that is emerging,'' said Dennis
DeMaio, vice president of The National Writers' Union. ``What
really makes the Globe contract unfair and deceptive is that they
are trying not only to hoodwink people into forfeiting their future
rights, but their past rights as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows we're in a new age of distribution,'' said
Gulla. ``What we're intending to do is to make the Boston Globe a
premier news medium whether it's in print or online . . . It's the
same Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' view has support inside the Globe newsroom.
Robert Jordan, president of the Newspaper Guild local at the Globe,
has sent a letter to Globe management protesting a contract that
``would usurp virtually all of the rights of the freelancers.'' And
as of Wednesday, nearly 80 staffers had signed a ``free the
freelancers!'' petition asking the paper to scrap ``a patently
unfair license agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The showdown sparked by Monday's litigation has been building
for some time. One crucial turning point was a recent ruling in the
case of Tasini vs. The New York Times that publishers could not
simply reuse freelancers' work electronically without their
consent. (Times spokeswoman Catherine Mathis said the newspaper is
seeking US Supreme Court review of that ruling.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Gulla, the Globe licensing agreement was sent to
about 750 regular freelancers and nearly 300 have signed to date.
But any freelancer who does not sign on by July 1 will have his
relationship with the paper terminated. Calling the Globe case
``sort of the son of Tasini,'' Sills accused the paper of trying to
limit ``its enormous copyright violation exposure,'' by trying to
get freelancers to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gulla acknowledged that ``Tasini was the impetus behind the
(Globe's) new license agreement,'' which he said ``was not
influenced'' by its New York Times parent company, but was
``developed by Globe editors after reviewing the licensing
agreements throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Inquirer spokeswoman Pamela Browner said
freelancers there sign a contract giving the paper ``non-exclusive
rights to reuse their material anywhere, including the Web,'' and a
similar system exists at The Washington Post. The Times, Mathis
said, retains the freelancers' copyright and ``the exclusive right
to use his or her article in any medium.'' Freelancers at Newsday
agree to allow the paper to repackage their material ``online . . .
on our database and in other forms,'' said Bob Keane, assistant to
the publisher. ``We've had writers who've said they've preferred
not to do that. But it hasn't been much of an issue.'' The Boston
Herald also recently sent a contract to its freelancers stipulating
that the paper owns the copyright on their work ``in any and all
media and forms of publication.'' (Herald officials could not be
reached.)
</P>
<P>
   While the Globe case looms as a major legal precedent, DeMaio
said that ``there are a lot of these publishers who are pirating
these rights. . . . We see this as only the beginning of a very
large war. We anticipate there will be other cases. We're widening
the war against these contracts and we intend to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills compares the freelancer situation to that of the fierce
legal wrangle over Napster, the digital music-sharing service that
has many music producers crying copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intellectual property,'' he said. The issue is ``who
controls the intellectual property and what's a fair and equitable
way of doing it.''

 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a rig for gearheads. That's not gearheads as in folks
who like nothing more than to tear into the mechanical intricacies
of what they drive. It's gearheads who like their vehicles to carry
lots of stuff: skis, snowboards, bikes, kayaks, garden tools,
manure, lumber, groceries.
</P>
<P>
   I call it a rig because, like many people who have test driven
the Ford Explorer Sport Trac, I don't know if it's a truck or an
SUV. And with its ability to carry six adults in absolute,
sedan-like comfort, you could argue that it's a station wagon, as
well. Ah, when world's collide.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a pickup truck-SUV boom, Ford has done a fine
job of melding the two.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it does not deliver the pure benefits of either but
does a good turn in letting you at least sample the best of each.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a longer wheelbase than the Explorer SUV on which it is
based. This makes it a bit more sure-footed headed down the
highway. Off-road, however, coupled with a ground clearance that's
not quite 7 inches, it doesn't chew up slop and steep the way the
shorter-wheelbase Explorer does. But you don't buy this rig for
serious off-roading. You buy it for hauling and for good travel in
winter slop. Living in New England, I would not consider a
two-wheel-version. Go with the four.
</P>
<P>
   As a pickup truck, it's a small one. The cargo bed _ made of
dent-and-ding-resistant sturdy plastic _ is only 50 inches long.
Add the optional plastic tonneau cover and you get a huge, lockable
trunk. Travel with five and luggage and you've got dry storage.
</P>
<P>
   Without the cover, the open bed offers lots of options.
</P>
<P>
   Six tie-downs, shaped like dock cleats, are positioned outside
the cargo bed's upper rails. Ropes can go up and over any load
inside the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Four more tie-downs are mounted on the inside of the box to hold
down shorter-stacked loads. An optional divider can split the cargo
bed into two bins.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Sport Trac's rear window _ a la old-time station
wagons _ slides down into the rear wall and lets you project longer
loads into the cabin _ though if you use this option, particularly
with heavy objects such as skis or lumber, you'd better be sure
you've got the load tied down so it won't come hurtling forward if
you have to brake suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   A better option for long loads, I found, was the optional
cage/bed extender that flips out onto an open tailgate and adds
about two feet of length to the bed. You're still not going to get
a sheet of plywood into the bed _ though you could tie plywood down
over this setup _ but for hauling boards, the bed extender's open
slots form great support through which to insert the load into the
bed. In addition, the bed extender simply gives you more room for
multiple, shorter items you can sort within the bed.
</P>
<P>
   The Sport Trac also comes with standard roof rails, good for
other loads that active lifestyles entail.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you can load it up with gear. What about people?
</P>
<P>
   Big, firm leather bucket seats up front. A big, firm leather
bench in the rear _ think three adults sitting comfortably on a
couch with plenty of room to extend their legs. Back to gear for a
moment: Fold that split rear seat down and you get a cavernous area
for luggage, groceries, or other goodies. Added treat: behind the
seats are two bins, with doors, for smaller items.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, all is delightfully simple.
</P>
<P>
   Big buttons run your audio. Three dials control climate.
Windows, door locks, and mirrors are controlled from driver's door.
A button at center console raises and lowers the rear window.
</P>
<P>
   To haul all this potential load, Ford has given the Sport Trac
one of the best V-6 engines I've run across. It's a 4.0-liter DOHC
that produces 205 horsepower. Some critics have bemoaned the lack
of a V-8, and I'm sure Ford could sell that option if they chose
to, but I found the six to be plenty peppy. I got almost 18 miles
per gallon in a week of driving the Sport Trac _ respectable for
all it will haul. Early models offer only a 5-speed automatic
transmission. I'd hold out for the 5-speed manual due by fall.
</P>
<P>
   Confident, with a fine burble, I'd say were I a wine critic.
</P>
<P>
   Handling was very nice straight ahead on the highway, owing to
not only the extra wheelbase but also a stiffer frame than on the
SUV Explorer. The rear tended to be skittish off road and in quick
turns _ it's light because of its plastic composite, after all, and
it does have leaf springs. The latter are good for load absorption,
not as good as shocks when the load is light.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to be fully loaded, charging down the highway at
high speed, and making those crazy commuter lane shifts in the
Sport Trac. That's because it is, in many ways, an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to count on the Sport Trac to haul massive gear
through the bogs and steep woods of Maine on your next hunting
trip. It's not made for that.
</P>
<P>
   And you're not going to hang out your construction company
shingle and buy this truck for hauling tools and lumber from site
to site. It's not made for that either.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy one, here's what it is made for: hauling family and
friends and all their assorted luggage and gear on active, outdoor
vacations. It will get you to the campground, the lodge, even to
reasonably accessible backwoods campsites. And it will get you
there with SUV-like roominess with a small pickup truck's load
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The long tubular door grips on the inside panels. Grip them
with your whole hand and slam away.
</P>
<P>
   --The tightly-bound rubber flooring (beneath removable carpets).
You could gently hose this thing out if you got it muddy inside.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   -- With the great job Ford did positioning tie-downs, they
missed when they didn't put any directly on the floor of the cargo
bed. Physics dictates that tying a stacked load from a low point
let's you cinch it down better.

their separate stations, but it is blacks and Mexicans that are
left to battle over the dirty jobs at the factory, one of the only
places within a 50-mile radius in this muddy corner of North
Carolina where a person might make more than $8 an hour. While
Smithfield's profits nearly doubled over the past year, wages have
remained flat. So a lot of Americans have quit and a lot of
Mexicans have been hired to take their places. But more than
management, the workers see one another as the problem, and they
see the competition in skin tones. By Charlie LeDuff. (With photos)

&HT;     REGULATORS PLAY POLITICS WITH ABORTION PILL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARGOT MAGOWAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Why are American women so behind the times? We
are supposed to have the most advanced medical system in the world,
but the abortion pill, RU-486, is still not available in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming legal in France 12 years ago, RU-486 has been
used by more than 600,000 women worldwide with 95 percent
effectiveness. Nearly 90 percent of these women report they are
very satisfied with this option.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Food and Drug Administration said that RU-486 may
be prescribed only by doctors who can also perform surgical
abortions. This seems a strange stipulation. Why would you need a
surgeon to take a pill?
</P>
<P>
   One of the benefits of RU-486 is that more doctors can prescribe
it precisely because no surgery is necessary. Only 5 percent of
women who have used RU-486 have needed follow-up medical care. In
those cases, patients were referred to qualified doctors, as is the
case in every other medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   More doctors means more access. RU-486 could free women from
their dependency on abortion clinics. This would be especially
beneficial to rural women who live far from abortion service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the need for a specified clinic also gives women
privacy and safety. Anti-abortion rights activists cannot identify
and target prescriptions the way they can clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA eliminated privacy for doctors and patients when it
mandated that RU-486 will be approved only if there is a national
registry of doctors who prescribe it. This national stigma
infringes on basic privacy rights and will radically discourage
doctors from giving out the pill.
</P>
<P>
   At best, these FDA conditions are extremely paternalistic. At
worst, they are blatantly political. Either way, they don't serve
women.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA first pronounced RU-486 safe and effective back in 1996,
but delayed full approval because of unspecified production issues.
And now, when asked about the proposed restrictions, FDA officials
reply with ``no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   This response is more befitting a politician than a non-partisan
agency that should be basing its decisions on science, not
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the FDA hasn't demonstrated some rather odd health
priorities. It rushed to legalize Viagra almost immediately after
the drug was created.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the likelihood of insisting there be a national registry
for doctors who prescribe a pill for erectile dysfunction. Viagra
turned out to have dangerous side effects for some men.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fen-Phen, the diet drug recalled because of fatal
consequences, was released before RU-486. And silicon breast
implants are still legal, even though many doctors and thousands of
victims believe the implants can leak dangerous toxins. The FDA
permitted these risky procedures for the sake of potent men,
reduced body fat, and large breasts _ all the while delaying a pill
that can safely terminate pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's recommendations for RU-486, in terms of certification
and the licensing of providers, is beyond what has been required of
any other drug. It's time for the Clinton administration to take
some leadership and liberate a medical process from a political
one.
</P>
<P>
   Just as critically, Vice President Al Gore, who has consistently
taken pro-women positions, and has recently made privacy rights a
hot issue of his presidential campaign, should speak to these
inconsistencies in the FDA. Allowing American women access to a
safe and effective drug should be a national priority. We have
waited long enough.

   PARIS _ The succession to Hafez Assad in Syria will be
complicated by the fact that the country is largely run by a tiny
minority, the Alawites.
</P>
<P>
   Totaling fewer than 10 percent of the Syrian population, they
have held sway over the Sunni Muslims, who constitute 75 percent of
the nation, since Assad forged the current state apparatus in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   This sectarian tension was absent in recent Arab generational
changes in Jordan and Morocco. In addition, both countries were
hereditary monarchies, where crown princes mounted the thrones
unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Syria affords few institutional guarantees for the
apparent new leader, Bashar Assad. Both his strength and potential
vulnerabilities stem from his origins in the Alawite clan, around
which his father constructed the modern Syrian state.
</P>
<P>
   His officially orchestrated rise has been buffeted by a
leadership challenge by a banished uncle, Rifaat Assad. The exiled
uncle has been consolidating his contacts with the Alawites in
recent months as his brother's health weakened, reminding them of
his role as the brutal defender of the Alawites' dominant position
in Muslim Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The uncle's forces repressed the biggest public challenge to the
regime when Sunni Muslims, organized by the fundamentalist Muslim
Brothers, took over the Syrian town of Hama in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The town was razed by special troops commanded by Rifaat Assad
in an operation in which 20,000 Syrian Muslims reportedly died.
</P>
<P>
   Exiled to Europe as a potential rival to his brother, Rifaat
Assad, 63, announced Monday that he ``represents the true
legitimacy and is ready to take up his responsibilities at any
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, broadcast in Arabic via the BBC, was really
directed at the Alawites, according to an Arab ambassador in Paris.
It was simple, he said: ``Who do you trust for your survival? The
butcher of Hama? Or a 34-year-old eye doctor who was just his
father's boy?''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to make his son a ``hereditary republican'' ruler in
a theoretically socialist state, President Assad, according to most
analysts, wanted to preserve the link between leader and clan that
has kept power out of the hands of Sunni Muslims in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad, analysts said, faces two imminent threats. First,
the Syrian Army, where the Sunni Muslim forces are controlled by a
handful of Alawite officers, may erupt in a bid to throw off
Alawite hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Bayanoni, a fundamentalist Sunni leader in exile in Jordan,
recently predicted this outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Also, said the Arab ambassador, ``the Alawites themselves may
worry that Bashar is not tough enough to safeguard their
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry over leadership of the Alawites has been heating up
for five years, ever since Hafez Assad's elder son and heir
apparent, Basil, was killed in a car accident _ and replaced in
public by Bashar, who had until then had been an eye doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Last September in Latakiya, the Mediterranean port that is the
unofficial capital of the Alawites, the army rounded up followers
of Rifaat Assad.
</P>
<P>
   The potentially explosive dimensions of Syrian politics reflect
the country's recent history in which Hafez Assad built up a
powerful security machinery for the country, including its
suzerainty over Lebanon, by relying on his own tightly knit sect of
Alawites.
</P>
<P>
   If the Alawite connection fails, ``the country has only shallow
political, religious or dynastic institutions to preserve unity,''
the Arab envoy said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab world, Syria is comparable to neighboring Iraq,
where a small clan of Sunni Muslims wield power in Baghdad over a
Shiite Muslim majority.
</P>
<P>
   In both countries, the leaders have built systems based on
terror and then sought to pass power to sons in their mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, Uday Hussein has battled for years with his brother
Qusay. They have both battled with their uncles, the half brothers
of President Saddam Hussein, who all come from the same Takrikti
clan of Sunnis.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, these religious tensions _ never discussed publicly
by officials in these nominally secular states _ are more acute in
Syria because Alawites have historically been viewed as heretics by
most Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   President Assad persuaded a leading Lebanese cleric in 1975 to
issue a declaration saying that Alawites were Shiite Muslims. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Hafez al-Assad's on-again, off-again approach to the
Middle East peace process frequently drove U.S. and Israeli
policymakers to distraction. Was the Syrian leader, who died
suddenly Saturday at 69, temperamental and unpredictable? Were his
enemies gulled by the mistaken view that Assad, a maddeningly
clever negotiator, was entirely trustworthy once he had given his
word? Many pundits in Israel and the United States think so. But
this view is a serious and unfair misreading of Assad. In fact, his
behavior was anything but erratic; it was consistent and
predictable. To understand that consistency, one must understand
the enigmatic man known as the ``sphinx of Damascus'' and the world
in which he lived. To the end, Assad remained the uncompromisingly
tough, unyielding defender of Arab honor....By Henry Siegman,

has a monument by which to remember its old adversary, Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad. It sits above the Sea of Galilee,
overlooking the highway that skirts the lake's eastern edge. It is,
of course, highly unflattering. The Syrian leader is perching on
top of a grassy crag, a hook-nosed vulture-like figure with a
fishing rod. This is the Assad as he was seen by most Israelis: a
malevolent predator roosting on the landscape, waiting patiently
for the chance to sling his hook again into Jewish waters, and to
plunder its treasures....By Phil Reeves, The Independent &QL;

Saturday threw the Middle East into shock and profound uncertainty
as one of the Arab world's most powerful military nations found
itself leaderless. Ever since 1982, when he suffered his first
heart problems, Assad's health has been a subject for constant
speculation. But there had been no prior hint of his imminent
death, which has left Syrians unprepared for the great changes
which must now lie ahead in their country....By Robert Fisk, The

has a monument by which to remember its old adversary, Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad. It sits above the Sea of Galilee,
overlooking the highway that skirts the lake's eastern edge. It is,
of course, highly unflattering. The Syrian leader is perching on
top of a grassy crag, a hook-nosed vulture-like figure with a
fishing rod. This is the Assad as he was seen by most Israelis: a
malevolent predator roosting on the landscape, waiting patiently
for the chance to sling his hook again into Jewish waters, and to
plunder its treasures....By Phil Reeves, The Independent &QL;

UMASS MAY BRING EDUCATION TO THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a bid to become the state's premier online campus,
the University of Massachusetts may soon launch a
multimillion-dollar campuswide Internet education program.
</P>
<P>
   A new report commissioned by the university supports a push
toward electronic learning by President William M. Bulger's office
and concludes that UMass would enjoy ``explosive growth'' by
enrolling thousands of students in online classes.
</P>
<P>
   UMass, primarily the Amherst and Lowell campuses, already
provides Internet classes to more than 1,750 students. But the lack
of a coordinated plan, the report says, has taken a toll. UMass
trails many public university systems, including the University of
Illinois, which enrolls 4,500 students; the University of Nebraska,
with 15,000 students; and the University of Maryland, which has
30,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Potential online students include government workers, corporate
employees, grade school teachers, and high school students
interested in college-level classes. The report by
PricewaterhouseCoopers found nearly 1.5 million Massachusetts
residents ``somewhat-to-very-likely'' to pursue education or
training within two years. Of those, an estimated 45,000 said they
would be interested in taking classes exclusively over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the increasing competition in the field, and the need
for UMass to establish an identity as an online information
provider, the report cautions that a crucial element of success is
speed. The report, which cost UMass $300,000, starts out by quoting
Bulger's call to action:
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks and opportunities . . . preclude the option of
waiting for the market to mature and provide greater clarity,''
Bulger said late last year in a letter to the board of trustees.
``Waiting, or complacency, will give competitors an advantage in
the market and erode our competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between letting the status quo run its course and
following the consultants' plan could amount to a loss of almost
$60 million in potential profits, according to the report. After
losing $20 million the first two years, UMass would earn $93.3 in
annual gross revenue by the fourth year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tuition, the online plan provides for other forms
of revenue. The report suggests advertising on the Web site,
revenue-sharing deals with online book companies such as Amazon.com
and BarnesandNobles.com, and the resale of everything from class
notes to exams provided over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The key to beating the increasing field of competitors _ which
include Harvard, MIT, Boston University, Northeastern, and Babson
College _ is the price. The cost of current UMass courses
($520-$650 for undergraduate) is significantly less than other
schools, the consultants say.
</P>
<P>
   And to reduce the current redundancies between campuses and
increase efficiency, the report suggests the university create a
separate administrative body that would be controlled by the
president instead of any one campus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many professors are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Some view the proposal as an attack on academic integrity, fear
the plan would dilute profits they already earn from the individual
campus's online education programs, and believe the investment
would be too risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the potential to be the `Big Dig' of public higher
education in Massachusetts,'' said Joe Larson, professor of natural
resources and leader of the faculty senate at UMass-Amherst. ``So
much money would be put at risk, it would be devastating for us to
lose it. Given our lean budget, it would have a major negative
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report says, the potential long-term profits of
providing classes over the Internet are enormous. In 1998, 710,000
students across the country enrolled in such distance-education
programs, which generated more than $1 billion in revenue, the
consultants say. By 2002, they say, more than 2.2 billion students
will be taking Internet-based classes, with annual revenues rising
above $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the report, however, sounds like a nightmare to some
professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts the standard rules of academic governance on its
head,'' said Robert Parkin, a mechanical engineering professor and
president of the faculty senate at UMass-Lowell. ``The faculty has
primary responsibility over academic matters. The report takes that
away from the faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Parkin and six other UMass-Lowell professors on the
faculty senate sent this week to Bulger's office, they outlined
their dismay over the report's corporate focus. Parkin said the
consultants forgot they were reviewing the future of a university.
And he said he is outraged they would advise Bulger to consider
advertising or selling professors' class notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the system afford such a high risk, potentially
budget-busting activity that would seriously damage the reputation
of UMass if and when it fails?'' Parkin writes.
</P>
<P>
   A professor on the faculty senate at UMass-Boston, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, also questioned the online program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really concerned about this because there hasn't been
any real discussion about this,'' the professor said. ``And I think
there is some suspicion that (Bulger) is trying to amass power in
himself. This campus might have no control over the program.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials, however, emphasized that the
PricewaterCoopers report is only a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost of their concerns, they say, is ensuring
academic integrity and faculty involvement. And while enhancing
revenue is a significant perk, they said they believe that, more
importantly, the university will further its mission by increasing
students' access to public education.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Connolly, a spokesman for Bulger, said the president
would consult the faculty and hopes to have a plan ready by
September. He said that while he understands professors'
uneasiness, he believes central coordination can make the online
program work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an arena that the university has to be in,'' he said.
``We're now in the process of how the university should go about
it. Either way, I believe this will go forward.''

FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT AGAINST LIGHT POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you ever fly at night over the megalopolis from Portland,
Maine, to Washington, D.C., you can see what a river of light it is
_ much of it wasted, really.
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds of miles, you see light escaping upwards into the
blackness. It is an ongoing headache, draining resources to
generate unneeded power, and cities don't seem to be doing much
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Why not eliminate the glare, or at least that light that is
shooting straight up? That is a goal of the lightscaping industry,
the people who install lighting in gardens and yards. It's a big
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But it is relatively easy to install night lighting on your
property with hardly a ray escaping to the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Charles Callahan of Hull does. He heads NightScape
of Cohasset. Callahan says, ``Your home is our showroom,'' meaning
your nightscape can't help but show others what it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he could use his own house as a showroom. He has
installed lights under the rails of his front steps, and also
fixtures called foot lights, which are really downlights, copper
affairs that look like tulips or lilies.
</P>
<P>
   The railing lights are hidden, until they are turned on at
night, when they convert the railing to a fence of lights.
</P>
<P>
   The copper foot lights, which plunge into the ground, are always
visible. The 12-inch-high fixtures light a small area of ground;
24-inch fixtures light more, and the 36-inch units even more.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan started as a landscaper, and still is, but went into
nightscaping 20 years ago. He is on the Net at
www.landscapelight.com, or call 781-383-2375.
</P>
<P>
   There are many nice things about nightscaping, and one is that
most of the fixtures run on 12 volts, converted with transformers
to that low voltage from the power of 120 volts.
</P>
<P>
   The transformers are compact and easy to use. Wiring is simple,
and can be buried without extra protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole new concept in night lighting, Callahan said:
``Buy quality fixtures, and we'll put them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a collection of favorite lights that I like to use. We
provide safety, security and peace of mind. I also bail out
screwups,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The idea in lightscaping is to remove 90 percent of the uplight,
which Callahan calls ``burning your retina out,'' and use the 10
percent left over to light the ground, trees, and other objects in
the garden and yard.
</P>
<P>
   The lights to do so are downlights, pathway lights, tree lights,
moon lights and ground lights.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these are obvious, but tree lights and moon lights need
explaining. Tree lights can be various types: One is a light aiming
into the tree, highlighting it, but you have to be careful to avoid
glare and direct light. Another tree light illuminates a wall
behind a tree, silhouetting the plant and eliminating glare. This
is particularly effective in winter.
</P>
<P>
   A moon light is a wide-angle lamp at the top of a tree flooding
the tree like a full moon. Here again you must be careful to avoid
glare and direct lights.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a nightscaper has to be alert to avoid glare at all
times.
</P>
<P>
   When he can't avoid glare, Callahan paints the bulbs white or
etches them.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury vapor lights are gaining in popularity because they
produce a lot of light for the voltage, although most of them need
line voltage of 120 volts. Low-voltage mercury vapor lights are
coming, said Callahan.
</P>
<P>
   Fluorescent lights are also being used more and more. Callahan
says he likes their blue light to enhance blue spruces and other
evergreens.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the homeowner can do, if he does not want to have it
done, is to buy the pathway or foot lights and place them where he
wants them. All they need is sticking in the ground, being careful
to keep the wires underground.
</P>
<P>
   Nightscaping is not necessarily expensive; Callahan said a
10-light system is about $1,650, making a nice potpourri, a little
light up, a little light down, and a little moon. Callahan's Web
site has packages for $750 and less.
</P>
<P>
   So, start small. Then go on to bigger and brighter things. But
not too bright.

 &HT;    FLAWED CAMPAIGN MAY HURT VOTER TRUST IN 'CLEAN' PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION, MEXICAN OFFICIALS SAY

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It hasn't taken place yet, but Mexico's July 2
presidential election is already being called the cleanest and most
competitive in this country's tarnished electoral history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some top election officials here complain that the campaign
leading up to election day has been tainted by reports of pressure
tactics, vote-buying and ongoing government propaganda in the media
that boosts Mexico's 71-year-old ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our position of responsibility as electoral authorities,
any vote that is manipulated, coerced or bought undermines the
integrity of the election,'' said Emilio Zebadua, one of nine
counselors at Mexico's Federal Elections Institute (IFE), an
autonomous government agency that will supervise a presidential
election for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much can it affect the outcome of the election? We don't
know. It might depend on how close the election is,'' said Zebadua,
who, along with three other counselors, spoke to a group of foreign
correspondents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The election is indeed expected to be tight. This is the first
race since 1929 that Mexico's long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, faces the real possibility of losing
the presidency. Recent polls indicate the PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida Ochoa is slightly ahead or even with challenger Vicente
Fox Quesada of the National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   As election day approaches, the PRI and the government have been
accused of stockpiling gifts _ bicycles and washing machines in
Yucatan and bags of cement in Mexico state _ to dole out to
supporters around or on election day.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the watchdog group Civic Alliance _ which is under
contract to Mexico's Congress to report irregularities _ presented
a list of more than 80 examples of alleged unlawful pressure
tactics or vote-buying. The group announced a ``crusade'' for
democracy and said it will join forces with other citizens'
organizations to dispatch 10,000 people throughout the country to
promote free voting.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a high-ranking manager at the government-owned
Mexican Petroleum company in Tabasco state held a news conference
to denounce an alleged campaign to force public workers to pressure
their subordinates to vote for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bosses can threaten you with losing your job, but don't
let them make you commit (electoral) crimes,'' Ramiro Berron,
technical coordinator for oil exploration in Mexico's southern
region, said in an appeal to fellow workers published in Reforma
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts of food, building supplies and other materials that have
been doled out already in some areas are not necessarily illegal.
But it is forbidden to tie handouts to votes, or for public
officials to use their position or government resources to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has challenged anyone who is complaining to come forward
with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The IFE, which has devised a sophisticated balloting system for
Mexico, is investigating 12 complaints of coercion or vote-buying _
10 against the PRI and two against other parties.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he has faith in the electoral system, candidate
Fox has said, ``I fully trust the Federal Elections Institute. It
is in good hands. But it is not in control of the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   A special section of the Mexican attorney general's office is
responsible for prosecuting cases of electoral fraud or pressure.
Mexico's Ministry of Social Development, which administers welfare
programs, said Tuesday it has investigated four complaints of
pressure campaigns using social programs as bait and has discounted
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Zebadua said reports of irregularities ``contaminates the
(election) environment. In spite of this, the Federal Elections
Institute is trying to march in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   After an investment of about $1.7 billion since 1998 on
technology, staffing and public funding for parties, election
officials believe that the actual balloting on July 2 will be free
of wholesale fraud if nearly 800,000 trained supervisors show up as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The country's 113,000 polling places are the ``neurological
center'' of the election, said election counselor Jesus Cantu. Only
voters with a photo credential matched to their name, photo and
number on registration lists at polling places will be allowed to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   A limited number of ballots will be available at each station.
The teams that will supervise the balloting are citizens who were
selected by lottery and trained by the IFE.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the legitimacy of the voting are representatives of the
political parties, who are allowed to observe the balloting and
help count votes at each station before ballot boxes are delivered
to regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about irregularities will be investigated by a
tribunal, which has reportedly added extra lawyers for the
election. Only the tribunal has the power to annul ballots.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The PAN says it has assigned representatives to about 88 percent
of polling stations and is working toward 100-percent coverage,
according to Robert Pastor of the Atlanta-based Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor and others from the Carter Center, which has observed 28
elections in 20 countries, have been invited to spend election day
at each party's headquarters to assess complaints or observations
that come in from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precisely because the parties have the most at stake,'' Pastor
said, ``they will be the best eyes and ears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most competitive election in Mexican history,'' he
added. ``There is no important issue that is not being debated
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To address the perception of campaign inequity, election
officials here have been waging a battle against the federal
government _ including President Ernesto Zedillo _ over alleged
abuse of the media.
</P>
<P>
   Last month election officials asked Zedillo to suspend a series
of pro-government television and radio commercials at least 30 days
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has been credited with opening up Mexican democracy
during his six-year term, but election officials say that the
publicly funded commercials Zedillo refuses to pull from the
airwaves constitute extra publicity for Labastida and the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
   Zebadua called the ads ``the most extensive publicity campaign
in the history of the six-year administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads cast the government in a positive light, showing sunny
public workers dedicated to their jobs or details about recent
government achievements. In a letter defending the ads, Zedillo
spokesman Marco Provencio denied the commercials were
``propaganda'' and said ``the federal government is obligated to
inform citizens'' about its activities.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law requiring the ads to be suspended, but officials
said that before the 1994 presidential election the federal
government agreed to take similar spots off the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspension of publicity and public works and government
propaganda (prior to voting day) contributed to the legitimacy of
then-candidate Zedillo's election,'' said election counselor Juan
Molinar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today as (President Zedillo) doesn't answer our letter and he
continues propaganda on behalf of his party,'' Molinar said. ``That
seems like a bad example to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Election officials were also upset by a two-month gap prior to
May when television stations refused to air hard-hitting public
service ads advising Mexicans not to be ``puppets'' and to ignore
attempts to buy or coerce votes.
</P>
<P>
   Stations argued that the IFE was not eligible for free
government time since it was autonomous. Mexico's Ministry of
Internal Affairs dragged its feet in coming to the institute's
defense, Zebadua said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent public appearances, Zedillo has tried to blunt
criticism that the PRI has an unfair advantage in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government no longer interferes in the organization of
elections,'' Zedillo said Wednesday in a speech before Mexican
architects. ``The Mexican electoral system is one of the best and
most complete in the world.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Listen to Jesus, not Paul, about
women's role in church
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Should women be allowed to serve as ministers in
Baptist churches?
</P>
<P>
   That's sex, religion and politics, all in one -- a trinity unto
itself.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday morning when I visited First Baptist Church
of Washington, D.C., Dr. Robert Troutman of Alexandria, Va., a
retired minister with 35 years of experience, had something to say
on the question.
</P>
<P>
   Be it noted that First Baptist Church of Washington is in the
process of calling a new pastor. Dr. Troutman, who is a graduate of
Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and Southern Theological Seminary
in Louisville, Ky., was filling in.
</P>
<P>
   You often get your best sermons from retired preachers who are
filling in.
</P>
<P>
   Preaching from their heart and soul, they also tend to speak
their mind.
</P>
<P>
   Not allowing women to be ordained as ministers is tied to a
verse in 1st Timothy, 2:12, Dr. Troutman reminded the congregation,
in which the Apostle Paul admonishes women ``to be in silence'' in
the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul might have had a bad day when he wrote what he did,'' Dr.
Troutman allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Better we should place our faith in the actions of Jesus, not
the words of Paul, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the Gospel story of the woman at the well, which Dr.
Troutman considers ``the most important event for women in the
whole Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus asks for a drink of water from a Samaritan woman who has
come to the community well. She is shocked. Jews did not associate
with Samaritans.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the two peoples involved a difference in
doctrine, according to Dr. Troutman: Samaritans believing that the
Mount of Moses was the most sacred spot on Earth and the Jews
convinced that it was Jerusalem. As a result, they hadn't been on
speaking terms for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But Jesus always dealt with people on an individual basis,
``relating one on one with a human being,'' without concern for
race or gender, the preacher said.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this point, when Jesus offers her ``living water''
through salvation and everlasting life, Dr. Troutman said, ``He
made a woman equal to every man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done well with this, even into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The Samaritan woman rushes home to tell all her friends and
relatives about Jesus, and brings such crowds to hear Him that
Jesus spends two days speaking with all who come.
</P>
<P>
   What did that make her? ``She was an evangelist,'' said Dr.
Troutman. She literally ``brought people to Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is, Dr. Troutman concluded, when a young girl asks him if
she can be a minister, he will ask her only this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what the Lord is telling you to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``If she says yes, I say 'Amen.'''
</P>
<P>
   And the congregation, on this particular Sunday morning at this
particular Baptist church, said ``Amen.''

know. It might depend on how close the election is,'' said Zebadua,
who, along with three other counselors, spoke to a group of foreign
correspondents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The election is indeed expected to be tight. This is the first
race since 1929 that Mexico's long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, faces the real possibility of losing
the presidency. Recent polls indicate the PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida Ochoa is slightly ahead or even with challenger Vicente
Fox Quesada of the National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   As election day approaches, the PRI and the government have been
accused of stockpiling gifts _ bicycles and washing machines in
Yucatan and bags of cement in Mexico state _ to dole out to
supporters around or on election day.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the watchdog group Civic Alliance _ which is under
contract to Mexico's Congress to report irregularities _ presented
a list of more than 80 examples of alleged unlawful pressure
tactics or vote-buying. The group announced a ``crusade'' for
democracy and said it will join forces with other citizens'
organizations to dispatch 10,000 people throughout the country to
promote free voting.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a high-ranking manager at the government-owned
Mexican Petroleum company in Tabasco state held a news conference
to denounce an alleged campaign to force public workers to pressure
their subordinates to vote for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bosses can threaten you with losing your job, but don't
let them make you commit (electoral) crimes,'' Ramiro Berron,
technical coordinator for oil exploration in Mexico's southern
region, said in an appeal to fellow workers published in Reforma
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts of food, building supplies and other materials that have
been doled out already in some areas are not necessarily illegal.
But it is forbidden to tie handouts to votes, or for public
officials to use their position or government resources to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has challenged anyone who is complaining to come forward
with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The IFE, which has devised a sophisticated balloting system for
Mexico, is investigating 12 complaints of coercion or vote-buying _
10 against the PRI and two against other parties.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he has faith in the electoral system, candidate
Fox has said, ``I fully trust the Federal Elections Institute. It
is in good hands. But it is not in control of the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   A special section of the Mexican attorney general's office is
responsible for prosecuting cases of electoral fraud or pressure.
Mexico's Ministry of Social Development, which administers welfare
programs, said Tuesday it has investigated four complaints of
pressure campaigns using social programs as bait and has discounted
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Zebadua said reports of irregularities ``contaminates the
(election) environment. In spite of this, the Federal Elections
Institute is trying to march in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   After an investment of about $1.7 billion since 1998 on
technology, staffing and public funding for parties, election
officials believe that the actual balloting on July 2 will be free
of wholesale fraud if nearly 800,000 trained supervisors show up as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The country's 113,000 polling places are the ``neurological
center'' of the election, said election counselor Jesus Cantu. Only
voters with a photo credential matched to their name, photo and
number on registration lists at polling places will be allowed to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   A limited number of ballots will be available at each station.
The teams that will supervise the balloting are citizens who were
selected by lottery and trained by the IFE.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the legitimacy of the voting are representatives of the
political parties, who are allowed to observe the balloting and
help count votes at each station before ballot boxes are delivered
to regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about irregularities will be investigated by a
tribunal, which has reportedly added extra lawyers for the
election. Only the tribunal has the power to annul ballots.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The PAN says it has assigned representatives to about 88 percent
of polling stations and is working toward 100-percent coverage,
according to Robert Pastor of the Atlanta-based Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor and others from the Carter Center, which has observed 28
elections in 20 countries, have been invited to spend election day
at each party's headquarters to assess complaints or observations
that come in from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precisely because the parties have the most at stake,'' Pastor
said, ``they will be the best eyes and ears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most competitive election in Mexican history,'' he
added. ``There is no important issue that is not being debated
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To address the perception of campaign inequity, election
officials here have been waging a battle against the federal
government _ including President Ernesto Zedillo _ over alleged
abuse of the media.
</P>
<P>
   Last month election officials asked Zedillo to suspend a series
of pro-government television and radio commercials at least 30 days
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has been credited with opening up Mexican democracy
during his six-year term, but election officials say that the
publicly funded commercials Zedillo refuses to pull from the
airwaves constitute extra publicity for Labastida and the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
   Zebadua called the ads ``the most extensive publicity campaign
in the history of the six-year administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads cast the government in a positive light, showing sunny
public workers dedicated to their jobs or details about recent
government achievements. In a letter defending the ads, Zedillo
spokesman Marco Provencio denied the commercials were
``propaganda'' and said ``the federal government is obligated to
inform citizens'' about its activities.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law requiring the ads to be suspended, but officials
said that before the 1994 presidential election the federal
government agreed to take similar spots off the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspension of publicity and public works and government
propaganda (prior to voting day) contributed to the legitimacy of
then-candidate Zedillo's election,'' said election counselor Juan
Molinar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today as (President Zedillo) doesn't answer our letter and he
continues propaganda on behalf of his party,'' Molinar said. ``That
seems like a bad example to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Election officials were also upset by a two-month gap prior to
May when television stations refused to air hard-hitting public
service ads advising Mexicans not to be ``puppets'' and to ignore
attempts to buy or coerce votes.
</P>
<P>
   Stations argued that the IFE was not eligible for free
government time since it was autonomous. Mexico's Ministry of
Internal Affairs dragged its feet in coming to the institute's
defense, Zebadua said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent public appearances, Zedillo has tried to blunt
criticism that the PRI has an unfair advantage in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government no longer interferes in the organization of
elections,'' Zedillo said Wednesday in a speech before Mexican
architects. ``The Mexican electoral system is one of the best and
most complete in the world.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: How do you get rid of Castro, with TV ads?
 &HT;    RESENDING TO CORRECT SPELLING OF ``DESPERATE' IN TWO PLACES
 &HT;    For release June 18, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - Backed by seemingly limitless funds from within their
community, Cuban exiles are launching a series of nationwide
television ads designed to showcase the evils of the Fidel Castro
regime. This, of course, is in an attempt to reverse the negative
image among Americans on the heels of the Elian Gonzalez hysteria:
the screeching Marisleysis, the Cuban flag waving, the exploitation
of the child.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it is intended to inhibit the growing swell for ending the
boycott of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   So once again, the Cuban exile community declares war on Fidel
in the wrong place: in the U.S. instead of in Cuba. Let's face it,
the embargo _ now in its 50th year -- is a sham, nothing more than
political salve. Everyone in the world is trading with Cuba.
Americans break the embargo by the thousands and travel there, and
Cuban exiles themselves pump billions of dollars onto the island
each year in the form of funds and materials to their famililies
still there.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Castro's record is worth scrutinizing. His inexplicable
charisma that so excites (and fools) so many is a mask for his many
human rights crimes. But the exiles are waging a wrong kind of war
against Castro. Ads on television, legal battles over Elian,
boycotts of Cuba-based performers are not counter-revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal is to overthrow Castro, then that's got to be done
within Cuba. Better the exile community -- whose members include
some fabulously wealthy people should go about creating problems
for Castro on the island, rather than on the streets of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Recent U.S. Coast Guard videos reveal how desperate Cubans are
to get away from their island prison. They show rafters wielding
machetes against Coast Guard personnel attempting to interdict them
at sea. One must wonder why the machetes never have been wielded
against Castro officials on the island in an attempt to overturn
the oppression of his regime.
</P>
<P>
   The end of Castroism begins somewhere in Cuba, just as the
beginning of Castroism began there _ in the mountains, with rebels,
with guns, with martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 40 years since the Bay of Pigs fiasco and almost
that long since the United States, in a deal with the Soviets,
agreed to put the lid on military counter-revolutionary incursions
by Cubans from the U.S. It was a lousy deal then, still is.
</P>
<P>
   But that should not prevent the exiles from pursuing their
cause. Certainly raids on Cuba would go against much of world
opinion, and terrorism in the form of making it difficult for
tourists to consider Cuba a safe visit would be seen as
reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the way to undermine Castro. That's what he did in
1959. Certainly, the world has changed since _ but the
revolutionary world has not. The only way to overthrow a repressive
government (other than by democratic election) is to physically
pitch it out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Let the disenchanted, desperate people of Cuba stay in Cuba and
do something about it instead of rafting to South Florida and
joining in the anti-Castro rhetoric here. And let the exiles show
some bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Arms smuggling, these days, is easy; everyone in the world is
doing it. Give the disenchanted on the island firepower instead of
machetes, dislodge the tourist industry and foreign investment
there, cause internal problems with infrastructure (what there is
of it) and make life miserable for Fidel Castro as he did for
Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
   This does not need to be done with the approval of the United
States, a nation incapable of stopping the flow of illegal drugs
and aliens in the region and just as unlikely to be able to stop
the flow of illegal arms and other counter-revolutionary
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The First Marine Division is not going to take back Cuba for the
exiles; they and those inside Cuba must do it. What good is a
positive image (via TV ads) if your life's goal -- the cause _ is
nowhere close to being realized?
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis long ago stopped worrying about world opinion, and
paid attention to the nasty business they had to deal with. And
that's what Cuban exiles need to be doing.

&HT;     GETTING YOUR CAMPING KIT IN ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RICK KARLIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The newest generation of camping/hiking gear
might not be cheaper, but it's definitely lighter, stronger, and
better than that of past decades, or even just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a lot more of it, from fashionable hiking boots and
cargo pants to the ubiquitous backpack. ``They call it the `Jeep'
look,'' said Dave Dillenbeck, of Ragged Mountain outdoor store in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   When you're really using the stuff outside, though, it needs to
be functional more than fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   Here are things to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for different properties, depending on whether you are
backpacking or car-camping. When you're hauling everything on your
back, lightness and compactness are paramount.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are traveling in the backcountry, avoid cotton. It will
stay wet if you are caught in the rain or if you work up a sweat.
On a hot, humid day, that moisture is merely uncomfortable, but if
the temperature cools, which can happen year-round in the
mountains, it can become downright dangerous. Clothing made of
water-repelling fibers such as polypropylene or, for colder
weather, fleece, is a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   _ For sleeping bags, almost anything that's comfortable and warm
enough will do in the summer if you're in a campground. Most
sleeping bags have temperature ratings that serve as guides.
Traditionally, down is the warmest and lightest filling for a
sleeping bag, but it has fallen out of favor as synthetic
insulation has become more efficient. While down remains
incomparably light and comfortable, it becomes almost useless when
wet.
</P>
<P>
   Backpackers often prefer mummy bags that are smaller and
lighter, but they do constrict movement and can be uncomfortable
for those who toss and turn while they sleep.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't use a cot, take along a specialized backpacking
mattress like a ThermaRest or dense foam pad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tents run the gamut from huge car-camping palaces to light
backpacking models. Get one from a reputable manufacturer such as
Eureka, North Face or other well-known brand, and if there are
seams, cover them with sealant before you use it. As with much
backpacking gear, ``the more you are willing to spend, the lighter
it can be,'' notes Neil Woodworth, deputy executive director of the
Adirondack Mountain Club.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the backcountry, you'll need a water filter or purifier to
guard against Giardia lamblia, those microscopic organisms that
cause severe diarrhea. Thoroughly boiling your drinking and cooking
water also will protect you, as will iodine, but filters and
purifiers are hard to beat for convenience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boots: there is a dizzying array of styles, brands, materials
and prices. The best advice is the most simple: Get a pair that
offer good ankle support and fit well, with adequate room for your
toes when walking downhill.
</P>
<P>
   _ A final bit of advice for techies: don't rely solely on that
nifty new Global Positioning System device for pathfinding. GPS
devices use microwave links to satellites to give the users
latitude and longitude. But if you don't have a map for referencing
the terrain, or can't figure out which direction you should go to
get home, a GPS is useless.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should you become dependent on your cell phone. Reception
can be spotty in mountainous areas, and of course, batteries can
fail at the most inauspicious moments.

&HT;     CLOTHIERS STITCH TOGETHER CAMPAIGN AGAINST CASUAL GARB 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Subs entire text)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DANIELLE T. FURFARO   
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A nationwide campaign aimed at reversing the
trend of casual dress in the workplace has been launched by a
clothier who is spearheading ``Dress-up Thursdays,'' an initiative
that he and others hope will bring a sense of traditionalism back
to the office and sales back to the tailored clothing industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dress code of America has slipped into the gutter,'' said
Vince Rua, owner of Christopher's Mens Stores Inc. in Albany. ``If
you have something that you would wear to your kid's soccer game on
the weekend, you shouldn't wear it to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rua and his industry peers _ including Steve Toia, national
sales manager at Arnold Brant; George Zimmer, president of Men's
Wearhouse; and James Ammeen, president and chief executive officer
of Neema Clothing _ are on the steering committee for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has spent the last few months gearing up for a
Sept. 21 kickoff for Dress-up Thursdays by developing a marketing
plan, collecting contributions and contacting business executives
to get them to incorporate the day into their company culture.
</P>
<P>
   At his office in downtown Albany, Rua rattles off a list of
studies and anecdotes that show a correlation between casual dress
policies and lower productivity/higher absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In white-collar situations, when the dress code is relaxed,
office decorum suffers tremendously,'' he said. ``Productivity
suffers all week and Fridays don't even exist.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, management consultant and behavioral scientist Jeffrey
L. Magee of Tulsa undertook a study to determine the effect casual
dress had on productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clients were complaining a lot about problems in the
office,'' Magee said. ``I started noticing a correlation between HR
(human resources) people having to spend time on babysitting issues
and casual-dress policies.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Magee's study, which Rua uses in his crusade
against ``business casual,'' ethics, productivity and morality in
the workplace all go down when casual-dress policies are in place,
while instances of absenteeism, sexual harassment and offensive
language increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in a blue-collar situation, when dress is allowed to be
more casual, the level of service is also more casual,'' Magee
said. ``If you are talking on the phone and a customer comes in,
you are more likely to get off the phone right away if you are in a
suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rua said Dress-up Thursdays is not an effort to increase sales
at his three retail stores. He said he does hope the campaign will
increase sales across the $62 billion tailored-clothing industry.
Others on the steering committee agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clothing sales have declined in the past 10 years, especially
in the tailored-clothing segment,'' said Ammeen, whose Neema
Clothing is a manufacturer in New York City. ``So this is a
grass-roots movement to get some of that back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammeen and Rua both put the blame for the start of business
casual on Levi Straus &AMP; Co., the San Francisco company that more
than a decade ago began sending out promotional packages to
executives touting the benefits of dressing casually on the job.
The packet included a videotape and brochures of sharp-looking
casual wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point in time, every CEO in the country found this
package on their desk,'' Rua said. ``And now, a major bank just
announced they were going casual. And why? It's because the
competitor did it. They don't even bother to look into the
statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide trend toward casual might keep companies from
implementing Dress-up Thursdays, at least in the beginning, some
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``As CPAs, we really follow trends, as opposed to lead,'' said
M. Bruce Cohen, managing partner of the PricewaterhouseCoopers
office in Albany. ``So as long as our clients are dressed casual,
we are going to do what they do. If our clients dress casually on a
Thursday, we will be dressed casually, too.''

IT'S A CREDIT TO GOVERNOR ALL AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's not bragging about it, but Gov. George W. Bush has spiced
Afro-Texans' first-of-the-new-century Juneteenth jubilee with
something special to eat, sing, dance, parade and orate about.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the emancipation of two plaques commemorating the
Confederacy from the Texas Supreme Court building melded perfectly
with the annual observance of Gen. Gordon Granger's June 19, 1865,
announcement of the emancipation of the slaves in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it wasn't planned that way. But because of the strong
symbolism of the removal of the plaques, one of which contains a
representation of the Confederate battle flag and the other the
seal of the Confederacy, it is hard to believe that it was not
premeditated political scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Bush is not taking credit for the deed. He did not
utter any kind of plaque emancipation proclamation. A Bush
representative said that the decision on the plaques' fate rested
with the General Services Commission. The GSC's executive director
said, however, that his agency was obligated to do whatever the
governor and the Texas Supreme Court told it to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's reasonable, therefore, to assume that the GSC took its
marching orders in the matter of the plaques either directly or
indirectly from the governor. But those orchestrating the Bush
presidential campaign undoubtedly would like to keep the candidate
in a posture of ``plausible deniability.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaques had become a meddlesome issue for Bush. The call for
their removal by the Texas chapter of the NAACP reminded the public
of his evasiveness on the Confederate battle flag issue during the
primary in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   He could not continue to evade the issue in his own state. He
needed to dispose of it to keep it from dogging his heels all the
way to November. So he did the right thing, both in absolute terms
and politically.
</P>
<P>
   Those plaques, which are so insulting to millions of
Afro-Texans, had no place in a place of such exalted significance
to the people of Texas, a building paid for by the taxpayers of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   It well may be that the governor did the right thing for
political reasons alone. But it also could be that he did it just
because he knew it was the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texans, particularly Confederate heritage advocates, have
criticized the way the plaques were removed and new ones _
declaring that the Texas courts dispense ``equal justice ...
regardless of race, creed or color'' _ were substituted for them.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque exchange occurred unannounced last Friday after
working hours. Some see that as sneaking, craven and undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Actually it was a display of good, pragmatic leadership. Bush
did not want to turn that business into a sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   He must have known that he would catch some grief from the
neo-Confederates, and he decided to weather it, knowing that it
will soon blow over. He has no reason to fear political retaliation
from them because they have nowhere else to go. They surely won't
vote for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, has to be concerned about independent voters.
With his display of sensitivity to the concerns of
African-Americans, he has indicated that he is not writing them
off.
</P>
<P>
   He can take Texas without the black vote. But he may need some
of it in other states. And he could lose votes among white
independents in the Northeast and on the West Coast by appearing to
write off the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has reached that point in his campaign for
the presidency where he must begin to show that there really is a
compassionate side to his conservatism. He can afford to do that
because he has most of the white conservative voters _ not just the
neo-Cons _ in his hip pocket.
</P>
<P>
   His Juneteenth gesture was a good move in that direction. It was
politically smart. And it was the right thing to do.

MOSLEY AND DE LA HOYA RENEW OLD RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They weighed 75 pounds when they first met. Shane
Mosley was 12 years old, Oscar De La Hoya was 11 and, according to
Mosley, the decision was never in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit him anytime I wanted to with the jab,'' Mosley recalled
during an interview in his downtown hotel suite. ``I beat him, but
that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As amateurs, they boxed about 60 rounds against each other,
developing a rivalry that will culminate Saturday night, when
Mosley and De La Hoya fight for the World Boxing Council
welterweight championship at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting De La Hoya's draw at the box office, promoters for Top
Rank are predicting that pay-per-view sales will be the largest in
history for a nonheavyweight fight. For De La Hoya, it is a chance
to polish his golden-boy image and finally put his haunting Sept.
18 loss to Felix Trinidad behind him.
</P>
<P>
   For Mosley, it is simply an opportunity to ascend to stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for a new champion,'' Mosley said. ``People need to
see just how Sugar Shane executes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley (34-0, 32 knockouts) can become the sixth fighter to win
both the lightweight and welterweight titles. He would join a group
that includes De La Hoya (32-1, 26 knockouts), Roberto Duran,
Pernell Whitaker, Henry Armstrong and Barney Ross.
</P>
<P>
   As a 135-pound lightweight, Mosley defended his title eight
times, winning each by knockout. He vacated the championship last
year and made the leap to the 147-pound welterweight division.
After knockouts of Wilfredo Rivera and Willie Wise, Mosley moved
into position for a reunion with De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting De La Hoya gives me a comfort level because we know
each other so well,'' Mosley said. ``A lot of other fighters have
gotten in the ring with him and get hit a couple of times and they
go, `Oh, wow,' and they start doubting themselves. With me, I know
what to expect. I know what I'm up against.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley has been staggered, but never knocked to the canvas in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to their amateur days, he believes, his jabs are still
quicker and stronger than De La Hoya's. ``I can cover over the top
of his jab with mine,'' Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya politely disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's seen everything, he hasn't felt it,'' De La Hoya said.
``He's had 34 fights, but he doesn't have that kind of experience
to know how it feels to be hit by someone who can punch as hard as
me. I don't know how he's going to react, but it's an issue with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley and De La Hoya last met in the ring during sparring
sessions as they both prepared for the 1992 Olympics, where De La
Hoya won the gold medal at 132 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a jab contest between me and him,'' Mosley said. ``I
landed a lot of jabs and overhand rights. Oscar did what he does
best, throw a lot of combinations and left hooks.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said, ``If he's going to use that fight there, he's
really in trouble.''

ARMSTRONG IS GETTING AHEAD OF HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong, who last summer capped an amazing recovery from
cancer by winning the Tour de France, the world's most prestigious
and difficult bicycle race, is a bit concerned about his physical
condition. He says he feels so sharp that he may be ready too soon
for this year's tour, from July 1-23.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my training and racing this year has been geared to the
tour,'' Armstrong said Wednesday night in a telephone interview
from his spring and summer home in Nice, France. ``I'm satisfied
with what I've done. In fact, maybe I'm a little ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in such good condition, you can't use it in
training or races to show off your strength. You can't constantly
go deep and try to be extraordinary all the time, or you'll break
down your form.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Armstrong, a 28-year-old Texan, and his U.S.
Postal Service team completed the Tour Dauphine Libere, eight days
through the French Alps with considerable climbing. His teammate
Tyler Hamilton won. Armstrong finished third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the same race last year,'' Armstrong said, ``and didn't
feel nearly as good as I did this year. So this told me that I'm
either stronger than I was last year or I'm too far ahead of
schedule now. I don't know. I have to be careful not to be ready
too quick.''
</P>
<P>
   That Armstrong is even riding is remarkable. Less than three
years ago, testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen, lungs
and brain was diagnosed; doctors gave him less than a 50-50 chance
to recover. He not only recovered, but he also rode better than
ever. He said his health is fine now, and the slight concussion he
sustained a month ago in a training crash had done nothing except
persuade him to wear his helmet whenever he rides.

<P>
   Last winter, back home in Austin, he spent much of his time with
his foundation spreading awareness of cancer. With Sally Jenkins,
he also wrote an autobiography, ``It's Not About the Bike: My
Journey Back to Life'' (Putnam). It was sixth among nonfiction
books on last Sunday's New York Times best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the defense of his Tour de France title, although his
human-interest drama has been overshadowed by the drug problems
that have haunted this race in recent years. Cycling officials are
suspending riders for two weeks if their red blood cell count
exceeds 50 percent, saying it may indicate the use of EPO, a
potentially life-threatening drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need a test,'' Armstrong said, ``but it needs to be
solid and fair. I hate to think we could have false positives and
see our sport thrown back into all that baloney again. There's not
nearly as much of that stuff used as people are led to believe.
From all my experience on all the teams I've been on, this is
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, the percentage of red blood cells fluctuates
drastically according to the effort you put in. Mine is generally
43 or 44 percent, but if I train for three or four weeks at
altitude it could go up to 50 percent. So there's a problem
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's support staff is in place. At his three-bedroom home
in Nice, a mile uphill from the Mediterranean, he has his wife,
Kristin, and their 8-month-old son, Luke, who has started to crawl.
He says nothing is bothering him, including the pressure on a
defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   Does he expect to win the tour?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be disappointed if I don't,'' he said, ``but I don't know
if that means I expect to win. I certainly expect to be a factor.
In the tour, the strongest man almost always wins, and I felt I was
the strongest last year. When the race was in its hardest moments,
I felt I was there.''

<P>
   TAR HEEL, N.C. _ It must have been 1 o'clock. That's when the
white man usually comes out of his glass office and stands on the
scaffolding above the factory floor. He stood with his palms on the
rails, his elbows out. He looked like a tower guard up there or a
border patrol agent. He stood with his head cocked.
</P>
<P>
   One o'clock means it is getting near the end of the workday.
Quota has to be met and the workload doubles. The conveyor belt
always overflows with meat around 1 o'clock. So the workers double
their pace, hacking pork from shoulder bones with a driven
single-mindedness. They stare blankly, like mules in blinders, as
the butchered slabs pass by.
</P>
<P>
   It is called the picnic line: 18 workers lined up on both sides
of a belt, carving meat from bone. Up to 16 million shoulders a
year come down that line here at Smithfield Packing Co., the
largest pork production plant in the world. That works out to about
32,000 a shift, 63 a minute, one every 17 seconds for each worker
for eight and a half hours a day. The first time you stare down at
that belt you know your body is going to give in way before the
machine ever will.
</P>
<P>
   On this day the boss saw something he didn't like. He climbed
down and approached the picnic line from behind. He leaned into the
ear of a broad-shouldered black man. He had been riding him all
day, and the day before. The boss bawled him out good this time,
but no one heard what was said. The roar of the machinery was too
ferocious for that. Still, everyone knew what was expected. They
worked harder.
</P>
<P>
   The white man stood and watched for the next two hours as the
blacks worked in their groups and the Mexicans in theirs. He stood
there with his head cocked.
</P>
<P>
   At shift change the black man walked away, hosed himself down
and turned in his knives. Then he let go. He threatened to murder
the boss. He promised to quit. He said he was losing his mind,
which made for good comedy, since he was standing near a conveyor
chain of severed hogs' heads, their mouths yoked open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who that cracker think he is?'' the black man wanted to know.
There were enough hogs, he said, ``not to worry about no fleck of
meat being left on the bone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep treating me like a Mexican and I'll beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   The boss walked by just then and the black man lowered his head.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GETS THE DIRTY JOBS
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you learn in the hog plant is the value of a
sharp knife. The second thing you learn is that you don't want to
work with a knife. Finally you learn that not everyone has to work
with a knife. Whites, blacks, American Indians and Mexicans, they
all have their separate stations.
</P>
<P>
   The few whites on the payroll tend to be mechanics or
supervisors. As for the Indians, a handful are supervisors; others
tend to get clean menial jobs like warehouse work. With few
exceptions, that leaves the blacks and Mexicans with the dirty jobs
at the factory, one of the only places within 50 miles in this
muddy corner of North Carolina where a person might make more than
$8 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   While Smithfield's profits nearly doubled in the past year,
wages have remained flat. So a lot of Americans here have quit and
a lot of Mexicans have been hired to take their places. But more
than management, the workers see one another as the problem, and
they see the competition in skin tones.
</P>
<P>
   The locker rooms are self-segregated and so is the cafeteria.
The enmity spills out into the towns. The races generally keep to
themselves. Along Interstate 95 there are four tumbledown bars, one
for each color: white, black, red and brown.
</P>
<P>
   Language is also a divider. There are English and Spanish lines
at the Social Security office and in the waiting rooms of the
county health clinics. This means that different groups don't
really understand one another and tend to be suspicious of what
they do know.
</P>
<P>
   You begin to understand these things the minute you apply for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   BLOOD AND BURNOUT
</P>
<P>
   ``Treat the meat like you going to eat it yourself,'' the hiring
manager told the 30 new employees, most of them down on their luck
and hungry for work. The Smithfield plant will take just about any
man or woman with a pulse and a sparkling urine sample. This
reporter was hired using his own name and acknowledged that he was
currently employed but was not asked where and did not say.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughtering swine is repetitive, brutish work, so grueling that
three weeks on the factory floor leave no doubt in your mind about
why the turnover is 100 percent. Five thousand quit and five
thousand are hired every year. You hear people say, They don't kill
pigs in the plant, they kill people.
</P>
<P>
   So desperate is the company for workers, its recruiters comb the
streets of New York's immigrant communities, personnel staff
members say, and word of mouth has reached Mexico and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The company even procures criminals. Several at the morning
orientation were inmates on work release in green uniforms, bused
in from the county prison.
</P>
<P>
   The new workers were given a safety speech and tax papers, shown
a promotional video and informed that there was enough methane,
ammonia and chlorine at the plant to kill every living thing here
in Bladen County. Of the 30 new employees, the black women were
assigned to the chitterlings room, where they would scrape feces
and worms from intestines. The black men were sent to the
butchering floor. The two free white men and the Indian were given
jobs making boxes. And most of the Mexicans, whose orientation was
given in Spanish, were assigned knife work, cutting sides of pork
into smaller and smaller products.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the hiring hall that morning, two women chatted in
Spanish about their pregnancies. A young black man had heard
enough. His small town the next county over was crowded with
Mexicans. They just started showing up three years ago _ drawn to
rural Robeson County by the plant _ and never left. They stood in
groups on the street corners, and the young black man never knew
what they were saying. They took the jobs and did them for less.
Some had houses in Mexico, while he lived in a trailer with his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now here he was, trying for the only job around, and he had to
listen to Spanish, had to compete with peasants. The world was
going to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is America and I want to start hearing some English,
now!'' he screamed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women told him where to stick his head and listen for
the echo. ``Then you'll hear some English,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An old white man with a face as pinched and lined as a pot roast
complained, ``The tacos are worse than the niggers,'' and the
Indian leaned against the wall and laughed. In the doorway, the
prisoners shifted from foot to foot, watching the spectacle unfold
from behind a cloud of cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring manager came out of his office and broke it up just
before things degenerated into a brawl. Then he handed out the
employment stubs. ``I don't want no problems,'' he warned. He told
them to report to the plant on Monday morning to collect their
carving knives.
</P>
<P>
   $7.70 AN HOUR, PAIN ALL DAY
</P>
<P>
   Monday. The mist rose from the swamps and by 4:45 a.m. thousands
of headlights snaked along the old country roads. Cars carried
people from the backwoods, from the single and doublewide trailers,
from the cinder-block houses and wooden shacks: whites from
Lumberton and Elizabethtown; blacks from Fairmont and Fayetteville;
Indians from Pembroke; the Mexicans from trailer parks in Red
Springs and St. Pauls.
</P>
<P>
   They converged at the Smithfield plant, a 973,000-square-foot
leviathan of pipe and steel near the Cape Fear River. The factory
towers over the tobacco and cotton fields, surrounded by pine trees
and a few of the old white-washed plantation houses. Built seven
years ago, it is by far the biggest employer in this region, 75
miles west of the Atlantic and 90 miles south of the booming
Research Triangle around Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The workers filed in, their faces stiffened by sleep and the
cold, like saucers of milk gone hard. They punched the clock at 5
a.m., waiting for the knives to be handed out, the chlorine freshly
applied by the cleaning crew burning their eyes and throats. Nobody
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   The hallway was a river of brown-skinned Mexicans. The six
prisoners who were starting that day looked confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell's going on?'' the only white inmate, Billy
Harwood, asked an older black worker named Wade Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Baker said, seeing that the prisoner was talking about
the hundreds of Mexicans. ``I see you been away for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Harwood had been away _ nearly seven years, for writing
phony payroll checks from the family pizza business to buy crack.
He was Rip Van Winkle standing there. Everywhere he looked there
were Mexicans. What he probably didn't know was that one out of
three newborns at the nearby Robeson County health clinic was a
Latino; that the county's Roman Catholic church had a special
Sunday Mass for Mexicans said by a Honduran priest; that the
schools needed Spanish speakers to teach English.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a month to go on his sentence, Harwood took the
pork job to save a few dollars. The word in jail was that the job
was a cakewalk for a white man.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't looking like any cakewalk. He wasn't going to
get a boxing job like a lot of other whites. Apparently inmates
were on the bottom rung, just like Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Harwood and the other prisoners were put on the picnic
line. Knife work pays $7.70 an hour to start. It is money
unimaginable in Mexico, where the average wage is $4 a day. But the
American money comes at a price. The work burns your muscles and
dulls your mind. Staring down into the meat for hours strains your
neck. After thousands of cuts a day your fingers no longer open
freely. Standing in the damp 42-degree air causes your knees to
lock, your nose to run, your teeth to throb.
</P>
<P>
   The whistle blows at 3, you get home by 4, pour peroxide on your
nicks by 5. You take pills for your pains and stand in a hot shower
trying to wash it all away. You hurt. And by 8 o'clock you're in
bed, exhausted, thinking of work.
</P>
<P>
   The convict said he felt cheated. He wasn't supposed to be doing
Mexican work. After his second day he was already talking of
quitting. ``Man, this can't be for real,'' he said, rubbing his
wrists as if they'd been in handcuffs. ``This job's for an ass.
They treat you like an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   He just might have quit after the third day had it not been for
Mercedes Fernandez, a Mexican. He took a place next to her by the
conveyor belt. She smiled at him, showed him how to make incisions.
That was the extent of his on-the-job training. He was peep-eyed,
missing a tooth and squat from the starchy prison food, but he
acted as if this tiny woman had taken a fancy to him. In truth, she
was more fascinated than infatuated, she later confided. In her
year at the plant, he was the first white person she had ever
worked with.
</P>
<P>
   The other workers noticed her helping the white man, so unusual
was it for a Mexican and a white to work shoulder to shoulder, to
try to talk or even to make eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   As for blacks, she avoided them. She was scared of them.
``Blacks don't want to work,'' Fernandez said when the new batch of
prisoners came to work on the line. ``They're lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the factory cuts people off from one another.
If it's not the language barrier, it's the noise _ the hammering of
compressors, the screeching of pulleys, the grinding of the lines.
You can hardly make your voice heard. To get another's attention on
the cut line, you bang the butt of your knife on the steel
railings, or you lob a chunk of meat. Fernandez would sometimes
throw a piece of shoulder at a friend across the conveyor and wave
good morning.

<P>
   THE KILL FLOOR
</P>
<P>
   The kill floor sets the pace of the work. For those jobs, the
plant picks strong men and pays a top wage, as high as $12 an hour.
If the men fail to make quota, plenty of others are willing to try.
It is mostly the blacks who work the kill floor, the stone-hearted
jobs that pay more and appear out of bounds for all but a few
Mexicans. Plant workers gave various reasons for this: The Mexicans
are too small; they don't like blood; they don't like heavy
lifting; or just plain ``We built this country and we ain't going
to hand them everything,'' as one black man put it.
</P>
<P>
   Kill-floor work is hot, quick and bloody. The hog is herded in
from the stockyard, then stunned with an electric gun. It is lifted
onto a conveyor belt, dazed but not dead, and passed to a waiting
group of men wearing bloodstained smocks and blank faces. They slit
the neck, shackle the hind legs and watch a machine lift the
carcass into the air, letting its life flow out in a purple gush,
into a steaming collection trough.
</P>
<P>
   The carcass is run through a scalding bath, trolleyed over the
factory floor and then dumped onto a table with all the force of a
quarter-ton water balloon. In the misty-red room, men slit along
its hind tendons and skewer the beast with hooks. It is again
lifted and shot across the room on a pulley and bar, where it hangs
with hundreds of others as if in some kind of horrific dry-cleaning
shop. It is then pulled through a wall of flames and met on the
other side by more black men who, stripped to the waist beneath
their smocks, scrape away any straggling bristles.
</P>
<P>
   The place reeks of sweat and scared animal, steam and blood.
Nothing is wasted from these beasts, not the plasma, not the
glands, not the bones. Everything is used, and the kill men,
repeating slaughterhouse lore, say that even the squeal is sold to
Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   The carcasses sit in the freezer overnight and are then rolled
out to the cut floor.
</P>
<P>
   The cut floor is opposite to the kill floor in nearly every way.
The workers are mostly brown _ Mexicans _ not black; the lighting
yellow, not red. The vapor comes from cold breath, not hot water.
It is here that the hog is quartered. The pieces are parceled out
and sent along the disassembly lines to be cut into ribs, hams,
bellies, loins and chops.
</P>
<P>
   People on the cut lines work with a mindless fury. There is
tremendous pressure to keep the conveyor belts moving, to pack
orders, to put bacon and ham and sausage on the public's breakfast
table. There is no clock, no window, no fragment of the world
outside. Everything is pork. If the line fails to keep pace, the
kill men must slow down, backing up the slaughter. The boxing line
will have little to do, costing the company payroll hours. The
blacks who kill will become angry with the Mexicans who cut, who in
turn will become angry with the white superintendents who push
them.
</P>
<P>
   10,000 UNWELCOME MEXICANS
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans never push back. They cannot. Some have legitimate
work papers, but more, like Mercedes Fernandez, do not.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, Fernandez was several thousand dollars in debt to
the smugglers who had sneaked her and her family into the United
States. She owed $1,000 more for the authentic-looking birth
certificate and Social Security card that are needed to get hired.
She and her husband, Armando, expected to be in debt for years.
They had mouths to feed back home.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans are so frightened about being singled out that they
do not even tell one another their real names. They have their
given names, their work-paper names and ``Hey you,'' as their
American supervisors call them. In the telling of their stories,
Mercedes and Armando Fernandez insisted that their real names be
used, to protect their identities. It was their work names they did
not want used _ names bought in a back alley in Barstow, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely are the newcomers welcomed with open arms. Long before
the Mexicans arrived, Robeson County, one of the poorest in North
Carolina, was an uneasy racial mix. In the 1990 census, of the
100,000 people living in Robeson, nearly 40 percent were Lumbee
Indian, 35 percent white and 25 percent black. Until a dozen years
ago the county schools were de facto segregated, and no person of
color held any meaningful county job from sheriff to court clerk to
judge.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in 1988, two armed Indian men occupied the local
newspaper office, taking hostages and demanding that the sheriff's
department be investigated for corruption and its treatment of
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Indian lawyer, Julian Pierce, was killed that same
year, and the suspect turned up dead in a broom closet before he
could be charged. The hierarchy of power was summed up on a plaque
that hangs in the courthouse commemorating the dead of World War I.
It lists the veterans by color: ``white'' on top, ``Indian'' in the
middle and ``colored'' on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   That hierarchy mirrors the pecking order at the hog plant. The
Lumbees _ who have fought their way up in the county apparatus and
have built their own construction businesses _ are fond of saying
they are too smart to work in the factory. And the few who do work
there seem to end up with the cleaner jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But as reds and blacks began to make progress in the 1990s _ for
the first time an Indian sheriff was elected, and a black man is
now the public defender _ the Latinos began arriving. The U.S.
Census Bureau estimated that 1,000 Latinos were living in Robeson
County last year. People only laugh at that number.
</P>
<P>
   ``A thousand? Hell, there's more than that in the Wal-Mart on a
Saturday afternoon,'' said Bill Smith, director of county health
services. He and other officials guess that there are at least
10,000 Latinos in Robeson, most having arrived in the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they built that factory in Bladen, they promised a
trickledown effect,'' Smith said. ``But the money ain't trickling
down this way. Bladen got the money and Robeson got the social
problems.''

 TAR HEEL, N.C.: social problems.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Robeson there is the strain on public resources. There is the
substandard housing. There is the violence. Last year 27 killings
were committed in Robeson, mostly in the countryside, giving it a
higher murder rate than Newark, N.J., or Detroit. Three Mexicans
were robbed and killed last fall. Latinos have also been the
victims of highway stickups.
</P>
<P>
   In the yellow-walled break room at the plant, Mexicans talked
among themselves about their three slain men, about the midnight
visitors with obscured faces and guns, men who knew that the
illegal workers used mattresses rather than banks. Mercedes
Fernandez, like many Mexicans, would not venture out at night.
``Blacks have a problem,'' she said. ``They live in the past. They
are angry about slavery, so instead of working, they steal from
us.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband never lingered in the parking lot at shift
change. That is when the anger of a long day comes seeping out.
Cars get kicked and faces slapped over parking spots or fender
benders. The traffic is a serpent. Cars jockey for a spot in line
to make the quarter-mile crawl along the plant's one-lane exit road
to the highway. Usually no one will let you in. A lot of the
scuffling is between black and Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK AND BLEAK
</P>
<P>
   The meat was backing up on the conveyor and spilling onto the
floor. The supervisor climbed down off the scaffolding and chewed
out a group of black women. Something about skin being left on the
meat. There was a new skinner on the job, and the cutting line was
expected to take up his slack. The whole line groaned. First looks
flew, then people began hurling slurs at one another in Spanish and
English, words they could hardly hear over the factory's roar. The
black women started waving their knives at the Mexicans. The
Mexicans waved theirs back. The blades got close. One Mexican spit
at the blacks and was fired.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the knife scene, Wade Baker went home and sagged
in his recliner. CNN played. Good news on Wall Street, the
television said. Wages remained stable. ``Since when is the fact
that a man doesn't get paid good news?'' he asked the TV. The TV
told him that money was everywhere _ everywhere but here.
</P>
<P>
   Still lean at 51, Baker has seen life improve since his youth in
the Jim Crow South. You can say things. You can ride in a car with
a white woman. You can stay in the motels, eat in the restaurants.
The black man got off the white man's field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Socially, things are much better,'' Baker said wearily over
the droning television. ``But we're going backwards as black people
economically. For every one of us doing better, there's two of us
doing worse.''
</P>
<P>
   His town, Chad Bourne, is a dreary strip of peeling paint and
warped porches and houses as run down as rotting teeth. Young men
drift from the cinder-block pool hall to the empty streets and
back. In the center of town is a bank, a gas station, a chicken
shack and a motel. As you drive out, the lights get dimmer and the
homes older until eventually you're in a flat void of tobacco
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was standing on the main street with his grandson Monte
watching the Christmas parade march by when a scruffy man
approached. It was Baker's cousin, and he smelled of kerosene and
had dust in his hair as if he lived in a vacant building and warmed
himself with a portable heater. He asked for $2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic isn't it?'' Baker said as his cousin walked away
only eight bits richer. ``He was asking me the same thing 10 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of Mexicans stood across the street hanging around the
gas station watching them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around here always want to blame the system,'' he said.
``And it is true that the system is anti-black and anti-poor. It's
true that things are run by the whites. But being angry only means
you failed in life. Instead of complaining, you got to work twice
as hard and make do.''
</P>
<P>
   He stood quietly with his hands in his pockets watching the
parade go by. He watched the Mexicans across the street, laughing
in their new clothes. Then he said, almost as an afterthought,
``There's a day coming soon where the Mexicans are going to catch
hell from the blacks, the way the blacks caught it from the
whites.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade Baker used to work in the post office, until he lost his
job over drugs. When he came out of his haze a few years ago, there
wasn't much else for him but the plant. He took the job, he said,
``because I don't have a 401(k).'' He took it because he had
learned from his mother that you don't stand around with your head
down and your hand out waiting for another man to drop you a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Baker, bent and gray now, grew up a sharecropper, the
granddaughter of slaves. She was raised up in a tarpaper shack,
picked cotton and hoed tobacco for a white family. She supported
her three boys alone by cleaning white people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s something good started happening. There was a
labor shortage, just as there is now. The managers at the textile
plants started giving machine jobs to black people.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Baker was 40 then. ``I started at a dollar and 60 cents
an hour, and honey, that was a lot of money then,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The work was plentiful through the 1970s and '80s, and she was
able to save money and add on to her home. By the early '90s the
textile factories started moving away, to Mexico. Robeson County
has lost about a quarter of its jobs since that time.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Robeson hovers around 8 percent, twice the
national average. In neighboring Columbus County it is 10.8
percent. In Bladen County it is 5 percent, and Bladen has the pork
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baker believes that people who want to work can find
work. As far as he's concerned, there are too many shiftless young
men who ought to be working, even if it's in the pork plant. His
son-in-law once worked there, quit and now hangs around the gas
station where other young men sell dope.
</P>
<P>
   The son-in-law came over one day last fall and threatened to
cause trouble if the Bakers didn't let him borrow the car. This
could have turned messy; the 71-year-old Evelyn Baker keeps a .38
tucked in her bosom.
</P>
<P>
   When Wade Baker got home from the plant and heard from his
mother what had happened, he took up his pistol and went down to
the corner, looking for his son-in-law. He chased a couple of the
young men around the dark dusty lot, waving the gun. ``Hold still
so I can shoot one of you!'' he recalled having bellowed. ``That
would make the world a better place!''
</P>
<P>
   He scattered the men without firing. Later, sitting in his car
with his pistol on the seat and his hands between his knees, he
said, staring into the night: ``There's got to be more than this.
White people drive by and look at this and laugh.''

   LIVING IT, HATING IT
</P>
<P>
   Billy Harwood had been working at the plant 10 days when he was
released from the Robeson County Correctional Facility. He stood at
the prison gates in his work clothes with his belongings in a
plastic bag, waiting. A friend dropped him at the Salvation Army
shelter, but he decided it was too much like prison. Full of black
people. No leaving after 10 p.m. No smoking indoors. ``What you
doing here, white boy?'' they asked him.
</P>
<P>
   He fumbled with a cigarette outside the shelter. He wanted to
quit the plant. The work stinks, he said, ``but at least I ain't a
nigger. I'll find other work soon. I'm a white man.'' He had hopes
of landing a roofing job through a friend. The way he saw it, white
society looks out for itself.
</P>
<P>
   On the cut line he worked slowly and allowed Mercedes Fernandez
and the others to pick up his slack. He would cut only the left
shoulders; it was easier on his hands. Sometimes it would be three
minutes before a left shoulder came down the line. When he did cut,
he didn't clean the bone; he left chunks of meat on it.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes Fernandez was disappointed by her first experience with
a white person. After a week she tried to avoid standing by Billy
Harwood. She decided it wasn't just the blacks who were lazy, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the supervisor came by one morning, took a look at one
of Harwood's badly cut pork shoulders and threw it at Fernandez,
blaming her. He said obscene things about her family. She didn't
understand exactly what he said, but it scared her. She couldn't
wipe the tears from her eyes because her gloves were covered with
greasy shreds of swine. The other cutters kept their heads down,
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Her life was falling apart. She and her husband both worked the
cut floor. They never saw their daughter. They were 26 but rarely
made love anymore. All they wanted was to save enough money to put
plumbing in their house in Mexico and start a business there. They
come from the town of Tehuacan, in a rural area about 150 miles
southeast of Mexico City. His mother owns a bar there and a home
but gives nothing to them. Mother must look out for her old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to work so we have a chance to grow old in
Mexico,'' Mercedes Fernandez said one evening while cooking pork
and potatoes. Now they were into a smuggler for thousands. Her
hands stung while she worked and swelled into claws in the
evenings. She felt trapped. But she kept at it for the money, for
the $9.60 an hour. The smuggler still had to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   They explained their story this way: The coyote drove her and
her family from Barstow a year ago and left them in Robeson. They
knew no one. They did not even know they were in the state of North
Carolina. They found shelter in a trailer park that had once been
exclusively black but was rapidly filling with Mexicans. There was
a lot of drug dealing there and a lot of tension. One evening,
Armando Fernandez said, he asked a black neighbor to move his
business inside and the man pulled a pistol on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the blacks,'' Armando Fernandez said in Spanish,
sitting in the break room not 10 feet from Baker and his black
friends. Harwood was sitting two tables away with the whites and
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   After the gun incident, Armando Fernandez packed up his family
and moved out into the country, to a prefabricated number sitting
on a brick foundation off in the woods alone. Their only contact
with people is through the satellite dish. Except for the coyote.
The coyote knows where they live and comes for his money every
other month.
</P>
<P>
   Their 5-year-old daughter has no playmates in the back country
and few at school. That is the way her parents want it. ``We don't
want her to be American,'' her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   `WE NEED A UNION'
</P>
<P>
   The steel bars holding a row of hogs gave way as a woman stood
below them. Hog after hog fell around her with a sickening thud,
knocking her senseless, the connecting bars barely missing her
face. As co-workers rushed to help the woman, the supervisor spun
his hands in the air, a signal to keep working. Wade Baker saw this
and shook his head in disgust. Nothing stops the disassembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a union,'' he said later in the break room. It was
payday and he stared at his check: $288. He spoke softly to the
black workers sitting near him. Everyone is convinced that talk of
a union will get you fired. After two years at the factory, Baker
makes slightly more than $9 an hour toting meat away from the cut
line, slightly less than $20,000 a year, 45 cents an hour less than
Mercedes Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get racial about the Mexicans,'' he whispered
to the black workers. ``But they're dragging down the pay. It's
pure economics. They say Americans don't want to do the job. That
ain't exactly true. We don't want to do it for $8. Pay $15 and
we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   These men knew that in the late '70s, when the meat packing
industry was centered in northern cities like Chicago and Omaha,
people had a union getting them $18 an hour. But by the mid-1980s,
to cut costs, many of the packing houses had moved to small towns
where they could pay a lower, nonunion wage.
</P>
<P>
   The black men sitting around the table also felt sure that the
Mexicans pay almost nothing in income tax, claiming 8, 9, even 10
exemptions. The men believed that the illegal workers should be
rooted out of the factory. ``It's all about money,'' Baker said.

 TAR HEEL, N.C.: Baker said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His co-workers shook their heads. ``A plantation with a roof on
it,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, many of the Mexicans in Tar Heel fear that a
union would place their illegal status under scrutiny and force
them out. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union last tried
organizing the plant in 1997, but the idea was voted down nearly
2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the Americans refused to vote for the union was
because it refuses to take a stand on illegal laborers. Another
reason was the intimidation. When workers arrived at the plant the
morning of the vote, they were met by Bladen County deputy sheriffs
in riot gear. ``Nigger Lover'' had been scrawled on the union
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago the work force at the plant was 50 percent black,
20 percent white and Indian, and 30 percent Latino, according to
union statistics. Company officials say those numbers are about the
same today. But from inside the plant, the breakdown appears to be
more like 60 percent Latino, 30 percent black, 10 percent white and
red.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Buffkin, a white woman and the former director of
purchasing who testified before the National Labor Relations Board
in an unfair-labor-practice suit brought by the union in 1998, said
in an interview that the company assigns workers by race. She also
said that management had kept lists of union sympathizers during
the '97 election, firing blacks and replacing them with Latinos.
``I know because I fired at least 15 of them myself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company denies those accusations. Michael H. Cole, a lawyer
for Smithfield who would respond to questions about the company's
labor practices only in writing, said that jobs at the Tar Heel
plant were awarded through a bidding process and not assigned by
race. The company also denies ever having kept lists of union
sympathizers or singlling out blacks to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   The hog business is important to North Carolina. It is a
multibillion-dollar-a-year industry in the state, with nearly two
pigs for every one of its 7.5 million people. And Smithfield Foods,
a publicly traded company based in Smithfield, Va., has become the
No. 1 producer and processor of pork in the world. It slaughters
more than 20 percent of the nation's swine, more than 19 million
animals a year.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has acquired a network of factory farms and
slaughterhouses, worries federal agriculture officials and
legislators,who see it siphoning business from smaller farmers. And
environmentalists contend that Smithfield's operations contaminate
local water supplies. (The Environmental Protection Agency fined
the company $12.6 million in 1996 after its processing plants in
Virginia discharged pollutants into the Pagan River.) The chairman
and chief executive, Joseph W. Luter III, declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Smithfield's employment practices have not been so closely
scrutinized. And so every year, more Mexicans get hired. ``An
illegal alien isn't going to complain all that much,'' said Ed
Tomlinson, acting supervisor of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service bureau in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   But the company says it does not knowingly hire illegal aliens.
Smithfield's lawyer, Cole, said all new employees must present
papers showing that they can legally work in the United States.
``If any employee's documentation appears to be genuine and to
belong to the person presenting it,'' he said in his written
response, ``Smithfield is required by law to take it at face
value.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS _ which has only 18 agents in North Carolina _ has not
investigated Smithfield because no one has filed a complaint,
Tomlinson said. ``There are more jobs than people,'' he said, ``and
a lot of Americans will do the dirty work for a while and then
return to their couches and eat bonbons and watch Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT FIT FOR A CONVICT
</P>
<P>
   When Billy Harwood was in solitary confinement, he liked a book
to get him through. A guard would come around with a cartful. But
when the prisoner asked for a new book, the guard, before handing
it to him, liked to tear out the last 50 pages. The guard was a
real funny guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got good at making up my own endings,'' Harwood said during
a break. ``And  &UR; my &LR;  book don't end standing here. I ought to be on
that roof any day now.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few days later, he found out that the white contractor he
was counting on already had a full roofing crew. They were Mexicans
who were working for less than he was making at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   During his third week cutting hogs, he got a new supervisor _ a
black woman. Right away she didn't like his work ethic. He went too
slow. He cut out to the bathroom too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a bladder infection?'' she asked, standing in his spot
when he returned. She forbade him to use the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   He boiled. Mercedes Fernandez kept her head down. She was
certain of it, she said: he was the laziest man she had ever met.
She stood next to a black man now, a prisoner from the north. They
called him K.T. and he was nice to her. He tried Spanish, and he
worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   When the paychecks were brought around at lunch time on Friday,
Harwood got paid for five hours less than everyone else, even
though everyone punched out on the same clock. The supervisor had
docked him.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners mocked him. ``You might be white,'' K.T. said,
``but you came in wearing prison greens and that makes you good as
a nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The ending wasn't turning out the way Harwood had written it: no
place to live and a job not fit for a donkey. He quit and took the
Greyhound back to his parents' trailer in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   When Mercedes Fernandez came to work the next day, a Mexican guy
going by the name of Alfredo was standing in Billy Harwood's spot.

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pulling up to the main house of Southern Cross Ranch, dust
flying up like a storm cloud behind the minivan, I feel like I'm
coming home to grandma's house. On the back porch a German shepherd
snoozes. It glances up at me as I open the screen door and enter
the kitchen, then closes its eyes once more and continues its nap.
</P>
<P>
   Before closing the door, I take a deep breath, inhaling not only
the clean, crisp Georgia air, but also the surrounding vision:
lush, green grass; 10 or so dogs lying in the shade; the horses and
cattle; twin reindeer statues on the lawn; and the fresh dust
settling from our trip. A sense of calm overcomes me, even though I
feel a wave of excitement over the adventure I'm about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   You see, unless you count the time I sat on a pony's back and
was led around in circles at a carnival years ago, I've never
ridden a horse. I'd chosen my destination, Southern Cross Ranch in
Georgia, specifically to learn to ride _ but without having to
rough it.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Cross Ranch, a new breed of dude ranch that combines a
working ranch with the Southern comfort of a bed-and-breakfast inn,
sits on 200 acres deep in Georgia's cattle country. The ranch is in
Madison, smack dab in the middle of the Antebellum Trail, a stretch
covering such small towns as Athens, Watkinsville, Madison,
Eatonton, Milledgeville, Old Clinton and Macon that represent the
historic significance of the Old South. Madison, for instance, was
one of the few towns left unburned during General Sherman's rampage
through Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   German native Inge Wendling began construction on the ranch
after years as a successful horse breeder in Indiana. The ranch,
with room for 50 guests, opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000-square-foot Southern antebellum mansion has rooms
with names like Mint Julep, General Lee, Scarlett O'Hara, Navaho
and Painted Desert. The mixed themes reflect Wendling's attempt to
mix Southern gentility with the rugged West.
</P>
<P>
   She has succeeded. My comfortable room had a king-size bed, TV
and VCR, and private bath with a whirlpool _ a feature that was
particularly welcome after my first few encounters with a horse.
</P>
<P>
   And, pampering aside, I'd come to learn how to ride.
</P>
<P>
   I'd come to the right place. New riders weren't thrown into the
woods alone, which suited me just fine. A guide accompanied me on
my first few rides, after which I rode with other guests. Our rides
on the wooded trails ranged from peaceful to exciting with the
surrounding trees providing ample shade; the trails are so varied
and the ranch so large that we could ride for hours without leaving
the property.
</P>
<P>
   And we learned more than just how to sit in the saddle. Each
guest was responsible for getting his or her horse out of the pen,
brushing it, hosing it down, cleaning its hoofs and putting on its
saddle and bridle. The same was done when you returned to the
stable. Newcomers, like me, were instructed how to do this properly
and, needless to say, breaking a sweat was involved.
</P>
<P>
   But it was well worth it. Even my horse's numerous attempts to
assassinate me didn't ruin my extraordinary experience.
</P>
<P>
   My horse's name was Bear _ an apt name for the medium-sized
brown horse with a white patch on its nose, who seemed out to get
me from the moment he laid eyes on me. Maybe I'm exaggerating a
bit, but after he bolted into the woods with me hanging onto the
saddle for dear life, I got the impression that he didn't care for
me too much. Most guests rode the same horse throughout their stay;
I tried to get rid of Bear, with no luck.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my Bear troubles, the other guests and I quickly fell
into an agreeable routine.
</P>
<P>
   My days usually began with an 8 a.m. breakfast, followed by an
hourlong trail ride. Next came nap time followed by lunch, another
horse ride, more napping and dinner. If I had the energy, I could
take a dip in the pool or soak in the hot tub behind the house,
play on the trampoline out back, or challenge another guest to a
game of horseshoes. Most nights were spent chitchatting with other
guests and watching videos.

   TAR HEEL, N.C. _ It must have been 1 o'clock. That's when the
white man usually comes out of his glass office and stands on the
scaffolding above the factory floor. He stood with his palms on the
rails, his elbows out. He looked like a tower guard up there or a
border patrol agent. He stood with his head cocked.
</P>
<P>
   One o'clock means it is near the end of the workday. Quota has
to be met and the workload doubles. The conveyor belt always
overflows with meat around 1 p.m. So the workers double their pace,
hacking pork from shoulder bones with a driven single-mindedness.
They stare blankly as the butchered slabs pass by.
</P>
<P>
   It is called the picnic line: 18 workers lined up on both sides
of a belt, carving meat from bone. Up to 16 million shoulders a
year come down that line here at Smithfield Packing Co., the
largest pork production plant in the world. That works out to about
32,000 a shift, 63 a minute, one every 17 seconds for each worker
for eight and a half hours a day. The first time you stare down at
that belt you know your body is going to give in way before the
machine ever will.
</P>
<P>
   On this day the boss saw something he didn't like. He climbed
down and approached the picnic line. He leaned into the ear of a
broad-shouldered black man. He had been riding him all day, and the
day before. The boss bawled him out good this time, but no one
heard what was said, due to the roar of the machinery. Still,
everyone knew what was expected. They worked harder.
</P>
<P>
   At shift change the black man walked away, hosed himself down
and turned in his knives. Then he let go. He threatened to murder
the boss. He promised to quit. He said he was losing his mind,
which made for good comedy, since he was standing near a conveyor
chain of severed hogs' heads, their mouths yoked open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who that cracker think he is?'' the black man raged. There
were enough hogs, he said, ``not to worry about no fleck of meat
being left on the bone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep treating me like a Mexican and I'll beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   The boss walked by just then and the black man lowered his head.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GETS THE DIRTY JOBS
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you learn in the hog plant is the value of a
sharp knife. The second thing you learn is that you don't want to
work with a knife. Finally you learn that not everyone has to work
with a knife. Whites, blacks, American Indians and Mexicans, they
all have their separate stations.
</P>
<P>
   The few whites on the payroll tend to be mechanics or
supervisors. As for the Indians, a handful are supervisors; others
tend to get clean menial jobs like warehouse work. With few
exceptions, that leaves the blacks and Mexicans with the dirty jobs
at the factory, one of the only places within 50 miles in this
muddy corner of North Carolina where a person might make more than
$8 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   While Smithfield's profits nearly doubled in the past year,
wages have remained flat. So a lot of Americans here have quit and
a lot of Mexicans have been hired to take their places. But more
than management, the workers see one another as the problem, and
they see the competition in skin tones.
</P>
<P>
   The locker rooms are self-segregated and so is the cafeteria.
The enmity spills out into the towns. The races generally keep to
themselves. Along Interstate 95 there are four tumbledown bars, one
for each color: white, black, red and brown.
</P>
<P>
   BLOOD AND BURNOUT
</P>
<P>
   The Smithfield plant will take just about anyone with a pulse
and a sparkling urine sample. This reporter was hired using his own
name and acknowledged that he was currently employed but was not
asked where and did not say.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughtering swine is repetitive, brutish work, so grueling that
the turnover is 100 percent. Five thousand quit and five thousand
are hired every year.
</P>
<P>
   So desperate is the company for workers, its recruiters comb the
streets of New York's immigrant communities, say personnel staff
members, and word of mouth has reached Mexico and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The company even procures criminals. Several at one morning
orientation for 30 new workers were inmates on work release in
green uniforms, bused in from the county prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 new employees, the black women were assigned to the
chitterlings room, where they would scrape feces and worms from
intestines. The black men were sent to the butchering floor. The
two free white men and the Indian were given jobs making boxes. And
most of the Mexicans were assigned knife work, cutting sides of
pork into smaller and smaller products.
</P>
<P>
   In the hiring hall that morning, two women chatted in Spanish
about their pregnancies. A young black man had heard enough. His
small town in nearby Robeson County was crowded with Mexicans. They
just started showing up three years ago _ drawn by the plant _ and
never left. They stood in groups on the street corners, and the
young black man never knew what they were saying. They took the
jobs and did them for less. Some had houses in Mexico, while he
lived in a trailer with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now here he was, trying for the only job around, and he had to
listen to Spanish, had to compete with peasants. The world was
going to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is America and I want to start hearing some English,
now!'' he screamed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women told him where to stick his head and listen for
the echo. ``Then you'll hear some English,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   $7.70 AN HOUR, PAIN ALL DAY
</P>
<P>
   Monday. By 4:45 a.m. thousands of headlights snaked along the
old country roads. Cars carried people from the backwoods, from the
single and doublewide trailers, from the cinder-block houses and
wooden shacks: whites from Lumberton and Elizabethtown; blacks from
Fairmont and Fayetteville; Indians from Pembroke; the Mexicans from
trailer parks in Red Springs and St. Pauls.
</P>
<P>
   They converged at the Smithfield plant, a 973,000-square-foot
leviathan of pipe and steel in Bladen County near the Cape Fear
River. Built seven years ago, it is the biggest employer in this
region, 90 miles south of the booming Research Triangle around
Chapel Hill.

UNDATED: and watching videos. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps because we all were enticed by the horses, the guests
proved to be an amiable group who got to know each other quickly; I
came alone but I didn't get lonely. My fellow guests, including a
group of German men and women, a family of three, two couples and
three college students, mingled in the game room and the den. We
all ate together, enjoying plentiful meals such as lasagna and
fried chicken, prepared by a private chef.
</P>
<P>
   Three days of sleeping late, watching shows I don't have time to
catch at home, gorging myself on food and riding a horse for four
hours a day made the time go quickly. All too soon, I was eating my
last meal at the Southern Cross.
</P>
<P>
   I finished my breakfast of fruit, eggs, sausage and orange juice
and said goodbye to the guests and my host. As I rode off in the
ranch's courtesy van, I looked back and sighed, feeling rested in
body and mind.
</P>
<P>
   I may have been going home, but I had fond memories of long, hot
baths, lazy mornings, yummy food _ and yes, even Bear.
</P>

<P>
   If You Go
</P>
<P>
   The rooms: The 14 rooms at Southern Cross Ranch are rated on a
five-level system, ranging from $275 to $375 and up for a
three-night stay. More expensive rooms may include a fireplace,
whirlpool tub or hot tub, and vaulted ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Rates include twice-daily horseback rides, mountain-bike use,
game-room privileges, access to video selection, three meals a day,
snacks and non-alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   To do: Beginners can take an hourlong riding lesson for $25.
Most guests take a morning ride after breakfast, then lounge
around. The ranch has a few mountain bikes, but guests who want to
ensure usage should bring their own. Guests are free to hike on the
property.
</P>
<P>
   Off-the-ranch options include a group trip to Hard Labor Creek
Park for an 8.8-mile trail hike. The park is Georgia's largest at
5,800 acres and offers camping, hiking, fishing, trail riding and
an 18-hole golf course. Another option is a tour of historic
Madison, ``The Town Sherman Refused to Burn,'' where guests can
shop at numerous antique, craft and Civil War artifact boutiques.
Lake Oconee is a few miles away and offers 19,000 acres of good
fishing. Guests with a car can take day trips to either Atlanta
(one hour north) or Augusta (one hour east).

 TAR HEEL, N.C.: Chapel Hill.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The workers punched the clock at 5 a.m., waiting for the knives
to be handed out, the chlorine freshly applied by the cleaning crew
burning their eyes and throats. Nobody spoke.
</P>
<P>
   The hallway was a river of brown-skinned Mexicans. The six
prisoners who were starting that day looked confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell's going on?'' said the only white inmate, Billy
Harwood, to an older black worker named Wade Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Baker said, seeing that the prisoner was talking about
the hundreds of Mexicans. ``I see you been away for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Harwood had been away _ nearly seven years, for writing phony
payroll checks from the family pizza business to buy crack. He was
Rip Van Winkle standing there. Everywhere he looked there were
Mexicans. What he probably didn't know was that one out of three
newborns at the nearby Robeson County health clinic was a Latino;
that the county's Roman Catholic church had a special Sunday Mass
for Mexicans; that the schools needed Spanish speakers to teach
English.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a month to go on his sentence, Harwood took the
pork job to save a few dollars. The word in jail was that the job
was a cakewalk for a white man.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't looking like any cakewalk. He wasn't going to
get a boxing job like a lot of other whites. Apparently inmates
were on the bottom rung, just like Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Harwood and the other prisoners were put on the picnic line.
Knife work pays $7.70 an hour to start. It is money unimaginable in
Mexico, where the average wage is $4 a day. But the American money
comes at a price. The work burns your muscles and dulls your mind.
Staring down into the meat for hours strains your neck. After
thousands of cuts a day your fingers no longer open freely.
Standing in the damp 42-degree air causes your knees to lock, your
nose to run, your teeth to throb.
</P>
<P>
   Harwood said he felt cheated. He wasn't supposed to be doing
Mexican work. After his second day he was already talking of
quitting.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, he took a place next to Mercedes Fernandez, a
Mexican, by the conveyor belt. She smiled at him, showed him how to
make incisions. That was the extent of his on-the-job training.
</P>
<P>
   Harwood acted as if Fernandez had taken a fancy to him, but in
truth, she was more fascinated than infatuated. In her year at the
plant, he was the first white person she had ever worked with.
</P>
<P>
   As for blacks, she avoided them. She was scared of them.
``Blacks don't want to work,'' Fernandez said when the new batch of
prisoners came to work on the line. ``They're lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   THE KILL FLOOR
</P>
<P>
   The kill floor sets the pace of the work. For those jobs, the
plant picks strong men and pays a top wage, as high as $12 an hour.
It is mostly blacks who work the kill floor, the stone-hearted jobs
that pay more and appear out of bounds for all but a few Mexicans.
Plant workers gave various reasons for this: The Mexicans are too
small; they don't like blood; they don't like heavy lifting; or
just plain ``We built this country and we ain't going to hand them
everything,'' as one black man put it.
</P>
<P>
   Kill-floor work is hot, quick and bloody. The hog is herded in,
then stunned with an electric gun. Dazed but not dead, it is passed
to a group of men wearing bloodstained smocks and blank faces. They
slit the neck, shackle the hind legs and watch a machine lift the
carcass into the air, letting its life flow out in a purple gush,
into a steaming collection trough.
</P>
<P>
   The carcass is run through a scalding bath, trolleyed over the
factory floor and then dumped onto a table. In the misty-red room,
men slit along its hind tendons and skewer the beast with hooks.
The hog is shot across the room on a pulley and bar, where it hangs
with hundreds of others. It is then pulled through flames and met
on the other side by more black men who scrape away any straggling
bristles.
</P>
<P>
   The carcasses sit in the freezer overnight and are then rolled
out to the cut floor, which is the opposite of the kill floor in
nearly every way. The workers are mostly Mexicans, not blacks. The
lighting is yellow, not red. The vapor comes from cold breath, not
hot water.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that the hog is quartered. The pieces are parceled
out and sent along the disassembly lines to be cut into ribs, hams,
bellies, loins and chops. Nothing is wasted from these beasts, not
the plasma, not the glands, not the bones. Everything is used, and
the kill men, repeating slaughterhouse lore, say that even the
squeal is sold to Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   People on the cut lines work with a mindless fury. There is
tremendous pressure to keep the conveyor belts moving. If the line
fails to keep pace, the kill men must slow down, backing up the
slaughter. The boxing line will have little to do, costing the
company payroll hours. The blacks who kill will become angry with
the Mexicans who cut, who in turn will become angry with the white
superintendents who push them.
</P>
<P>
   10,000 UNWELCOME MEXICANS
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans never push back. They cannot. Some have legitimate
work papers, but more, like Mercedes Fernandez, do not.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, Fernandez was several thousand dollars in debt to
the smugglers who had sneaked her and her family into the United
States. She owed $1,000 more for the authentic-looking birth
certificate and Social Security card that are needed to get hired.
She and her husband, Armando, expected to be in debt for years.
</P>
<P>
   Robeson County, one of the poorest in North Carolina, was an
uneasy racial mix even before the Mexicans arrived. In the 1990
census, of the 100,000 people living in Robeson, nearly 40 percent
were Lumbee Indian, 35 percent white and 25 percent black. Until a
dozen years ago the county schools were de facto segregated, and no
person of color held any meaningful county job.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumbees _ who have fought their way up in the county
apparatus and have built their own construction businesses _ are
fond of saying they are too smart to work in the factory. And the
few who do work there seem to end up with the cleaner jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But as reds and blacks began to make progress in the 1990s, the
Latinos began arriving. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 1,000
Latinos were living in Robeson County last year. But some people
laugh at this number as being ridiculously low.
</P>
<P>
   In Robeson there is the strain on public resources. There is the
substandard housing. There is the violence. Last year 27 killings
were committed in Robeson. Three Mexicans were robbed and killed
last fall. Latinos have also been the victims of highway stickups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks have a problem,'' said Mercedes Fernandez. ``They live
in the past. They are angry about slavery, so instead of working,
they steal from us.''

<P>
   BLACK AND BLEAK
</P>
<P>
   There was a new skinner on the job, and the cutting line was
expected to take up his slack. The whole line groaned. First looks
flew, then people began hurling slurs at one another in Spanish and
English, words they could hardly hear over the factory's roar.
</P>
<P>
   The black women started waving their knives at the Mexicans. The
Mexicans waved theirs back. The blades got close. One Mexican spit
at the blacks and was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Baker, 51, has seen life improve since his youth in the Jim
Crow South. ``Socially, things are much better,'' Baker said. ``But
we're going backwards as black people economically. For every one
of us doing better, there's two of us doing worse.''
</P>
<P>
   His town, Chad Bourne, is a dreary strip of peeling paint and
warped porches and houses as run-down as rotting teeth. Young men
drift from the cinder-block pool hall to the empty streets and
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around here always want to blame the system,'' Baker
said as he stood on the main street. ``And it is true that the
system is anti-black and anti-poor. It's true that things are run
by the whites. But being angry only means you failed in life.
Instead of complaining, you got to work twice as hard and make
do.''
</P>
<P>
   He watched a group of Mexicans across the street, laughing in
their new clothes. Then he said, ``There's a day coming soon where
the Mexicans are going to catch hell from the blacks, the way the
blacks caught it from the whites.''
</P>
<P>
   After Baker lost a postal job due to drug problems, which he
later overcame, there wasn't much else for him but the plant.
</P>
<P>
   His 71-year-old mother, Evelyn Baker, grew up a sharecropper,
the granddaughter of slaves. She was raised in a tarpaper shack,
picked cotton and hoed tobacco for a white family. She supported
her three boys alone by cleaning white people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s something good started happening. There was a
labor shortage, just as there is now. The textile plants started
giving machine jobs to blacks. The work was plentiful through the
'80s, and Mrs. Baker was able to save money and add on to her home.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '90s the textile factories started moving away, to
Mexico. Robeson County has lost about a quarter of its jobs since
that time.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Robeson hovers around 8 percent, more than twice
the national average. In neighboring Columbus County it is 10.8
percent. In Bladen County it is 5 percent, and Bladen has the pork
factory.
</P>
<P>
   LIVING IT, HATING IT
</P>
<P>
   Billy Harwood had been working at the plant 10 days when he was
released from the Robeson County Correctional Facility.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to quit the plant. The work stinks, he said, ``but at
least I ain't a nigger. I'll find other work soon. I'm a white
man.''
</P>
<P>
   He had hopes of landing a roofing job through a friend. The way
he saw it, white society looks out for itself.
</P>
<P>
   On the cut line he worked slowly and allowed Mercedes Fernandez
and the others to pick up his slack. He would cut only the left
shoulders; it was easier on his hands. Sometimes it would be three
minutes before a left shoulder came down the line. When he did cut,
he didn't clean the bone; he left chunks of meat on it.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez was disappointed by her first experience with a white
person. After a week she tried to avoid standing by Harwood. She
decided it wasn't just the blacks who were lazy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband both worked the cut floor. They never saw
their five-year-old daughter. They were 26 but rarely made love
anymore. All they wanted was to save enough money to put plumbing
in their house in Tehuacan, in a rural area about 150 miles
southeast of Mexico City, and start a business there. But now they
owed a smuggler thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez's hands stung while she worked and swelled into claws
in the evenings. But she kept at it for the money, for the $9.60 an
hour. The smuggler still had to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   `WE NEED A UNION'
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a union,'' said Wade Baker in the break room. It was
payday and he stared at his check: $288. He spoke softly to the
black workers sitting near him. Everyone is convinced that talk of
a union will get you fired.
</P>
<P>
   After two years at the factory, Baker makes slightly more than
$9 an hour toting meat away from the cut line, slightly less than
$20,000 a year, 45 cents an hour less than Mercedes Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get racial about the Mexicans,'' he whispered
to the black workers. ``But they're dragging down the pay. It's
pure economics. They say Americans don't want to do the job. That
ain't exactly true. We don't want to do it for $8. Pay $15 and
we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   These men knew that in the late '70s when the meat packing
industry was centered in northern cities like Chicago and Omaha,
people had a union getting them $18 an hour. But by the mid-1980s,
to cut costs, many of the packing houses had moved to small towns
where they could pay a lower, nonunion wage.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Mexicans in Tar Heel fear that a union would place
their illegal status under scrutiny and force them out. The United
Food and Commercial Workers Union last tried organizing the plant
in 1997, but the idea was voted down nearly 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Smithfield says it does not knowingly hire illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   NOT FIT FOR A CONVICT
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Harwood learned that the white contractor he
was counting on already had a full roofing crew. They were Mexicans
who were working for less than he was making at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   During his third week cutting hogs, he got a new supervisor _ a
black woman. Right away she didn't like his work ethic. He went too
slow. He cut out to the bathroom too much.
</P>
<P>
   He boiled. Mercedes Fernandez kept her head down. She was
certain of it, she said: he was the laziest man she had ever met.
She stood next to a black man now, a prisoner from the north. They
called him K.T. and he was nice to her. He tried Spanish, and he
worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   When the paychecks were distributed on Friday, Harwood got paid
for five hours less than everyone else, even though everyone
punched out on the same clock. The supervisor had docked him.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners mocked him. ``You might be white,'' said K.T.,
``but you came in wearing prison greens and that makes you good as
a nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Harwood quit and took the Greyhound back to his parents' trailer
in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   When Mercedes Fernandez came to work the next day, a Mexican was
standing in Billy Harwood's spot.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I've painted four cows,'' Edwina Sandys, the artist
and sculptor, is saying, of _ oh, why bother trying to stop
ourselves; if you've been walking around town you can see it's
going to be a very silly day _ her current cowmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first was for the New York Public Library; it's called the
Moobile Library. I have another cow for the SoHo and TriBeCa
Partnerships. Then Peter Price, the head of Avenue magazine, asked
me to do one for EdificeRex, the other for the magazine.
`Cowmoonication' and `Herd on the Avenue.' He's going to put them
in the Met Life building.''
</P>
<P>
   A little defensive here, in that brisk, British accent you
expect when dealing with a granddaughter of Winston Churchill. But
wry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to spend my life with cows, only one cow leads
to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Cows to our left, cows to our right: Cow Parade 2000 begins
Thursday, with 500 life-size cow sculptures (Holsteins) around town
through summer.
</P>
<P>
   Enter also, Edwina Sandys (pronounced SANDS), who despite her
concern about her reputation knows a good deal about fun.
</P>
<P>
   Witty _ that's the word often used for her work. A small
sculpture, titled ``Marriage Bed,'' with a doll's bed that's half
nails, half roses. Sandys also does sculpture on a large scale. Her
15-foot piece, ``Child,'' is in front of the U.N. International
School. ``Christa,'' her sculpture of a female Jesus on the cross,
made her the center of controversy in the early '80s. She has also
done a sculpture from a section of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very attractive, very intelligent and very daring,''
says Hans Janitschek, a correspondent for the Austrian paper Kronen
Zeitung, who met Sandys at the Ritz Hotel in London in 1972, when
he was secretary general of the Socialist International and she a
Conservative, and they nonetheless became close friends. ``You
always had the feeling she was up to something, and she was. And
whether she has money or not, she will always manage. She has the
ability to live in a castle like a big star or in a studio, which
she did in New York, ordering from a Chinese restaurant around the
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Some colors pop, Sandys says. Orange and blue, also red and
green. In addition, red is her primary color. Her hair is red. The
linen shirt she's wearing over black tights and a black T-shirt is
red. You enter Sandy's spectacular SoHo two-floor loft into a red
alcove. If you stay for a few hours, bothering her with personal
questions as she paints her cows _ Sandys is too polite to say it's
time to leave _ you will see the deep red bathroom. Sandy's second
husband, the architect Richard Kaplan, who works as an
administrator of his family's J.M. Kaplan Fund, designed the
apartment. Sandys, who came to New York after her divorce in the
'70s, is able to support herself with her work, but not, she
concedes cheerfully, in this style.
</P>
<P>
   There are things Sandys does not like speaking about: her
grandfather, who died when she was 23; the death of her mother,
Diana, Churchill's eldest daughter, who committed suicide when
Sandys was 24. ``They say there is no such thing as bad
publicity,'' she says, half to herself toward the end of the
interview, in the tone of one who is having doubts.

   Sandys' father was Lord Duncan Sandys, a British cabinet
minister; she was presented to Queen Elizabeth as a debutante.
Always artistic, Sandys worked briefly as an assistant to a
dressmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Career plans?
</P>
<P>
   ``I only knew that I wanted to marry, and um, I would like to
marry an ambassador so I could be an ambassadress. So I could have
a public life in some way. I assumed I would have an interesting
life through a man. That's the way it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandys married Piers Dixon, the son of the British ambassador to
France, at 21, had two sons, then, still in her 20s, decided to run
for a seat in Parliament. She gave that up when supporters of her
husband, who was also planning a run, told her that wouldn't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told him they were interested in couples only,'' Sandys
says. ``They said it was as if they were having a big party and had
hired a butler and a cook, and at the last moment the cook did not
turn up. They said, `Tell your wife to get off the bus.' So I got
off the bus. And into painting. And then we got a divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's wrote a novel, moved to Tuscany, Italy, where she had a
home, then, running out of money, sold the house and came to New
York. There will be a show at Egizio's Project in SoHo in November.
She is also finishing a book called ``Penelope in Belgravia'' _
paintings she did in the '70s to which she has added a story line.
``Sometimes I feel like doing something totally outrageous,'' the
married and wealthy heroine says. Was the heroine she? Perhaps a
bit, she'll say.
</P>
<P>
   As for how she met her present husband, it's one personal story
in which she delights: She needed a lift to the Hamptons, and he
arrived to drive her out, bringing her the gift of a red rose
tucked into a lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell in love that instant.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later comes a call, regarding Winston Churchill. ``Hey,
you asked me to tell you something about my grandfather: He liked
cows. That might be your final shot. He had a herd of, I think,
belted Galloways. For aesthetic purposes, he liked the way they
looked against the hillside.''
</P>
<P>
   Any other memories?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now don't delve too much. And don't forget Egizio's Project;
that's where I'll be in the fall.''

KNITTING FACTORY GOES HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let's begin with a generalization: The main
difference between going to a concert in Manhattan or in Hollywood
is the intent. In Manhattan, most people go to a concert because
the act is good or interesting or has been recommended by a
trustworthy source. In Hollywood, most people seem to be attending
shows because the acts are on the pop charts, seeking to land on
the pop charts or predicted to make the pop charts. Or they buy
tickets (more accurately, land on the guest list) because the
performers are acquaintances of a friend or in business with a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan is a cultural capital, where an overheard conversation
on the subway is as likely to be about Andrei Tarkovsky as Steven
Spielberg, Diamanda Galas as Britney Spears. But Los Angeles is an
industry town, pumping out audience-tested dreams to please the
world: What is the point of making a movie or music, runs the logic
in Tinseltown, if it isn't created in the most current style with
the intention of entertaining the widest audience possible?
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Knitting Factory.
</P>
<P>
   For 13 years, the Knitting Factory has been a catalyst and focal
point for avant-garde music in Manhattan, a home (though admittedly
not always a happy one, but what homes are?) for downtown composers
and improvisers, for European avant-gardists and left-of-center
rock bands and for galvanizing series of experimental klezmer music
and silent-film accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Knitting Factory is coming here, opening a high-tech
club smack dab in the middle of Hollywood in hopes
(multimillion-dollar hopes) that there is a large enough audience
for avant-garde music here to support it. The club was supposed to
have opened this month and had already booked concerts with New
Yorkers like Arto Lindsay and Luna and Los Angelenos like Vinny
Golia and Petra Haden, but construction problems have delayed its
start until early July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of agents in L.A. tell me, `That John Zorn
garbage won't play out here,' but I've taken it with a grain of
salt,'' said Glen Max, who is overseeing music bookings at the
Knitting Factory in Manhattan and Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   And what are his thoughts on the subject? ``I'm not sure,'' he
said. ``We won't know until we start presenting it, but hopefully
if we present it with enough enthusiasm and make it a really good
experience, there will be an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, new music in Los Angeles has had trouble finding a
home. It is presented perhaps once a week, usually on off nights
(like the Monday night series at the now defunct Alligator Lounge),
and its bookers are typically forced to change venues often,
floating from art gallery to club to community center in search of
a tolerant host.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Knitting Factory for at least a little while
because of its name will generate a certain amount of interest and
success,'' said Alex Cline, a percussionist and curator of a new
music series at the Eagle Rock Community Cultural Center on the
east side of Los Angeles. ``But when they find out that some of
these people don't draw, I don't know whether they'll pull the plug
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There are all types of avant-garde scenes in Los Angeles, from
mix-and-match improvisers like G.E. Stinson to ambient texturalists
like Solid State to older statesmen like Don Preston, who played
with Frank Zappa. But most attract the type of crowd that will make
the main room at the Knitting Factory here (which will seat 400)
seem awfully lonely. Even the top-drawing musician in Los Angeles'
current avant-garde, the guitarist Nels Cline, brings in only about
200 people on a good night at a popular club like the Troubadour.
</P>
<P>
   J. Ray, a booker at Spaceland, a club in the Silverlake area,
sometimes books improvisers, experimentalists, and sound-searchers.
But since those acts leave plenty of space in his club, which seats
250, he wonders how the Knitting Factory will fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, that will be interesting,'' he said when he heard of the
Knitting Factory's plans to book acts that are more extreme than
underground rockers and songwriters. ``I think that's a New York
thing. This is the land of rock. But if it does work for them, I'd
be stoked.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope for the Knitting Factory Hollywood, said Michael Dorf,
owner of both, is that the club will find the same kind of luck
that its original space in Manhattan did: it opened as a rock club,
but was adopted by musicians like Zorn and Elliott Sharp, whose
careers rose simultaneously with the reputation of the Knitting
Factory in Manhattan. He said he hoped that in Los Angeles, where
there is certainly no shortage of musicians, a similar scene might
``come out of the woodwork.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dorf said he wanted Knitting Factory Hollywood to be more
than an avant-garde club: the place will feature two performance
spaces, a small lounge and restaurant, plenty of rock bands that
are well loved on college radio, an annual jazz festival with
stages on Hollywood Boulevard and computers and Internet
connections galore so that Dorf can link up all the clubs he is
planning to open, with Berlin next on the itinerary. Dorf has even
rented a house a few miles away from the club so that he can fly in
Knitting Factory regulars from downtown Manhattan for extended
residencies.
</P>
<P>
   And while many Los Angeles musicians are awaiting the arrival of
the Knitting Factory with a combination of excitement and
trepidation (especially when it comes to the club's relatively
corporate attitude), they know that whatever happens, the music
will survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scene has historically been about self-determination,''
Cline said. ``And while I think of the Knitting Factory as a
positive thing because it will draw more attention to what's going
on here, I don't think of it as East Coast deities coming in on
their chariot and saving new music in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, he added, it is odd that the Knitting Factory
chose Hollywood as its second home _ not because of the lack of a
cohesive arts audience here, but the lack of a cohesive city. On a
busy weekend night, driving into Hollywood for a show can be an
ordeal more challenging than any avant-garde music the Knitting
Factory might book.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY
 &HT;    U.S. can capitalize on Korean talks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astonishing is the word for the warm and tumultuous welcome
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung received in Pyongyang this week
from thousands of cheering North Koreans and their Communist
overlord Kim Jong Il. It was as if everyone involved decided not to
let harsh realities _ such as the explosive border the Koreas share
and half a century of near-war _ get in the way of a joyous family
get-together.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing happens in North Korea without the Dear
Leader's say-so. Kim Jong Il can't be terribly confident about his
regime's prospects for survival, what with his nation on the verge
of economic collapse, even starvation. So he deigned to play the
jolly fat man, making jokes about his reputation as eccentric loner
and extending a hand of friendship to his southern counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   What the two Kims agreed upon is vague but promising. An obvious
priority is to arrange visits promptly between Korean families too
long separated. That would be facilitated by reopening cross-border
rail lines and roads, which would have the further benefit of
encouraging trade and much-needed investment in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing hair-trigger tensions on both sides of the
demilitarized zone dividing the peninsula is another must. As for
reuniting the two Koreas into one nation, 70 million strong, that
is a far more serious challenge than the consolidation of East and
West Germany and could take generations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, America has a substantial stake in all this, most
notably in the form of the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South
Korea. They weren't even mentioned in the Kim-Kim dialogue, nor was
there any need to. A U.S. presence will be required for the
duration, until signs of a durable peace on the peninsula are
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should move quickly, however, to discourage
North Korean arms adventurism. Last September, Washington and
Pyongyang agreed that North Korea would halt missile testing in
return for the phasing-out of a decades-long U.S. economic embargo.
So far, North Korea has stuck to the deal, but the United States
has failed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to fathom why the Clinton administration and Congress
seem hellbent on building a national missile defense, principally
to defend against North Korea, when whatever puny threat Pyongyang
poses could be negated by other, peaceable means. As a sign of its
good faith and in recognition of this week's fruitful all-Korea
summit, the Clinton administration should start soon to relax U.S.
sanctions against North Korea.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tony Coelho has resigned as chairman of Vice
President Al Gore's presidential campaign for health reasons, the
Gore campaign announced Thursday. He will be replaced by Commerce
Secretary William Daley, several campaign officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The call I made to the vice president last night informing him
of my doctor's advice is one of the most difficult calls I have
ever had to make,'' Coelho said in a statement released by Gore
headquarters in Nashville, Tenn. ``My doctors have told me that I
need to slow down, eat better and travel less for a period of time.
Unfortunately, none of this advice is consistent with the rigors of
chairing a presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, whose 58th birthday is Thursday, was hospitalized
earlier this week with an inflamed colon. His departure has nothing
to do with a continuing criminal inquiry into his role as head of
the U.S. exhibit at the 1998 World Exhibition in Portugal, two
campaign officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore paid a warm tribute to his departing chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Coelho led this campaign to a tremendous victory in the
primaries, and he has put an incredible team in place for the
general election,'' Gore said. ``Tony has been an invaluable friend
and adviser. I look forward to calling upon Tony's counsel and help
once again just as soon as his doctors give me the word.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that Daley would leave the Commerce Department
and take over the helm of the Gore campaign will be made later
Thursday, said a campaign official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Daley has led the Clinton administration's effort to pass a bill
that would normalize U.S. trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Daley is the brother of Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago and
the son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, who led Chicago for two
decades and wielded enormous power in the national Democratic Party
until his death in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho served in the House of Representatives from 1978 to 1989,
representing part of California's Central Valley and earning a
reputation as a highly effective fund-raiser for Democratic
candidates. He joined the Gore campaign in May 1999 at a time when
it was struggling with out-of-control spending.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department inspector general inquiry had found
questionable spending surrounding the U.S. exhibit in Portugal's
World Exhibition. It found that Expo officials had violated federal
rules by hiring Coelho's niece. A Portuguese bank also made a
$300,000 loan to Coelho for a private foundation to build a
memorial at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley M. Brand, Coelho's lawyer, said his client's reasons for
quitting had nothing to do with the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is health,'' Brand said. ``It's the kind of issue where he
has been told he can't travel, he has to restrict his diet. He is
not the kind of guy who can operate in a job with those kinds of
restrictions and feel comfortable that he is doing 100 percent.
That's really what has brought this about, nothing else.''

`SHAFT': HE'S STILL RISKING HIS LIFE FOR HIS BROTHER, MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's unusual for a movie to stack the deck with a fistful of
jokers, but the new version of ``Shaft'' _ part remake and part
sequel _ does just that. Here, John Shaft is not a complicated man.
He's not even as complicated as the second-rate score, which has
more wah-wah pedal guitar effects than the ``Shaft'' marathon TNT
ran a couple of nights ago. (It's as if the composer, David Arnold,
were trying to show he's ecologically minded, since he recycles
Isaac Hayes' triumphant ``Theme From `Shaft''' throughout the
movie.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the always dependable and indomitable Samuel
L. Jackson as John Shaft, nephew of the seminal free-lance crime
fighter in the 1971 original, is unmistakably the star. His
sharpshooter's timing and saucer-eyed self-awareness has found a
home: He's doing Samuel L. Jackson again, only this time he's
called Shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Shaft is a Manhattan police detective when first introduced, and
he makes more entrances in this picture than Joan Crawford had in
her entire career. For about a third of its running time, ``Shaft''
is basically a runway show, and not for Eleganza this time. The
hero is done up in Giorgio Armani's trademark sleekness, and he
wears it well, though he dresses like R. Kelly. When Shaft verbally
smacks down a colleague (Daniel Von Bergen) who brags about the
four-bedroom house he bought in Long Island, it's an example of the
pot calling the kettle extravagant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' may be the most unrepentantly politically incorrect
movie since the glory days of ``The French Connection.'' When Shaft
is ready to go to work in one of several shootouts _ some of the
most primitively staged gunplay since the Republic western serials
of the 1940s _ he cocks a shotgun and cracks, ``It's Giuliani
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that lack of sensitivity may come from the writer
Richard Price, who contributed the character of the drug kingpin
Peoples Hernandez. As Peoples, the skillful and talented Jeffrey
Wright steals the movie, though it's petty larceny, to be sure.
Peoples is a trash-talking, violent exemplar of the id. His
peculiar enunciation leads one to believe he has burned the roof of
his mouth. ``Ju god a bin'ness car?'' he says, and we know he means
``You got a business card?''
</P>
<P>
   The picture wants to trade on the not-so-subtle differences
between stereotype and archetype, and it breaks a sweat trying to
shatter them. In that way, laboring to find its own politics in the
naive but powerful way the original did, ``Shaft'' becomes the
United Nations of misanthropy. It has not only Peoples Hernandez,
but also a wealthy, heartless WASP racist, Walter Wade Jr.
(Christian Bale).
</P>
<P>
   Wade sets the picture into motion when he beats a young black
man (Mekhi Phifer) to death, then beats the rap by fleeing the
country. Shaft becomes a ``black private dick'' and leaves the
police force to bring Wade to justice, flinging his shield at the
judge who sets Wade free on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Like the original, ``Shaft'' becomes a woman-in-jeopardy movie.
Diane (Toni Colette), a waitress, witnesses the assault and
disappears. Shaft and his friend Detective Carmen Vasquez (Vanessa
Williams) set out to track her down. Peoples and Wade join forces,
though the spectacle of these two battling for onscreen primacy _
the chilly, brittle Wade and the florid, sly Peoples _ is not
unlike a death match between Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo
for the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to remember a movie so unapologetically flamboyant as
``Shaft,'' with two major villains, Bale and Wright, as well as a
star who welds the mismatched pieces together through sheer
presence. Jackson uses the intense, deliberate concentration of a
Baptist preacher, even on a laugh line. Every dialogue exchange is
a baptism by fire, and the hero is as much fun to watch as the
villain.
</P>
<P>
   Though saucy and upbeat, he's judgmental; the fact that no one
understands him but his woman is not an issue this time around,
because he doesn't have one. Except for a sex scene in the opening
with nothing but torsos _ a scene cut so quickly it almost seems
subliminal and you may not be sure if Shaft is in it _ the movie
has no romance.
</P>
<P>
   The one area in which the original ``Shaft'' succeeded is that
it explicitly portrayed black men as sexual beings in a way they
had never been onscreen before. Though an outrageous flirt, the
nouveau Shaft has more affection for his wardrobe than anything
else. It would be way too retro to have Shaft carry on with the
ladies as if it were still the '70s, but it would be nice if he at
least had a steady girlfriend. He's very close to the kind of guy
Sidney Poitier (and Eddie Murphy in the ``Beverly Hills Cops''
movies) often played who strode into a situation, saved the day and
left alone.
</P>
<P>
   For filmgoers, especially African-American filmgoers, of a
certain generation, it's tough to stop thinking of ``Shaft'' as
something that belongs to them. Yes, ``Shaft'' has to be different,
if only because the remake simply couldn't generate the same
visceral impact as the original. Simply by changing the color
scheme of a shopworn genre, film noir, it made a political
statement. And adding elements of New York cultural history, like
basing the villain Bumpy Jonas on a real-life racketeer, Bumpy
Johnson, gave it whispers of confidence in the black audience's
pride in allusions to many sides of its history. There's no way the
new ``Shaft'' can still have the same giddy shock of the new.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Shaft'' is aware of the racial politics of this new
era. The scene that incites Wade to violence features a comeback by
his victim that's a sure-fire pleaser, though it also make it clear
that no one wins in such confrontations. ``Too black for the
uniform, too blue for the brothers'' is the reason Jackson's Shaft
gives his uncle (the original Shaft, Richard Roundtree, cooler and
silkier than ever; it's a crime he's not used more) for leaving the
force.
</P>
<P>
   The politics seem glib here, more cynical than in any
blaxploitation-era movie, and by the end Shaft has turned into a
vigilante. With plot points cribbed from the history of the black
action film, from ``Gordon's War'' to ``New Jack City,'' ``Shaft''
is pasted together like a ransom note.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the first movie that runs under two hours and yet
has no attention span: characters are abandoned and picked up;
narrative threads dissolve before your very eyes, no doubt because
of the backstage battles.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that the director John Singleton and his co-producer,
Scott Rudin, squabbled like Peoples and Wade. Though ``Shaft'' will
probably score at the box office, it will be a cheap, opportunistic
victory.
</P>

 &HT;    Peep shows
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We've become a nation of peeping Toms. We like
to watch, and we especially like to watch real people in dangerous,
pathetic, embarrassing or scandalous situations.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman tells Jerry Springer her boyfriend is cheating on
her, and Springer gleefully reveals the man is sleeping with her
mother. A restaurant worker spits into a plateful of food and
serves it to a customer as viewers yell ``eeeeeeew!'' But they
remain transfixed. Pets attack, toddlers crash into trees with
salad bowls on their heads. On and on we watch.
</P>
<P>
   We peep into private homes, island campsites, studio
confessionals and any other place human nature is on display. Those
of us who aren't actually peeping are hoping to be peeped at. For
many people today, reality _ in the form of births, birthdays,
weddings, anniversaries, even funerals _ doesn't exist without
video images. We're voyeurs on one side of the window;
exhibitionists on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 18 million people watched ``Survivor,'' the latest in
a long line of voyeuristic TV shows dating back to 1948 when Allen
Funt flipped on his ``Candid Camera,'' and 1956 when housewives
sobbed out their woes in exchange for applause and prizes on
``Queen for a Day.'' The biggest phenomenon on TV this year is
``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire,'' which lets us groan or cheer,
cluck or complain while watching ordinary folks answer (or fail to
answer) an array of trivial questions.
</P>
<P>
   And coming soon will be the Orwellian ``Big Brother'' on CBS, a
summer series that will give peepers the chance to see a houseful
of strangers coping with life under the microscope of dozens of
hidden cameras. It's a mainstream version of MTV's strangely sturdy
``Real World,'' a modest cable show that was considered innovative
when it debuted in 1992. Now it's considered rather passe with no
prize money, no eating of rats, no struggles to survive.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this so-called reality say about us as a national
crop of couch potatoes? Maybe something, maybe nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the attraction of these programs is the hope of
watching something violent or sexual,'' says Deborah Peel,
president of the Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians and a
psychoanalyst in private practice. ``They're not set up to show
tenderness or altruism. They're designed to promote friction,
tension and bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But Art Farley, a psychoanalyst who practices and teaches in
Austin and Houston, thinks the desire to watch the trials and
tribulations of others is little more than innate curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like watching soap operas,'' Farley says. ``It
gives people the opportunity to live through other people's lives,
and they find that enormously satisfying. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways these shows are a little like a conflict-laden
dream, a window into our unconscious. The more real they are, even
though they may be bad TV, the more easily you can vicariously live
through these people. It's human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   But if we're watching soap operas, talk shows and reality shows
to feel good about our own less scandalous lives or to feel
superior to the exposed sufferers, is that a good use of our
entertainment time?
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be an outlet for various aggressive or hostile
fantasies,'' Peel says. ``But voyeurism is very passive. You watch;
you don't act. Some things you watch on TV are beautiful or
meaningful, but this real stuff is hardly art. It just takes you
away from acting on your own life.
</P>
<P>
   NATURE OF THE BEAST
</P>
<P>
   Of course, television by its definition is voyeuristic, as are
other forms of dramatic entertainment. The audience sits and
watches. Theatergoers watch actors on a stage, who pretend nobody's
watching. Movies take it a step further, with the action tossed up
on a huge screen in front of an audience sitting in the dark. But
television has that added element of privacy that takes voyeurism
to another level. If you're watching something awful, nobody has to
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voyeurism and TV are so perfectly meant to be together that
the miracle isn't that it's happening now,'' says Robert Thompson,
director of Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular
Television. ``The miracle is we've had the taste or discretion to
wait this long. There's just an innate something wired into people.
It's the thing that makes us look into medicine cabinets in other
people's houses or not hang up the extension phone when we hear
someone talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there may be a survival element to the penchant to
snoop, the ability to find out a person's vulnerability in order to
conquer and thrive.
</P>
<P>
   But if all this snooping is so natural, why are we often ashamed
of it? More than 23 million people tuned into Fox's ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire,'' yet it was hard to find anyone who
wasn't copping an attitude about it: ``I can't believe you watched
that! I flipped through it for a few seconds, but that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   So, where did those 23 million people come from? We're not
proud, but we're watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before that show was on was Valentine's Day, and I ate
a whole box of chocolates,'' confessed Thompson. ``I insulted my
own dignity, but it felt so good going down. Watching
`Multimillionaire' was stupid, a waste of two hours on one level.
But the feeling of your jaw dropping lower and lower is a
surprisingly pleasant feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW LOW WILL WE GO?
</P>
<P>
   TV trends don't usually start strong and then weaken. They tend
to become more and more extreme, and the ``Web cam'' sites that
stream video over the Internet are perhaps the most bizarre aspect
of reality pon, D.C., resident Jennifer Ringley go about her daily
life (including changing her clothes and taking a shower) can pay a
subscription fee for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanting to be watched by other people sounds empty and hollow
to me,'' says Peel. ``These people might want to think about
getting some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Television hasn't gone as far as jennicam yet, but it might
someday. Sitcoms used to be mild and sweet; now they're crude and
caustic. Dramas used to be thoughtful if slightly melodramatic; now
they're fast-paced and gritty. On ``ER,'' people bleed profusely
and vomit. Just as it takes more graphic sex and violence to
appease moviegoers now than it did in the 1950s, it will take even
more shocking reality to keep viewers ogling.
</P>
<P>
   Watching people search for love on ``The Dating Game'' and vie
for big bucks on ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' seemed harmless
enough _ until the two shows evolved into ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire.'' And we all know the low point TV reached when
Darva and Rick said ``I do.'' If it takes eating rats to keep
people riveted to ``Survivor,'' will the folks on ``Big Brother''
feel compelled to show us their bathroom habits?
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect we're going to see a spiral of extremes,'' Thompson
says. ``Although they certainly speak to our less noble instincts,
I think they're going to be the next big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Caveat emptor. Television is in the business of grabbing
eyeballs and selling ads, and network executives will do pretty
much whatever it takes to do that. ``When Animals Attack'' and
``World's Scariest Police Videos'' are proof positive.
</P>
<P>
   WHOM THEY'RE AFTER
</P>
<P>
   The networks don't want just any old eyeballs. They want young,
well-to-do eyeballs, and they've found them in the new reality
shows. CBS has been saddled with an audience of viewers primarily
over 50 for decades, but now it has ``Survivor'' and is eagerly
awaiting the birth of ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of adventure is very much in fashion with
the younger generation,'' says David Poltrack, CBS's guru of
ratings and research. ``There's been a lot of young, 18- to
34-year-old viewers for 'Survivor.' They also tend to be in the
upper-income brackets, college-educated and slightly more female.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Big Brother'' attracts the same clientele as MTV's ``Real
World,'' more men and even younger viewers will watch. ``Real
World,'' which began its ninth season Tuesday, is enormously
appealing to young people because it validates their lives with the
status of a TV show. It takes their problems, mostly
relationship-oriented, and turns them into high drama and grand
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of danger and disaster is part of the appeal of
reality shows. But the mass consumption of human beings for the
purpose of entertainment can destroy lives, a threat that was
explored in the movies ``The Truman Show'' and ``EDtv.'' One of the
contestants in the European version of ``Survivor'' committed
suicide after being voted out of the tribe on national television.
Programmers may figure if it doesn't happen on camera, it's OK.
</P>
<P>
   Real on-air disaster is not very likely because the reality is
manipulated for TV. Clearly nobody on ``Survivor'' is going to
starve to death or die from a snakebite. Camera crews and producers
are lurking behind every palm tree. And reality is altered by
virtue of turning on the camera. Are the subjects really ignoring
the camera? We don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about these shows is totally contrived,'' says
Thompson. ``They put people in contrived situations and record
them. The only thing real is that we're seeing previously
noncelebrity characters trying to become famous and win money.
Viewers know this, but they don't care. They've seen so much TV and
heard so many experts pontificating about it that they're
absolutely savvy to the manipulation of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet we watch. Like rubber-necking drivers slowing down to
peek at a bloody accident, we're unable to turn away.
</P>
<P>
   THE EVOLUTION OF REALITY TELEVISION . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Candid Camera'' (1948-90) _ Smile! You're on ``Candid
Camera.'' The phrase is part of the national vernacular. The
prime-time show ``caught people in the act of being themselves.''
Conceived and hosted by Allen Funt, each episode captured scenes on
hidden camera _ a mailbox talked to a surprised letter-dropper, a
mechanic opened a woman's car hood to check the oil and found no
engine, teen-agers combed their elaborate coifs in a high-school
bathroom, a cop directed traffic to his own imaginary music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Queen for a Day'' (1956-70) _ A bizarre daytime game show
during which four or five women competed to see whose sob story
spawned the most applause from the studio audience. The woman who
boosted the meter the highest won a cheesy-looking crown and
whatever such as nuclear proliferation and less serious subjects
such as cross-dressing. Donahue sacrificed his dignity when he
appeared in a dress for that one, but he remained popular until
``Oprah'' knocked him off. ``Donahue'' is the granddaddy of
confessional daytime talkers, sowing the seeds for more extreme
confessionals such as ``Sally Jessy Raphael,'' ``Jenny Jones,''
``Jerry Springer'' and ``Ricki Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An American Family'' (1973) _ The forerunner of peeping Tom
documentaries, this landmark PBS program sent cameras to the home
of the Loud family in Santa Barbara, Calif., and spent seven months
chronicling Bill and Pat and their five chil

 &HT;    `''Fantasia''/2000' lacks the luster of classic original
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Walt Disney envisioned ``Fantasia'' as a concert
film with a perpetually changing repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our intention to make a new version of ``Fantasia''
every year,'' Disney said in 1941, a year after the film's original
release. ``Its pattern is very flexible and fun to work with _ not
really a concert, not a vaudeville or a revue, but a grand mixture
of comedy, fantasy, ballet, drama, impressionism, color, sound and
epic fury.''
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Fantasia'' is a masterpiece of animation, but
Disney's bold experiment in sight and sound was one of his rare
financial failures. The film reportedly didn't turn a profit until
its 1956 re-release, followed by successful reissues in 1969, 1977
and 1990. It has since become one of the studio's most popular
home-video titles.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later, Walt Disney's dream has finally come to
fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Having premiered on Jan. 1 exclusively in Imax theaters, where
it set box-office records, ``Fantasia''/2000 opens today in
standard 35mm format for a limited four-week engagement. The film
features seven new visual interpretations of classical music
selections, along with the return of Mickey Mouse in ``The
Sorcerer's Apprentice.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter piece was the genesis for the original ``Fantasia''
and it remains an animation milestone. In comparison, the rest of
the updated program comes up short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia''/2000's marriage of classical music and animated
images offers nothing as grand as its forebear. The pieces on the
whole are entertaining and beautifully rendered, but none are as
charming as the original's ``Dance of the Hours,'' with its dancing
hippos and alligators, nor as stunning as the dark, terrifying ``A
Night on Bald Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Running 46 minutes less than the two-hour original, the
lightweight collection appears more geared to children's short
attention spans than to elevating animation to high art.
</P>
<P>
   Musical selections by such composers as Ludwig Van Beethoven,
Igor Stravinsky, Dmitri Shostakovich and George Gershwin are
performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, conducted by James
Levine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia 2000'' opens with Beethoven's ``Symphony No. 5,''
accompanied by colorful, butterfly-like triangles that move in time
with the familiar notes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin welcomes viewers in the first of six host segments
that also feature Quincy Jones, Bette Midler, James Earl Jones,
Penn &AMP; Teller and Angela Lansbury.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the most visually impressive piece of the new works,
featuring a pod of computer-animated whales that miraculously take
flight to Ottorino Respighi's ``Pines of Rome.'' The lovely
10-minute segment brings to mind the marine-life paintings of
Wyland.
</P>
<P>
   Caricaturist Al Hirshfeld's line drawings inspire a stylized
view of 1930s New York City, set to Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in
Blue.'' The free-flowing lines and monochrome backgrounds have a
bouncy look, but the segment's humor falls flat.
</P>
<P>
   Shostakovich's ``Piano Concerto No. 2 ``provides the backdrop
for Hans Christian Anderson's classic fairy tale, ``The Steadfast
Tin Soldier.'' Though visually dynamic, the computer-animated
segment's sharply angled characters pale next to those in the ``Toy
Story ``movies.
</P>
<P>
   A goofy-looking flamingo twirling a yo-yo to Camille
Saint-Saens' ``Carnival of the Animals'' provides much-needed comic
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Following the digitally restored Mickey Mouse classic, which has
a much richer look than the new material, Donald Duck gets his due
_ loading animals two-by-two onto Noah's Ark in a fun and clever
rendition of Edward Elgar's march, ``Pomp and Circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia 2000 ``concludes with a beautiful but self-important
piece about death and rebirth set to Stravinsky's powerful
``Firebird Suite.'' The title creature, which bursts with flaming
wings from a volcano, recalls the Chernobog from ``A Night on Bald
Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Disney's dream is realized, it misses his guiding hand.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bowery is nobody's idea of paradise. But when the
aging buildings and their fire escapes shimmer in the morning
light, it's a place of urban beauty, alluring like an Edward Hopper
painting. Its flat facades, with their mismatched colors and styles
and uneven heights, create an eclectic backdrop for a glimpse of
what the city might have been like the last time the century
turned. The Bowery deserves better than its skid row connotations.
</P>
<P>
   Long shadowed by an elevated railroad, the Third Avenue El,
until it was torn down in 1955, the Bowery now has remarkable
light. The width of the street and the low buildings on either side
create an airiness unusual in Manhattan. Looking north, there's a
clear vista of the skyscrapers in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Once a grand boulevard, the mile-long stretch from Chatham
Square to Cooper Square is a street of many incarnations.
Ever-changing, it's still home to a shrinking population of men
living in its remaining lodging houses where daily rent can begin
at $5 or $10 for a cubicle. Increasingly, the Bowery's residents
are people living in renovated lofts on sites that might once have
been music halls or dime museums. Commercially, a new wave of
immigrants makes its mark, alongside some longstanding family
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   There are three distinct Boweries: Chinatown, at the southern
boundary; the blocks from Grand to Houston Street, dominated by
shops selling lighting fixtures, store and restaurant equipment,
where sunlight bounces off stainless steel sinks and pizza ovens
displayed on the sidewalk; and the northern end, above Houston
Street, which is as close as the Bowery gets to being hip, with El
Sur, the street's first new cafe, at the corner of Bleecker Street,
and CBGB, a club at 315 Bowery, between First and Second Streets,
where punk rock and new wave movements flourished in the 1970s. At
one new restaurant, a glass of wine costs $7 _ not much value for
the more typical Bowery consumer, whose drink of choice remains
Wild Irish Rose, $2 a pint at one of two liquor stores left on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Early mornings, the Bowery wakes up energetically. At the 237
Grand Restaurant, most recently a Jewish-style cafeteria called
Moshe's, diners huddle over breakfasts of noodles and other
specialties. All along the Bowery, merchants are lifting the heavy
gates over their storefronts, as truckers hurl supplies onto the
sidewalk. At the corner of Delancey Street, a few men do tai chi on
a rooftop. Across Delancey, someone is scrubbing down an oven,
preparing it for resale, and a few men sweep the sidewalks. No one
seems to notice when a man with silver lame pants and no shirt
dashes by, his thick mane of black hair flying behind him.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the days when morning began all day long on the
Bowery, when men would find sunny plots of sidewalks for napping,
brown paper bags at their side. As a child, I'd often visit my
father's business, and the only way to get to the entrance was to
step over several sleeping men. My sisters and I would sit in the
front window on bar stools, waving to passers-by and to the men as
they woke up. My father knew most of them. One gent named Bill the
Sailor, who had stars tattooed on his forehead, would always tip
his hat.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the Old Guard are still around, but most are long gone.
In the days before political correctness, we didn't think twice
about calling them bums. From the late 1800s, the Bowery was their
capital; it was home to people who had no place else to go. Some
worked, some were decorated war veterans, some chose life amid the
camaraderie of men and the bottle. But by the 1970s, we no longer
had to climb over bodies on the pavement. Flop-houses were closing,
and many of the men left the area. Still, at No. 227 near Prince
Street, the Bowery Mission continues, after more than a century, to
offer aid as well as shelter to those in need of it. Along with a
few nearby lodging houses, it is a reminder of a down-and-out past
that is quickly fading. A friend who has lived on the Bowery for
almost 30 years misses the days of having 50 doormen _ when they
weren't asleep in his doorway _ watching out for him and his
children.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I enjoy wandering along the Bowery, and it's the buildings
and their stories that most interest me. Little is marked, so
connecting present and past is a combination of rumor and research.
Passing by commercial sites once occupied by H &AMP; S Raynor's Bowery
Circulating Library at No. 76 (circa 1820), the Pig and Whistle
Tavern at No. 131 (late 1700s) and Hammacher Schlemmer's first
hardware store, between Delancey and Rivington Streets at No. 209
(1859-1926), I have the impulses of an archaeologist, curious about
how these sites reveal layers of history and, at the same time,
hide secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Older than New York City, the Bowery dates back to the time when
Lower Manhattan was a Dutch colony, and Gov. Peter Stuyvesant built
a country estate, or farm _ bouwerie in Dutch, sometimes spelled
bowerij _ in what was then the suburbs, at about what is now Sixth
Street, in 1651. A road, De Bouwerie, was built linking New
Amsterdam and his farm, following an old Indian trail. Along the
road were other farms, Dutch cottages and an occasional tavern;
engravings of the scene at the time show a country lane lined with
tall poplars.
</P>
<P>
   That part of Bowery history is mostly invisible now, other than
the names; the DeLanceys owned much of the farmland east of the
Bowery, the Bayards to the west. The farms were parceled off to
become shops and homes, some quite elegant, and the Bowery was a
fashionable stretch in the first decades of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowery's history unfolds in the evolution of a plot of land.
South of what is now Canal Street, on the site of a cattle market
connected to the Bull's Head Tavern, the neo-classical Bowery
Theater was built in the 1820s. Then the largest theater in the
country, it was the first in New York to be gaslit. Its 1826
opening production was ``The Road to Ruin,'' which many later said
was prescient of its future, for the theater burned down six times
and was rebuilt five times. The final fire was in 1929, and by then
it had been renamed the Thalia, showcasing Yiddish, German,
Italian, and Chinese theater. Now in its place are Chinese
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1800s, the city's theatrical life centered on the
Bowery. The first stage version of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' opened at
the National Theater, No. 104, in 1852, between Hester and Grand
Streets, although serious theater gave way to melodrama,
vaudeville, circus acts, minstrel and variety shows. Theatrics
reigned inside and outside the theaters: the Bowery was an ongoing
carnival. Crowded with trolleys and pedestrians, pushcarts, organ
grinders and chestnut sellers, the street was lively late into the
night, illuminated by streetlights and, after 1879, with the lights
of the elevated train.
</P>
<P>
   A working-class haven, the street was lined with pawnshops, pool
halls, book stores barber schools, tattoo parlors and black-eye
fixers, hotels of all kinds and missions to save residents from its
vices. A German section, Kleindeutschland, served the large
immigrant population in its beer gardens and theaters. Beggars
worked the street, and a couple of blind men were known to regain
their sight nightly after some whiskey.

<P>
   Much has been written about the Bowery boys _ or b'hoys, in
their dialect _ picturesque 19th-century characters who walked with
a swagger, dressed colorfully and welcomed a good fight. I wonder
about the women of the Bowery. A 1904 play, ``Strenuous Mame: The
Bowery Girl: A Vaudeville Cocktail,'' is about a tough-talking,
gum-chewing aspiring actress whose speech is as colorful as a
Bowery b'hoy's. No doubt she would have gotten the hook, which
presumably first came into use at Miner's Bowery Theater, No. 167,
on its ``Amateur Nights'' in the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   Today on the Bowery the tallest building _ other than the 1970s
Confucius Plaza in Chatham Square _ is the 10-story Salvation Army
Chinatown Corps, No. 225, near Rivington Street; most are three or
four stories. Three buildings have landmark status. At No. 18,
around 1789, the merchant Edward Mooney built a three-story
Georgian-influenced house, at what is now the corner of Pell
Street, that's Manhattan's oldest surviving town house and the
Bowery's oldest building. Later it was a tavern, then was rumored
to be a brothel, and more recently it became an OTB office and the
headquarters of Summit Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most ornate structure is No. 330, the Bouwerie Lane
Theater, at the corner of Bond Street, housed in an 1873 Italianate
cast iron former bank. At No. 130, a monumental temple of a bank
near Grand Street that gives the Bowery a bit of grandeur, was
built in 1894 as the Bowery Savings Bank by McKim Mead &AMP; White.
While it has since changed hands, it is still popularly known by
its original name, which can be seen on the building's facade.
Another bank giving the Bowery a bit of stature _ in its palmy
days, the avenue was a commercial strip as well as a raffish one _
is the majestic pile of the former Germania Bank, now a private
residence, whose faded opulance graces the northwest corner of
Spring Street.
</P>
<P>
   Another structure of architectural and historical note is now
occupied by Hong Kong &AMP; Shanghai Banking Corp., No. 58, at the
corner of Canal Street. The domed, classical 1924 building is on
the site of the Black Horse Inn, not far from where George
Washington and his troops gathered on Nov. 25, 1783, for their
triumphal march through a New York City liberated from British
troops.
</P>
<P>
   A cultural landmark, the Amato Opera, at No. 319, is completing
its 52nd season this weekend in its tiny Bowery jewel box theater,
with cast members singing the ``The Marriage of Figaro'' as though
they're at the Met. At the other end of the Bowery, shoppers can
make deals on diamonds in the many booths at the jewelry exchanges
at Canal Street, and walking north might find Chinese pastries,
bridal dresses, track lighting, industrial shelving, a cinema-style
popcorn maker, slicing machines, chairs for rent and, in a former
parking lot, plants and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   For drivers, crossing the Bowery north of Delancey Street can
sometimes resemble the Bowery Follies, the name of a now defunct
establishment favored by sailors at No. 265, off Houston Street.
The Bowery interrupts the city's straightforward grid. Streets like
Prince, Spring and Bleecker on the west side, and Stanton,
Rivington and First on the east, end _ or begin _ at the Bowery. In
some cases, the names change: Delancey becomes Kenmare; Bond Street
becomes East Second; Bleecker becomes Great Jones.
</P>
<P>
   It's a street that surprises. Old-timers gape at a two-story
terraced gray penthouse, recently erected atop a dark orange brick
building. A number of the facades _ some Federal style, some
Georgian, most an architectural mix _ have been restored, and
others seem battered, although traces of rich details are
plentiful. Some buildings with unremarkable exteriors house
astonishing interior renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Mention the Bowery to most New Yorkers, and they're more likely
to associate it with ``bums'' than ``beauty,'' but I do find the
Bowery striking. Still seedy around the edges, the Bowery is not
yet gentrified _ there's no Starbucks, no Gap _ and it's not clear
whether it will soon look more like SoHo, to the west.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the former Bowery Theater, the street's spirit
lives on in the light-footed Roland Joseph, a traffic policeman on
the corner of Canal Street, at the entrance to the Manhattan
Bridge. His hands in white gloves, he theatrically salutes and
talks to virtually every passing driver, wiggling his hips to avoid
being sideswiped, getting the dance steps right without ever
looking at his feet. Always smiling, he's another master performer
where all the street's a stage.

&HT;     COURT CLEARS FBI AGENT IN FATAL IDAHO SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a ruling that a dissenter likened to a James
Bond-style license to kill, a federal appeals court said an FBI
sharpshooter acted reasonably and cannot be prosecuted for killing
the wife of white separatist Randy Weaver while firing at a fleeing
friend in Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2-1 decision Wednesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said FBI agent Lon Horiuchi had reasonably believed he was
shooting at an armed and dangerous man in the doorway of a rural
cabin and did not know Vicki Weaver was on the other side of the
door, holding her infant child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, all must regret the tragic result,'' wrote U.S.
District Judge William Shubb, who is temporarily assigned to the
appeals court. ``However, given the circumstances at the time,
Horiuchi made an objectively reasonable decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling upholds a federal judge's decision to throw out an
Idaho prosecutor's involuntary manslaughter charge against
Horiuchi, who has remained in the FBI without interruption since
the 1992 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In a scorching dissent, Judge Alex Kozinski said the shooting
had been condemned by a Justice Department task force, a Senate
subcommittee and another panel of the same court, which denied
Horiuchi immunity from a civil damage lawsuit. Kozinski said the
court was adopting a ``007 standard for the use of deadly force''
by law enforcement officers, allowing them to kill civilians who
pose no immediate threat of harm.
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi's lawyer, Adam Hoffinger, said he was delighted with
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents went to Ruby Ridge in August 1992 to arrest Randy
Weaver on a weapons charge. Weaver's 14-year-old son, Sam, and a
deputy U.S. marshal, William Degan, were killed in a gunfight at
the outset of a siege that lasted 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   The day after that gunfight, Horiuchi fired a shot that grazed
Weaver, who the agent thought was preparing to shoot at an FBI
helicopter. A few seconds later, Weaver and companion Kevin Harris,
who was carrying a rifle, ran toward the cabin. Believing Harris
was seeking a refuge to attack the officers, Horiuchi fired at the
open door where Harris was headed. The bullet smashed through a
pane of glass on the door, hit Vicki Weaver in the head, then
struck Harris in the shoulder. The child was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Harris were acquitted of murder charges in Degan's
death, and the government paid the Weaver family $3.1 million to
settle civil claims. Harris' civil suit against the government,
Horiuchi and others is scheduled to go to trial in Idaho on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   An Idaho prosecutor filed an involuntary manslaughter charge
against Horiuchi, claiming he had acted recklessly or with gross
negligence in shooting at Harris without determining whether anyone
else was in the line of fire. The appeals court upheld a U.S.
district judge's decision to dismiss the charge.
</P>
<P>
   But Kozinski said Harris, by running away, had posed no imminent
threat. Agents could have negotiated, waited out the inhabitants of
the cabin or taken any number of other steps rather than shooting,
he said. He also said there was evidence that Horiuchi should have
known someone was behind the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since when does taking up a defensive position justify the use
of deadly force?'' Kozinski wrote. ``This has never been the law in
this circuit, or anywhere else I'm aware of _ except James Bond
movies.''

&HT;     ROTHKO CHAPEL REOPENING AFTER RENOVATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PATRICIA C. JOHNSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The buff brick structure sits quietly on a grassy
corner, unassuming and tranquil. You might drive right past unless
you've been there before.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, though, it becomes an oasis.
</P>
<P>
   The Rothko Chapel offers an escape from the heat and hustle of
Houston, from the cacophony of cars and visual stimuli that
threaten to overwhelm.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by lawns and old live oaks, fronted by a pool of
water with Barnett Newman's Broken Obelisk as sentinel, the compact
enclosure gives respite to the tired of mind and soul.
</P>
<P>
   The chapel was commissioned by visionary art patrons John and
Dominique de Menil and named for American artist Mark Rothko, whose
14 giant canvases define its meditative interior. It has been one
of Houston's most famous international destinations since its
dedication in February 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The octagonal chapel is a unique site where modern art,
architecture, spirituality and a gentle, potent humanist activism
coexist. It is open to weddings and memorial services, to symposia,
international colloquia and private contemplation. It is the source
of the prestigious Rothko Chapel Awards for the Commitment to Truth
and Freedom, initiated in 1981, and the Oscar Romero Award, begun
in 1986, which recognize individuals, unknown or famous, who battle
for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, the chapel closed its doors when problems
that have dogged it since the opening were exacerbated by a new
one.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting had been an issue from the beginning. Rothko wanted a
skylight but underestimated the intensity of the Texas sun, which
blasted the interior. The baffle added to soften and diffuse the
light was never satisfactory. The air-conditioning system was
antiquated.
</P>
<P>
   When cracks appeared on the north wall and widened almost enough
to see outside, it became obvious that serious foundation problems
existed, too. Meanwhile, the fragile paintings, which had last been
conserved in the mid-1980s, were removed to the nearby Menil
Collection conservation lab for a thorough checkup.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the chapel will reopen after a $1.8 million
</P>
<P>
   restoration overseen by McReynolds Architects of Houston that
has
</P>
<P>
   renewed it from top to bottom, inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   A new skylight with ultraviolet glass has been installed. The
baffle, which hung just beneath it, has been replaced to fit inside
the skylight's edges. The result is a rim of light that is diffused
gently down the walls and through the space.
</P>
<P>
   The doors were enlarged so the paintings, the largest of which
measures just under 25 feet high, may be moved in and out without
having to open the skylight, as was necessary in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The foyer was modified to create a climate-control chamber,
allowing a new energy management system to neutralize hot, humid
air from outside before it enters the chapel proper. To accommodate
the system, the entry ceiling was dropped six feet _ from 18 feet
to 12 _ after much debate.
</P>
<P>
   The fear was that the lower ceiling might seem oppressive. It
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   A new foundation was laid. Over the years, the chapel had sunk
nearly two inches. The oak trees along Sul Ross have absorbed
increasing amounts of moisture as they have matured, so the ground
there dries faster than on the opposite side of the chapel. The
solution was to sink the foundation piers deeper, from 20 feet to
55 feet (twice the height of the building).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Menil Collection conservator Carol Mancusi-Ungaro and
Mellon Fellow Pia Gottschaller studied the huge, delicate paintings
inch by inch. Pronounced unfaded and healthy, they were the last,
central component of the chapel's renewal, installed on resurfaced
and repainted walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will just open quietly,'' said Suna Umari, a native of
Lebanon and the chapel's executive director since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The de Menils originally conceived Rothko Chapel in 1964 as a
Catholic chapel to be affiliated with the nearby University of St.
Thomas, where the couple were significant patrons. However, the
university _ already wary of the high profile that art had on
campus _ determined that ``responsibility for the works of art and
making them available to the public would be too great a burden.''
So wrote historian Susan Barnes in The Rothko Chapel, An Act of
Faith.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was never intended to be an independent entity, in
1969 the de Menils proposed to donate the chapel to the ecumenical
Institute of Religion and Human Development instead. The institute,
which is located in Houston's Texas Medical Center and devoted
toclinical aspects of pastoral training, accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that association was severed, as well, in October 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty months after its public dedication, the chapel was reborn
as an autonomous body. The charter mandates that the chapel offer a
place of worship, meditation and prayer, where people may gather
and explore spiritual bonds, discuss human problems, share a
spiritual experience.
</P>
<P>
   With financial support from the Menil Foundation and others, the
Rothko Chapel became the world's ``first broadly ecumenical center,
a holy place open to all religions and belonging to none,'' Barnes
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There are 16 members on its varied board of directors, currently
chaired by Ben F. Love, former chairman of Texas Commerce Bank (now
Chase Texas). The annual budget is approximately $500,000. That
figure comprises operating expenses and about $130,000 to cover
commitments made by Dominique de Menil, who died in late 1997.
These include lifetime support for Father Andre Scrima, a Catholic
priest in his late 60s who lives in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominique collected remarkable people, you know,'' Umari said,
``people like Father Scrima, who have wonderful talents and gifts
but have no means of support.''
</P>
<P>
   The chapel's $11 million endowment also funds the $20,000 Oscar
Romero Award, given periodically. But the $10,000 Rothko Chapel
Award was personally funded by Dominique de Menil and will be
discontinued, Umari said.

</P>
<P>
   Raising money to cover the renovation is the first priority of
the chapel. Initial efforts have raised $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   The chapel's integration of art and architecture is
unparalleled.
</P>
<P>
   The Sistine Chapel, inconceivable without Michelangelo's
majestic
</P>
<P>
   frescoes, was designed and built 20 years before Pope Julius II
</P>
<P>
   commissioned its famed ceiling paintings. So, too, the Chapel of
the Rosary in Vence, France, existed before Henri Matisse was
commissioned to design its interior _ everything from the altar,
the crucifix and the vestments to the stained-glass windows and
drawings on the tile walls.
</P>
<P>
   Rothko not only created the work that hangs inside the Rothko
Chapel, he designed the space, too.

</P>
<P>
   The Menils hired Phillip Johnson for the project in 1964. The
choice of this patrician architect seemed a natural since he had
designed the Menil home in River Oaks and the University of St.
Thomas campus However, Johnson's drawings were amended _ or
rejected outright _ by Rothko until, as Dominique de Menil
gracefully phrased it, ``the great architect bowed out to the great
artist.'' Houston architects Howard Barnstone and Eugene Aubry
completed the design as the painter demanded, and the patrons
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   (The lengthy, often acrimonious debate between Rothko and
Johnson is amply described in Barnes' history and also in Sheldon
Nodelman's The Rothko Chapel Paintings: Origins, Structure,
Meaning.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rothko worked on the 14 paintings, including three
triptychs for the east, north and west walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude, on every level of experience and meaning, of
the task in which you have involved me, exceeds all my
preconceptions,'' Rothko wrote to the de Menils two years into the
project. ``It is teaching me to extend myself beyond what I thought
was possible for me.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born in Latvia in 1903, Rothko was a leading member of the
American Abstract Expressionists and renowned for his paintings of
luminous rectangles of color that seemed to float on the surface.
The chapel's paintings are the culmination of a successful career
fraught, as well, with self-doubt and depression. Rothko killed
himself in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The monumental, seemingly monochromatic paintings are
unprecedented in his oeuvre. In a Manhattan studio that held a
full-scale mock-up of the chapel, including the skylight, Rothko
began to work on the paintings in summer 1964, shortly after
receiving the commission. He finished by mid-April 1967. The
project completely absorbed him. He calibrated every detail of tone
and surface, experimented with media, and obsessed about the
paintings' precise placement in the architecture he had designed
for them. These ``paintings of silence,'' as Dominique de Menil
called them, create the chapel's interior space.
</P>
<P>
   John de Menil once described them as being the color of wine and
blood.
</P>
<P>
   But color is subjective and fugitive; color memory even more so.
</P>
<P>
   Mancusi-Ungaro tells of one visitor who recalls the paintings as
being vivid red.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, seven of the paintings are black rectangles painted on
dark maroon grounds, the so-called ``black-form paintings.'' The
other seven are a deep plum. The artist blended egg, dry pigment,
oil paint and dammar resins, among other materials, then applied
the mix to the canvas in skinlike veils over rectangular forms
sketched in charcoal.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with earlier work, Rothko eliminated his characteristic
brushy surfaces and any suggestion of form. He created instead
sheer expanses of color and remarkably luminous, if flat, surfaces,
suggesting immeasurable depths.
</P>
<P>
   Devoid of recognizable shapes, the paintings can confound
viewers who are accustomed to entering more traditional chapels
adorned with images.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some _ with huge Rothkos on all sides _ have asked where
the paintings are.
</P>
<P>
   But Rothko's chapel and paintings demand to be sensed almost
through the skin, not looked at like objects. Perhaps spiritual
things and places are meant to be discovered _ revealed _ and need
not trumpet their arrival.

`BOYS AND GIRLS': CUTE BUT UM, LIKE, A REAL CONTROL FREAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're still disconsolate over the demise of ``Beverly Hills
90210,'' then ``Boys and Girls'' may be the movie for you. I don't
mean the early, cheesy Shannen Doherty ``90210,'' mind you, or the
sleazy. soap-operatic Dylan-in-distress middle years. What this
feeble, harmless romantic comedy calls to mind is an extra-long
episode from one of the show's interminable final seasons, in which
the cast seemed to change every week and nobody could remember if
Donna was still a virgin or not, because nobody _ not the audience,
not the writers, not even the long-suffering David _ cared.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Prinze Jr., who specializes in anodyne romantic comedies
with defiantly forgettable titles, is a nice-looking young actor
with a winning, gentlemanly manner _ kind of like Ricky Nelson
without the smoldering eroticism. His natural demeanor is so
pleasant and untroubled that the screenwriters, a duo called the
Drews, and the director, Robert Iscove _ also responsible for
``She's All That,'' Prinze's first star vehicle _ have had to labor
mightily to drum up enough emotional complication to eke out a
90-minute movie. Well, not all that mightily. Prinze does appear
briefly in braces, in a team-mascot gopher head and in an
unflattering modified Dutch-boy haircut, but the idea that his
character could be at all troubled, lonely or neurotic is a conceit
the movie can't possibly sustain.
</P>
<P>
   Prinze plays Ryan, a Berkeley engineering major (hey, stop
snickering) whose best (and apparently only) friends are his comic
room-mate sidekick (Jason Biggs) and the girl he really loves even
though he can't admit it. Her name is Jennifer, she's played by
Claire Forlani, and the big joke is that while Ryan's an uptight
control freak who insists on planning everything, Jennifer is a
wild, spontaneous, free spirit who lives in and for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The moment seems to drag on forever. The best thing that can be
said about ``Boys and Girls'' is that it is studiously inoffensive.
But this means that every time a potentially interesting
complication arises _ an inkling of sexual confusion, a situation
that might lead to hurt feelings, a funny joke _ the movie bolts
like a panicky colt, or like Ryan, who keeps remembering that he
has studying to do.
</P>
<P>
   I saw ``Boys and Girls'' at a sneak preview packed with eager
members of its target audience. After about 30 minutes, many of
them seemed to wish they'd stayed home to study. ``I never thought
I could feel ripped off by a movie I saw for free,'' one young man
remarked on his way out. He was the voice of his generation, or at
least of the mob of his peers who had, during Ryan's big emotional
speech about love, trust and fidelity, howled with derisive
laughter at Prinze's furrowing brow and downturned mouth. They may
have been disappointed, but I, at least, was able to leave the
theater with new-found respect for America's often maligned and
misunderstood youth.

`BUTTERFLY': WIDE-EYED WONDER AS A POLITICAL STORM GATHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT

<TEXT>
<P>
   It sometimes seems as if the film industries of a peaceful,
prosperous, and more or less united Europe have staked their
survival on recreating the strife, misery and division of the
European past. In recent years, the political catastrophes that
convulsed the continent in the middle decades of the 20th century
have become fodder for costume drama, as horror gives way to
sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Recent films like Istvan Szabo's ``Sunshine'' and Regis
Wargnier's ``East-West'' confront the brutality and moral ugliness
of fascism and Stalinism, but they infuse the past with an
unmistakable air of romance. This development is troubling but
inevitable. For all our commitment to remembering, the past does
recede. Its specific hurts become less acute, and its ephemera _
silk stockings and veiled hats, boxy automobiles and charming rural
towns _ become objects of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Butterfly,'' Jose Luis Cuerda's delicate, quietly
devastating new film, is doubly nostalgic since it filters its tale
of ideological cataclysm through the eyes of a child. But Cuerda,
who fashioned ``The Butterfly'' out of several linked short stories
by Manuel Rivas, views childhood realistically, as a state of
curiosity and confusion, rather than of preternatural wisdom or
angelic innocence, so ``The Butterfly,'' though it has the look of
a picture postcard from the olden days, arrives with the urgency of
a telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Moncho is a sensitive, observant boy living in a Galician town
in the summer of 1936, when Republican Spain was on the threshold
of civil war. This was a time when ordinary Spaniards, according to
the film's introductory titles, were torn between the desire for
social progress and the demands of tradition. In Moncho's family,
this tension takes the shape of occasional disputes between his
father, a tailor with Republican sympathies, and his churchgoing
mother, who is, as her husband affectionately puts it, ``very
mystical.''
</P>
<P>
   The town itself is less amicably divided, and there are portents
_ black-hatted Civil Guards lurking in the woods, testy exchanges
between the local schoolmaster and the parish priest _ of the
strife to come. Of course, the main upheavals in the boy's life are
not political at all, but are rather the usual jolts and
bewilderments of the coming-of-age story.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Lozano, who plays Moncho, has a wide-eyed, slightly pouty
face that registers amazement, bafflement and an almost scholarly
intellectual appetite. Moncho is equally fascinated by the
physiology of bugs and the mechanics of human sex (which he
observes while spying, with his best friend, Roque, on the town
drunk sporting in a hay loft with the town tramp).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Butterfly'' is a bit like a calmer, less bawdy
``Amarcord'' _ full of the magical absurdity of recollected
boyhood, set to the brassy tumult of a ragged provincial dance
band. But Moncho's story, inevitably, involves a loss of innocence,
which the stealthy arrival of fascism renders particularly
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   After his doting parents and his dreamy, saxophone-playing older
brother, Moncho's most important relationship is with Don Gregorio,
a freethinking schoolmaster whose unorthodox ideas about pedagogy
and discipline (to say nothing of religion and politics) make him a
suspect, as well as a revered, figure in the town.
</P>
<P>
   As Don Gregorio, the great Spanish actor Fernando Fernan Gomez,
recently seen in a small role in Pedro Almodovar's ``All About My
Mother,'' embodies the faltering, slightly comic dignity of the
doomed republic. His every word and gesture signal his faith in
democracy, progress and the innate perfectibility of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   This makes him a tragic figure, and gives the film's nostalgia a
core of raw political anguish. Don Gregorio, with his passion for
science and stubborn (and frequently tested) belief in the decency
of the boys he teaches, personifies the flawed, valiant attempt at
modern secular democracy that was driven underground and all but
extinguished by Franco. If ``The Butterfly'' makes you feel that
loss anew, it also looks at it from a consoling distance, so that
the betrayal of democracy becomes an enactment of personal,
intimate, childish weakness rather than an inexplicable evil.
</P>

 &HT;    CONGRESS SEEKING STIFFER PENALTIES FOR TRAFFICKING 'ECSTASY'
 &HT;    BY ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing a dramatic increase in the amount of the
illegal stimulant ``ecstasy'' imported into the United States,
House members Thursday supported stiffer penalties for trafficking
in the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs service has seized 5.7 million tablets of the
drug this year, up from 500,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   About 84 percent of ecstasy is imported from Western Europe,
where the raw materials to make it are less tightly controlled than
in the United States. About 90 percent of the ecstasy distributed
worldwide is from the Netherlands and Belgium, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The drug's primary ingredient is the chemical MDMA, often mixed
with other drugs such as cocaine or heroin. The pill usually
resembles an aspirin and is often stamped with a symbol such as the
internationally known Rolex or Adidas trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   Users say ecstasy produces intense feelings of peacefulness and
empathy, along with enhanced sensual pleasure and increased energy.
It is usually taken orally and lasts about four to six hours.
</P>
<P>
   However, users risk permanent brain damage, along with
depression, mood swings, and memory loss, according to Lewis Rice
Jr., special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Similar bills in the House and Senate propose stricter penalties
for those caught importing and distributing ecstasy. Currently,
such penalties are much less harsh then the penalties for drugs
such as LSD or methamphetamines. They are more similar to the
penalties for trafficking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new legislation, penalties for distributing ecstasy
would mirror those associated with methamphetamine trafficking,
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said at a hearing Wednesday of the
House Judiciary subcommittee on crime.
</P>
<P>
   The House legislation would reduce the amount of the drug needed
to earn a mandatory five-year prison sentence from 8 kilograms
(about 16.6 pounds or 28,570 tablets) to 4 kilograms, about 8.8
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single reason for the explosion of ecstasy that is being
imported into the U.S. is greed,'' McCollum said. ``For an initial
investment of $100,000, a trafficker could realize a $5 million
profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said such profits are possible because of the very low cost
of producing the drug and its high market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of producing an MDMA tablet is estimated to be
between 50 cents and $1,'' Rice said, ``Once the it reaches the
United States, the wholesaler will sell in bulk for about $6 to $8
a tablet, depending on the amount purchased. The retailer then
turns around and sells individuals tablets for anywhere from $20 to
$40 per pill.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum said that the United States should help Belgium and the
Netherlands monitor the production of ecstasy within their borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stop the millions of tablets of ecstasy that are
flowing into our country every year,'' McCollum said. ``Our
legislative window of opportunity is slowly closing for this year,
and I hope that we can bring the bill before our committee as soon
as possible.''

`ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY': EPIC DAYDREAMS OF A CURMUDGEONLY
COMPLAINER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As readers of his 1997 best seller ``Naked'' already know, David
Sedaris is part Walter Mitty, part Garry Shandling, part Andy
Rooney, with a little bit of Oscar Wilde thrown in for good
measure: a campy commentator on the absurdities of contemporary
life, a writer whose favorite subject always remains himself.
</P>
<P>
   A sequel of sorts to ``Naked,'' his latest book, ``Me Talk
Pretty One Day,'' amplifies the antic family portrait he created in
the earlier book, while recounting his adventures in New York and
Paris. Whereas ``Naked'' reads like a series of overlapping
autobiographical essays, this volume feels more like a collection
of magazine pieces or columns on pressing matters like the care and
feeding of family pets and the travails of dining in Manhattan. But
if Sedaris sometimes sounds as though he were making do with
leftover material, ``Talk Pretty'' still makes for diverting
reading.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time this volume shows Sedaris intermittently trying
to step out of his role as curmudgeonly complainer. Though he still
whips off the tart put-down with practiced ease _ ``it seems rude
to visit another country dressed as if you've come to mow its
lawns,'' he complains of American tourists in Paris _ he also shows
himself capable, in these pages, of something approaching empathy
and introspection.
</P>
<P>
   As readers learned in ``Naked,'' the Sedaris clan _ at least the
Sedaris clan as depicted by Sedaris _ is a family of crackpots and
eccentrics. His father _ an IBM engineer who loves jazz, Great
Danes and complicated mathematical equations _ is so cheap that he
buys food that's been reduced for quick sale and hoards it long
past its expiration date. His mother, who appeared more prominently
in ``Naked,'' revives a dying puppy by putting it in a casserole
and popping it in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   His sister Gretchen is a ``tanorexic,'' whose passion for the
sun has evolved ``from an intense hobby to something more closely
resembling a psychological dysfunction.'' His younger brother Paul
is portrayed as a foul-mouthed pot smoker, who is nonetheless the
one of the six children to show up at their father's house on
Thanksgiving to try to prepare a traditional Greek meal.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sedaris, he comes across, much as he did in ``Naked,'' as
a self-dramatizing narcissist, by turns egomaniac and
self-deprecating, needy and judgmental. He cannot abide people who
smoke Merit cigarettes, wear cowboy boots or ``consider the human
scalp an appropriate palette for self-expression.'' Equally
loathsome to him are the words ``flick,'' ``freebie,''
``cyberspace,'' ``progressive'' and ``zeitgeist,'' and abbreviated
street designations like ``59th and Lex.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy Sedaris daydreams of becoming an artist, but it's the
lifestyle, not the work, that appeals: he can picture ``the long
satin scarves and magazine covers'' but can't quite envision what
sort of artwork he'd actually do. He toys with the idea of becoming
a ``song stylist,'' performing for television commercials in the
voice of Billie Holiday. When that fantasy fails to materialize, he
flirts with a career as a conceptual artist, a career that is
fueled by the energizing fumes of crystal meth and that comes to an
abrupt halt when his drug dealer skips town.
</P>
<P>
   Sedaris' other daydreams are even more grandiose. He dreams of
becoming a world-famous scientist who not only cures AIDS,
paralysis and mental retardation but also concocts a soap that
rejuvenates aging skin. He fantasizes about becoming the first gay
heavyweight champion of the world. He imagines himself as a genius
version of Monica Lewinsky: a pudgy girl who has sex with the
president of the United States, goes to jail for refusing to answer
questions and later writes the novel ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My epic fantasies offer the illusion of generosity but never
the real thing,'' he writes. ``I give to some only so I can
withhold from others. It's fine to cure the leukemia sufferers but
much more satisfying to imagine the parade of opportunists
confounded by my refusal to cooperate. In imagining myself as
modest, mysterious and fiercely intelligent, I'm forced to realize
that, in real life, I have none of these qualities. Nobody dreams
of the things he already has. I'm not sure which is more unlikely:
the chance that I'll sleep with the president or the hope that I
will one day learn to keep a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   As this book and ``Naked'' make all too clear, Sedaris has made
a career of not keeping secrets and recounting those secrets in a
voice that uses hyperbole as matter-of-factly as the soap opera
stars he says he's tried to emulate. He observes that Great Danes
generally don't live very long: ``There are cheeses with a longer
shelf life.'' He describes a fellow student in French class as
having ``front teeth the size of tombstones.''
</P>
<P>
   Sedaris' tone can easily wear thin, however, and in the slighter
pieces _ like one about his brief stint as a writing teacher _ his
efforts to send up himself and his supporting cast are neither
comical nor convincing, merely petulant. The stronger chapters in
this book tend to be the ones that mix satire with sentiment,
brazenness with rumination. Those pieces reveal a writer who is
capable not only of being funny, but touching, even tender, too.

</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal: If George W. Bush will say publicly that he
supports the Republican Party's official position on abortion, I
will vote for him. But almost no one else will.
</P>
<P>
   The man in charge of writing the party's 2000 platform,
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, says he plans no change in the
abortion language from 1996, and no public discussion about it
either. He might as well go all the way and say he won't even read
it, because I doubt even he agrees with it.
</P>
<P>
   The official position of the Republican Party is that women who
have abortions should be executed. The platform doesn't say this in
so many words, but it's not a fanciful interpretation. In fact,
it's an unavoidable interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The platform says: ``The unborn child has a fundamental
individual right to life which cannot be infringed.'' No
exceptions. And: ``(We) endorse legislation to make clear that the
Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.'' It's
the second bit that's the killer.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it's gibberish. Legislation cannot ``make clear''
the meaning of the 14th Amendment because it is a constitutional
provision, whose official meaning is up to the Supreme Court, not
Congress. Second, the 14th Amendment begins, ``All persons born or
naturalized in the United States...,'' so if anything is ``clear''
it is that the 14th Amendment's protections do not apply to the
unborn.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, neither position is ``clear,'' and a second reference
to ``any person'' has sometimes been held to cover resident aliens.
Of course the most recent Republican platform also complains about
judges who ``invent new rights as they go along, arrogating to
themselves powers King George III never dared to exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   What is undeniably clear from the abortion language is that the
Republican Party stands for the principle that fetuses are
``persons'' as that term is used in the 14th Amendment. Among other
famous provisions, that amendment forbids ``any state'' to ``deny
to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, according to the Republican platform, the law
should treat the abortion of a one-month-along fetus exactly like
the killing of, say, a 5-year-old child. In every state it is
considered a rather serious crime for a mother to hire someone to
kill her innocent child. In states with a death penalty, this is
just the kind of killing _ premeditated, commercial, often
remorseless, a betrayal of humanity's deepest bond _ that qualifies
for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting the ``equal protection'' clause has been the
Supreme Court's main line of business for decades. What kinds of
unequal treatment qualify? How much does the government have to be
involved? But there are no complications here. Nothing could be
more unequal than the difference between being executed and not
being executed, and there's no ambiguity about the government's
role.
</P>
<P>
   So the abortion provisions of the Republican platform would give
states a choice: Either execute women who have abortions, along
with doctors who perform them, or don't execute other premeditated
murderers and their hired gunmen. And there's really no choice
because elsewhere in this steamy document the platform is quite
enthusiastic about the death penalty, complaining repeatedly that
it isn't used nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Right-to-life Republicans generally say that while doctors who
perform an abortion should be punished, the woman who procures one
should be seen as a victim. Not only does this make no sense but
under the language the party plans to readopt this year, it would
be flatly unconstitutional. Even leaving aside capital punishment,
a state could not send one woman to prison for murdering her child,
do the same to a doctor who performs an abortion, but let another
woman who scheduled an appointment, wrote a check, and had the
abortion go free.
</P>
<P>
   The full implications of the platform's abortion language also
make a mockery of the GOP's ``big tent'' efforts to find room for
pro-choicers in the party. The '96 platform precedes the abortion
passages with some fairly desperate lemons-into-lemonade guff about
being the ``party of the open door'' that sees ``diversity of views
as a source of strength'' and is ``committed to resolving our
differences in a spirit of civility, hope, and mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the Republican Party isn't the Communist party, with
an official ``line'' everyone must follow. Any party in a democracy
must appeal to voters who agree with it on some issues and not on
others. And an acknowledgement that issues are complex and that
reasonable people can disagree is always welcome.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a little silly to talk about mutual respect and
tolerance in the context of what you define as child murder, then
revert to nasty high indignation when discussing, say, the closing
of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It is simply not coherent to tell believers in abortion rights,
``We think you're slaughtering children _ and, no, we're not
prepared to discuss it _ but hey! We don't care. Come on in anyway
and try to make yourself feel at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Moral clarity is the great strength of the extreme pro-life
position: Abortion is killing a baby, period. But it's a position
that's hard to fake, as the GOP continues to learn.

 &HT;    From `Birds' to beasts
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tippi Hedren lives among 60 big cats and two
African elephants, but that makes a sort of sense: Being a movie
star is fine preparation for a life with wild animals. Or vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   It was all a long time ago, nearly 40 years, but Hedren is still
happy to talk about her tumultuous professional and personal
relationship with Alfred Hitchcock, the subject of the eighth
annual American Movie Classics Film Preservation Weekend on the
cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Hedren starred in two films for Hitchcock: ``The Birds,'' which
was very popular at the time, and ``Marnie,'' which wasn't, but
which has gained stature over the years. After she split with
Hitchcock, she made ``A Countess from Hong Kong,'' Charlie
Chaplin's last movie, and ``The Harrad Experiment'' with her
daughter, Melanie Griffith. And then . . . silence.
</P>
<P>
   She owes her portion of fame, as well as the silence that
followed, to Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed a personal contract with Hitch for seven years,'' she
says via phone from Shambala, her animal preserve in California.
``The only other actress he ever had under personal contract was
Vera Miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock had seen Hedren in a TV commercial and was struck by
her patrician blond beauty, something for which he always had a
weakness _ Grace Kelly, Eva Marie Saint, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was rather amusing that I was being likened to
Grace Kelly. I had enough assurance that I wasn't insulted by being
associated with someone else. I'm my own woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedren's memories of Hitchcock are of a ferociously articulate
man, painstaking in his explanations of what a particular scene
needed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wonderful with me; he was not only my director, he was
my drama coach. It was fabulous to have that kind of in-depth
direction, but I'm sure I needed it; ``The Birds ``was my first
movie. I had done a tremendous number of commercials, but that is
not the same as becoming a character. I was technically educated
about cameras but not about acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very psychological director. It could be maddening at
some points. I didn't even realize what was happening; he'd know
which buttons to push to get a response out of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other times, I pulled things out of my own experience. When my
horse died in ``Marnie,'' I went right back to when my dog Corky
died when I was a child. Corky was a little terrier who died of
distemper because my parents didn't have enough money to take the
animals for shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedren still marvels at the amount of preparation Hitchcock did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had me sit in on meetings with everyone from the cameraman
to (costume designer) Edith Head, to editing and set decorating. It
was really incredible. We would talk about the script and the
character so much that by the time we got to the filming, it was
very clear what was needed. He rarely did more than three takes on
most of the scenes. Sometimes, he would go with the first take.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its complicated special effects, ``The Birds'' was an
extremely arduous production experience, and after Grace Kelly
flirted with the idea of making a comeback on ``Marnie,'' Hitchcock
again turned to Hedren.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that picture that Hedren rebelled against what she
regarded as Hitchcock's increasing mania about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possessiveness that the man was perpetrating upon me was
suffocating. He was so controlling _ suffocating really is the best
word. He didn't want me as a mistress, it wasn't that; he just
didn't want me to be with anyone else. Dating was a big problem.
Remember, I already had a child, I was my own woman, and if you're
going to be Svengali, you'd better choose somebody that doesn't
have any life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get out of it. I did it myself. `I can't go on like
this,' I told him, `I have to get out.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `I'll ruin your career,' and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next four years, Hedren got her $600 a week and
basically didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hurt the most was that (French director Francois)
Truffaut wanted me for a picture, and Hitch said I wasn't
available. It was so hurtful I could hardly stand to hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he gave my contract to Universal, and they wanted me to
do some TV show, and I said I didn't want to do that. And they
said, `We'll drop your contract.' And I put out my hand and said,
`Will you shake on that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hedren runs Shambala, a game preserve that grew out of
``Roar,'' a barely released film she made with her then-husband and
her daughter in the late '70s that took years to complete but
spawned a passionate love of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity helps some in fund-raising, but in other ways it
hurts _ people think we're rich, which isn't the case. Some people
say, `Let her daughter support her.' That goes over real well. But
the celebrity makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Shambala is spread across 75 acres in Southern California and
has a monthly overhead of $75,000, but as far as Hedren is
concerned, it has been far more rewarding than the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the financial burdens weren't so horrendous, I'd be the
luckiest woman in the world. We have private parties on the
weekend. We have a fantastically wonderful safari tent that's
decorated to the nines, gourmet dinners served on a wonderful
inch-and-a-half-thick glass dining table with crystal and china.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's paradise out here.''

THE TWO FACES OF JIM CARREY 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Jim Carrey in
scenes from ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Maybe if he made less money. Maybe if his face wasn't
perpetually contorted into some impossible grimace. Maybe if he
displayed fewer teeth.
 &HT;    Maybe then Jim Carrey would get the kind of respect Hollywood
normally accords any actor whose box-office receipts are a billion
and rising.
 &HT;    Outdrawing Hollywood's top male stars hasn't worked. Neither has
playing it straight, more or less, in bravura performances for
world-class directors in Peter Weir's ``The Truman Show'' (l998)
and Milos Forman's ``Man On The Moon'' (l999).
 &HT;    Oh, sure, those performances brought him a pair of Golden Globes
from the Hollywood Foreign Press, but nobody really counts those.
What matters is the Academy Award, and in the Oscar stakes Carrey
is left at the starting gate time after time.
 &HT;    Like his idol Jerry Lewis, who was never taken seriously by
anyone except the unfathomable French, Carrey has ruled the box
office but still struggled to be seen as anything more than a guy
making faces.
 &HT;    ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' which will open June 23, may be more of
the same. In it Carrey tackles the kind of all-stops-out, ``look,
Ma, no hands'' steamroller of a part that actors' dreams are made
of, playing split personalities trapped within a single body.
 &HT;    The catch: The movie is the latest opus from Peter and Bobby
Farrelly, who were responsible _ and we use the word loosely _ for
``Dumb and Dumber'' (1994) and ``There's Something About Mary''
(l998), which together earned more than $500 million worldwide.
 &HT;    Carrey's performance as Charlie, a mild-mannered police officer
whose subconscious bubbles to the surface in the form of Hank, his
violent, abrasive alter ego _ think Dirty Harry on steroids _ is a
remarkable one, even if it happens in the kind of lowbrow,
anything-for-a-laugh comedy that made Carrey Hollywood's
least-respected superstar.
 &HT;    ``This is our take on `The Three Faces of Eve,''' Peter Farrelly
says, ``except we call it `The Two Faces of Barney Fife,''' after
the beleaguered deputy played by Don Knotts on television's ``The
Andy Griffith Show.''
 &HT;    ``It's an extremely demanding role,'' Farrelly adds, ``because
Jim had no props or make-up to clearly delineate between the two
characters. It's not an easy thing to do. He uses voice changes,
but mostly body language and mannerisms.''
 &HT;    The film is also a love triangle, as Charlie and Hank vie for
the affections of Irene, a woman on the lam who likes them both.
The role is played by Renee Zellweger, who is currently Carrey's
offscreen love interest as well.
 &HT;    Zellweger, who earned her stripes opposite Tom Cruise in ``Jerry
Maguire'' (1996), thinks Carrey ranks with Hollywood's best actors.
 &HT;    ``Jim is a genius,'' she says. ``I've never seen anybody do what
he can do. We'd perform a scene, and in the next instant he'd be
somebody completely different, completely unrecognizable. It was
kind of scary, because his eyes were even different.
 &HT;    ``It was magical to see what he could do.''
 &HT;    In promoting ``Man on the Moon,'' in which he played the bizarre
comic Andy Kaufman, Carrey indulged in some wild, Kaufmanesque
antics. This time around, he's relaxed, even mellow in a T-shirt,
sports jacket and short-cropped hair. Even the mention of his
second consecutive failure to be nominated for an Oscar, despite
most critics' considering him a shoo-in, doesn't get him riled.
 &HT;    ``They're bastards,'' he says of the Academy, ``but you know
I've got to be careful about what I say.
 &HT;    ``Please say I was being facetious,'' he adds quickly, ``because
sometimes these jokes don't translate directly.
 &HT;    ``I understand the Academy, and their experience of me over five
movies was as a crazy persona,'' he says more seriously. ``Over two
films, they're not going to bend that far. I'll accept (the Oscar)
from my seat by the time I get it. I'll have to get somebody to go
up there as I slobber over myself.
 &HT;    ``But I swear to God I don't sweat those things,'' he concludes.
``It would be ungrateful. I have a great life. After all, I'm able
to work with Peter Weir and Milos Forman.''
 &HT;    And with Zellweger, of course. Carrey _ who is divorced from
actress Lauren Holly, whom he met while shooting ``Dumb and
Dumber'' _ says that there are no marriage plans. He also denies
rumors that Zellweger, who is currently shooting ``Bridget Jones's
Diary'' in England, is pregnant.
 &HT;    He will, however, admit that they're more than just good
friends.
 &HT;    ``I will say we had the most wonderful old-fashioned,
tremendously
something-you-dream-about-happening-that-never-happens-anymore
courtship,'' Carrey says. ``We're having a great time. She's a gem
of a human being, and one of the best actresses I've ever seen in
my life. That's why I wanted her in my movie _ not to go after her
but to learn from her.
 &HT;    ``She's a great person, and is what she seems to be,'' the
comedian says. ``She makes me laugh. She's a bashful person, but
very funny.''
 &HT;    Next up for the funnyman is a straight role in ``The Phone
Booth'' for director Joel Schumacher. The story, described as a
Hitchcockian thriller, is about a man who answers a pay phone on a
crowded New York street and is told he will die if he hangs up.
 &HT;    Plans for him to star in a remake of the Danny Kaye film ``The
Secret Life of Walter Mitty'' (1947) are on hold, though Carrey
would seem to be an absolute natural for that one.
 &HT;    ``It's a cool story,'' he admits, ``but I need to see a script
before going ahead.''
 &HT;    After multiple ups and downs, personally and professionally,
Carrey says he is now comfortable with his life.
 &HT;    ``It's never been about money,'' he says. ``It was where you are
when you get that money.
 &HT;    ``The big change in my life is that everybody knows me now,''
Carrey continues. ``It makes you self-conscious. Yet my life is
getting simpler and simpler, thanks to a lot of people who remind
me that, if you lose the menial things in life, you lose your pride
and your joy.
 &HT;    ``When I first got famous,'' he recalls, ``I bought into the
philosophy that you should hire people because you can. I wanted to
be Bruce Wayne.
 &HT;    ``Now I enjoy washing my own cape.''

LONG LIVE ELIAN GONZALEZ: JUAN MIGUEL'S CHOICE

   &UR; BY JEFFERSON MORLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Nations Statistical Division, the
average life expectancy of a 6-year-old boy living in the United
States is 66.5 more years (or 72.5 total). Unless he is relocated
to Cuba, where the average life expectancy of a 6-year-old boy is
67.5 more years (73.5 total).
</P>
<P>
   This little statistic by no means settles the Elian argument.
Anyone might sensibly say that 66.5 years of freedom are worth more
than 67.5 years under communism. Actuarial equivalence isn't moral
equivalence.
</P>
<P>
   But when you consider how much Americans are willing to spend _
how much you yourself would be willing to spend _ for an extra year
of life, the fact that staying in the United States would be
slightly hazardous to Elian's long-term health ought to give you
pause.
</P>
<P>
   But is it true? Isn't the notion that Cuba has a good
health-care system an old leftist cliche, long since discredited?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the explanation, to be sure, is that Cuba's miserable
economy has spared Cubans some of the diseases of affluence, such
as those caused by industrial pollution, automobile accidents, rich
diets, and so on. And don't go looking for a quick MRI if you're in
Havana and feel a brain tumor coming on.
</P>
<P>
   But Castro does indeed deserve credit for some effective public
health measures, especially near-universal child vaccination. For
details, check out the Web site of the Pan American Health
Organization, a Washington-based agency funded in part by the U.S.
government and not previously identified as a Communist front.
</P>
<P>
   But what about basic liberties such as freedom of speech and
association? Who wouldn't risk the distant and uncertain chances of
a longer life for his child in order to secure the fruits of
freedom? The answer, of course, is a man like Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Disbelief greeted his initial statements from Cuba that he
didn't want to come live in the United States. Opponents of his
son's return to Cuba demanded he come and express his opinion in a
free country. So he came to Washington and said the same thing in a
private meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol was still skeptical,
demanding to know why Juan Miguel didn't come to Miami and ``tell
his side of the story.'' The expectation seemed to be that a random
Cuban deposited in America would spontaneously recite the gospel
according to the Wall Street Journal. And if he didn't, that proved
he was a Fidel stooge.
</P>
<P>
   Most sane people are now convinced that Elian's father actually
prefers to live in a sunny Caribbean beach town surrounded by
Scandinavian tourists, Communist busybodies, and loving relatives
rather than to move to America for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to
bicker with strangers about private matters on C-SPAN and CNN. That
someone would subordinate even the exercise of civil liberties to
living a long time in familiar circumstances _ and maximizing the
chances of the same for his son _ was something that people outside
the media-political bubble could understand.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, one of several perverse effects of our four-decade
embargo of Cuba is that Americans have never disliked Fidel Castro
as much as he might deserve and hard-liners in Washington and Miami
would like. Fidel has spent 40 years successfully tweaking the
elites of Washington. Americans like that kind of guy. Given a
choice between dogma and an underdog, even uncompassionate
conservatives are known to hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   But back to those statistics. Imagine that male life expectancy
of 6-year-olds in Cuba was, say, 46.7 more years (or 52.7 total).
That's what it is in Haiti, another impoverished Caribbean island
that many residents would dearly love to flee (and whose 6-year
olds and their parents, if they make it to our shores, are turned
back).
</P>
<P>
   Or pretend that male life expectancy in Cuba was 58.1 more years
(or 64.1 total), the figure for El Salvador. The whole debate over
Elian's future would have been very different.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Juan Miguel himself would have faced a more
difficult choice. In this scenario, one or all of Elian's
grandparents, still kicking in their late 60s and early 70s, would
likely be dead. The judges of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals
would have been much strengthened in their skepticism about
returning a child to a ``Communist-totalitarian'' country
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives would undoubtedly _ and correctly _
point out that returning the boy would risk not just his freedom
but a decade or two of his life. Anti-Clinton pundits would be
accusing Janet Reno of murder. (Well, accusing her of murder
again.) Castro's immunization program not only eliminated measles,
it also killed off these arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel's choice for himself and his son may, in the end, be
wrong. But that choice is more than merely his to make: It's
understandable that he would make it. It may be ideological, but
it's not obviously crazy. Quite the opposite.

   Sexual selection is driving some fish towards extinction, say
researchers from New Mexico. They have found that female Pecos
pupfish prefer to mate with males of another species.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like seeing speciation in reverse,'' says biologist
Jonathan Rosenfield at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   In freshwater fish, roughly 40 percent of endangered species are
at risk of hybridizing with related exotic species. But few studies
have investigated the biological mechanisms that cause the genetic
swamping and assimilation of one species by another.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield and his colleague Astrid Kodric-Brown have found that
sexual selection _ a process of nonrandom mating known to play a
role in the formation of new species _ may be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that female Pecos pupfish (Cyprinodon
pecosensis) much prefer males of another species, the introduced
sheepshead minnow (C. variegatus). Hybrid offspring of these
crosses are more successful than either parent species at defending
breeding territories, and so enjoy greater reproductive success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hybrids are almost super-pupfish,'' observes Kodric-Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of this behavior have been dire. In just five
years in the 1980s the hybrids replaced the Pecos pupfish across
most of its native range, a 500-kilometer stretch of the Pecos
River in southern New Mexico. The pure pupfish today survive only
in isolated springs and sinkholes in the river flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hybrid zone spread extremely quickly,'' says Craig
Stockwell, a conservation biologist and pupfish researcher at North
Dakota State University, Fargo. ``This work now lets us understand
how and why that happened.'' &QL;

   A live HIV vaccine that can't infect the people it's supposed to
protect may be possible after all. A team based in California has
created a hybrid of HIV and another virus that can enter cells, but
can't replicate once it's there.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine, containing four HIV genes surrounded by the coat of
the vesicular stomatitis virus, should encourage the immune system
to seek out and destroy cells harboring HIV. Animal tests are due
to start any time now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monkeys are all lined up and we're ready to go,'' says the
team leader Flossie Wong-Staal, director of the Center for AIDS
Research at the University of California in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment relies on priming dendritic cells, which act as
the gatekeepers of the immune system by spotting invading organisms
and abnormal cells such as those from tumors and engulfing them.
Dendritic cells display protein fragments of their prey on the
surface, and this trains other components of the immune system such
as T cells to recognize and destroy the same invaders or diseased
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Wong-Staal's plan is to extract dendritic cells from the
patient's blood and infect these cells with the gutted HIV. The
patient would then be injected with the treated cells to encourage
their immune system to destroy HIV-infected cells. A similar
technique has shown promise in treating skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Using real HIV, even in a severely weakened form, would be far
too risky. So Wong-Staal and colleagues have removed the genes HIV
needs to replicate itself, and added genetic material from the
other virus.
</P>
<P>
   They are treading cautiously, as previous attempts to develop an
emasculated version of HIV ended in failure when the virus
recovered its capacity to cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   The new hybrid ``is one step away from the virus itself,'' says
June Kan-Mitchell of the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit,
Mich., who has been working closely with Wong-Staal. ``These things
can't replicate, but they are infectious, although only for one
round of infection,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Initial results of laboratory tests, due to appear in Blood next
month, suggest that dendritic cells exposed to the vaccine
encourage other components of the immune system to destroy cells
infected with real HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first step to establishing the efficacy of the
vaccine,'' Kan-Mitchell says.
</P>
<P>
   Other vaccine researchers think the approach has potential. Ruth
Ruprecht of Harvard Medical School agrees the vaccine should be
safe because, unlike the live, attenuated vaccine her team has
studied, Wong-Staal's virus can't replicate. She says she will
watch progress of the trial closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like an interesting approach and has potential,'' she
says, although some scientists think that to protect against HIV, a
vaccine will also need to generate antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   If Wong-Staal's strategy proves successful, either by itself or
as part of a combined vaccine, the researchers hope that further
development will allow the hybrid virus to be delivered directly to
dendritic cells without having to remove them from the body first. &QL;

   How do homicide detectives know how long a person has been dead?
In the first 12 to 24 hours after death, visible changes in the
body give an accurate enough estimate. But when corpses are days or
weeks old it becomes more difficult because the complex chemistry
of decay takes over and no one understands very much about it.
</P>
<P>
   But now chemists, anthropologists and other scientists in
Tennessee are working on a project to develop a device they could
wave over a body to detect how long the person has been dead. Arpad
Vass of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the lead investigator on
the lab's ``time since death'' program, says the first step is to
create a look-up table of the chemicals made during a body's
decomposition. You would then compare entries in the table with the
output of an electronic nose _ a device that detects and identifies
vapors.
</P>
<P>
   A body passes through three stages after death, says Vass:
enzymatic liquefaction of cells (autolysis), bacterial
decomposition of tissue (putrefaction) and then skeletonization.
These processes occur in the hours and days after death, at rates
dependent upon the environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Volatile gases are released, and organs liquefy and complex fats
and proteins are broken down, but so far no one has quantified this
process.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to shed some light, Jennifer Love, a graduate
assistant at the University of Tennessee, is spending successive
nights in a morgue, taking vapor samples near corpses and samples
of tissue from several organs, while noting temperature and
humidity conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Love says the Oak Ridge team is using mass spectroscopy, gas
chromatography and electronic noses for odor analysis. The aim is
to discover which absolute quantities of individual chemicals,
ratios of related compounds or multi-component chemical profiles
will correlate with different periods of time since death.
</P>
<P>
   Vass has previously analyzed the fatty acid content of the soil
beneath corpses, and believes that such signatures let him estimate
time since death with an accuracy of two days either way for every
30 days of decomposition. Eventually, in addition to a device that
detectives would wave over a body, Vass would like to identify the
chemicals that police dogs use to find corpses, so e-noses can do
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have reservations about the aim of eliminating expert
interpretations of results,'' says Lee Goff, a forensic
entomologist based in Hawaii, who has estimated time of death for
more than 200 corpses _ based on the stage in the life cycle of
insects that quickly populate a body.
</P>
<P>
   Goff says that the many variables involved, such as body size
and environment, will mean that a forensics expert will always be
needed to evaluate the evidence. &QL;

   Viruses given a gene for a toxin from one of the world's
deadliest spiders could replace chemical pesticides, say
researchers in the United States. They plan to carry out field
trials, although there are fears about the wisdom of releasing such
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn King of the University of Connecticut Health Center in
Farmington and his colleagues recently identified a unique family
of toxins in the venom of a funnel-web spider. These neurotoxins
are lethal when injected into insect tissues, yet have no effect if
eaten by insects or other animals.
</P>
<P>
   King's team is now engineering the gene for one of these toxins
into baculoviruses, common viruses that infect certain moths and
butterflies, and have long been used as biopesticides. When the
modified baculovirus infects an insect, the insect's cells should
start to produce the toxin, killing it faster than wild viruses.
Because the host dies quickly, before much virus can replicate, the
modified virus shouldn't persist in the environment, the
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome a potentially environmentally friendly pest control
but it's abundantly clear we need to be more firm about risk
issues,'' comments George McGavin, an entomologist at Oxford
University. ``If we are not 100 percent sure, it shouldn't be in
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   There have already been several field trials worldwide of
baculoviruses given a gene for a scorpion toxin. However, most of
the scorpion toxin made in infected insects fails to fold into the
correct shape, King says. By contrast, tests in bacteria suggest
that almost 100 percent of the spider toxin should fold properly,
making the virus deadlier.
</P>
<P>
   King thinks engineering toxin genes into viruses is preferable
to adding them to plants, such as Bt maize. Not only does it mean
that people do not have to eat plants that produce insecticidal
toxins, but only target insects will be affected, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``These viruses can be exquisitely specific, right down to
infecting individual species,'' King claims. ``This means that only
the pest insects will be killed whilst beneficial insects such as
bees remain unaffected.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics fear that the virus will spread into the
environment and affect other kinds of butterflies and moths.
</P>
<P>
   ``A containment environment could not possibly hold a virus,''
McGavin says, who opposed trials of a scorpion toxin virus in
Oxfordshire in the 1990s. ``If you could get a specific baculovirus
it would be great, but baculoviruses do pass on to other
species].''
</P>
<P>
   There are also fears that the toxin gene might be transferred to
other viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no instance of a toxin gene jumping from virus A to
virus B,'' says Bruce Hammock of the University of California,
Davis, who is also working on modified baculoviruses. ``But if it
jumped, the new virus would become less effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Cory of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Oxford
agrees transfer of the toxin gene is unlikely, but thinks further
tests would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vicious circle,'' she says, ``you have to do a risk
assessment before you do the experiment but we don't know all the
risks without doing field experiments in the first place.'' &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: FINDING A FILM IN FICTION'S FEEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apart from the luster of borrowed seriousness, what literature
most often provides the movies is access to a deep and
ever-replenishing reservoir of stories. Film and the novel are
cousins not far removed, and the DNA they share is narrative. But
their narrative codes _ owing partly to obvious differences of
media, and partly to their divergent histories _ have grown farther
and farther apart. By now, after several generations of fervid
experimentation, the flouting of storytelling norms has become,
among ambitious fiction writers, a convention in itself.
</P>
<P>
   While it would be a distortion to say that the rise of the
movies as a parallel and competing art form has been the cause of
this, the signature effects of postmodern fiction _ recursive
language games; self-conscious, unreliable and multiple-narrative
voices; Mobius strip skeins of allusion and parody, sincerity and
irony _ seem almost flagrant in their defiance of cinematic
appropriation.
</P>
<P>
   The giants of postmodernism _ William Gaddis, Thomas Pynchon,
Don DeLillo _ have erected pyramids of prose so intricate in their
conceits and so saturated with reference as to defy replication
altogether. Their most recognizable progeny carry on this
resistance. Can you picture the 1,100 pages of David Foster
Wallace's ``Infinite Jest,'' with its 400 footnotes and uncountable
subplots, on the screen?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, American movies seem, perhaps more than ever,
to languish under the tyranny of story, a regime with its own
bureaucratic jargon. Aspiring screenwriters are schooled in the
dogma of ``three-act structure,'' ``character arcs'' and
``through-lines.'' The average Hollywood product, confined within
iron laws of genre and subject to the killing discipline of test
marketing, arrives in theaters overstuffed with incident, whipsawed
by the need for suspense and predictable from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly surprising, then, that a handful of restless and
independent-minded filmmakers have turned to contemporary fiction
for relief, as though envious of the liberties writers have claimed
for themselves _ the freedom to meander, to proliferate loose ends,
to think out loud. Alison Maclean's ``Jesus' Son,'' opening in New
York Friday, is the latest in a series of intriguing efforts to
translate the words of particularly idiosyncratic writers into the
visual and aural idioms of film. Like Sofia Coppola's ``Virgin
Suicides,'' Bette Gordon's ``Luminous Motion,'' Mary Harron's
``American Psycho'' and Stephen Frears' ``High Fidelity,'' ``Jesus'
Son'' is at once a tribute to its source and a bold refashioning of
it, an attempt to preserve the author's style and to advance the
director's vision in a single gesture.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Maclean is doggedly faithful to her source, a slim
volume of resonant, anecdotal stories by Denis Johnson. The book is
held together by his shuffling, soulful, absent-minded hero, a
young man adrift in a landscape of drugs, sad women and surreal
jobs. Johnson's lean, wry prose infiltrates the film's soundtrack
through dialogue and voice-over, and some of his descriptive
passages are reproduced with meticulous obedience, as though they
were architectural drawings.
</P>
<P>
   But reading ``Jesus' Son,'' you wonder how its spare,
half-mumbled vignettes and loopy, hipster jokes could sustain the
flesh-and-blood realism of a movie. The supporting characters, not
all of whom are named, seem like interchangeable apparitions from a
jumbled series of acid flashbacks, and the book as a whole is like
a long conversation with a voluble, not entirely sane or sober
companion on a cross-country bus trip.
</P>
<P>
   The book's resonance and humor seem to dwell between its lines,
in the capacity of Johnson's artful prose _ and prose in general _
to be at once more abstract and more sensual than film, however
ingenious, can ever hope to be. Language is able to track the
stutterings of consciousness, the bleeding together of thought and
sensation, the dislocated experience of time, by the simplest and
most efficient of means. Poetry, Robert Frost said, is what gets
lost in translation, and a corollary might be that prose is what
disappears before your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a typical passage from ``Jesus' Son'': ``Or maybe that
wasn't the time it snowed. Maybe it was the time we slept in the
truck and I rolled over on the bunnies and flattened them. It
doesn't matter. What's important for me to remember now is that
early the next morning the snow was melted off the windshield and
the daylight woke me up. A mist covered everything and, with the
sunshine, was beginning to grow sharp and strange. The bunnies
weren't a problem yet, or they'd already been a problem and were
already forgotten, and there was nothing on my mind. I felt the
beauty of the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   In a hundred words, Johnson evokes several distinct states of
feeling, jumps backward, forward and sideways in time, and leaps
with careless grace from the narrator's inner world to the world
outside. The camera may be able to approximate some of these
effects, or convey, through the alchemical interactions of light on
the landscape and the human face, a faint equivalent of them. But
never with this kind of effortless, off-the-cuff efficiency.

</P>
<P>
   Or consider another passage, a kiss from Jeffrey Eugenides'
``Virgin Suicides'' that is stranger, truer, and far more vividly
icky than even the most splendidly backlit classic-Hollywood
smooch:
</P>
<P>
   ``He could sense her whole being through the kiss, he said, as
though her soul escaped through her lips, as the Renaissance
believed. He tasted first the grease of her Chap Stick, then the
sad Brussels-sprout flavor of her last meal, and past that the dust
of lost afternoons and the salt of tear ducts. The peach schnapps
faded away as he sampled the juices of her inner organs, all
slightly acidic with woe.''
</P>
<P>
   If this seems overdone, it's purposely so, since Eugenides'
theme is obsessive longing, to the point, precisely, of this kind
of lunacy, which teen-age boys are capable of when confronted with
the unfathomable reality of teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin Suicides,'' published in 1993, is a lyrical
meditation on death, loss and the suburbs, filtered through the
collective consciousness of an anonymous group of young men. Its
central event is signaled by the title and spelled out in the first
sentence, so that its story plays out to the melancholic rhythms of
longing. The sense of mystery that pervades the book is sustained
by its lush, obsessive style. Like ``Jesus' Son,'' its most
striking feature is its voice.
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said of Scott Bradfield's ``History of
Luminous Motion,'' Nick Hornby's ``High Fidelity,'' and even Bret
Easton Ellis' aggressively styleless, brutally misunderstood
``American Psycho.'' This is not just a matter of style, which all
good writers possess, but of the sometimes excessive application of
style to the creation of a seamless subjective reality. The way the
narrators address the reader _ intimate, formal, conversational,
but above all palpably artificial _ is also, in each case, a way of
making the world strange, or rendering the familiar, forgettable
details of childhood, family life, popular culture and urban
consumer capitalism outlandish and disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The History of Luminous Motion'' Phillip _ an 8-year-old
boy who accompanies his mother from town to town and man to man in
a beat-up car crammed with textbooks, stolen credit cards and
strange mementos _ has the vocabulary and philosophical acuity of a
graduate student, as well as an ability to interpret his own life
with curious detachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to grow and learn,'' he observes, ``we must permit
the world to betray itself.'' The voice we hear in the novel, of
course, is not the voice of an actual child, any more than the
``we'' who relates the doom of the Lisbon sisters in ``The Virgin
Suicides'' is a literal chorus of wishful Michigan schoolboys.
These voices are rather representations of consciousness: what the
characters might say if they could.
</P>
<P>
   But in movies, what we hear is what people do say, even if only
to us, out of earshot of the other characters. The shortest,
roughest route from the page to the screen is the voice-over, a
device that has gone from rarity to near ubiquity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin Suicides'' distills the mournful voice of the
novel's collective narrator into the unseen person of Giovanni
Ribisi. Phillip's prickly, precocious thoughts in ``Luminous
Motion'' are channeled through the squeaky voice of Eric Lloyd, the
cute, pudgy-faced actor enlisted to play this murderous, possibly
psychotic character. ``American Psycho'' rings the most daring
change on this convention by making the novel's long, turgid
parodies of rock criticism into spoken preludes to murder,
addressed by Patrick Bateman to his uncomprehending victims.
</P>
<P>
   The voices that echo in the darkness of our heads and the ones
that echo in the darkness of a movie theater, and the reliance on
voice-over as a convenient preservative reduces the literary to the
literal. Who talks that way? Why would he say that? What's that
supposed to mean?
</P>
<P>
   Or, most treacherously, Why doesn't he just shut up? That
question is brazenly risked by ``High Fidelity,'' which transfers
large tracts of Hornby's novel directly into the mouth of John
Cusack, ironing out its Britishisms to suit Cusack's amiable
Midwestern delivery. The movie beautifully captures the riffing,
digressive energy of Hornby's prose, and of all the films discussed
here it's perhaps the most shapely and satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   But also the least daring. Its story, after all, hews to one of
the top five movie plots: a self-centered, basically decent guy
confronts his self-centeredness, affirming his basic decency and
thus meriting the love of the woman he had driven away. Like the
novel, the movie restricts itself entirely to the guy's point of
view, and most of the film's action consists of Cusack speaking
into the camera directly to us, blocking out our ability to see
around him into what the other characters might be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' thus manages to be engaging without quite
being a movie; it's more like a staged reading of the novel, with
some interesting visual illustrations and a soundtrack to die for.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity,'' like the other books mentioned, is narrated
by a young _ or at least not quite mature _ man, and its subject,
buried under the flash and noise of rock 'n' roll, is the way young
men think about women. It's a curious coincidence (and a sign of
welcome and overdue, if tenuous, change) that the directors of
``The Virgin Suicides,'' ``American Psycho,'' ``Luminous Motion,''
and ``Jesus' Son'' are women, who have staked the development of
their own distinctive styles on bringing to the screen studies in
male narcissism and then quietly, respectfully, but pointedly,
subverting them.
</P>
<P>
   In all of these books, women _ the star-crossed Lisbon sisters
in ``The Virgin Suicides,'' the alcoholic Mom in ``The History of
Luminous Motion,'' the barely differentiated wives and girlfriends
in ``Jesus' Son,'' and the victims in ``American Psycho'' _ are
visible only through the distorting lens of male self-regard. They
are objects of longing, rage and need, but never selves in their
own right with autonomous interior lives, fears and desires. But
the transformative magic of movies is that characters who on the
page may be ciphers, icons or fantasies are permitted to come alive
as embodied persons.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of ``Jesus' Son'' may be stunned to find that Michelle,
a character whose abortion figures in one of the stories, and about
whom we never learn much more, has become Samantha Morton, whose
noble, fearless performance gives the movie an emotional depth and
coherence not found in the book.
</P>
<P>
   And the remorseless self-obsession of Patrick Batemen in
``American Psycho'' is brilliantly undermined, in Harron's sharply
satiric rendering of the book, by Cara Seymour as the prostitute
who grasps, perhaps better than the audience does, what Patrick is
about. Deborah Kara Unger in ``Luminous Motion'' and Kirsten Dunst
in ``The Virgin Suicides'' provide those movies with similar
emotional gravity and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   None of these films are perfect. All of them have the rough
edges of worthwhile experiments pursued with discipline and
imagination. Their imperfections make them interesting and suggest
new permutations in the long relationship between literature and
cinema. In the end it may not be possible to make such odd and
challenging books into movies, but Harron, Coppola, Gordon and
Maclean have nonetheless transformed them into novels.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Why isn't Hillary Clinton mopping up the floor with
her rookie Republican opponent, a young congressman so obscure that
64 percent of New Yorkers in a recent survey didn't know anything
about him?
</P>
<P>
   She's virtually tied with Rep. Rick Lazio, who hastily entered
the New York Senate race only in May as a fall-back candidate after
the Republicans' first choice, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to that familiar axiom, you can't beat
somebody with nobody? Clearly, Clinton is a Somebody. And so far,
Lazio is a Nobody.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times/CBS Poll conducted June 4-10 showed the first
lady with the support of 44 percent of likely voters compared with
39 percent for Lazio, a statistically insignificant difference.
This is essentially the same standoff that polls matching Clinton
with Giuliani had registered for months.
</P>
<P>
   Although 45 percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable
impression of the first lady, she has been unable to attract a
simple majority in any poll the past year despite diligent
statewide campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   And that leads to a second, contradictory axiom.
</P>
<P>
   People seldom vote FOR a candidate on individual merit. They
vote AGAINST a candidate they don't like, making that person's
opponent an incidental beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to measure the true extent of the hostility
toward the first lady that has slopped over from disgust over her
husband's misdeeds. But it is clearly a factor. The recent poll
shows 31 percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable opinion of
her. She is unlikely to sway those folks. Her negatives, like those
of her husband, are frozen in partisan cement.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, hardly open-minded observers, make much of her
inability to break through to 50 percent support. At the same time,
however, the 40ish support she does have seems consistently solid,
which as a base is not bad this early in a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the snarling attitude that always assumes the worst
of her is the view of conservative commentator George Will, who
scoffed on ABC-TV last weekend at the self-deprecating witticisms
she made a recent New York Legislative Correspondents Association
dinner in Albany. She isn't known for a sense of humor; so her
performance was a breakthrough of sorts. With her carpetbag and her
photographic poses in a Yankees cap, she was a surprising hit.
Lazio showed up at the dinner but refused to make a speech.
</P>
<P>
   The cynical journalistic crowd loved her jokes, but not Will,
whose heart permanently belongs to Ronald Reagan. Will grumped
irrelevantly that she now had more experience as a stand-up comic
than she had in public office, mocking the inconvenient fact that
as first lady she was involved in serious public policy debates and
carried out many official duties. ``So maybe she ought to
reconsider what she's running for,'' he said. Then he sourly added
that if the Mets had beaten the Yankees recently, she would have
changed hats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has no hope of winning over the Wills of the world. So
what she must do _ and is doing _ is go after the 24 percent who
are still undecided about her. This is no small task since it is a
mystery how anybody in this polarized era could have remained
neutral until now on the subject of the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, on the other hand, is still a blank page. He has spent
his House career being all things to all people, voting sometimes
with conservative Speaker Newt Gingrich, sometimes with Republican
moderates. Only 26 percent of those surveyed viewed him favorably,
but the whopping 64 percent who said they don't know anything about
him constitute both an opportunity and a potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   They can be cranked up or turned off. It is up to Lazio to
capture them and Clinton to lure them away.
</P>
<P>
   Both are bent to their task. Lazio is riding a bus around the
state, but it lacks the originality and personal touch that Sen.
John McCain brought to his Straight Talk Express. The first lady is
everywhere, marching in parades, giving interviews, dropping in on
ordinary folks.
</P>
<P>
   Barring some enormous verbal gaffe, none of this will hurt. How
much it actually helps this summer until voters begin to focus on
politics in the fall is open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran pollsters of both parties complain that nobody is even
paying attention to the presidential contests yet, let alone to
local sideshows like congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   But early positioning can ultimately influence public opinion.
Is this to be a referendum on her fame, or on his obscurity?
</P>
<P>
   The first lady is trying to paint Lazio as a right-wing radical,
which he does not seem to be. He is trying to return the favor,
portraying her as a left-wing radical, which she is not.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully by autumn they will both have that stuff out of their
systems and can get down to the real business of the campaign,
which is the clash of ideas.

&HT;     MORE SEASONED MONTGOMERIE RETURNS WITH REALISTIC APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Colin Montgomerie always seems to come
into the U.S. Open as one of the favorites. He has yet to walk away
with a win.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 Open at Pebble Beach, his first U.S. Open, may have
been as close as he's come. Montgomerie went into the clubhouse as
the leader with a final-round 70 to finish at even-par in ungodly
conditions and then accepted congratulations from Jack Nicklaus on
his first Open win, which is golf's equivalent of a papal blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit, I thought at that stage when I finished that
round _ I holed a very good putt at the last, about a 5-footer left
to right _ that I holed that putt to win,'' Montgomerie said
Wednesday. ``I felt that putt was to win the tournament. And as it
turned out, it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tom Kite _ who was 3-over after just three holes _
rallied to pick up six strokes and the victory. Jeff Sluman
finished second at 1-under.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, 36, is a star, and a very rich man, thanks to the
European Tour, where he has won twice in nine tries this year. But
he joins a list of the game's biggest names (including David Duval,
Phil Mickelson and Jesper Parnevik) who have never won a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be honest. It's not a normal golf tournament, so
everyone feels that way and I'm no different,'' Montgomerie said.
``I've had a reasonable career and haven't won a major, so, yes,
there's slightly more pressure on the situation. But it won't
affect me in any way, shape or form in my lifestyle or life if I do
happen to win a major. I would like to do it, but if I don't, well,
I've had a good run, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie has a hostile history with Northern California
galleries. At the 1998 Open at the Olympic Club, Montgomerie was
flustered and angry by the remarks from the crowd. It was getting
so bad at one point that Montgomerie turned to confront his verbal
attackers and fellow players denounced the behavior of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   While not addressing the issue of the galleries specifically,
Montgomerie thinks he's become tougher as the years wear on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through enough to learn, hopefully, and to be able
to cope with any situation that's thrown against me here and for
the ages to come,'' he said. ``I feel that my character is a lot
tougher than it was before and I'm as determined as ever. I just
hope that lady luck throws in a shot or two to my side.''

`TITAN A.E': MAY A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FORCE BE WITH YOU 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A brash young space traveler with festering father-son issues,
his tart-tongued female colleague and a crew of oddly shaped
intergalactic creatures: If the basic ingredients of Don Bluth and
Gary Goldman's ambitious animated film ``Titan A.E.'' sound awfully
familiar, it's because in some ways this handsomely designed
intergalactic adventure could be described as Son of ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   But in many other respects the movie is not a George Lucas
imitation. Its guiding concept imagines the human race literally
lost in the stars and scattered about the universe in ``drifter
colonies'' after an alien invasion in the 31st century has
destroyed the planet. Even then the survivors and their descendants
are pursued by the aliens who drove them from their homes. Huddled
in their enclaves, these refugees hoard useless earthly bric-a-brac
that reminds them of their home. (``A.E.'' stands for ``After
Earth.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' goes only so far in implying a multi-species
equality. Without designating a hierarchy it suggests that humans
are still superior to almost everyone else. That's why their
enemies, the Drej, are determined to chase them to the ends of the
universe if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Then why, given the movie's poignant notion of humans as
intergalactic exiles, does so much of ``Titan A.E.'' feel
emotionally flat and mechanically tossed off? Despite some gorgeous
sequences, including one set in a lake of glowing hydrogen
``trees,'' ``Titan A.E.'' is bland. Although crammed with action,
little of it produces roller-coaster thrills of adventure and
self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may have to do with our ever loftier
technological expectations of science fiction movies in the
post-``Star Wars'' era, and ``Titan A.E.'s'' animation techniques
are certainly innovative. The two-dimensional figures interact
seamlessly with three-dimensional computer-generated surroundings
that are richly colored and loaded with intriguing gadgetry. But
when thrust into complex environments that cry out for real human
figures, the animated characters tend to seem smaller than life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' has problems in pacing, storytelling and
character definition. In striving to be all things to all
generations, the screenplay, adapted from a story by Hans Bauer and
Randall McCormick, vacillates uneasily between the fluff of
Saturday morning cartoons and fairly sophisticated wisecracking.
Although the action sequences are lively, they zip by too fast to
build up much cliffhanging excitement.
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet the movie's hero, Cale (Matt Damon), he is a
towheaded little boy whose father, a military scientist, is racing
against time to complete a secret operation, the Titan Project,
that could save humanity from extinction. Earth is about to be
destroyed by the Drej, a race of soulless aliens described as
``pure energy,'' who swarm in shape-shifting formations of
laser-blue lights and speak in mechanized, metallic mumbo jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   As the end of the world looms, Cale's father bids a hasty
farewell to his son before shipping him off to safety. Although the
boy is desperate to remain, his father is firm about his having to
leave and promises that one day they will be reunited. In a parting
gesture he gives his son a magic ring that he says will protect him
from harm.
</P>
<P>
   The story leaps ahead more than a decade. Cale is now a
rebellious teen-age dock worker at a space station that resembles a
grungy junkyard of rusting outmoded machinery. Seething because he
believes his father abandoned him, he has little regard for
humanity. But his feelings suddenly change when he discovers that
the ring his father left him contains a genetically encoded map to
guide him to the Titan, a spaceship designed to save humanity and
concealed somewhere in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   With Korso (Bill Pullman), the space captain of the spaceship
Valkyrie and an old acquaintance of his father's, Cale embarks on
this ultimate treasure hunt. In close pursuit are the Drej, who
know of the Titan's existence and are waiting for Cale to lead them
to it. As the code is deciphered step by step, the predictable
space battles erupt, and two of Cale's fellow treasure hunters
reveal a treacherous side.
</P>
<P>
   One signal that Korso is not entirely a good guy is his red
goatee. Action heroes just don't wear goatees, especially red ones.
Pullman's John Wayne-like vocal swagger is just a little too
exaggerated for comfort. Korso's wily first mate, Preed (Nathan
Lane), is even more suspicious. Haughty and slightly effeminate
with a Vincent Price voice, he conforms to Hollywood's
stereotypical image of the effete villain.
</P>
<P>
   Also on board the Valkyrie is Akima (Drew Barrymore), a curt,
resourceful Eurasian-looking pilot, and a crew that includes the
vessel's eccentric, turtle-like navigator, Gune (John Leguizamo),
and its sour, grumbling weapons specialist, Stith (Janeane
Garofalo).
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' tries to pack so much into 90 minutes that the
characters don't have enough screen time to engage our emotions.
Cale and Akima in particular have all the depth of television
spinoffs of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. This is not to say
that ``Titan A.E.'' isn't entertaining in its breezy, mild-mannered
way, only that its mythology and characters barely resonate.
</P>

 &HT;    U.S. STILL WITHOUT 'TIMELINE' FOR KOSOVO PEACEKEEPING EFFORT,
OFFICIAL SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

   WASHINGTON _ A year after U.S.-led NATO troops liberated Kosovo
from Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic's oppressive government, the
United States is apparently no closer to forming an ``exit
strategy'' for its peacekeeping efforts in the war-torn province, a
top U.S. foreign policy official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not set a timeline to it,'' said Jim O'Brien, special
advisor to the President and Secretary of State for Kosovo and
Dayton Implementation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a solution that is driven by dates,'' he said,
responding to concerns that the United States has become bogged
down in yet another unending peacekeeping effort. ``It is something
that is driven by our interests, and our desire to stay there until
results are achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Those desired results, however, may be too difficult to achieve,
according to O'Brien's fellow panelists at news conference
Thursday. formidable
</P>
<P>
   They said the tasks of nation-building undertaken by the United
Nations _ creating democratic institutions, a self-sufficient
economy and a peaceful multi-ethnic society _ could be a formidable
challenge for the international community.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, U.N. officials and peacekeeping forces find themselves
maintaining security in a region that has never known multi-ethnic
cooperation, and perhaps never will. Just as in Cyprus and Korea,
blue-hatted peacekeepers and a de-militarized zone (DMZ) could
become perpetual fixtures in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and our European allies will need to be
present in Kosovo for a very, very long time,'' said Ivo Daalder,
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Brien, ongoing U.S. participation in Kosovo is
justified by America's duty to stand up for ``what is right,'' as
well as ``strategic interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balkans are at the heart of the central question about the
future of Europe,'' he said ``As we recognized wisely after the
second world war, Europe coalesces around American leadership and
presence on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States last spring led a devastating 78-day NATO air
war against Yugoslavia, which beat back the Serb army and allowed
hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians to return to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, steady progress has been made in rebuilding Kosovo.
An economy based on the Deutch mark is beginning to function, a
central bank and judicial system have recently been established and
efforts are being made to re-welcome minority groups such as the
Roma (gypsies) back into the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the panelists said deep-rooted ethnic conflicts cannot be
painted over with a fresh coat of new institutions and
international aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot enforce peace,'' said Dan Goure, senior fellow at
the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International
Studies. ``You can restrain violence, but you cannot prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daalder agreed, adding, ``What we can and must insist upon is
that if you are a Serb or an Albanian, there should be no reason
for you not to be able to walk down the street.''

   Since then, steady progress has been made in rebuilding Kosovo.
An economy based on the Deutch mark is beginning to function, a

that if you are a Serb or an Albanian, there should be no reason
for you not to be able to walk down the street.''

`JESUS' SON': TRAVELS WITH A STONED CANDIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: ``Jesus' Son'' was shown as part of this year's New
Directors/New Films Series. Here are excerpts from A.O. Scott's
review, which appeared in The New York Times on April 7.) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son,'' Alison Maclean's scruffy, likable new film
adapted from a book of linked short stories by Denis Johnson,
follows the adventures of a young man known only by a nickname that
can't be printed in this newspaper. He acquires this sobriquet _
the initials are F.H. _ because of his almost miraculous propensity
to screw things up, to bring bad luck on himself and those around
him.
</P>
<P>
   But as incarnated first in Johnson's dreamy, neo-beatnik prose
and now in Billy Crudup's transcendent goofing, F.H. retains a
curious aura of innocence. He's like Candide strung out on every
drug he can find, or an itinerant holy man hitchhiking across the
Midwest in wet, filthy hipster hand-me-downs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pleasures of ``Jesus' Son'' is watching a filmmaker
take risks and discover new resources of style. True to her source,
Maclean tells the young man's story in a looping, absent-minded
manner, skittering ahead and then scrambling backward to fill in
forgotten details.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to string together a series of self-contained
vignettes could have resulted in meandering tedium, but she manages
to find a loose, improvisatory rhythm that matches Johnson's
discursive riffing, and that gives her scenes a keen edge of
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Her use of Johnson's own words in the voice-over narration works
less well. Some of his breathless beatnik invocations of the beauty
of the universe lose their innocence on the journey from page to
soundtrack and come across as more fussy than inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The film is fragmentary and episodic, but its first two
sections, set mostly in the brown wintriness of Iowa in 1971,
achieve a tattered narrative unity, thanks to the hero's on-again,
off-again obsession with a doomy, passionate young woman named
Michelle (Samantha Morton).
</P>
<P>
   As their relationship ambles along on its inevitable course from
stoner comedy to junkie tragedy, our hero encounters a succession
of memorably messed-up characters, including Wayne (Denis Leary),
who sucks spilled booze out of a cocktail napkin and smashes the
walls of his own house to find copper wire to sell for scrap, and
Georgie (Jack Black), a hospital orderly who is either a gifted
healer or a dangerous psychopath.
</P>
<P>
   Georgie figures in the film's most memorable sequence, a set
piece shot in the hallucinatory fluorescence of a late-night
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A man wanders in off the street with a hunting knife sticking
out of his eye. ``Patient complains of a knife in his eye,'' the
intake nurse dutifully reports, and later she asks the man, who was
stabbed by his wife, if he wants the hospital staff to call the
police. ``Only if I die,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of surrealist deadpan humor, visual and verbal,
pervades ``Jesus' Son.'' The movie may remind you, in style and
subject, of Gus Van Sant's ``Drugstore Cowboy,'' which similarly
imagined the early 1970s as the golden age of American junkiedom
and was suffused with a rough, dreamy masculine lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   Van Sant's film featured William S. Burroughs as its household
saint of pharmacological enlightenment. For her part Maclean trots
out Dennis Hopper, once the Lord Byron of the drug culture and now
its Ancient Mariner, for a cameo as a scary guy our young friend
meets in rehab.
</P>
<P>
   As it follows F.H. into recovery, the film loses momentum. The
last section is devoted to his new life, post-Michelle, in Arizona.
He has a job at a treatment center for disturbed and disabled
patients, a new love (Holly Hunter) and a voyeuristic devotion to a
Mennonite housewife.
</P>
<P>
   But these details, bereft of the desperate energy of need that
had propelled the movie, feel small and anecdotal. It's not that
``Jesus' Son'' romanticizes drug use; on the contrary, it rubs our
faces in the tawdry emptiness of an addict's days. But if drugs
wreck _ and sometimes take _ the lives of F.H. and his misfit
tribe, they also make them interesting, vivid and oddly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   These words also apply to Crudup and Morton, whose chemistry (so
to speak) keeps the film from nodding off into feckless hustler
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Crudup plays a lost, irresponsible and stupid young man with
discipline and intelligence, using every muscle in his face to
suggest the unreachable emotion and the accidental goodness of his
character. His F.H. is authentically creepy and unexpectedly
charming. If you saw him on the street, you wouldn't know whether
to cross to the other side, give him a quarter or take him home
with you.
</P>
<P>
   Morton, nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of the mute
laundress in Woody Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' is just as
fierce, sweet and angry here, and without much more to say. She
inspires her errant knight to fantasies of rescue and saves this
movie from its own self-destructive impulses.

HEROIN-RELATED DEATHS IN BRITAIN AND IRELAND LINKED TO BACTERIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Officials investigating the mysterious deaths of 35
heroin addicts in England, Scotland and Ireland in the last two
months said Thursday that the cause was a strain of clostridium, a
bacterium usually found in soil or dust.
</P>
<P>
   The clostridium strain, known as Clostridium novyi Type A, is
well known as a cause of severe infection in farm animals and can
lead to a bovine illness known as Black Disease, which kills off
flesh, turning it black. It rarely infects humans, though it is
said to have been responsible for outbreaks of gangrene among
soldiers in the First and Second World Wars.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the heroin users, the bacterium is most likely
coming from a particular batch of heroin contaminated with dirt
harboring clostridium spores, officials said. When the users
dissolve the heroin in citric acid and inject it into their
muscles, generally because their veins have collapsed from repeated
abuse, the injection kills off surrounding tissue, forming a
perfect breeding ground for the bacterium. The first symptom of the
illness is a severe infection at the site of the injection, leading
to massive localized swelling and gaping abscesses.
</P>
<P>
   The illness is treatable at this early stage, with huge doses of
antibiotics and the surgical removal of the dead tissue at the site
of the infection. But left untreated, the bacterium then releases
powerful toxins into the body, causing a huge increase in white
blood cell counts and kidney and liver malfunctions. Patients who
have reached this stage have died of heart failure within 48 hours
or so.
</P>
<P>
   Of more than 70 reported cases, in Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Manchester, Liverpool and other cities, about half the victims have
died.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that it was impossible to tell which batch of
heroin was responsible, or at what point on the usual heroin route,
from West Asia to Britain, the drug had been contaminated. They
also said they did not know how much was still out on the streets.
In Glasgow, police announced that a special unit set up to
investigate the outbreak had made 11 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   But even though they now know what is causing the illness,
doctors said that there is still no cure once the toxins enter the
bloodstream. They stressed that addicts should smoke heroin, not
inject it. Dr. Jai Lingappa, an investigator with the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said that studies
were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward to the results of culturing the heroin
under a variety of conditions to see if we can isolate it and other
bacteria,'' Lingappa told reporters in Glasgow. ``We also want to
learn more about why these people became sick and others didn't.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Very warm and more humid air will spill into the Middle Atlantic
and Northeastern states Friday. Partly sunny skies will combine
with breezes from the southwest that warm as they descend the
Appalachians raising temperatures above seasonal levels. A few
thunderstorms are will form in the afternoon in the Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Many showers and thunderstorms, some of which will be strong
with heavy rain, will develop from the Great Lakes to the central
Mississippi Valley Thursday as a cold front sweeps to the east.
Behind this front, cooler air will move south from Canada, dropping
readings into the 50s and 60s in the northern and central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The record warmth will abate slightly in the West as cooler
onshore breezes develop along the central California coastline.
Interior deserts and valleys will remain hot, however.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: BREAKING RECORDS
</P>
<P>
   Many summer hot spells are accompanied by the setting of daily
temperature records. Much less common are all-time records that are
set when the heat exceeds that of any previous day measured at a
given location. Rarer still are all-time state records that occur
when the temperature is higher than has been measured at any
official site in a state. On Wednesday, an all-time record was set
at San Jose, Calif. when the mercury touched 109 degrees. The
California state record remains 134 degrees at Death Valley, which
has stood since July 10, 1913.

<P>
   Al Gore's presidential campaign is getting a new chairman. Tony
Coelho is quitting for health reasons, and William Daley is
stepping down as commerce secretary to take over. It's the second
makeover in a year of Gore's high command. Coelho, an ex-California
congressman, was hospitalized this week with an inflamed colon and
said he's been having epileptic seizures. Daley, considered one of
the most politically savvy members of President Clinton's Cabinet,
is a son of the late Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and brother of
current Mayor Richard M. Daley.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY TO ABLE THE DISABLED
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush proposed spending $880 million over five years
for technology development to ease the challenges facing the
disabled and helping them work from home. Speaking today at a
disabled-friendly company in Portland, Maine, Bush said: ``People
with disabilities confront hardship every day of their lives. To me
that leaves our society with a simple choice: whether to add to
that hardship or to try to lessen it.'' The candidate's father,
former President George Bush, signed the Americans with
Disabilities Act in July 1990.
</P>
<P>
   UPPING THE ANTE
</P>
<P>
   Doubling the size of his original plan, Al Gore today promised
$500 billion in tax relief over 10 years to help middle-class
Americans pay for tuition, buy health insurance and save for
retirement. He had outlined most of his tax relief plans during the
primary season, estimating their cost at no more than $250 billion
over 10 years. But as prow to be fathers. I know I did,'' the
screen says, crediting the quote to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WEALTH
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is giving a double meaning to his current three-week
``prosperity tour,'' collecting a cool million at two dinners on
Manhattan's Upper East Side for the Democratic Party. He stopped
first at the Park Avenue home of financier Alan Patricof, where 40
people paid $12,500 each for a total take of $500,000. At the next
stop, the 90th Street home of Mitchell Blutt, a doctor and venture
capitalist, 50 people paid $10,000 each, also yielding $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   TALL ORDER FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   A pro-choice stand on abortion may not be Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Ridge's only big obstacle for the Republican vice presidential
nomination; another could be the fact that he himself is too big.
The buzz in GOP circles, according to the New York Post, is that
when focus groups see video of Ridge with George W. Bush, the
pairing flops because the 6-foot-3, massively built Ridge seems to
overpower the slim Bush, whose height is 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   NOT A HAPPY PLACE , BUT THE MONEY'S GOOD
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has some reasons to avoid Massachusetts. He
resoundingly lost the Republican primary there, and he's likely to
lose there again in the fall. And the Texan makes no secret of his
disdain for the elite atmosphere he encountered at Harvard Business
School. All of which might make Bush's stop in Boston tonight seem
odd, if it weren't for one fact: Massachusetts is a tempting place
for Republicans to raise money, appealing to Boston business
leaders and the booming high-tech industry. Bush is expected to
bring in $1 million at a $20,000-a-couple event.
</P>
<P>
   VEEP CHANCES GONE WITH NUCLEAR SECRETS?
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists and friends of Bill Richardson are
worried that the flak and finger pointing over sky-high gas prices
and lost nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab
could doom the energy secretary's prospects of becoming Al Gore's
running mate. Controversy is hardly what presidential candidates
look for in a No. 2, especially Gore, already weighed down by the
baggage of campaign fund-raising allegations and President
Clinton's scandals. But Gore is not discussing whether Richardson's
troubles would disqualify him.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT PART OF NO _
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's Michigan backers apparently haven't heard him say
repeatedly he has no interest in being tapped for George W. Bush's
presidential ticket. In fact, they put in orders for 500
Bush-McCain bumper stickers after McCain's Michigan campaign office
announced by e-mail that they were available. State Sen. John
Schwarz, who had headed McCain's Michigan campaign, said he paid
for them himself because he's convinced that having McCain on the
ticket will help the GOP win in November _ and that ``it will be
kind of fun'' if they start showing up.
</P>
<P>
   FORGET THE GLITZ , HIRE MORE BOUNCERS
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about violence between rumbling Reform Party factions
and protesters at the convention in Long Beach, Calif., organizers
say they've increased the security budget by as much as 15 percent.
Reform Party official Cedric Scofield cited tough-talking e-mails
between supporters of presidential contender Pat Buchanan and party
founder Ross Perot. And National Chairman Gerry Moan said the party
had received threatening messages from militant groups opposed to
Buchanan. He said he's increased the security budget by nixing
other expenditures _ including for a fancy stage design.
</P>
<P>
   OUT TO GET THE PARTY-SWITCHER
</P>
<P>
   A conservative group that does not have to disclose its donors
set up 50 electronic billboards in Rep. Michael Forbes' Suffolk
County district that show the newly minted Democrat with ex-House
Speaker Newt Gingrich. The Republican Majority Issues Committee
also is sending out 20,000 fliers to Democratic houses on eastern
Long Island touting Forbes' votes for impeachment and school prayer
and against abortion. Forbes became a Democrat last summer,
accusing GOP House leaders of being too extreme, and Republicans
have tabbed him their No. 1 target for defeat in November.
</P>
<P>
   SILENT PARTNER BEHIND THE SCENES
</P>
<P>
   By most outward signs, former President George Bush has
maintained a cautious distance from George W. Bush's quest for the
White House, seldom making joint appearances with his son and
rarely commenting on the election. But behind the scenes, Bush the
elder is anything but remote. The New York Times reports that he
regularly exchanges phone calls or e-mails with about a half-dozen
senior officials in the campaign, and his chief of staff, Jean
Becker, is on the phone with Karl Rove, the chief campaign
strategist, almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   RAISING FUNDS _ THAT'S WHAT HE DOES
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising for the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles will intensify in the coming weeks, Terry McAuliffe, the
convention committee's new the factions that have developed within
the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   MOOLAH IN VERMONT
</P>
<P>
   Under Vermont's new state law providing public financing for
statewide campaigns, Anthony Pollina, a Progressive Party candidate
for governor, announced that he has just qualified for nearly
$300,000 in state money, more than the incumbent Democratic
governor, Howard Dean, will get. Pollina had only to raise
contributions of $50 or less from 1,500 Vermont voters around the
state. Some of his donations were as small as 50 cents. The
contributions had to amount to at least $35,000, and to be gathered
from February to July. The state will now give him enough public
money to reach a $300,000 total campaign budget.
</P>
<P>
   HOW ABOUT YOU _ BETTER OR WORSE?

Tour'' this week, he recycled a version of Ronald Reagan's famous
question, asking voters: `

`BOYS AND GIRLS,' RETREAD OF CLASSIC `WHEN HARRY MET SALLY,' GOES
FLAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C-  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Clueless'' turned Jane Austen's ``Emma'' into high school
hijinks and Baz Lurman's ``Romeo + Juliet'' put Shakespeare in the
mouths of babes, who'd have thought such recycling would get so out
of hand?
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Boys and Girls,'' a ``When Harry Met Sally ... ''
for the college set. My, how the classics have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Prinze Jr. is geeky, socially maladroit Ryan, who hides
his good looks behind an aggressively nerdy haircut and a pair of
Clark Kent glasses. Nervous, careful, haplessly applying logic and
reason to an unreasonable world, he keeps crossing paths with
kooky, confident Jennifer (Claire Forlani of ``Meet Joe Black''), a
talky, gawky beauty who makes Ryan bristle with every spontaneous
outburst.
</P>
<P>
   The mixture is combustible, or so the film would have us
believe, but there are no sparks behind the wan verbal fireworks,
no character behind the caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, director Robert Iscove turned ``She's All That,'' a
teen knockoff of ``Pygmalion,'' also starring Prinze, into a
surprise hit. The story wasn't much to speak of, but the film
bubbled with energy thanks to a swirl of bright characters around
the charismatic leads and a delightful step-perfect dance number
that popped out of nowhere to pick up the picture's spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Iscove, a former choreographer, remembered that dance number and
this time uses it to even greater effect. Shy, stiff Ryan flails
around, intently trying to pick up the rhythm of a group dance,
while goosey Jennifer leaps right in.
</P>
<P>
   The energy is infectious and by the end of the number the
mismatched couple is grooving to the same beat. In one spirited
scene, Iscove exemplifies what the wordy script insistently
verbalizes, but once off the dance floor the film slips back into
its dull inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Biggs (``American Pie'') marvelously underplays his part
as Ryan's roommate, a pathological liar who remakes his identity
every few minutes and freely dispenses useless romantic advice, but
otherwise the film lacks a social world for the flirting best
friends their nervous mating dance.
</P>
<P>
   Left with little more than a series of conversations where the
best friends and would-be lovers talk around the issue so much they
wear a hole in the film, ``Boys and Girls'' is finally beholden to
the dialogue. The screenwriters ``The Drews'' haven't the deftness
or invention to pull it off. Prinze and Forlani coast on charisma
alone, but even their charms can't coax magic from the prosaic
dialogue and romantic cliches that clog this listless comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Boys and Girls. Directed by Robert Iscove. Screenplay by The
Drews. Cast: Freddie Prinze Jr., Claire Forlani, Jason Biggs,
Amanda Detmer, Heather Donahue, Alyson Hannigan. Dimension Films.
97 minutes. Rated R for sexuality.

STAN LEE SPINS A NEW WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of comic-book
writer Stan Lee surrounded by some of the characters he created.) 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``I'm going to try to put you on speaker phone,'' Stan Lee says.
``If I lose you, I'll call back and we'll try it again.''
 &HT;    It's an amusing moment. Lee is the legendary creator of such
comic-book superheroes as the X-Men, Spider-Man and the Fantastic
Four. These days, he's also an Internet titan.
 &HT;    And he can't master a speaker phone.
 &HT;    ``I'm the worst guy in the world with things that are
technical,'' he says, laughing across the telephone line from his
office in Encino, Calif. ``You know something? I bought my wife a
new car, and it's got 8,000 buttons to push _ I can't figure any of
it out.
 &HT;    ``I drive an '87,'' he adds. ``There are a couple of buttons,
and I know what they are and what they do. I think things can get
too technical.''
 &HT;    Technological difficulties resolved, Lee launches into
conversation about the goings-on at Stan Lee Media and Marvel
Comics. There's the big-screen version of ``The X-Men'' to discuss,
as well as ``The 7th Portal'' and Lee's shocking deal to pen comics
for Marvel's archrival, DC Comics.
 &HT;    ``I don't know if the Marvel diehards have calmed down yet,''
Lee says of that last development. ``What I'm going to do is write
the DC characters _ Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Batman,
about a dozen of them _ as if they'd never been created.
 &HT;    ``It'll be as if I thought of a guy called Superman,'' Lee
explains. ``He won't necessarily be from Krypton and won't
necessarily be a reporter. I'm going to take it from scratch and
see what I'd do with him.
 &HT;    ``I may make one of the men a girl or make one of the people a
black man,'' he says. ``I'm free to do it any way I want. But I'm
not trying to set up a whole new series. I'm only doing one of each
_ what DC does after that is up to them.''
 &HT;    The first Lee-DC collaboration, featuring Wonder Woman, will hit
comic-book stores by year's end, with subsequent books out every
other month.
 &HT;    But anyone eager to see Lee's latest work doesn't need to wait _
just hop onto the Web and visit www.stanlee.net. There you'll
encounter Vendetta, Krog, Thunderer and the other heroes and
nasties who seek to control the universe in ``The 7th Portal.''
 &HT;    Launched in February, ``7th Portal'' runs in five-minute,
biweekly installments.
 &HT;    ``Each episode is getting better and better,'' Lee says. ``It's
a learning process for us. I didn't foresee the Internet, but I
will tell you now it's a certainty that the Internet will be the
greatest, most all-consuming, all-pervasive entertainment medium
the world has ever known.''
 &HT;    At the expense of comic books?
 &HT;    ``I don't think so,'' Lee replies. ``I think people, especially
young people, are always going to love reading a story on paper.
They love turning the pages, seeing full color, having little books
that you can roll up and put in your pocket, that you can share
with friends or collect.''
 &HT;    Besides, comic books are invaluable sources of material for
animated Saturday-morning television shows, live-action series and
feature films. The latest example is the big-screen production
``X-Men,'' directed by Bryan Singer and starring Patrick Stewart,
Ian McKellen, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin, among others.
 &HT;    ``I've not seen the movie yet,'' says Lee, who makes a quick
walk-on in the July 14 release, ``but Bryan is an incredibly
intelligent director and a dedicated one. I have to feel he's going
to put a certain amount of intelligence into this movie that'll
make it palatable not just to the comic book's fans, but to the
general audience.''
 &HT;    Numerous other films based on Marvel comic books loom on the
horizon. Among them is ``Spider-Man,'' to be directed by Sam Raimi,
as well as a ``Blade'' sequel, ``The Silver Surfer,'' ``The
Fantastic Four'' and a computer-generated ``The Incredible Hulk.''
 &HT;    And then there are Lee's more recent creations, who are also on
their way to the big screen.
 &HT;    ``You know Mark Canton, the producer who did `Batman,' `Men in
Black' and so forth?'' Lee says excitedly. ``He's here in my office
right now, and he's going to do a movie of `The 7th Portal.' It's
going to be a big-budget motion picture done by a guy who produces
the biggest of the big. I'm so thrilled I can't begin to tell
you.''
 &HT;    As if all that weren't enough, Lee and company are creating
original Internet adventures _ look for ``The Accuser'' and
``Lumina,'' not to mention ``The Backstreet Boys'' _ and readying a
newfangled Mighty Mouse. They're also involved in designing a ``7th
Portal'' ride for Paramount Parks.
 &HT;    Most men Lee's age _ he's 77 _ are heading for the golf courses,
recalling former glories or fretting about meeting the Grim Reaper.
Lee, however, says that he simply doesn't have time for such
thoughts.
 &HT;    ``I wouldn't dare die,'' he says. ``There's just too much
unfinished work here.''

`LOVE'S LABOUR'S' NOT UP TO BRANAGH'S OR THE BARD'S USUAL HIGH
STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B+  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone wandering into ``Love's Labour's Lost'' with high
expectations is probably in for a big disappointment. Kenneth
Branagh's fourth Shakespeare adaptation is neither a tour-de-force
like his ``Henry V'' and ``Much Ado About Nothing,'' nor is it an
eye-filling starfest like his shot-in-70mm ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a slight, whimsical version of one of the Bard's lesser,
least performed comedies, not very convincingly updated to 1939 and
goosed up with some broad comic effects and a series campy
production numbers featuring songs by such '30s tunesmiths as
George Gershwin, Cole Porter and Jerome Kern.
</P>
<P>
   It's never hugely engaging and it's instantly forgettable, but
it has a certain goofy charm, the language is always glorious and
generally well spoken, the musical numbers are enjoyably
choreographed, and it's mercifully brief _ at 93 minutes, probably
the shortest of all Shakespeare movies.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's plot has to do with the complications that ensue
when the King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his three best
friends (Matthew Lillard, Adrian Lester and Branagh) make a pact to
eschew wine, women and song so they can devote themselves to a
three-year campaign of non-stop meditation and study.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner do they take their oath than the beautiful Princess of
France (Alicia Silverstone) pops into the castle with her three
attendants (Natascha McElhone, Carmen Ejogo and Emily Mortimer) for
a lengthy visit. As each of the eight characters finds an
attractive partner, the guys' pact becomes very hard to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, bard of Avon or no, this is all about as profound
as a re-run of ``Love American Style.'' The reason that the lesser
Shakespeare plays are so infrequently performed is that they don't
hold up dramatically. It's ultimately boring to watch a bunch of
people standing around the stage endlessly gushing about how much
they love someone.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century update helps a bit, but not much. Branagh has
devised a cute '30s-style newsreel that bridges several of his
scenes nicely, but the Ruritanian setting clashes rather glaringly
with the text (the historical Kingdom of Navarre was in northern
Spain) and the added pre-WWII political background is basically
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the actors are attractive and marginally appealing, and
the language has its own power and momentum, even if the context is
so empty and uninvolving that it's easy to nod off and miss a good
deal of it. Branagh has one particularly moving speech about the
transforming power of love that's stirring enough to bring tears to
the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And Branagh's biggest gamble _ the '30s songs and Busby
Berkeley-like production numbers _ actually works. They may make
Shakespeare purists want to throw rocks at the movie, but they
perfectly counterpoint the play's sappy sensibility, and they offer
a regular fix of music and color. Frankly, I'd hate to sit through
this movie without them.
</P>
<P>
   Love's Labour's Lost. Directed and written by Kenneth Branagh.
Cast: Kenneth Branagh, Alicia Silverstone, Alessandro Nivola,
Natascha McElhone, Adrian Lester, Nathan Lane. Miramax. 93 minutes.
Rated PG.

 BEWARE OF SHRINKAGE WHEN JUMPING INTO HOLDRs  
 (Financial Commentary)  
 (Editors: Please note disclosure at end.)  
 By DAGEN McDOWELL   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When people talk about a shrinking investment, they
usually mean they're losing money. Merrill Lynch's HOLDRs are
giving an altogether new definition to that phrase.
</P>
<P>
   These baskets, which trade on the American Stock Exchange, all
start out with 20 stocks. But with mergers and acquisitions, stocks
can leave the portfolio and HOLDRs, by their very nature, will
never add new ones as replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine sector HOLDRs, four of them now have fewer than 20
stocks. And all the HOLDRs are less than a year old.
</P>
<P>
   For prospective and current owners of these portfolios, you
should know that you get a very concentrated basket of stocks that
can become more and more concentrated with age. Not only do these
mergers expose your HOLDRs to potentially greater volatility, the
tax consequences of these mergers and acquisitions might hurt, too.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, Merrill Lynch's HOLDRs are fixed portfolios
of 20 stocks that can be bought and sold just like stocks. They can
only be purchased in 100-share increments, or round lots, so they
are not exactly for the small investor.
</P>
<P>
   These baskets cover emerging, volatile sectors, like
business-to-business and Internet Infrastructure, and more
established areas like Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   They give you an easy way to buy a small basket of stocks with
one purchase. So, rather than paying 20 commissions to buy 20
stocks, you pay one commission to buy one security.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you actually own all the underlying stocks in the
portfolio and can redeem HOLDRs shares for the underlying stocks.
(That exercise can only be done in 100-share increments and costs
$10 per 100 shares, with the fees going to the HOLDRs trustee, Bank
of New York.)
</P>
<P>
   However, these are fixed, unmanaged baskets of stocks that don't
track well-known indexes, which continually replenish their stock
makeup. HOLDRs are concentrated at birth and can become even less
diversified as time goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to mergers and acquisitions, three of the existing HOLDRs
_ the Internet, Pharmaceutical and Internet Infrastructure baskets
_ now only have 19 stocks. The B2B, or Internet
business-to-business, HOLDRs portfolio only has 18 stocks. Future
transactions could reduce the number of stocks in other HOLDRs as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet HOLDRs basket now holds 19 stocks after the merger
of EarthLink and MindSpring earlier this year. (America Online as a
holding probably won't be affected by its merger with Time Warner.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmaceutical HOLDRs lost Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn when it merged
with Monsanto to become Pharmacia.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Infrastructure portfolio has one less stock
following VeriSign's acquisition of Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The B2B HOLDRs has 18 stocks since SBC Communications acquired
Sterling Commerce and Kana Communications acquired Silknet
Software.
</P>
<P>
   When these mergers and acquisitions occur, a stock might leave
the basket. But since you officially own every stock in the
portfolio, you'll receive your due as a shareholder in any company
that's being acquired. You'll get the appropriate amount of cash or
stock; it will just show up in your brokerage account.
</P>
<P>
   When SBC bought Sterling Commerce in an all-cash deal, B2B
owners got that money in their accounts. When Kana acquired
Silknet, the B2B basket only had one share of Silknet stock. Owners
of that HOLDR got 1.66 shares of Kana stock distributed to them for
every 100 shares of the B2B basket they held.
</P>
<P>
   If a company in one of the HOLDRs spins off a piece of itself to
the public, you'll also see those shares in your brokerage account.
For example, Hewlett-Packard, one of the stocks in the Internet
Architecture HOLDRs, spun off Agilent Technologies. For every share
of H-P, investors got 0.3814 shares of Agilent. For every 100
shares of the Internet Architecture basket you owned, you got 2.67
shares of Agilent in your account.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all this activity can also mean taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The federal income-tax laws treat owners of the HOLDRs as
directly owning the underlying securities. The HOLDRs will not
result in any federal tax consequences separate from the tax
consequences associated with the ownership of the underlying
securities, says each HOLDRs prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   The tax treatment of each merger or acquisition depends on how
the underlying issuer is treating it. You could end up paying
ordinary income or capital gains taxes depending on how each deal
is structured.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinkage issue is only going to become more apparent. Two
proposed transactions, if they get done, will reduce the stocks in
the Telecom HOLDRs.
</P>
<P>
   Brace yourself.
</P>
<P>
   A FULL MAILBOX
</P>
<P>
   Also prepare yourself for a deluge of mail if you own several of
the HOLDRs baskets. If you buy just one, you technically own each
and every stock in that basket. And you will get an annual report
from every company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I currently own some Telecom HOLDRs shares and previously
owned some Biotech shares for a short time,'' wrote reader John
Baycich. ``I received an annual report and proxy card for every
company in the HOLDRs. The mailman was not pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine the amount of mail you would get if you owned
four or five of these baskets?

<P>
   Disney doesn't merely dominate the world of animated features,
it literally controls the market, and decades of attempts by rival
studios have done little to ease the monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox is cagily targeting two audiences with ``Titan
A.E.,'' families looking for wholesome fare and techno-fans who
seek out anything science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Equal parts space-age Bible story, mythological quest and
old-fashioned space opera, it's an attempt to recapture the
zeitgeist of ``Star Wars'' with the limitless possibilities of
animation, polished up with glitzy computer-generated sequences and
paced at warp speed. But can it overcome the presumption that
animated features are simply long cartoons for kids?
</P>
<P>
   Set a thousand years in the future, in a galaxy where Earth has
been reduced to charcoal and humans are scattered cosmic castaways,
bitter orphan Cale (Matt Damon) shuns his own kind like lepers and
ekes out a living as a space age hard hat on a rough deep space
outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Hot-shot mercenary Captain Corso (Bill Pullman), a growling Han
Solo to this surly Luke Skywalker, hijacks him for a mission to
save what's left of mankind. Cale holds the secret to finding a
futuristic Noah's Ark called the Titan, a ship created by Cale's
father and sent into the far reaches of space.
</P>
<P>
   The glowing blue race of baddies known as the Drej, creatures of
pure energy who splintered the Earth 15 years earlier with their
crystalline Death Star, are also hunting Cale to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   Cale escapes an assassination attempt in a breakneck chase and
flirts with Corso's curvy, big-eyed, butt-kicking pilot Akima (Drew
Barrymore), an idealistic freedom fighter who breaks through his
shell of indifference and helps him discover his inner hero and
fulfill his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't any surprises in terms of the story, a throwback to
the same cliffhanger adventures and pulp sci-fi that inspired
``Star Wars,'' and the script suffers from flat stock characters
and a supporting cast of second fiddle alien types defined less by
personality than attitude and smart ass quips. But the appeal of
space opera is not drama but the spectacle and directors Don Bluth
and Gary Goldman deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The film navigates through magnificent spacescapes, intricately
designed colonies made of jury-rigged astral junk, and an ice field
where the giant floating crystals crash and shatter as ships play
hide and seek, going the asteroid scene of ``The Empire Strikes
Back'' one better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' packs spectacular imagery and high-energy action
in a tight 90 minutes and drives it a ripping pace. It moves so
fast you almost forget it the leaves characters in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   Titan A.E. Directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. Screenplay by
John August, Joss Whedon, Ben Edlund and Randall McCormick. Voice
cast: Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman, Nathan Lane, John
Leguizamo, Janeane Garofalo. 20th Century Fox. 90 minutes. Rated PG
for action violence, mild sensuality and brief language.

&HT;     LAND OF OPPORTUNITY FOUND ON THE GOLF COURSE

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Javier Sanchez still doesn't seem real.
Even after a 20-minute conversation, I consider him a work of
fiction, a character invented by the USGA to prove that golf really
and truly can belong to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez sneaked across the Mexican border 24 years ago, because
he believed that washing dishes in a San Francisco-area restaurant
could be the start of something big. He was 17, and he had grown up
on a farm without electricity, running water or neighbors _ unless
you counted the people 2 miles away. To go to school, he commuted
more than an hour each way on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is teeing off in his fifth U.S. Open, at one of the
most opulent resorts in the world. Children ride horses here, too,
but somehow it's not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was 21 when he picked up a golf club for the first time.
At the same age, Tiger Woods had won the Masters. He had
commercials on every television network. Sanchez didn't even know
that golf was on TV.
</P>
<P>
   His introduction to the game came totally by chance. He was on
his third job in the States, cooking in a restaurant, when his
bosses decided to take over the restaurant at the Palo Alto
Municipal Golf Course. That job led to another, with the grounds
crew, and his friends at the course told him that he should try the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I got some (used) clubs, a bag, and I used to go to the
driving range and not even hit a ball but just watch people
swing,'' he told a news conference this week. ``And later on, when
everybody kind of would leave, I kind of started imitating. And
then I started hitting the ball up in the air and fell in love with
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, that should have been the beginning of a lovely
hobby, not a new career. But Sanchez already had made a habit of
ignoring boundaries. He came to the States with a green card
``borrowed'' from another Mexican man for $50. His uncle drove him
across the border that night and told him not to say anything when
they showed the document to immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I couldn't say anything,'' Sanchez said, ``because
I couldn't speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned quickly and well. He has public-speaking skills that
elude most natives. He also has an immigrant's prodigious work
ethic, which helped him make the huge leap from dishwashing to
professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Pollex, an instructor at Palo Alto Municipal, gave him some
lessons, and he practiced a lot after his shift with the grounds
crew. Sanchez may be the most distinguished graduate of golfing
night school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to putt with the lights on the parking lot; they'd
shine on the putting green,'' he said. ``I used to play there until
9 or 10. And I put in a lot of hard work. Like I said, working hard
for me is not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   His life in Mexico had been much harder. Even at minimum wage,
he felt obliged to send money back to his parents, Bruno and
Rosario. They now live in Redwood City, barely two hours' drive
from this weekend's Open. Sanchez doesn't expect them to come to
the tournament, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know anything about golf,'' he said. ``I took them
out on a course and tried to explain, but they don't understand how
the score is kept or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the family, he said, never balked when he decided to turn
professional in 1990, at age 31. His friends, who understood golf,
thought he had gone around the dreamer's bend.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Sanchez had married an American woman (he is now
divorced and remarried) and become a citizen. He had succeeded as
an amateur golfer, but his first few years as a pro were bound to
be lean. And they were. His first year, playing in golf's version
of the minor leagues, he made about $14,000. He spent $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he couldn't get past the PGA qualifying school,
but he did start to make some money. He had moved to Georgia, where
some Atlanta lawyers befriended him and became his sponsors. He no
longer stays in the cheapest hotels. He says that, in his best
years, he makes about $70,000 to $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   In four trips to the U.S. Open, Sanchez has made the cut once,
finishing in a tie for 90th in 1996. He still hopes to make the PGA
Tour, at age 41. It seems unlikely, but why shouldn't Sanchez
believe? He left reality in the dust a long time ago.

 (For release Friday, June 16)  
(EDS: Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New
York Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is
Lived in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort
by a team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of
ordinary people and some of the troubling issues that Americans
continue to face. These stories, two or three each week, will be
approximately 6,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days. Please see

   TAR HEEL, N.C. _ It must have been 1 o'clock. That's when the
white man usually comes out of his glass office and stands on the
scaffolding above the factory floor. He stood with his palms on the
rails, his elbows out. He looked like a tower guard up there or a
border patrol agent. He stood with his head cocked.
</P>
<P>
   One o'clock means it is getting near the end of the workday.
Quota has to be met and the workload doubles. The conveyor belt
always overflows with meat around 1 o'clock. So the workers double
their pace, hacking pork from shoulder bones with a driven
single-mindedness. They stare blankly, like mules in blinders, as
the butchered slabs pass by.
</P>
<P>
   It is called the picnic line: 18 workers lined up on both sides
of a belt, carving meat from bone. Up to 16 million shoulders a
year come down that line here at Smithfield Packing Co., the
largest pork production plant in the world. That works out to about
32,000 a shift, 63 a minute, one every 17 seconds for each worker
for eight and a half hours a day. The first time you stare down at
that belt you know your body is going to give in way before the
machine ever will.
</P>
<P>
   On this day the boss saw something he didn't like. He climbed
down and approached the picnic line from behind. He leaned into the
ear of a broad-shouldered black man. He had been riding him all
day, and the day before. The boss bawled him out good this time,
but no one heard what was said. The roar of the machinery was too
ferocious for that. Still, everyone knew what was expected. They
worked harder.
</P>
<P>
   The white man stood and watched for the next two hours as the
blacks worked in their groups and the Mexicans in theirs. He stood
there with his head cocked.
</P>
<P>
   At shift change the black man walked away, hosed himself down
and turned in his knives. Then he let go. He threatened to murder
the boss. He promised to quit. He said he was losing his mind,
which made for good comedy, since he was standing near a conveyor
chain of severed hogs' heads, their mouths yoked open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who that cracker think he is?'' the black man wanted to know.
There were enough hogs, he said, ``not to worry about no fleck of
meat being left on the bone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep treating me like a Mexican and I'll beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   The boss walked by just then and the black man lowered his head.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GETS THE DIRTY JOBS
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you learn in the hog plant is the value of a
sharp knife. The second thing you learn is that you don't want to
work with a knife. Finally you learn that not everyone has to work
with a knife. Whites, blacks, American Indians and Mexicans, they
all have their separate stations.
</P>
<P>
   The few whites on the payroll tend to be mechanics or
supervisors. As for the Indians, a handful are supervisors; others
tend to get clean menial jobs like warehouse work. With few
exceptions, that leaves the blacks and Mexicans with the dirty jobs
at the factory, one of the only places within 50 miles in this
muddy corner of North Carolina where a person might make more than
$8 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   While Smithfield's profits nearly doubled in the past year,
wages have remained flat. So a lot of Americans here have quit and
a lot of Mexicans have been hired to take their places. But more
than management, the workers see one another as the problem, and
they see the competition in skin tones.
</P>
<P>
   The locker rooms are self-segregated and so is the cafeteria.
The enmity spills out into the towns. The races generally keep to
themselves. Along Interstate 95 there are four tumbledown bars, one
for each color: white, black, red and brown.
</P>
<P>
   Language is also a divider. There are English and Spanish lines
at the Social Security office and in the waiting rooms of the
county health clinics. This means that different groups don't
really understand one another and tend to be suspicious of what
they do know.
</P>
<P>
   You begin to understand these things the minute you apply for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   BLOOD AND BURNOUT
</P>
<P>
   ``Treat the meat like you going to eat it yourself,'' the hiring
manager told the 30 new employees, most of them down on their luck
and hungry for work. The Smithfield plant will take just about any
man or woman with a pulse and a sparkling urine sample, with few
questions asked. This reporter was hired using his own name and
acknowledged that he was currently employed, but was not asked
where and did not say.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughtering swine is repetitive, brutish work, so grueling that
three weeks on the factory floor leave no doubt in your mind about
why the turnover is 100 percent. Five thousand quit and five
thousand are hired every year. You hear people say, They don't kill
pigs in the plant, they kill people.
</P>
<P>
   So desperate is the company for workers, its recruiters comb the
streets of New York's immigrant communities, personnel staff
members say, and word of mouth has reached Mexico and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The company even procures criminals. Several at the morning
orientation were inmates on work release in green uniforms, bused
in from the county prison.
</P>
<P>
   The new workers were given a safety speech and tax papers, shown
a promotional video and informed that there was enough methane,
ammonia and chlorine at the plant to kill every living thing here
in Bladen County. Of the 30 new employees, the black women were
assigned to the chitterlings room, where they would scrape feces
and worms from intestines. The black men were sent to the
butchering floor. Two free white men and the Indian were given jobs
making boxes. This reporter declined a box job and ended up with
most of the Mexicans, doing knife work, cutting sides of pork into
small- er and smaller products.

</P>
<P>
   Standing in the hiring hall that morning, two women chatted in
Spanish about their pregnancies. A young black man had heard
enough. His small town the next county over was crowded with
Mexicans. They just started showing up three years ago _ drawn to
rural Robeson County by the plant _ and never left. They stood in
groups on the street corners, and the young black man never knew
what they were saying. They took the jobs and did them for less.
Some had houses in Mexico, while he lived in a trailer with his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now here he was, trying for the only job around, and he had to
listen to Spanish, had to compete with peasants. The world was
going to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is America and I want to start hearing some English,
now!'' he screamed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women told him where to stick his head and listen for
the echo. ``Then you'll hear some English,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An old white man with a face as pinched and lined as a pot roast
complained, ``The tacos are worse than the niggers,'' and the
Indian leaned against the wall and laughed. In the doorway, the
prisoners shifted from foot to foot, watching the spectacle unfold
from behind a cloud of cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring manager came out of his office and broke it up just
before things degenerated into a brawl. Then he handed out the
employment stubs. ``I don't want no problems,'' he warned. He told
them to report to the plant on Monday morning to collect their
carving knives.
</P>
<P>
   $7.70 AN HOUR, PAIN ALL DAY
</P>
<P>
   Monday. The mist rose from the swamps and by 4:45 a.m. thousands
of headlights snaked along the old country roads. Cars carried
people from the backwoods, from the single and doublewide trailers,
from the cinder-block houses and wooden shacks: whites from
Lumberton and Elizabethtown; blacks from Fairmont and Fayetteville;
Indians from Pembroke; the Mexicans from trailer parks in Red
Springs and St. Pauls.
</P>
<P>
   They converged at the Smithfield plant, a 973,000-square-foot
leviathan of pipe and steel near the Cape Fear River. The factory
towers over the tobacco and cotton fields, surrounded by pine trees
and a few of the old white-washed plantation houses. Built seven
years ago, it is by far the biggest employer in this region, 75
miles west of the Atlantic and 90 miles south of the booming
Research Triangle around Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The workers filed in, their faces stiffened by sleep and the
cold, like saucers of milk gone hard. They punched the clock at 5
a.m., waiting for the knives to be handed out, the chlorine freshly
applied by the cleaning crew burning their eyes and throats. Nobody
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   The hallway was a river of brown-skinned Mexicans. The six
prisoners who were starting that day looked confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell's going on?'' the only white inmate, Billy
Harwood, asked an older black worker named Wade Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Baker said, seeing that the prisoner was talking about
the hundreds of Mexicans. ``I see you been away for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Harwood had been away _ nearly seven years, for writing
phony payroll checks from the family pizza business to buy crack.
He was Rip Van Winkle standing there. Everywhere he looked there
were Mexicans. What he probably didn't know was that one out of
three newborns at the nearby Robeson County health clinic was a
Latino; that the county's Roman Catholic church had a special
Sunday Mass for Mexicans said by a Honduran priest; that the
schools needed Spanish speakers to teach English.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a month to go on his sentence, Harwood took the
pork job to save a few dollars. The word in jail was that the job
was a cakewalk for a white man.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't looking like any cakewalk. He wasn't going to
get a boxing job like a lot of other whites. Apparently inmates
were on the bottom rung, just like Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Harwood and the other prisoners were put on the picnic
line. Knife work pays $7.70 an hour to start. It is money
unimaginable in Mexico, where the average wage is $4 a day. But the
American money comes at a price. The work burns your muscles and
dulls your mind. Staring down into the meat for hours strains your
neck. After thousands of cuts a day your fingers no longer open
freely. Standing in the damp 42-degree air causes your knees to
lock, your nose to run, your teeth to throb.
</P>
<P>
   The whistle blows at 3, you get home by 4, pour peroxide on your
nicks by 5. You take pills for your pains and stand in a hot shower
trying to wash it all away. You hurt. And by 8 o'clock you're in
bed, exhausted, thinking of work.
</P>
<P>
   The convict said he felt cheated. He wasn't supposed to be doing
Mexican work. After his second day he was already talking of
quitting. ``Man, this can't be for real,'' he said, rubbing his
wrists as if they'd been in handcuffs. ``This job's for an ass.
They treat you like an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   He just might have quit after the third day had it not been for
Mercedes Fernandez, a Mexican. He took a place next to her by the
conveyor belt. She smiled at him, showed him how to make incisions.
That was the extent of his on-the-job training. He was peep-eyed,
missing a tooth and squat from the starchy prison food, but he
acted as if this tiny woman had taken a fancy to him. In truth, she
was more fascinated than infatuated, she later confided. In her
year at the plant, he was the first white person she had ever
worked with.
</P>
<P>
   The other workers noticed her helping the white man, so unusual
was it for a Mexican and a white to work shoulder to shoulder, to
try to talk or even to make eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   As for blacks, she avoided them. She was scared of them.
``Blacks don't want to work,'' Fernandez said when the new batch of
prisoners came to work on the line. ``They're lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the factory cuts people off from one another.
If it's not the language barrier, it's the noise _ the hammering of
compressors, the screeching of pulleys, the grinding of the lines.
You can hardly make your voice heard. To get another's attention on
the cut line, you bang the butt of your knife on the steel
railings, or you lob a chunk of meat. Fernandez would sometimes
throw a piece of shoulder at a friend across the conveyor and wave
good morning.

 TAR HEEL, N.C.: good morning.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE KILL FLOOR
</P>
<P>
   The kill floor sets the pace of the work. For those jobs, the
plant picks strong men and pays a top wage, as high as $12 an hour.
If the men fail to make quota, plenty of others are willing to try.
It is mostly the blacks who work the kill floor, the stone-hearted
jobs that pay more and appear out of bounds for all but a few
Mexicans. Plant workers gave various reasons for this: The Mexicans
are too small; they don't like blood; they don't like heavy
lifting; or just plain ``We built this country and we ain't going
to hand them everything,'' as one black man put it.
</P>
<P>
   Kill-floor work is hot, quick and bloody. The hog is herded in
from the stockyard, then stunned with an electric gun. It is lifted
onto a conveyor belt, dazed but not dead, and passed to a waiting
group of men wearing bloodstained smocks and blank faces. They slit
the neck, shackle the hind legs and watch a machine lift the
carcass into the air, letting its life flow out in a purple gush,
into a steaming collection trough.
</P>
<P>
   The carcass is run through a scalding bath, trolleyed over the
factory floor and then dumped onto a table with all the force of a
quarter-ton water balloon. In the misty-red room, men slit along
its hind tendons and skewer the beast with hooks. It is again
lifted and shot across the room on a pulley and bar, where it hangs
with hundreds of others as if in some kind of horrific dry-cleaning
shop. It is then pulled through a wall of flames and met on the
other side by more black men who, stripped to the waist beneath
their smocks, scrape away any straggling bristles.
</P>
<P>
   The place reeks of sweat and scared animal, steam and blood.
Nothing is wasted from these beasts, not the plasma, not the
glands, not the bones. Everything is used, and the kill men,
repeating slaughterhouse lore, say that even the squeal is sold to
Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   The carcasses sit in the freezer overnight and are then rolled
out to the cut floor.
</P>
<P>
   The cut floor is opposite to the kill floor in nearly every way.
The workers are mostly brown _ Mexicans _ not black; the lighting
yellow, not red. The vapor comes from cold breath, not hot water.
It is here that the hog is quartered. The pieces are parceled out
and sent along the disassembly lines to be cut into ribs, hams,
bellies, loins and chops.
</P>
<P>
   People on the cut lines work with a mindless fury. There is
tremendous pressure to keep the conveyor belts moving, to pack
orders, to put bacon and ham and sausage on the public's breakfast
table. There is no clock, no window, no fragment of the world
outside. Everything is pork. If the line fails to keep pace, the
kill men must slow down, backing up the slaughter. The boxing line
will have little to do, costing the company payroll hours. The
blacks who kill will become angry with the Mexicans who cut, who in
turn will become angry with the white superintendents who push
them.
</P>
<P>
   10,000 UNWELCOME MEXICANS
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans never push back. They cannot. Some have legitimate
work papers, but more, like Mercedes Fernandez, do not.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, Fernandez was several thousand dollars in debt to
the smugglers who had sneaked her and her family into the United
States. She owed $1,000 more for the authentic-looking birth
certificate and Social Security card that are needed to get hired.
She and her husband, Armando, expected to be in debt for years.
They had mouths to feed back home.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans are so frightened about being singled out that they
do not even tell one another their real names. They have their
given names, their work-paper names and ``Hey you,'' as their
American supervisors call them. In the telling of their stories,
Mercedes and Armando Fernandez insisted that their real names be
used, to protect their identities. It was their work names they did
not want used _ names bought in a back alley in Barstow, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely are the newcomers welcomed with open arms. Long before
the Mexicans arrived, Robeson County, one of the poorest in North
Carolina, was an uneasy racial mix. In the 1990 census, of the
100,000 people living in Robeson, nearly 40 percent were Lumbee
Indian, 35 percent white and 25 percent black. Until a dozen years
ago the county schools were de facto segregated, and no person of
color held any meaningful county job from sheriff to court clerk to
judge.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in 1988, two armed Indian men occupied the local
newspaper office, taking hostages and demanding that the sheriff's
department be investigated for corruption and its treatment of
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Indian lawyer, Julian Pierce, was killed that same
year, and the suspect turned up dead in a broom closet before he
could be charged. The hierarchy of power was summed up on a plaque
that hangs in the courthouse commemorating the dead of World War I.
It lists the veterans by color: ``white'' on top, ``Indian'' in the
middle and ``colored'' on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   That hierarchy mirrors the pecking order at the hog plant. The
Lumbees _ who have fought their way up in the county apparatus and
have built their own construction businesses _ are fond of saying
they are too smart to work in the factory. And the few who do work
there seem to end up with the cleaner jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But as reds and blacks began to make progress in the 1990s _ for
the first time an Indian sheriff was elected, and a black man is
now the public defender _ the Latinos began arriving. The U.S.
Census Bureau estimated that 1,000 Latinos were living in Robeson
County last year. People only laugh at that number.
</P>
<P>
   ``A thousand? Hell, there's more than that in the Wal-Mart on a
Saturday afternoon,'' said Bill Smith, director of county health
services. He and other officials guess that there are at least
10,000 Latinos in Robeson, most having arrived in the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they built that factory in Bladen, they promised a
trickledown effect,'' Smith said. ``But the money ain't trickling
down this way. Bladen got the money and Robeson got the social
problems.''

 TAR HEEL, N.C.: social problems.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Robeson there is the strain on public resources. There is the
substandard housing. There is the violence. Last year 27 killings
were committed in Robeson, mostly in the countryside, giving it a
higher murder rate than Newark, N.J., or Detroit. Three Mexicans
were robbed and killed last fall. Latinos have also been the
victims of highway stickups.
</P>
<P>
   In the yellow-walled break room at the plant, Mexicans talked
among themselves about their three slain men, about the midnight
visitors with obscured faces and guns, men who knew that the
illegal workers used mattresses rather than banks. Mercedes
Fernandez, like many Mexicans, would not venture out at night.
``Blacks have a problem,'' she said. ``They live in the past. They
are angry about slavery, so instead of working, they steal from
us.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband never lingered in the parking lot at shift
change. That is when the anger of a long day comes seeping out.
Cars get kicked and faces slapped over parking spots or fender
benders. The traffic is a serpent. Cars jockey for a spot in line
to make the quarter-mile crawl along the plant's one-lane exit road
to the highway. Usually no one will let you in. A lot of the
scuffling is between black and Mexican.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK AND BLEAK
</P>
<P>
   The meat was backing up on the conveyor and spilling onto the
floor. The supervisor climbed down off the scaffolding and chewed
out a group of black women. Something about skin being left on the
meat. There was a new skinner on the job, and the cutting line was
expected to take up his slack. The whole line groaned. First looks
flew, then people began hurling slurs at one another in Spanish and
English, words they could hardly hear over the factory's roar. The
black women started waving their knives at the Mexicans. The
Mexicans waved theirs back. The blades got close. One Mexican spit
at the blacks and was fired.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the knife scene, Wade Baker went home and sagged
in his recliner. CNN played. Good news on Wall Street, the
television said. Wages remained stable. ``Since when is the fact
that a man doesn't get paid good news?'' he asked the TV. The TV
told him that money was everywhere _ everywhere but here.
</P>
<P>
   Still lean at 51, Baker has seen life improve since his youth in
the Jim Crow South. You can say things. You can ride in a car with
a white woman. You can stay in the motels, eat in the restaurants.
The black man got off the white man's field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Socially, things are much better,'' Baker said wearily over
the droning television. ``But we're going backwards as black people
economically. For every one of us doing better, there's two of us
doing worse.''
</P>
<P>
   His town, Chad Bourne, is a dreary strip of peeling paint and
warped porches and houses as run down as rotting teeth. Young men
drift from the cinder-block pool hall to the empty streets and
back. In the center of town is a bank, a gas station, a chicken
shack and a motel. As you drive out, the lights get dimmer and the
homes older until eventually you're in a flat void of tobacco
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was standing on the main street with his grandson Monte
watching the Christmas parade march by when a scruffy man
approached. It was Baker's cousin, and he smelled of kerosene and
had dust in his hair as if he lived in a vacant building and warmed
himself with a portable heater. He asked for $2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic isn't it?'' Baker said as his cousin walked away
only eight bits richer. ``He was asking me the same thing 10 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of Mexicans stood across the street hanging around the
gas station watching them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around here always want to blame the system,'' he said.
``And it is true that the system is anti-black and anti-poor. It's
true that things are run by the whites. But being angry only means
you failed in life. Instead of complaining, you got to work twice
as hard and make do.''
</P>
<P>
   He stood quietly with his hands in his pockets watching the
parade go by. He watched the Mexicans across the street, laughing
in their new clothes. Then he said, almost as an afterthought,
``There's a day coming soon where the Mexicans are going to catch
hell from the blacks, the way the blacks caught it from the
whites.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade Baker used to work in the post office, until he lost his
job over drugs. When he came out of his haze a few years ago, there
wasn't much else for him but the plant. He took the job, he said,
``because I don't have a 401(k).'' He took it because he had
learned from his mother that you don't stand around with your head
down and your hand out waiting for another man to drop you a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Baker, bent and gray now, grew up a sharecropper, the
granddaughter of slaves. She was raised up in a tarpaper shack,
picked cotton and hoed tobacco for a white family. She supported
her three boys alone by cleaning white people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s something good started happening. There was a
labor shortage, just as there is now. The managers at the textile
plants started giving machine jobs to black people.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Baker was 40 then. ``I started at a dollar and 60 cents
an hour, and honey, that was a lot of money then,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The work was plentiful through the 1970s and '80s, and she was
able to save money and add on to her home. By the early '90s the
textile factories started moving away, to Mexico. Robeson County
has lost about a quarter of its jobs since that time.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Robeson hovers around 8 percent, twice the
national average. In neighboring Columbus County it is 10.8
percent. In Bladen County it is 5 percent, and Bladen has the pork
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baker believes that people who want to work can find
work. As far as he's concerned, there are too many shiftless young
men who ought to be working, even if it's in the pork plant. His
son-in-law once worked there, quit and now hangs around the gas
station where other young men sell dope.
</P>
<P>
   The son-in-law came over one day last fall and threatened to
cause trouble if the Bakers didn't let him borrow the car. This
could have turned messy; the 71-year-old Evelyn Baker keeps a .38
tucked in her bosom.
</P>
<P>
   When Wade Baker got home from the plant and heard from his
mother what had happened, he took up his pistol and went down to
the corner, looking for his son-in-law. He chased a couple of the
young men around the dark dusty lot, waving the gun. ``Hold still
so I can shoot one of you!'' he recalled having bellowed. ``That
would make the world a better place!''
</P>
<P>
   He scattered the men without firing. Later, sitting in his car
with his pistol on the seat and his hands between his knees, he
said, staring into the night: ``There's got to be more than this.
White people drive by and look at this and laugh.''

   LIVING IT, HATING IT
</P>
<P>
   Billy Harwood had been working at the plant 10 days when he was
released from the Robeson County Correctional Facility. He stood at
the prison gates in his work clothes with his belongings in a
plastic bag, waiting. A friend dropped him at the Salvation Army
shelter, but he decided it was too much like prison. Full of black
people. No leaving after 10 p.m. No smoking indoors. ``What you
doing here, white boy?'' they asked him.
</P>
<P>
   He fumbled with a cigarette outside the shelter. He wanted to
quit the plant. The work stinks, he said, ``but at least I ain't a
nigger. I'll find other work soon. I'm a white man.'' He had hopes
of landing a roofing job through a friend. The way he saw it, white
society looks out for itself.
</P>
<P>
   On the cut line he worked slowly and allowed Mercedes Fernandez
and the others to pick up his slack. He would cut only the left
shoulders; it was easier on his hands. Sometimes it would be three
minutes before a left shoulder came down the line. When he did cut,
he didn't clean the bone; he left chunks of meat on it.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes Fernandez was disappointed by her first experience with
a white person. After a week she tried to avoid standing by Billy
Harwood. She decided it wasn't just the blacks who were lazy, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the supervisor came by one morning, took a look at one
of Harwood's badly cut pork shoulders and threw it at Fernandez,
blaming her. He said obscene things about her family. She didn't
understand exactly what he said, but it scared her. She couldn't
wipe the tears from her eyes because her gloves were covered with
greasy shreds of swine. The other cutters kept their heads down,
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Her life was falling apart. She and her husband both worked the
cut floor. They never saw their daughter. They were 26 but rarely
made love anymore. All they wanted was to save enough money to put
plumbing in their house in Mexico and start a business there. They
come from the town of Tehuacan, in a rural area about 150 miles
southeast of Mexico City. His mother owns a bar there and a home
but gives nothing to them. Mother must look out for her old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to work so we have a chance to grow old in
Mexico,'' Mercedes Fernandez said one evening while cooking pork
and potatoes. Now they were into a smuggler for thousands. Her
hands stung while she worked and swelled into claws in the
evenings. She felt trapped. But she kept at it for the money, for
the $9.60 an hour. The smuggler still had to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   They explained their story this way: The coyote drove her and
her family from Barstow a year ago and left them in Robeson. They
knew no one. They did not even know they were in the state of North
Carolina. They found shelter in a trailer park that had once been
exclusively black but was rapidly filling with Mexicans. There was
a lot of drug dealing there and a lot of tension. One evening,
Armando Fernandez said, he asked a black neighbor to move his
business inside and the man pulled a pistol on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the blacks,'' Armando Fernandez said in Spanish,
sitting in the break room not 10 feet from Baker and his black
friends. Harwood was sitting two tables away with the whites and
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   After the gun incident, Armando Fernandez packed up his family
and moved out into the country, to a prefabricated number sitting
on a brick foundation off in the woods alone. Their only contact
with people is through the satellite dish. Except for the coyote.
The coyote knows where they live and comes for his money every
other month.
</P>
<P>
   Their 5-year-old daughter has no playmates in the back country
and few at school. That is the way her parents want it. ``We don't
want her to be American,'' her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   `WE NEED A UNION'
</P>
<P>
   The steel bars holding a row of hogs gave way as a woman stood
below them. Hog after hog fell around her with a sickening thud,
knocking her senseless, the connecting bars barely missing her
face. As co-workers rushed to help the woman, the supervisor spun
his hands in the air, a signal to keep working. Wade Baker saw this
and shook his head in disgust. Nothing stops the disassembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a union,'' he said later in the break room. It was
payday and he stared at his check: $288. He spoke softly to the
black workers sitting near him. Everyone is convinced that talk of
a union will get you fired. After two years at the factory, Baker
makes slightly more than $9 an hour toting meat away from the cut
line, slightly less than $20,000 a year, 45 cents an hour less than
Mercedes Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get racial about the Mexicans,'' he whispered
to the black workers. ``But they're dragging down the pay. It's
pure economics. They say Americans don't want to do the job. That
ain't exactly true. We don't want to do it for $8. Pay $15 and
we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   These men knew that in the late '70s, when the meat packing
industry was centered in northern cities like Chicago and Omaha,
people had a union getting them $18 an hour. But by the mid-1980s,
to cut costs, many of the packing houses had moved to small towns
where they could pay a lower, nonunion wage.
</P>
<P>
   The black men sitting around the table also felt sure that the
Mexicans pay almost nothing in income tax, claiming 8, 9, even 10
exemptions. The men believed that the illegal workers should be
rooted out of the factory. ``It's all about money,'' Baker said.

 TAR HEEL, N.C.: Baker said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His co-workers shook their heads. ``A plantation with a roof on
it,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, many of the Mexicans in Tar Heel fear that a
union would place their illegal status under scrutiny and force
them out. The United Food and Commercial Workers Union last tried
organizing the plant in 1997, but the idea was voted down nearly
2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the Americans refused to vote for the union was
because it refuses to take a stand on illegal laborers. Another
reason was the intimidation. When workers arrived at the plant the
morning of the vote, they were met by Bladen County deputy sheriffs
in riot gear. ``Nigger Lover'' had been scrawled on the union
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago the work force at the plant was 50 percent black,
20 percent white and Indian, and 30 percent Latino, according to
union statistics. Company officials say those numbers are about the
same today. But from inside the plant, the breakdown appears to be
more like 60 percent Latino, 30 percent black, 10 percent white and
red.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Buffkin, a white woman and the former director of
purchasing who testified before the National Labor Relations Board
in an unfair-labor-practice suit brought by the union in 1998, said
in an interview that the company assigns workers by race. She also
said that management had kept lists of union sympathizers during
the '97 election, firing blacks and replacing them with Latinos.
``I know because I fired at least 15 of them myself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company denies those accusations. Michael H. Cole, a lawyer
for Smithfield who would respond to questions about the company's
labor practices only in writing, said that jobs at the Tar Heel
plant were awarded through a bidding process and not assigned by
race. The company also denies ever having kept lists of union
sympathizers or singlling out blacks to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   The hog business is important to North Carolina. It is a
multibillion-dollar-a-year industry in the state, with nearly two
pigs for every one of its 7.5 million people. And Smithfield Foods,
a publicly traded company based in Smithfield, Va., has become the
No. 1 producer and processor of pork in the world. It slaughters
more than 20 percent of the nation's swine, more than 19 million
animals a year.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has acquired a network of factory farms and
slaughterhouses, worries federal agriculture officials and
legislators,who see it siphoning business from smaller farmers. And
environmentalists contend that Smithfield's operations contaminate
local water supplies. (The Environmental Protection Agency fined
the company $12.6 million in 1996 after its processing plants in
Virginia discharged pollutants into the Pagan River.) The chairman
and chief executive, Joseph W. Luter III, declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Smithfield's employment practices have not been so closely
scrutinized. And so every year, more Mexicans get hired. ``An
illegal alien isn't going to complain all that much,'' said Ed
Tomlinson, acting supervisor of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service bureau in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   But the company says it does not knowingly hire illegal aliens.
Smithfield's lawyer, Cole, said all new employees must present
papers showing that they can legally work in the United States.
``If any employee's documentation appears to be genuine and to
belong to the person presenting it,'' he said in his written
response, ``Smithfield is required by law to take it at face
value.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS _ which has only 18 agents in North Carolina _ has not
investigated Smithfield because no one has filed a complaint,
Tomlinson said. ``There are more jobs than people,'' he said, ``and
a lot of Americans will do the dirty work for a while and then
return to their couches and eat bonbons and watch Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT FIT FOR A CONVICT
</P>
<P>
   When Billy Harwood was in solitary confinement, he liked a book
to get him through. A guard would come around with a cartful. But
when the prisoner asked for a new book, the guard, before handing
it to him, liked to tear out the last 50 pages. The guard was a
real funny guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got good at making up my own endings,'' Harwood said during
a break. ``And  &UR; my &LR;  book don't end standing here. I ought to be on
that roof any day now.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few days later, he found out that the white contractor he
was counting on already had a full roofing crew. They were Mexicans
who were working for less than he was making at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   During his third week cutting hogs, he got a new supervisor _ a
black woman. Right away she didn't like his work ethic. He went too
slow. He cut out to the bathroom too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a bladder infection?'' she asked, standing in his spot
when he returned. She forbade him to use the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   He boiled. Mercedes Fernandez kept her head down. She was
certain of it, she said: he was the laziest man she had ever met.
She stood next to a black man now, a prisoner from the north. They
called him K.T. and he was nice to her. He tried Spanish, and he
worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   When the paychecks were brought around at lunch time on Friday,
Harwood got paid for five hours less than everyone else, even
though everyone punched out on the same clock. The supervisor had
docked him.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners mocked him. ``You might be white,'' K.T. said,
``but you came in wearing prison greens and that makes you good as
a nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The ending wasn't turning out the way Harwood had written it: no
place to live and a job not fit for a donkey. He quit and took the
Greyhound back to his parents' trailer in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   When Mercedes Fernandez came to work the next day, a Mexican guy
going by the name of Alfredo was standing in Billy Harwood's spot.

<P>
   TAR HEEL, N.C. _ It must have been 1 o'clock. That's when the
white man usually comes out of his glass office and stands on the
scaffolding above the factory floor. He stood with his palms on the
rails, his elbows out. He looked like a tower guard up there or a
border patrol agent. He stood with his head cocked.
</P>
<P>
   One o'clock means it is near the end of the workday. Quota has
to be met and the workload doubles. The conveyor belt always
overflows with meat around 1 p.m. So the workers double their pace,
hacking pork from shoulder bones with a driven single-mindedness.
They stare blankly as the butchered slabs pass by.
</P>
<P>
   It is called the picnic line: 18 workers lined up on both sides
of a belt, carving meat from bone. Up to 16 million shoulders a
year come down that line here at Smithfield Packing Co., the
largest pork production plant in the world. That works out to about
32,000 a shift, 63 a minute, one every 17 seconds for each worker
for eight and a half hours a day. The first time you stare down at
that belt you know your body is going to give in way before the
machine ever will.
</P>
<P>
   On this day the boss saw something he didn't like. He climbed
down and approached the picnic line. He leaned into the ear of a
broad-shouldered black man. He had been riding him all day, and the
day before. The boss bawled him out good this time, but no one
heard what was said, due to the roar of the machinery. Still,
everyone knew what was expected. They worked harder.
</P>
<P>
   At shift change the black man walked away, hosed himself down
and turned in his knives. Then he let go. He threatened to murder
the boss. He promised to quit. He said he was losing his mind,
which made for good comedy, since he was standing near a conveyor
chain of severed hogs' heads, their mouths yoked open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who that cracker think he is?'' the black man raged. There
were enough hogs, he said, ``not to worry about no fleck of meat
being left on the bone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep treating me like a Mexican and I'll beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   The boss walked by just then and the black man lowered his head.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GETS THE DIRTY JOBS
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you learn in the hog plant is the value of a
sharp knife. The second thing you learn is that you don't want to
work with a knife. Finally you learn that not everyone has to work
with a knife. Whites, blacks, American Indians and Mexicans, they
all have their separate stations.
</P>
<P>
   The few whites on the payroll tend to be mechanics or
supervisors. As for the Indians, a handful are supervisors; others
tend to get clean menial jobs like warehouse work. With few
exceptions, that leaves the blacks and Mexicans with the dirty jobs
at the factory, one of the only places within 50 miles in this
muddy corner of North Carolina where a person might make more than
$8 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   While Smithfield's profits nearly doubled in the past year,
wages have remained flat. So a lot of Americans here have quit and
a lot of Mexicans have been hired to take their places. But more
than management, the workers see one another as the problem, and
they see the competition in skin tones.
</P>
<P>
   The locker rooms are self-segregated and so is the cafeteria.
The enmity spills out into the towns. The races generally keep to
themselves. Along Interstate 95 there are four tumbledown bars, one
for each color: white, black, red and brown.
</P>
<P>
   BLOOD AND BURNOUT
</P>
<P>
   The Smithfield plant will take just about anyone with a pulse
and a sparkling urine sample, with few questions asked. This
reporter was hired using his own name and acknowledged that he was
currently employed but was not asked where and did not say.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughtering swine is repetitive, brutish work, so grueling that
the turnover is 100 percent. Five thousand quit and five thousand
are hired every year.
</P>
<P>
   So desperate is the company for workers, its recruiters comb the
streets of New York's immigrant communities, say personnel staff
members, and word of mouth has reached Mexico and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The company even procures criminals. Several at one morning
orientation for 30 new workers were inmates on work release in
green uniforms, bused in from the county prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 new employees, the black women were assigned to the
chitterlings room, where they would scrape feces and worms from
intestines. The black men were sent to the butchering floor. Two
free white men and the Indian were given jobs making boxes. This
reporter declined a box job and ended up with most of the Mexicans,
doing knife work, cutting sides of pork into small- er and smaller
products.
</P>
<P>
   In the hiring hall that morning, two women chatted in Spanish
about their pregnancies. A young black man had heard enough. His
small town in nearby Robeson County was crowded with Mexicans. They
just started showing up three years ago _ drawn by the plant _ and
never left. They stood in groups on the street corners, and the
young black man never knew what they were saying. They took the
jobs and did them for less. Some had houses in Mexico, while he
lived in a trailer with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now here he was, trying for the only job around, and he had to
listen to Spanish, had to compete with peasants. The world was
going to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is America and I want to start hearing some English,
now!'' he screamed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women told him where to stick his head and listen for
the echo. ``Then you'll hear some English,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   $7.70 AN HOUR, PAIN ALL DAY
</P>
<P>
   Monday. By 4:45 a.m. thousands of headlights snaked along the
old country roads. Cars carried people from the backwoods, from the
single and doublewide trailers, from the cinder-block houses and
wooden shacks: whites from Lumberton and Elizabethtown; blacks from
Fairmont and Fayetteville; Indians from Pembroke; the Mexicans from
trailer parks in Red Springs and St. Pauls.
</P>
<P>
   They converged at the Smithfield plant, a 973,000-square-foot
leviathan of pipe and steel in Bladen County near the Cape Fear
River. Built seven years ago, it is the biggest employer in this
region, 90 miles south of the booming Research Triangle around
Chapel Hill.

</P>
<P>
   The workers punched the clock at 5 a.m., waiting for the knives
to be handed out, the chlorine freshly applied by the cleaning crew
burning their eyes and throats. Nobody spoke.
</P>
<P>
   The hallway was a river of brown-skinned Mexicans. The six
prisoners who were starting that day looked confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell's going on?'' said the only white inmate, Billy
Harwood, to an older black worker named Wade Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Baker said, seeing that the prisoner was talking about
the hundreds of Mexicans. ``I see you been away for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Harwood had been away _ nearly seven years, for writing phony
payroll checks from the family pizza business to buy crack. He was
Rip Van Winkle standing there. Everywhere he looked there were
Mexicans. What he probably didn't know was that one out of three
newborns at the nearby Robeson County health clinic was a Latino;
that the county's Roman Catholic church had a special Sunday Mass
for Mexicans; that the schools needed Spanish speakers to teach
English.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a month to go on his sentence, Harwood took the
pork job to save a few dollars. The word in jail was that the job
was a cakewalk for a white man.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't looking like any cakewalk. He wasn't going to
get a boxing job like a lot of other whites. Apparently inmates
were on the bottom rung, just like Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Harwood and the other prisoners were put on the picnic line.
Knife work pays $7.70 an hour to start. It is money unimaginable in
Mexico, where the average wage is $4 a day. But the American money
comes at a price. The work burns your muscles and dulls your mind.
Staring down into the meat for hours strains your neck. After
thousands of cuts a day your fingers no longer open freely.
Standing in the damp 42-degree air causes your knees to lock, your
nose to run, your teeth to throb.
</P>
<P>
   Harwood said he felt cheated. He wasn't supposed to be doing
Mexican work. After his second day he was already talking of
quitting.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, he took a place next to Mercedes Fernandez, a
Mexican, by the conveyor belt. She smiled at him, showed him how to
make incisions. That was the extent of his on-the-job training.
</P>
<P>
   Harwood acted as if Fernandez had taken a fancy to him, but in
truth, she was more fascinated than infatuated. In her year at the
plant, he was the first white person she had ever worked with.
</P>
<P>
   As for blacks, she avoided them. She was scared of them.
``Blacks don't want to work,'' Fernandez said when the new batch of
prisoners came to work on the line. ``They're lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   THE KILL FLOOR
</P>
<P>
   The kill floor sets the pace of the work. For those jobs, the
plant picks strong men and pays a top wage, as high as $12 an hour.
It is mostly blacks who work the kill floor, the stone-hearted jobs
that pay more and appear out of bounds for all but a few Mexicans.
Plant workers gave various reasons for this: The Mexicans are too
small; they don't like blood; they don't like heavy lifting; or
just plain ``We built this country and we ain't going to hand them
everything,'' as one black man put it.
</P>
<P>
   Kill-floor work is hot, quick and bloody. The hog is herded in,
then stunned with an electric gun. Dazed but not dead, it is passed
to a group of men wearing bloodstained smocks and blank faces. They
slit the neck, shackle the hind legs and watch a machine lift the
carcass into the air, letting its life flow out in a purple gush,
into a steaming collection trough.
</P>
<P>
   The carcass is run through a scalding bath, trolleyed over the
factory floor and then dumped onto a table. In the misty-red room,
men slit along its hind tendons and skewer the beast with hooks.
The hog is shot across the room on a pulley and bar, where it hangs
with hundreds of others. It is then pulled through flames and met
on the other side by more black men who scrape away any straggling
bristles.
</P>
<P>
   The carcasses sit in the freezer overnight and are then rolled
out to the cut floor, which is the opposite of the kill floor in
nearly every way. The workers are mostly Mexicans, not blacks. The
lighting is yellow, not red. The vapor comes from cold breath, not
hot water.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that the hog is quartered. The pieces are parceled
out and sent along the disassembly lines to be cut into ribs, hams,
bellies, loins and chops. Nothing is wasted from these beasts, not
the plasma, not the glands, not the bones. Everything is used, and
the kill men, repeating slaughterhouse lore, say that even the
squeal is sold to Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   People on the cut lines work with a mindless fury. There is
tremendous pressure to keep the conveyor belts moving. If the line
fails to keep pace, the kill men must slow down, backing up the
slaughter. The boxing line will have little to do, costing the
company payroll hours. The blacks who kill will become angry with
the Mexicans who cut, who in turn will become angry with the white
superintendents who push them.
</P>
<P>
   10,000 UNWELCOME MEXICANS
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans never push back. They cannot. Some have legitimate
work papers, but more, like Mercedes Fernandez, do not.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, Fernandez was several thousand dollars in debt to
the smugglers who had sneaked her and her family into the United
States. She owed $1,000 more for the authentic-looking birth
certificate and Social Security card that are needed to get hired.
She and her husband, Armando, expected to be in debt for years.
</P>
<P>
   Robeson County, one of the poorest in North Carolina, was an
uneasy racial mix even before the Mexicans arrived. In the 1990
census, of the 100,000 people living in Robeson, nearly 40 percent
were Lumbee Indian, 35 percent white and 25 percent black. Until a
dozen years ago the county schools were de facto segregated, and no
person of color held any meaningful county job.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumbees _ who have fought their way up in the county
apparatus and have built their own construction businesses _ are
fond of saying they are too smart to work in the factory. And the
few who do work there seem to end up with the cleaner jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But as reds and blacks began to make progress in the 1990s, the
Latinos began arriving. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 1,000
Latinos were living in Robeson County last year. But some people
laugh at this number as being ridiculously low.
</P>
<P>
   In Robeson there is the strain on public resources. There is the
substandard housing. There is the violence. Last year 27 killings
were committed in Robeson. Three Mexicans were robbed and killed
last fall. Latinos have also been the victims of highway stickups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks have a problem,'' said Mercedes Fernandez. ``They live
in the past. They are angry about slavery, so instead of working,
they steal from us.''

   BLACK AND BLEAK
</P>
<P>
   There was a new skinner on the job, and the cutting line was
expected to take up his slack. The whole line groaned. First looks
flew, then people began hurling slurs at one another in Spanish and
English, words they could hardly hear over the factory's roar.
</P>
<P>
   The black women started waving their knives at the Mexicans. The
Mexicans waved theirs back. The blades got close. One Mexican spit
at the blacks and was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Baker, 51, has seen life improve since his youth in the Jim
Crow South. ``Socially, things are much better,'' Baker said. ``But
we're going backwards as black people economically. For every one
of us doing better, there's two of us doing worse.''
</P>
<P>
   His town, Chad Bourne, is a dreary strip of peeling paint and
warped porches and houses as run-down as rotting teeth. Young men
drift from the cinder-block pool hall to the empty streets and
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around here always want to blame the system,'' Baker
said as he stood on the main street. ``And it is true that the
system is anti-black and anti-poor. It's true that things are run
by the whites. But being angry only means you failed in life.
Instead of complaining, you got to work twice as hard and make
do.''
</P>
<P>
   He watched a group of Mexicans across the street, laughing in
their new clothes. Then he said, ``There's a day coming soon where
the Mexicans are going to catch hell from the blacks, the way the
blacks caught it from the whites.''
</P>
<P>
   After Baker lost a postal job due to drug problems, which he
later overcame, there wasn't much else for him but the plant.
</P>
<P>
   His 71-year-old mother, Evelyn Baker, grew up a sharecropper,
the granddaughter of slaves. She was raised in a tarpaper shack,
picked cotton and hoed tobacco for a white family. She supported
her three boys alone by cleaning white people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s something good started happening. There was a
labor shortage, just as there is now. The textile plants started
giving machine jobs to blacks. The work was plentiful through the
'80s, and Mrs. Baker was able to save money and add on to her home.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '90s the textile factories started moving away, to
Mexico. Robeson County has lost about a quarter of its jobs since
that time.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Robeson hovers around 8 percent, more than twice
the national average. In neighboring Columbus County it is 10.8
percent. In Bladen County it is 5 percent, and Bladen has the pork
factory.
</P>
<P>
   LIVING IT, HATING IT
</P>
<P>
   Billy Harwood had been working at the plant 10 days when he was
released from the Robeson County Correctional Facility.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to quit the plant. The work stinks, he said, ``but at
least I ain't a nigger. I'll find other work soon. I'm a white
man.''
</P>
<P>
   He had hopes of landing a roofing job through a friend. The way
he saw it, white society looks out for itself.
</P>
<P>
   On the cut line he worked slowly and allowed Mercedes Fernandez
and the others to pick up his slack. He would cut only the left
shoulders; it was easier on his hands. Sometimes it would be three
minutes before a left shoulder came down the line. When he did cut,
he didn't clean the bone; he left chunks of meat on it.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez was disappointed by her first experience with a white
person. After a week she tried to avoid standing by Harwood. She
decided it wasn't just the blacks who were lazy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband both worked the cut floor. They never saw
their five-year-old daughter. They were 26 but rarely made love
anymore. All they wanted was to save enough money to put plumbing
in their house in Tehuacan, in a rural area about 150 miles
southeast of Mexico City, and start a business there. But now they
owed a smuggler thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez's hands stung while she worked and swelled into claws
in the evenings. But she kept at it for the money, for the $9.60 an
hour. The smuggler still had to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   `WE NEED A UNION'
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a union,'' said Wade Baker in the break room. It was
payday and he stared at his check: $288. He spoke softly to the
black workers sitting near him. Everyone is convinced that talk of
a union will get you fired.
</P>
<P>
   After two years at the factory, Baker makes slightly more than
$9 an hour toting meat away from the cut line, slightly less than
$20,000 a year, 45 cents an hour less than Mercedes Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get racial about the Mexicans,'' he whispered
to the black workers. ``But they're dragging down the pay. It's
pure economics. They say Americans don't want to do the job. That
ain't exactly true. We don't want to do it for $8. Pay $15 and
we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   These men knew that in the late '70s when the meat packing
industry was centered in northern cities like Chicago and Omaha,
people had a union getting them $18 an hour. But by the mid-1980s,
to cut costs, many of the packing houses had moved to small towns
where they could pay a lower, nonunion wage.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Mexicans in Tar Heel fear that a union would place
their illegal status under scrutiny and force them out. The United
Food and Commercial Workers Union last tried organizing the plant
in 1997, but the idea was voted down nearly 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Smithfield says it does not knowingly hire illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   NOT FIT FOR A CONVICT
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Harwood learned that the white contractor he
was counting on already had a full roofing crew. They were Mexicans
who were working for less than he was making at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   During his third week cutting hogs, he got a new supervisor _ a
black woman. Right away she didn't like his work ethic. He went too
slow. He cut out to the bathroom too much.
</P>
<P>
   He boiled. Mercedes Fernandez kept her head down. She was
certain of it, she said: he was the laziest man she had ever met.
She stood next to a black man now, a prisoner from the north. They
called him K.T. and he was nice to her. He tried Spanish, and he
worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   When the paychecks were distributed on Friday, Harwood got paid
for five hours less than everyone else, even though everyone
punched out on the same clock. The supervisor had docked him.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners mocked him. ``You might be white,'' said K.T.,
``but you came in wearing prison greens and that makes you good as
a nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Harwood quit and took the Greyhound back to his parents' trailer
in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   When Mercedes Fernandez came to work the next day, a Mexican was
standing in Billy Harwood's spot.

`BIOGRAPHY': THE LIFE OF SAM PHILLIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Broadcast notes follow first review. Time, channel are for New
York area. Check local listings.) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The photograph, taken in 1956, is an icon of American pop music
history. Four young men are gathered around a piano in a simple
recording studio. Struggle, success and bitter disappointment lay
ahead for all of them. At that moment, though, they shared raw
talent, buckets of hope and Sam Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips _ just out of camera range that night in his Sun
Records studio in Memphis _ had orchestrated the publicity shot
just as he had organized the early careers of the four young men:
Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley. By
1956 Elvis had already graduated from Phillips' limited orbit, as
the others were soon to do.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, the biggest Sun star of that moment, had been making a
record that day, with Lewis playing backup piano. When Elvis
dropped by, Phillips, ever the quick-thinking promoter, first
summoned Cash, then called a newspaper, requesting a photographer
and reporter, who dubbed the group the Million-Dollar Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a moment, four men noodling around with songs they
all knew, hymns mostly. Then, like Phillips' time of great
influence, it was over. But that time is worth remembering. And
it's done particularly well in the documentary ``Sam Phillips: The
Man Who Invented Rock 'n' Roll,'' which A&AMP;E is offering on Sunday
night under its ``Biography'' banner.
</P>
<P>
   The film _ written by the rock historian Peter Guralnick and
directed by Morgan Neville _ is filled with the sounds of Phillips'
America: generous samples of gospel, country music and early rock.
And it's filled with the sound of Phillips, still going strong and
looking amazingly youthful well into his 70s. ``Nobody knows more
about sound than me,'' he proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, at age 27, Phillips, an Alabama native who had become a
Memphis radio personality, opened his studio as a sideline. He
began recording black Southern musicians, including the bluesmen
B.B. King and Howlin' Wolf, for established record companies. A
group called Jackie Brentson and His Delta Cats, including a young
Ike Turner on piano, brought Phillips a hard-driving rhythm tune
called ``Rocket 88.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, was that what I was looking for,'' Phillips says,
recalling how he marveled at ``the force that was in that thing.''
Today ``Rocket 88'' is widely regarded as the first rock 'n' roll
record. Phillips may not have invented it, but he had the sense to
package it, and soon he was selling it under his own label, too.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first Sun hits was ``Just Walking in the Rain''
(1953), recorded by Johnny Bragg and the Prisonaires, inmates at
the Tennessee State Penitentiary. (The tune was later covered by
white artists like Johnnie Ray.) The scene of the hulking Bragg,
standing now in the rusting ruins of his old cellblock singing his
song with an expression of ultimate bliss, is unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Everything changed _ everything _ in '53 when a 19-year-old
Elvis Presley walked into the Sun studio asking to make a record as
a birthday gift for his mother. Phillips' employees told the boss
about this ``white boy with a Negro sound.'' You know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips began promoting other white artists, Roy Orbison and
Charlie Rich among them. But there was only one Elvis, and after
releasing his first five records, Phillips released Elvis, selling
his contract to RCA for $35,000. His canny investments set him up
for life. But his moment was over. Today he runs a string of radio
stations and happily wallows in the role of rock patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   The film assembles a roster of performers and former staff
members, all of whom say they're glad their lives were touched by
the ebullient Phillips. ``I kind of think of Memphis as the Emerald
City,'' says Jack Clement, a Sun producer, ``the Emerald City of
rock 'n' roll at least. And that could make Sam the Wizard of Oz.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   `DEADLOCKED': OVERWROUGHT, YET SATISFYING
</P>
<P>
   ``Deadlocked'' (8 p.m. Sunday on TNT) gives Charles Dutton a
chance to build a head of steam, progressing from regret to anger
to a rage of Vesuvian proportions. He takes the viewer with him on
this journey, and if he is lustily chewing the scenery by the
film's climax, you may be ready to offer him another helping.
Although nothing else in the production is quite up to the level of
Dutton's affecting performance, the drama succeeds, at least by the
flexible standards of the made-for-television movie.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton plays Jacob Doyle, a retired corrections officer whose
son, Demond (Jo D. Jonz), has just been convicted of a brutal rape
and murder. Ned Stark (David Caruso) successfully prosecuted the
case, but that took no particular effort. The white victim was
found dead in her husband's office; DNA tests showed that she had
had sex with Demond, a black former gang member and petty criminal,
who refuses to say a word in his own defense.
</P>
<P>
   The final matter of business before the jury is consideration of
the death penalty. Jacob has come to court to beg for his son's
life, maintaining, despite the evidence, that Demond is the victim
of a system that discriminates by race and class. Jacob starts
meekly, but when he realizes the futility of his words, he pulls
out two pistols and starts firing. His ear bleeding from a court
officer's return fire, Jacob herds Demond, the jurors and the dead
woman's husband into the jury room and demands to see Ned.
</P>
<P>
   When Jacob declares to Ned, ``I'm the father that made the boy
you convicted,'' Dutton manages to make Jacob an overwhelmingly
sympathetic character. When he gives Ned 24 hours to find evidence
that will free Demond, and Ned agrees, you can't help rooting for
them.
</P>
<P>
   When the film, directed by Michael Watkins from a script by
David Rosenfelt and Erik Jendresen, moves beyond the unbearably
tense jury room, it sometimes feels like an episode of some generic
crime series. The latter part of the story depends on some turns
that you will probably see coming, even as they test credibility to
the breaking point. And the plot's overwrought conclusion is the
kind of smokescreen that covers a hasty retreat. Still, Dutton
leaves you satisfied, even after the smoke clears.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal regulators are set to give their blessing to
the planned merger of Bell Atlantic and Irving, Texas-based GTE,
creating the largest local phone company in the country, the
Washington Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, four of the five commissioners on the
Federal Communications Commission indicated Wednesday that they
would support the deal. The anticipated merger was announced two
years ago. A decision could come as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, which will be called Verizon
Communications, would control about 63 million telephone lines in
31 states, approximately one-third of the total lines in the United
States. The deal will add GTE's 4 million wireless customers to
Verizon Wireless, the venture formed last year by New York-based
Bell Atlantic and Britain's Vodafone AirTouch, which is already the
nation's largest wireless operator.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will have a market capitalization of close
to $150 billion, with $60 billion in revenue, while employing
260,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic closed Wednesday at 57 3/8, up 1 15/16, while GTE
was flat at 68 3/4.

   A RESEMBLANCE? IT'S ONLY NATURAL
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sunshine,'' the family saga by the Hungarian filmmaker
Istvan Szabo that opened in New York last Friday, the actresses
Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris play the same character at two
different stages in her life. Ehle is the young, rebellious Valerie
Sonnenschein, who marries her cousin Ignatz (Ralph Fiennes) in the
twilight years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; Harris is the mature
Valerie, who survives both the death camps of World War II and the
Stalinist repression of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   It's a smooth transition, made smoother by the fact that Ehle is
Harris' daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it twice, actually,'' Harris said in the Upper East
Side apartment that serves as the family pied-a-terre in New York
City (home base is North Carolina, where Harris' husband, the
novelist John Ehle, was raised). ``The first time was `The Camomile
Lawn,' a lovely British television series that Sir Peter Hall
directed,'' Harris said. ``He chose Jennifer for the bulk of the
story. I think there were seven episodes, and she was in six of
them. But the last one jumped to 40 years later when the survivors
from World War II met at a funeral, and Jennifer's was one of the
surviving characters. And Peter Hall asked me if I would be
Jennifer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to be riding on her coattails a lot,'' said Harris of
her daughter, who won a Tony Award this month for her performance
in ``The Real Thing'' _ thus beating out her mother, who had been
nominated for her role in ``Waiting in the Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris added: ``When Ralph and Istvan were talking about
casting, apparently, as Jennifer explained it to me the other day,
Ralph said, `Well, I know an actress who would be right for the
older Valerie,' and Istvan said, `Well, I've seen a girl who I
think should play the younger Valerie.' And then by chance they put
the two pieces together and said, `Well, isn't that a funny thing _
they're mother and daughter.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Jennifer, `Should we sit down and talk about it?'
and she said, `Oh, no _ do you think we should?' I said, `No, if we
don't know each other pretty well by now, nobody knows us better
than we do.' I didn't watch any film clips of her performance. I
knew with `Sunshine' she would be playing from her own personality,
so we didn't discuss it too deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the great figures of the London and New York stage, whose
lengthy resume includes Laurence Olivier's legendary 1963 ``Uncle
Vanya'' and her own Tony for the original 1966 production of ``A
Lion in Winter,'' Harris has been mysteriously neglected by the
cinema. ``I've never played a really big part in a movie,'' she
said. ``I think it would be lovely to go in every day and, like
threading beads on a string, to gradually let your part grow, like
one does in the theater. But so far, I've not been offered a part
that was more than a few scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say I feel more at home on the stage, partly because
of the text _ you get a bigger lump to grab hold of. I jokingly
said once I was like an animal that had evolved: I've grown gills
for the stage; I breathe in a different way. I am in my element, my
own element, when I'm on the stage. I'm in a slightly different
element when I'm in a film.''
</P>
<P>
   RUTHLESS BUT DEADPAN
</P>
<P>
   Although he appeared in only nine episodes, Patrick Warburton
will forever be associated with ``Seinfeld'': the 6-foot-3-inch,
broad-shouldered actor played David Puddy, the massively impassive
boyfriend of Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Warburton plays a very
different character in ``The Woman Chaser,'' an independent feature
adapted by the first-time filmmaker Robinson Devor from a neglected
pulp novel by Charles Willeford.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Hudson, a used-car dealer in 1960s Los Angeles, he's
a ruthless manipulator who suddenly discovers his artistic calling.
He has to make a movie to show the world what he's learned about
it. ``I thought the whole story was intriguing _ you've got a guy
who does some pretty reprehensible things, but there's not a total
lack of empathy for this character,'' Warburton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His way of dealing with people is so wrong sometimes,'' the
actor added. ``But I thought if we were able to approach this in
the right way, it could be a very humorous story. I've read `spoof'
in some critiques, but I've never thought of this being a spoof.
When I read this I thought it could work on all sorts of different
levels. I think we accomplished some of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear the word deadpan a lot,'' he said in regard to his
sober style of comic acting. ``I'm not sure exactly what it means
other than the fact that I know when I look at something and I find
it funny, that I really think the approach has got to be one of an
earnest, honest take on something. You let the viewer find the
humor. You don't spell it out. Otherwise it's just not funny. Puddy
is not a joke to Puddy, and Richard Hudson is not a joke to Richard
Hudson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved Jerry Lewis when I was growing up,'' Warburton said by
way of explaining a gift for comedy not always evident in men of
his size. ``I was a bit of a little freak. My parents sent me to an
all-boys Catholic prep school in Anaheim, and I had to take a bus
for a full half-hour each way. You were either an academic or a
football player, and I was neither. Sophomore year, I weighed 105
pounds; I was the littlest kid in the whole school, and I had big
old Coke-bottle glasses. I am absolutely blind. I'm farsighted, and
I am cross-sighted, and I have a huge astigmatism. I had to rely on
having something of a sense of humor just to survive life at the
time.''

   RACE-MEAT-PLANT (Tar Heel, N.C.) _ The first thing you learn at
the Smithfield hog plant here is the value of a sharp knife. The
second thing you learn is that not everyone has to work with a
knife. Whites, blacks, American Indians and Mexicans, they all have
their separate stations, but it is blacks and Mexicans that are
left to battle over the dirty jobs at the factory, one of the only
places within a 50-mile radius in this muddy corner of North
Carolina where a person might make more than $8 an hour. While
Smithfield's profits nearly doubled over the past year, wages have
remained flat. So a lot of Americans have quit and a lot of
Mexicans have been hired to take their places. But the workers see
one another, more than management, as the problem, and they see the
competition in skin tones. By Charlie LeDuff.

 &HT;    BILL TO AID RURAL HOSPITALS HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Hoping to avert a wave of rural hospital closings
across the country, a bipartisan group of lawmakers Thursday
proposed increasing those hospital's Medicare payments.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ sponsored in the House by Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.,
and in the Senate by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D. _ is a response to
reductions in Medicare payments resulting from the 1997 Balanced
Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balanced Budget Act was important ... but many of us
concluded that we went too far,'' in reducing payments to rural
hospitals, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers noted many rural hospitals, defined as those with 100
beds or fewer in rural areas, are in financial trouble and are
cutting services _ and in some cases closing _ because of Medicare
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These hospitals are tightening their belts and rural Americans
are feeling the pain,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a
cosponsor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Rural Research Program at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill indicated that 182 rural hospitals
have reduced their size to fewer than 15 beds in order to take part
in Medicare's Critical Access Hospital program, which pays slightly
higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of closing, they're taking this new program,'' said
Thomas C. Ricketts III, director of the university's rural health
research program.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad noted that many rural hospitals may have a patient
population that is 70 percent to 80 percent Medicare-eligible.
</P>
<P>
   When those hospitals' Medicare payments are reduced, it affects
their financial margins because rural hospitals receive
substantially less money than urban hospitals for the same
services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Medicare payments for treating simple pneumonia in
North Dakota are $4,259 compared to $8,564 in New York City.
Payments for treating heart failure are $3,980 in North Dakota and
$8,004 in New York, Conrad said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing payments to rural hospitals is a matter of fairness
and economic necessity, lawmakers from rural areas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elderly people in rural America pay the same Medicare taxes as
anyone else,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``There is no reason
they should be discriminated against.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fay, vice president of Province Health Care, which owns 17
rural hospitals and manages 48 others, said rural hospitals are
crucial to the welfare of their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the hospital is gone ... and their health care system has
melted down, communities have a difficult time recruiting new
industries,'' Fay said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna M. Williams, executive vice president of the National
Rural Health Association, said increased Medicare payments are
essential to the health of rural hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rural residents ... have the right to care no matter where
they choose to live,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors hope to attach the bill to any major proposal to reform
Medicare or offer seniors prescription drug benefit. For rural
hospitals, it would rescind a provision in the 1997 law that
reduced inflationary adjustments in Medicare payments by 1.1
percent through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Other provision in the bill would provide rural hospitals:
</P>
<P>
   _ Up to $5 million in low-interest federal loans to update their
buildings and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grants up to $50,000 to help rural hospitals install new
computer technology systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Higher payments to hospitals with at least a 60 percent
Medicare caseload or are in geographically isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increased payments for lab services to facilities with fewer
than 15 beds.

   UNEXPECTED MAN NOW EXPECTED
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's been on and off more times than Dame Edna's wig,
but the long-awaited production of ``The Unexpected Man,'' by
Yasmina Reza, who won a Tony Award for ``Art,'' is apparently
coming to fruition, and with an impressive cast to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Performances of the two-hander, about a pair of strangers
meeting on a train, are to begin on Oct. 11 at the Promenade
Theater. Eileen Atkins will play the female lead, a literary fan,
as she did in London, where she won an Olivier Award. Opposite her
is another famous face long absent from an American stage, Alan
Bates. Bates, who won a Tony in 1973 in ``Butley,'' will play a
writer with a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The production, which played in London in 1998 with Michael
Gambon as the writer, will again be directed by Matthew Warchus
(``True West''), who also directed ``Art'' on Broadway and in the
West End.
</P>
<P>
   The production had been rumored to be coming to New York several
times since, most recently for a January run at the Gramercy
Theater. But that fell through after a suitable male lead could not
be found. This time, however, Julian Schlossberg, a producer, says
everything is a go. ``We're very excited,'' he said. ``Our hats are
over the windmill.''
</P>
<P>
   SIGNING THE STARS
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With summer vacations looming, several of next year's
big musicals have been looking to signing their leading men.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list are the producers of ``The Producers,'' the
musical adaptation of Mel Brooks' 1968 film satire about a pair of
hapless Broadway schemers. Nathan Lane played the deranged producer
Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel in the movie) in early readings and is
still the leading candidate for that part. For his sidekick, Leo
Bloom, the accountant turned producer played by Gene Wilder in the
film, producers are pursuing Matthew Broderick.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the production team who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the two actors were the leading choices for the
roles but stressed that no deals had been signed.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, with a score by Brooks and a book by him and Thomas
Meehan, is expected to try out in Chicago early next year before a
spring opening on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, after several days of rumors, the producers of
``Seussical,'' the Dr. Seuss musical, were ready to confirm that
David Shiner had been cast in the prime role of the Cat in the Hat.
Shiner is probably best known to audiences as the clowning foil of
Bill Irwin in Broadway runs of ``Fool Moon'' in 1993, 1995 and
1998. The role of the Cat, who acts as the musical's narrator, was
something of a surprise for Shiner, who said he had auditioned on a
lark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never done a musical before,'' he said, speaking from his
home in Germany. ``So I was very relaxed. I never thought they'd
take me.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they did, so now Shiner is to start vocal lessons.
Rehearsals begin on July 10 for a planned October opening at the
Richard Rodgers Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the biggest guessing game in town is who might be in
the running for ``Oklahoma!,'' the revival that the producer
Cameron Mackintosh says he will bring to Broadway this year _ but
only if he gets the right cast. He and the director Trevor Nunn
have been holding casting calls for male and female leads.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the show were mum on casting, but those in the
know say that Marc Kudisch (the cocaine-sniffing ambisexual in
``The Wild Party'') and, even more enticingly, Harry Connick Jr.,
have been sighted coming and going to audition rooms.
</P>
<P>
   TWO ON BROADWAY?
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nothing is definite, but the Manhattan Theater Club
could soon have two productions on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Already announced is Charles Busch's comedy ``The Tale of the
Allergist's Wife,'' confirmed to open on Broadway on Nov. 2, most
likely at the Barrymore Theater (currently home to ``The Real
Thing''). But there is also talk that ``Proof,'' David Auburn's
drama about a touched mathematician and his daughter, might have a
further life as well. The theater club has already extended its run
at City Center until July 30, but several commercial producers have
inquired about a run at a larger theater, possibly the Walter Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   There is one complication, however. Mary Louise Parker, the star
of ``Proof,'' is listed on promotional material as the star of
``Desire Under the Elms,'' opening at the Roundabout Theater
Company this fall. If ``Proof'' proves to have legs, someone's
plans might have to change.
</P>
<P>
   FILLING SHOES
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taking on a play like ``True West,'' which calls for
toaster larceny, typewriter demolition and attempted murder, is
never easy for an actor. But that job is even more daunting when
the roles taken over have most recently been filled by Philip
Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly, both nominated for Tony Awards
for their performances.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the task at hand for Josh Brolin and Elias Koteas,
accomplished film actors who start their run in ``True West'' on
Wednesday, with Brolin playing Austin, the soft-spoken
screenwriter, and Koteas as Lee, his drifter brother. (The two will
begin switching roles in late July and alternating in early
August.)
</P>
<P>
   Brolin, who began his career in theater and will be seen in this
summer's film thriller ``The Hollow Man,'' said he was eager to be
back onstage. ``I think I wanted to say no, but with this play, how
can you say no?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koteas, who has played memorable roles in ``The Thin Red Line''
and ``Crash,'' among other films, echoed Brolin's sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of searching for something to get myself back
onstage,'' said Koteas, who adds that he is still getting
reacquainted with the stage. ``There's technical stuff, '' he said.
``Getting used to using your voice, your body _ it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Brolin says that comparisons with their predecessors are natural
but dismisses them with a smile. ``People are going to write about
it because it's easy to write about,'' he said. ``But it's kind of
ridiculous, isn't it? It's like comparative lit, which I always
thought was one of the dumbest classes ever. How do you compare one
piece of art to another? They just are what they are.''

&HT;     RENO ENDORSES DNA TESTING FOR DEATH ROW INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Thursday weighed in
on the growing controversy over the death penalty, saying some
death row inmates had bad lawyers who failed to take advantage of
DNA evidence that could have proven their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very important, critically important, that, not
only do they have access to DNA testing before they get to the
point of being on death row, but that they have access to other
forensic and investigative resources that will permit them to
properly explore their claim of innocence,'' she told her weekly
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people in this country do not have competent counsel
to represent them in capital cases,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reno declined to say whether she supported some form of
post-conviction DNA testing. ``It's going to depend on the
circumstances,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said her view of the criminal justice
system was changed in 1989 because of her experience in helping
overturn the conviction of an innocent man in Florida when she was
a local prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, then the Dade County state's attorney in Florida, was
asked by the state's governor to re-examine the case of James
Richardson, who had spent 21 years in prison _ five on death row _
for poisoning to death his seven children and a stepchild.Reno
concluded that Richardson had been convicted on perjured testimony
and that investigators had ignored the baby sitter _ who was on
parole at the time of the murders for killing her second husband _
as a possible suspect. A judge set Richardson free on April 15,
1989.``I will never forget turning around and looking over my
shoulder at that man, who walked out of the courthouse free for the
first time in 21 years,'' Reno said. ``And to think that he could
have gone to the electric chair for a crime I did not think he
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   The state of Florida used an electric chair to execute prisoners
but in February switched to lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Two different bills, one sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and one sponsored by
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., would allow convicted prisoners to ask
for DNA tests under certain circumstances in an effort to prove
their innocence. Both bills would apply only to federal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   There has not been a federal execution since 1963, but the
number of people put to death by the states is growing _ more than
620 since 1976, according to the National Institute of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in
1976, eight prisoners have been freed from death sentences and 87
others from lesser sentences after DNA tests cast doubt on their
convictions, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a
Washington-based group opposed to capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers and foes of capital punishment say laws are
needed to guarantee that convicts can get DNA tested, even if their
appeals have expired. Such laws would be especially useful to those
convicted before the mid-1990s, when many prosecutors and defense
lawyers began using DNA tests at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she would work with both Hatch and Leahy to reach a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   New York, Illinois and Minnesota are the only states that have
laws specifically allowing inmates to ask judges to order DNA
testing of evidence using technology not available at the time of
trial. In California, the state Senate voted unanimously last month
to allow inmates to seek testing if the relevant evidence or
testing technology were not previously available and to require
officials to retain biological evidence. Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the expected Republican nominee, said earlier this month
that post-conviction DNA testing should be used when the results
could bear on guilt. But Bush, who supports the death penalty, has
refused to say whether he would support legislation _ either in
Texas or Washington _ to make DNA testing available to inmates who
currently cannot obtain it because of court-imposed time limits on
introducing newly discovered evidence.
</P>
<P>
   These time limits are based on the fact that evidence becomes
less reliable due to the passage of time.

`THE INTERVIEW': TWISTED TRUTHS IN A POLICE PROCEDURAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Interview,'' an Australian film, is a cat-and-mouse game
set up on a board very similar to ``The Usual Suspects,'' a
situation in which the truth is constantly in play. This movie
twists on perceptions of what is happening, starting when Fleming
(Hugo Weaving) is rousted out of his dozing as his shabby one-room
apartment is invaded by the police. It is not a terribly difficult
movie to figure out, but it is quite diverting.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the diversion may come from the vagaries of the
Australian legal system, which in certain situations allows for a
defense lawyer to become a potential witness for the police.
Fleming's lawyer tells him that if she stays around for the police
interrogation she can be subpoenaed as a witness. So Fleming is
left alone with two detectives.
</P>
<P>
   One is the veteran Steele (Tony Martin), a cagey hard case who
plays it cool yet is in trouble with his superiors because of the
way he operates. ``I'm brought in here to get results,'' he snarls.
His methods lead a colleague to respond, ``You've had more
complaints than Ned Kelly'' _ Australia's famous outlaw hero.
</P>
<P>
   Steele is being investigated by the ethics committee, the local
version of internal affairs. His young partner, Wayne (Aaron
Jeffery), has the hardheaded aggression of a man more eager to show
off his biceps than what he picked up at the police academy. Surely
even Melbourne's rules of conduct can't allow an officer to throw a
suspect to the ground and put a gun to his head.
</P>
<P>
   All this drama _ the messy and destructive arrest, the seizing
of Fleming's things from his home _ occurs because of a stolen car,
which may make one believe that the Queen's nominal subjects prize
autos even more highly than the denizens of a Jerry Bruckheimer
movie do. It turns out that the owner of the stolen car is missing,
and the flagrantly illegal manner in which Fleming is being treated
has something to do with all this. Or does it? A police procedural
story in which the procedures are totally different from those in
the United States can make things tough to follow, and ``The
Interview'' is perpetually in mid-twist. Though sometimes the
twirls of the narrative seem a bit arbitrary, they are necessary to
keep the distrust mounting.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaking is executed with extreme competence; ``The
Interview'' is a technical showpiece. Craig Monahan, who directed
and wrote the script with Gordon Davie, uses spaces to convey mood,
and his cinematographer, Simon Duggan, gives the picture a cold
sharpness; it looks as if it has been kept pristine in a grocer's
freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Weaving, whom most Americans probably know as the virtual
enforcer from ``The Matrix'' and who has a string of fine
Australian film performances to his credit, uses ``The Interview''
to display his quicksilver versatility. When he says he has been
described as average, Weaving's wide eyes, eyebrows that seem to
have a life of their own and savvy line reading give the lie to
such an assessment. In ``The Matrix,'' he couldn't look less like a
cyber invention. (Steele and Wayne dress like the evil enforcers
from that film, with their intimidating dark suits and ties.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Interview'' is really a competition between Fleming and
Steele, with each man shifting position during the rounds of
questioning. Viewers of police shows like ``NYPD Blue'' and
``Homicide'' have seen entire episodes constructed around
interrogations of suspects; Andre Braugher of ``Homicide,'' aglow
with technique, became a star conducting them. Here, the police
aren't always right, which allows both Fleming and Steele to go
from manipulator to exploited during the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Interview'' may be a minor work, but it is filled with
major talents. Its cheeky theatricality is watchable; it works hard
to keep you off balance.

PUTIN THE TERRIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The arrest Tuesday of Vladimir Gusinsky, the Russian media
tycoon who owns an independent TV network, radio stations,
newspapers, and magazines, looks like a crude effort to punish or
intimidate critics of President Vladimir Putin's government.
</P>
<P>
   The jailing of Gusinsky and the questionable charges against him
also betoken a political blunder _ either by the so-called power
ministries and by Putin's chief-of-staff, Alexander Voloshin, or by
Putin himself. Commenting from Spain, where he claimed not to have
had advance knowledge of the prosecutor's move against Gusinsky,
Putin termed his arrest ``a dubious present for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of state power to single out for retribution the
oligarch who has been the Kremlin's most damaging critic cast a
pall over Putin's European trip, belying his carefully crafted
image as president of a new Russia founded upon equal justice for
all.
</P>
<P>
   Abroad as in Russia, it is generally understood that the
country's nouveau billionaires had to bend or break the rules of a
game that changed overnight. Indeed, Gusinsky was not one of the
oligarchs who acquired oil fields, refineries, or metallurgical
factories at rigged privatization auctions. Targeting Gusinsky,
said Mikhail Gorbachev, ``smacks of vengeance, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky's broadcasting and press outlets are known for their
propensity to counter government propaganda about the Kremlin's
brutal war in Chechnya and for overt mockery of Putin and his inner
circle. Journalists and business people have protested the
Kremlin's retaliation, sensing that such a revival of police-state
methods may foreshadow a broader assault on all democratic forces
in Russia. Putin ought to hear from governments in the West that he
cannot have gadflies thrown in jail and hope to belong to the club
of the democracies.

 &HT;    INTERNET GAMBLING BILL FULL OF LOOPHOLES, PANEL TOLD
 &HT;    510&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite its name, the ``Internet Gambling
Prohibition Act'' would encourage more people to bet from home, law
enforcement and religious officials told Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, originally intended to stop Internet wagers, has
acquired so many loopholes that ``it does indeed expand gambling,''
Justice Department attorney Kevin DiGregory told the House Commerce
subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is a Trojan horse for the horse racing, dog racing,
``sports fantasy'' and jai alai companies,'' the Rev. Louis
Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, told the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   State lottery officials also opposed the bill, saying it would
block online lottery ticket sales even while allowing other kinds
of gambling. ``State lotteries would be put at a competitive
disadvantage to other participants in the industry,'' said Greg
Ziemak, president of the North American Association of State and
Provincial Lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton administration officials, state lottery
representatives and religious conservatives now ganging up on it,
the once-popular bill faces an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   The measure got off to a strong start last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., introduced it in response to complaints
that online gambling could encourage children to place bets, feed
the addictions of compulsive gamblers and create new opportunities
for fraud by unregulated casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Operators of Las Vegas casinos, fearing online competition, also
wanted Congress to stop Internet gambling. Sports officials, both
at the college and professional levels, joined the chorus calling
for curbs, saying the lure of Internet betting could overwhelm
young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, online gambling already is banned by a long-standing
federal law that prohibits the use of wires to transmit bets across
state lines. But most online gambling sites operate outside U.S.
borders, beyond the reach of the law.
</P>
<P>
   This legislation would cut off those offshore casinos by
blocking their access to Internet service providers in the United
States. Under the bill, if a state or federal law enforcement
agency were to notify a service provider of a gambling operation,
whether foreign or domestic, the provider would be required to take
down the Web site within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the legislation by unanimous consent last
November. In April, the House Judiciary Committee approved it,
21-8.
</P>
<P>
   But as the bill's fine print started getting closer inspection,
its progress has slowed in the House. At Thursday's hearing,
testimony called attention to the bill's exemptions for Internet
betting on horse racing, dog racing and jai alai.
</P>
<P>
   Those ``loopholes'' are ``so big you could drive a truck through
them,'' said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said several states now allow ``account wagering'' on
dog and horse races. In those states, residents can register
themselves to place bets by telephone. Under the proposed
legislation, subscribers could bet over the Internet too.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said racing officials would have no reliable way of
knowing who was opening an account on the Internet. For example, an
out-of-state teenager could open an account, pretending to be an
in-state adult.
</P>
<P>
   State officials fear that while dog and horse tracks would be
getting richer through the Internet, they would be losing business
because the law would block states selling lottery tickets on line.
</P>
<P>
   Though no state currently offers online gambling, ``there are
states who feel that there may come a time when their governments
feel it is appropriate to offer such games,'' Ziemak said. ``We are
united in the belief that the federal government has no place in
determining the way in which state lotteries operate.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Commerce Committee, which claimed jurisdiction because
the measure deals with Internet service providers, has until June
23 to amend the bill or pass it along for a floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the concerns raised about betting on horse races,
Eshoo, who represents the Silicon Valley, said she objects to
turning Internet companies into a watchdogs. She warned the bill
could place ``an inappropriate burden on high-tech companies.''

   In the beginning there was research, some legal work and in some
cases a lot of restoration. The result is a niche and a Web site:
www.broadwayarchive.com, which specializes in theatrical
productions made for television. Gathered together they make an
unusual outcropping in the home video sea.
</P>
<P>
   At present about 40 productions are available on videocassette
at the site, most of them from PBS. Swoosie Kurtz and Geraldine
Fitzgerald star in Eugene O'Neill's ``Ah, Wilderness!'' (1976);
Blythe Danner and Frank Langella in Tennessee Williams'
``Eccentricities of a Nightingale'' (1976); Irene Worth in Samuel
Beckett's ``Happy Days'' (1980); Dustin Hoffman and Eileen Brennan
in Maxwell Anderson's ``The Star Wagon'' (1966); James Earl Jones
and Raul Julia in ``King Lear'' (1974).
</P>
<P>
   Productions to be added go back to the Dupont Show of the Month
and the Kraft Television Theater in the '50s and '60s: George C.
Scott and Agnes Moorehead in ``A Tale of Two Cities'' (1958); Lee
J. Cobb and Eli Wallach in ``Don Quixote'' (1959); Julie Harris and
E.G. Marshall in ``The Night of the Storm'' (1961); Laurence
Olivier, Judith Anderson, Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in ``The
Moon and Sixpence'' (1961).
</P>
<P>
   To start such a collection one negotiates for rights and goes
digging for the material, wherever it has landed over the years.
``Basically, they were rotting in warehouses,'' said Andrew
Barrett, a vice president of the Broadway Theater Archive, which
began looking for the productions in 1996 in broadcasters' vaults,
libraries, museums and other likely spots.
</P>
<P>
   And there are hundreds more out there to be found. The owners
include estates, production companies and various individuals.
About 70 broadcasts have come from WNET. Barrett said that owners
have been cooperative. ``They realize that no one else is doing
this, and their stuff would be lost forever,'' he said.

   POOH-BAHS RETURN
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know the old-fashioned answer to that question,'' said
Mike Leigh, whose film ``Topsy-Turvy,'' nominated for four Academy
Awards, is to be released Tuesday on tape and DVD by USA Home
Entertainment. The question was how he feels about the film on
video. ``Basically I hope that anybody who sees it has a pretty big
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   The big, colorful film about the difficult and sometimes
hilarious relationship between the librettist William Schwenck
Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan was a departure for Leigh,
noted for small and highly original urban dramas. ``On a level of
naughtiness and anarchy, I was attracted by the sheer unlikelihood
of me doing such a project,'' he said from London.
</P>
<P>
   But there were fundamental connections. ``The main subject of
the film is one I endlessly come back to, which is the tension
between what we are and what we pretend to be, the mask,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflections like these make good additions to director's
commentaries on DVD, particularly when the director is as
expressive as Leigh. One day he will make a commentary, he said,
but there is none on the disc available next week.

   NEW RELEASES

<P>
   SWEET AND LOWDOWN
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen's film lives a jazz lover's fantasy: to step back
into the '30s and find out what the near-greats were like. And so
we have Emmet Ray (Sean Penn), a guitarist with just enough talent
to get away with his hubris and selfishness. ``I like women, but
they gotta have their place,'' says Emmet. His girlfriend, Hattie
(Samantha Morton), literally never says a word. But ``Allen's
tone,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``is too genial,
despite the character's obvious dark side, to allow Emmet much
weight.''

<P>
   ANNA AND THE KING
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair to ask this film to be what it isn't, but one still
misses Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr and the music in ``The King and
I.'' Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat occupy the roles of the
schoolteacher and the Siamese king who sent for her to teach his 58
children. In place of music, Andrew Tennant's adaptation of the
diaries of Anna Leonowens relies on grand settings and a
multicultural sensitivity that put the pair at loggerheads over
political and cultural issues. But ``without any real sparks
between the main characters, `Anna and the King' unfolds like an
exotic historical diorama with dramatic vignettes thrown in for
spice'' (Stephen Holden).

</P>
<P>
   THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other Chen Kaige films (``Farewell, My
Concubine,'' for example, or ``Temptress Moon''), this one, about
China's first emperor, Ying Zheng (Li Xuejian), clanks along as a
relatively conventional blood-soaked narrative of back-stabbing
imperial politics and mass slaughter. Eventually the emperor's
betrayal of his lover and brilliant strategic ally (Gong Li) leaves
him friendless and standing alone. One may wonder whether it is a
disguised parable about the failed ambitions of Mao's Cultural
Revolution, but with its action, pomp, suds and moralizing, ``the
movie conveys the sweep of history with a capital H'' (Holden).

</P>
<P>
   In 1963 the students at Godard's boarding school include the
promiscuous girl (Monica Keena), the angry rich one (Kirsten Dunst)
and the bulimic one (Heather Matarazzo). Odette (Gaby Hoffman)
arrives with her horse and a way with snappy sayings that leads one
classmate to predict that she will become ``a speechwriter or a
demagogue.'' When a merger with a boys' school threatens, the girls
fight for the school's identity. That leads to girl-power melodrama
and bratty farce, but ``the ungainliness is part of the film's
charm'' (A.O. Scott).

   WITNESS PROTECTION. When the petty mobster Bobby Batton (Tom
Sizemore) gets caught cheating on his bosses and is ordered killed,
he decides to rat on them to the authorities. That lands him, his
wife (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and children (Shawn Hatosy and
Skye McCole Bartusiak) in a duplex apartment where they are taught
how to live in the federal witness-protection program by a U.S.
marshall (Steve Beck). They have a lot to learn, especially the
arrogant Bobby, and, Ron Wertheimer wrote in the New York Times,
the ``process of forced metamorphosis is both fascinating and
frightening.'' 1999. HBO $79.99; DVD, $19.98. 101 minutes. Closed

U.S. REITERATES OBJECTIONS TO ISRAELI MILITARY SALE TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ U.S. diplomats met with Israeli military officials
Thursday to reiterate their objections to the sale of an airborne
radar system to China, participants in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also pressed for consultations before Israel
offers advanced weaponry to other countries ``of concern'' to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli officials reacted testily to the request, fearing
that the United States was in effect asking for veto power over
Israel's arm sales. And some of the U.S. officials appeared
exasperated by what they see as Israeli unwillingness to
acknowledge growing concern about tension in the China Straits and
about the potential exposure of U.S. forces there.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats from both sides said they welcomed the effort to
tamp down a simmering dispute that has prompted one key Congressman
to threaten to cut military aid here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are both trying to find a way to resolve a disagreement,
though our view still is that they should cancel the sale,'' a
State Department official said after the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation presented a list of 27 ``countries of
concern,'' including China and India, another important Israeli
arms client, where Washington wants formal consultations before
Israel negotiates arms sales, even if the weapons do not
incorporate U.S. technology.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing technical sophistication of Israel's homegrown
defense systems prompted this unusual request, U.S. officials said.
``This is a special relationship, with special obligations on both
sides,'' a U.S. official said. The U.S. delegation was headed by
Eric Newsome, chief of the State Department's Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs, and included several high-ranking
Pentagon officials and Martin Indyk, the U.S. ambassador to Israel.
Amos Yaron, the defense ministry's director-general, led the
Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Israel has resisted the intensifying U.S. pressure to
rescind the agreement to supply China with the $250 million worth
of a early-warning radar and communications system. Mounted in a
refurbished Ilyushin-76 transport parked on the periphery of Tel
Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport, the airborne surveillance
center is just weeks away from its final test flights, officials
close to the project said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., who heads the House subcommittee
that oversees foreign aid appropriations, vowed earlier this week
to slice $250 million from next year's planned $1.92 billion
military package for Israel if the sale is concluded.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would drop his objection if Defense Secretary William
Cohen testifies that the sale would not jeopardize U.S. national
security. That is a difficult proposition for Cohen, who forcefully
stated in recent visits to Israel that the radar system would
greatly heighten the risks faced by U.S. forces in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright strongly objected to the
threatened cut in aid. ``I want to make it clear that although the
United States has real concerns about the proposed Israeli sale of
Phalcon aircraft to China, and we are discussing the matter with
the Israeli government, we do not believe that linking this issue
to our assistance to Israel is the way to proceed,'' she said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Backing down somewhat, Callahan is now advocating a delay in the
disbursement of Israel's military aid until the sale is either
canceled by the Barak government or blessed by the Clinton
administration. A prolonged delay would disrupt Israeli defense
plans and cost the country upwards of $50 million in interest
earnings. That is because under an arrangement extended to no other
U.S. aid recipient, Israel traditionally receives its annual
military assistance disbursement up front, as a lump sum deposited
in an interest-bearing account at the start of the fiscal year.

&HT;     LAWMAKERS SEEK MORE BORDER JUDGES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling a backlog of narcotics and immigration
cases in federal courts a crisis, a bipartisan group of senators
from Southwest border states have introduced legislation that would
create 13 new judgeships in Arizona, California, New Mexico and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These courts are the front line of the drug war,'' said Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ``We cannot tolerate a lack of
judicial resources in our fight against the drug trade.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, said ``federal
courts along the U.S.-Mexico border are simply overwhelmed with
pending drug cases.''
</P>
<P>
   She said additional judges would result in ``more trials, more
convictions and a safer border.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, federal judges from border states traveled to
Washington to press lawmakers for more resources. They noted the
five U.S. judicial districts along the U.S.-Mexico border handle 26
percent of all federal criminal court cases filed.
</P>
<P>
   They also noted that criminal cases along the border skyrocketed
125 percent from 1994 to 1998, but court staffing increased by only
30 percent during that time, according to records kept by the
administrative office of the U.S. Courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to go to war, you need certain troops,'' U.S.
District Judge George Kazen of Laredo, Texas, told a news
conference in May.
</P>
<P>
   Edward C. Prado, a U.S. district judge in San Antonio, said the
onslaught of cases filed by agents with the Border Patrol, Customs
Service, Drug Enforcement Administration and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service has stuffed dockets all along the Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Prado said two San Antonio judges are dispatched to Del Rio,
Texas, each month because there is no full-time judge there.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and
Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., includes eight permanent judgeships
(three in the southern district of California, one in New Mexico,
and four in Texas) and five temporary judgeships (three in Arizona,
one in California, three in Arizona, and one in New Mexico).

PUTIN WARNS GERMAN BUSINESS LEADERS THAT U.S. COULD SPUR NEW ARMS
RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ President Vladimir Putin of Russia proposed Thursday
that his country be placed at the heart of Europe's defenses
against missile attack. Putin warned that a proposed U.S. missile
defense system would lead to a ``very dangerous'' arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to several hundred German business leaders in this
capital that long stood at the epicenter of the Cold War, Putin
sought to portray Russia as a natural ally of Germany and the new
Europe while depicting the United States as insensitive to European
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cooperation could take the form of building a nonstrategic
missile defense system reliably covering all of Europe from the
Atlantic to the Urals,'' Putin said on the second day of a
three-day visit here. ``We think this is all possible technically
and technologically. All we need is the political will.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time that the Russian president has taken
up the idea of using Russian anti-missile systems to protect
Europe. But the setting in Germany, the country at the continent's
center and the one whose modern history has been most troubled by
where its strategic allegiances should lie, gave his words an added
edge.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Russians appear to be proposing the use of
``theater'' anti-missile systems allowed under the Antiballistic
Missile Treaty of 1972 to shoot down short- and medium-range
missiles that threaten Europe. The Russians say they are developing
technology that could down missile-bearing rockets in the boost
phase.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is skeptical of the idea. But Putin is aware
that his proposal buttresses what appears to be a central strategic
aim, driving a wedge between Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, like other European countries, has expressed
ambivalence about the proposed U.S. system, which is widely seen
here as an unproven weapon against an unlikely enemy and one that
would undermine what the Germans call the ``architecture of
disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now no risk of all-out war in Europe,'' Putin said.
``But that is no reason for complacency.'' He added that the
proposed U.S. system ``would be a blow, especially in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Because such a U.S. system would in part depend on equipment
placed in Europe, the consequences would be particularly serious,
Putin continued, noting that Russia would have no choice but to
regard such equipment as ``directed against Russia'' and would
respond ``in an appropriate way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would NATO then do?'' he asked. ``Would Russia respond?
And what's that called? It's called a new arms race. We think that
is very dangerous. Can we find a way out? I am sure we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's German hosts appeared mildly taken aback by the
provocative tone of the speech that was delivered shortly after
Putin's first meeting with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Aides to
Schroeder hastily called an unscheduled briefing for early Friday,
but the purpose of the session was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The German government has been relentlessly upbeat in its
assessment of Putin, who spent five years in Germany as a KGB spy.
And Germany has described relations between the two countries as a
``strategic partnership.'' After their first meeting, but before
Putin's speech, Schroeder praised the Russian's ``open-minded
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Putin also attacked the eastward expansion of
NATO, a project that Germany favors. He said such expansion would
not strengthen European security and would prompt the question of
why is NATO moving toward our frontiers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have the right to think of our security?'' Putin added.
``We have not only the right, but a duty, for the sake of the
security of all. Because if a country like Russia felt itself to be
in danger, it would destabilize the situation both in Europe and
across the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a recent speech in Germany, President Clinton suggested that
eventual Russian membership in NATO should not be excluded, and
Putin has in the past entertained that notion as conceivable.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian clearly senses that European unease over the
U.S. missile plan has presented him an unusual opportunity, and he
is probing European uncertainty wherever possible. The best
alternative to NATO, he said Thursday, is to develop the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe into the basis
for regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   Between his talks with German officials, Putin talked by
telephone to President Jacques Chirac of France. A spokesman for
the Kremlin said the two agreed that the ABM Treaty, signed by
Washington and Moscow, should be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants the treaty amended to allow the
deployment of 100 interceptors and a battle-management radar system
in Alaska that would act as a shield against a possible attack from
countries like Iraq and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders of Russia and France,'' the Kremlin spokesman
reported, ``noted with pleasure the closeness of their positions on
questions of strategic stability, confirming as well the necessity
of preserving and strengthening the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany has also expressed concern over any dismantling or
change to the treaty, but has made clear that the U.S. plans will
not be allowed to affect the ``cohesion'' of the alliance. The
German commitment to NATO, seen as the guarantor of its postwar
revival and reconstruction, is deep.

JACKSON IS PURE PLEASURE IN `SHAFT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B-  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best thing about the 1971 blaxploitation classic, ``Shaft''
_ in fact, the only truly good thing _ was Isaac Hayes'
Oscar-winning music. And, happily, the producers of this remake
have been smart enough to realize this fact and to recreate that
score virtually intact.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's other big plus is Samuel L. Jackson, who has about
10 times the sassy charisma of the original's star, Richard
Roundtree. In his first solo above-the-title starring vehicle, he's
endlessly fun to watch: to the extent that this could well end up
being his defining role.
</P>
<P>
   So this big-budget effort to revive the dubious esthetics of the
extinct action genre of the early '70s essentially works _ even
though the script is a complete mess and John Singleton's direction
is often clumsy and heavy-handed to an annoying degree.
</P>
<P>
   The story follows the adventures of the original John Shaft's
nephew (Jackson), a highly unorthodox New York City detective
obsessed with an arrogant white racist (Christian Bale) who
callously murdered an innocent young black man but walked because
of the wealth and influence of his real estate magnate father.
</P>
<P>
   The main plot-thread has Shaft and the yuppie scumbag playing a
cat-and-mouse game with each other as they're both on the trail of
a panicky bartender (Toni Collette) who witnessed the murder,
fingered the villain for Shaft, but then disappeared into the night
before she could testify against him.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-movie, however, the script shifts its focus to Shaft's
conflict with a Dominican drug lord (Jeffrey Wright, of
``Basquiat'') _ a decision reportedly made in the editing room
because Singleton liked Wright's performance so much he decided to
emphasize it at the expense of Bale and what was supposed to be an
extended cameo by Roundtree.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's work is indeed humorous and clever, but this second-act
detour throws the movie way off balance. And by the time we get to
the inevitable, final-act shootout, the script has thrown in yet
another pair of villains _ two crooked Keystone Kops _ to create a
bewildering labyrinth of thinly motivated, often tedious subplots.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Shaft'' also suffers from Singleton's morbid view of
race relations and eagerness to exploit the race card. His white
characters are all as consistently evil and homicidally bigoted as
they were in his ``Rosewood.'' The worst thing Shaft can think of
to say about the Bale character is to call him ``a white boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still and all, the movie powers along on the strength of
Jackson's funny, foul-mouthed, tough-guy charm. His character _
with his demonic look, flowing leather trench coat, vigilante
sensibility and flamboyant resignations from the police force _ may
be an utter absurdity, but Jackson is always pure pleasure to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the music. In an era in which movies are invariably
crammed full of inappropriate pop songs in hopes of selling tons of
soundtrack albums, it's gratifying to have a film with a consistent
score that counterpoints the mood and visual style, provides a
stirring theme and is virtually a character of the movie _ perhaps
even the most important character.
</P>
<P>
   Shaft. Directed by John Singleton. Screenplay by Richard Price,
John Singleton and Shane Salerno. Cast: Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa
Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Christian Bale, Toni Collette. Paramount.
95 minutes. Rated R for language and violence.

   NEW YORK _ Jimy Williams was standing behind his desk in the
manager's office at Yankee Stadium, searching for answers. For one
of the few times in his tenure as Red Sox manager, Williams seemed
publicly frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had chances with the right people up,'' said Williams of
yet another wasted opportunity by his team. ``And balls were hit
hard, but they were caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have been unable to hit for the last few weeks.
Doldrums have slowed their bats tremendously. This is a profound
hitting slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hit balls . . . close games,'' said Williams, free
associating. ``We hit balls pretty good . . . hit 'em with guys in
motion.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no answers to team-wide slumps. Do you break out of
slumps with bunts and going to the opposite field? Or do you try to
smash out of slumps with free swings and long drives? Or do you
just wait for the law of averages to finally arrive in Boston?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in New York, Williams had gone the tried-and-true
approach. The manager attempted to create runs by sending his
runners, by playing hit-and-run, by not sitting back and waiting
for the big hit which, like warm air, has yet to arrive in Boston
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put 'em in motion,'' the manager said. ``You've got to
believe in your hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, for example, Williams had sent Jose
Offerman running with Trot Nixon at the plate with the Sox
trailing, 1-0. Nixon absolutely smashed the ball but his drive was
caught at the knees by right fielder Paul O'Neill. A few feet
either way, and the Red Sox might have had a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the balls pretty good with guys in motion,'' Williams
said again.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the sixth, the game still 1-0, Williams sent Darren
Lewis off from first on another hit-and-run with Jason Varitek at
the plate. Once again, a Red Sox hitter absolutely smashed the ball
as Varitek drove a liner to center. But Bernie Williams slid in to
make the catch at his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balls were hit hard,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   No difference. These Red Sox of late can't score.
</P>
<P>
   It is bizarre. Few Red Sox fans of any age, from 20 to 120, can
recall a Boston team of any era that could not hit. Just as few Red
Sox fans of any age can recall a Boston staff that pitched as well
as this Red Sox staff. Life is upside down in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And the frustration builds. ``Everybody is trying too hard to
take too much on himself,'' said first baseman/DH Brian Daubach
who, like Carl Everett, failed to come through against a struggling
Roger Clemens with the bases loaded in the first. ``That's for sure
what I'm doing. We're all trying too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   A big hit by either Daubach or Everett effectively would have
ended that game, given that Pedro Martinez was pitching. Neither
delivered, and the Red Sox were forced to try and claw and scratch
their way to a win when a big hit would have made the task much
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but we played hard and we played well,'' said
Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, big hits have been so rare in the last few weeks that a
first-and-third situation for the Red Sox is troublesome. The bases
loaded with one out? Dire straits. And the bases loaded with none
out _ baseball's most pleasant prospect _ is an absolutely
catastrophic prospect for a Boston team that is not hitting,
particularly in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the ball hard (Wednesday),'' said Nixon, ``but
sometimes we're all trying too hard with guys in scoring position
and we're trying to do too much in one at-bat. You're going to hit
those ruts during the season and you just hope there aren't too
many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But this rut is so deep that Red Sox fans are mystified. Each
night on TV, Red Sox fans see highlights of bases-clearing doubles
in other games, 13-10 final scores, and endless talk about a
juiced-up baseball or the sorry lot of major league pitching. And
yet virtually every pitcher facing the Red Sox seems to throw like
Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of opportunities to put a few runs up,'' said
Garciaparra, who accounted for the only Red Sox run Wednesday the
only sure way Boston seemingly can score the last few weeks _ with
a home run. But, once again, the Red Sox didn't take advantage of
those chances.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, for the umpteenth time, outstanding pitching was
squandered.

TO A QUAINT FISHING PORT CAME A JAZZY CITY BOY, LURED BY THE
LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At first look, the quaint fishing port of Gloucester,
Mass., seems an unlikely hangout for the jazzy city painter Stuart
Davis (1894-1964). But Davis loved the place, with its
sea-brightened light, its rocky coast, its maritime activity and
its art colony goings-on.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Davis, these attributes lured well-known painters over
the years, including Winslow Homer, William Morris Hunt and Frank
Duveneck in the late 19th century, and Edward Hopper, John Sloan,
Childe Hassam, William Glackens and Milton Avery in the 20th.
</P>
<P>
   Gloucester, Davis wrote in his 1945 autobiography, was the place
he had been looking for: ``It had the brilliant light of
Provincetown, but with the important additions of topographical
severity and the architectural beauties of the Gloucester schooner.
I wandered over the rocks, moors and docks with a sketching easel,
large canvases and a pack on my back, looking for things to
paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis had been drawn to Gloucester by Sloan, a friend of his
family, and spent almost every summer there from 1915 to 1934. He
first went with his mother, Helen, a sculptor, and his brother,
Wyatt. In 1925 his parents acquired a house, and Davis _ by then
very much part of the summer scene _ set up his painting studio in
it. Did Gloucester and its well-worn motifs play a role in the
lively and innovative American Cubist style that Davis eventually
developed? No doubt about it, as evidenced by ``Stuart Davis in
Gloucester,'' a show of some 45 oils, watercolors and drawings at
the National Academy of Design, organized by the Cape Ann
Historical Association with the art critic Karen Wilkin as curator.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he got to Gloucester, however, Davis had already
been hit with Armory shock, caused by the big-bang 1913 show in New
York that gave American innocents their first real experience of
European modernist art. As a matter of fact, Davis, who worked at
cartooning and illustrating while studying with the Ashcan painter
Robert Henri, exhibited no fewer than five watercolors at the
Armory Show (priced at $100 each). They were animatedly realistic,
but when he saw them in context, he decided he had to think in more
progressive terms. He turned to the Fauvist and Cubist modes he saw
there for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the standout early works he did in his summer place is a
reductive Fauvish landscape, ``Hillside Near Gloucester''
(1915-16). A crisp tree with a pale lavender trunk next to a large
aquamarine rock is set against a bright lavender-blue sky that
Matisse himself would not have scorned. In paintings like ``Rocky
Neck, Gloucester'' and ``Airview'' (both 1916), Davis seems to be
trying his hand at Cubist structure, piling together the geometric
shapes of houses and buildings and pushing their landscapes into
planar thrusts.
</P>
<P>
   In his efforts to become a ``modernist'' painter, Davis tried a
number of styles, producing work far more experimental than that of
his fellow artists. Much of it was cued by the European
avant-gardists he had admired at the Armory show, like van Gogh,
Matisse and Picasso. But though he didn't turn away from the
picturesque themes offered by Gloucester, Wilkin points out in her
``Stuart Davis in Gloucester,'' a book accompanying the show, he
often applied the Modernist notions he saw at the Armory show to
subjects more in line with the gritty philosophy of Henri and the
Ashcan School: backyards, sheds and outhouses, and working
streetscapes with garages, gas pumps and cars.
</P>
<P>
   An example of Davis' more mundane interests is the painting
``Coal Derrick'' (1916), a view of the harbor divided in the middle
by a long, ungainly black apparatus used to hoist coal from ships.
It sits in the water close to a harbor shoreline tightly packed
with a Cubist jumble of houses, while flattened fingers of land jut
out from another angle.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Multiple Views'' (1918), he makes an awkward pass at an
important Cubist notion, that of simultaneity. A number of separate
Gloucester vignettes are compressed into one painting: houses,
figures, the facade of a garage, a tree, a tower, landscape
elements and less readable forms, all on a flat surface plane.
Crude as it is, the work anticipates his later, stylized landscapes
like ``Report From Rockport'' (1940; not in the show) that meld
abstract and semi-abstract bits and pieces into a busy, complex
whole whose colors dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the paintings of the early 1920s seem to flounder,
suffering from Davis' laborious attempts to go further with Cubism.
``Garden Scene'' (1921), painted in muddy colors, is a rambling
collection of flattened, largely geometric shapes in search of a
composition. But by the mid-1920s, his work had lightened up. He
was beginning to hit his stride, as evidenced in the sprightly
watercolor ``Gas Pumps'' (1925).
</P>
<P>
   A jaunty red caricature of a pump with price (was gasoline ever
really 36 cents a gallon?) is poised on the edge of a heavily
stylized harbor scene with boats and sea gulls, the sea conveyed by
a set of straight horizontal lines. The scene, anchored at either
end by the pump and a buoylike form, is partially framed within a
linear trapezoid, in turn enclosed by a more irregular geometric
outline. It's a slight drawing, but it anticipates the later work
for which Davis is celebrated: the snappy compositions _ tied
together by ingenious linearities _ cued by neon signs, billboards,
rushing traffic, the beat of jazz and other elements by which he so
deftly conveyed the cacophony of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the later paintings in the show already illustrate the
bouncy, energetic shorthand that characterizes Davis' mature
styles, among them ``Sail Loft'' (1933), an intricate canvas in
which stylized parts of boats, wharves, water, fishing shacks, rope
and other nautical mementos are strategically melded in a tightly
designed composition. By this time, Davis had already established a
reputation with his first abstract paintings, the influential
``Eggbeater'' series of 1927.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes a number of black-and-white drawings
that reveal how cleverly Davis plotted the schematics of his work,
and a post-Gloucester oil or two to show that he used motifs from
the fishing port long after his close association with the place
was over.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Gloucester played a role in his work, as did his other
environments, especially New York City, providing a special light,
evocative motifs and particular spaces. Yet as Wilkin herself
suggests, Davis' art has more to do with his own genius _ his gift
for paring line and shape to essences and uniting them with
scintillating color _ than with any special place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Davis in Gloucester'' remains at the National Academy
of Design, 1083 Fifth Ave., at 90th Street, (212) 369-4880, through
July 30. &QL;

JOHN SIGNER SARGENT: A TELLING IMAGE NO MATTER THE LOCALE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By all accounts, it was almost impossible to dislike
John Singer Sargent as a man. Henry James said of him in 1884, ``He
has high talent, a charming nature and is civilized to his
fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   In all professional matters, he was a gifted strategist. Not the
least of his triumphs was that he was succeeded by ideally dutiful
descendants. They were anxious to find the best homes for what had
been entrusted to them, rather than to sit on the heap of gold that
it might have brought.
</P>
<P>
   Not being a marrying man, he left an unmarried sister, Emily
Sargent, and a married sister, Violet Ormond. Ormond (1870-1955)
was exemplary in her guardianship of Sargent and his estate, as is
her grandson Richard Ormond, co-author of the continuing ``Complete
Paintings of Sargent.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1925, when Sargent died, and 1937, museums in Boston,
Washington and Harvard were given more than 1,000 of his drawings.
But after Emily died in an accident in 1936 and Violet was about to
turn 80, in 1949, it was decided that the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York should be offered the bulk of what remained of the
estate. It was for the museum (whose director at the time, Francis
Henry Taylor, was a distant cousin of Violet Ormond) to do with it
whatever seemed best.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan duly received a massive gift from the Sargent
estate in June 1950. The gift included ``110 watercolors, a
scrapbook containing about 140 sheets of drawings and sketches, a
scrapbook containing 54 drawings and watercolors, and four
sketchbooks'' and much else.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken exactly 50 years to sort it all out. In all, 341
items from the gift are included in the monumental catalog that has
just been published by the Met (with 714 illustrations, 109 of them
in color). And there is now a very large exhibition of watercolors
and drawings from the Ormond bequest.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, and with the possible exception of his
enormous decorations for the Boston Public Library, Sargent knew
when to start and when to stop. He also knew where to dig in, and
when to move on. Even when he was still making his way, he knew how
to produce work that in the words of one shrewd judge ``more or
less kicked other people's pictures to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he did not like to get trapped in any one specialty.
He was nature's tourist, and rarely at a loss for a telling image
from his travels. And he was the portraitist whom everyone wanted,
not simply because he could ``capture a likeness,'' but also
because his portraits in oils would almost always radiate a certain
moral security.
</P>
<P>
   He could go to a landscape unknown to him _ the English
countryside, for instance _ and carry it off as if he had been
there all his life. And whatever he let out of the studio had a
certain immunity from the risks that bigger artists take. It is
therefore legitimate to wonder what he was like when he was not
``on show.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of it can be seen in this exhibition's four distinct
sections: Childhood and Youth (1856-74), Student Years and Early
Career (1874-89), Professional Activity (1890-1925) and Records of
Travel and Other Studies (1890-1925).
</P>
<P>
   The show is full of surprises, from the moment that Sargent in
his 15th year was shaping up as a student of the high ground in
Switzerland. The two drawings of white oxen in their blue-shadowed
stable in Siena, dated around 1910, have a tranquil monumentality.
</P>
<P>
   These are true portraits (rather than ``paughtraits,' as Sargent
used to call them, in exasperation at having to do so many of men
and women). The oxen are rendered with a spontaneous affection that
is not always found among the charcoal portraits on thick Whatman
paper that he was to make by the score in London, allotting roughly
two hours to each sitter. (As Stanley Olson says in his biography
of Sargent, published in 1986, Sargent ``moved the production of
likenesses into the realm of an hourly wage.'')
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fascination of this show is that it includes many
memorable things that Sargent never thought of selling. As to why
this was, all are free to speculate and none of us can be certain.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly striking example is the quite large group of
drawings and sketches from Sargent's service as an official
military artist from July 1910 onward. What was later asked of him
was that he should in some way portray the joint activities and, if
possible, the camaraderie of British and U.S. troops in France.
Initially he was not inclined to do it, on the grounds that he had
never seen anything ``really horrible'' in his life and did not
wish to risk the experience.
</P>
<P>
   It was arranged, however, that Sargent would not see too much
action at close quarters. As he knew nothing of soldiers and
soldiering and was initially a guest of the commander-in-chief of
the British armies in France, with a comfortable bed and full
board, he was not exactly in the thick of things. (One Sunday
morning he overheard a regimental band playing on its way to
church. ``I suppose there's no fighting on Sundays?'' said Sargent
to his host.)
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this initial problem, the wartime material that was
left to the Met includes some remarkably exact and well-conceived
studies of forward areas in which the war was temporarily in
abeyance. Dugouts, convoys of trucks, camps and a camouflaged field
_ all were given his best efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The gentlest and least vicious of men, Sargent took human nature
at its most presentable for his terrain. One or two of his other
wartime studies present the front line as a place in which young
men lay around in twos and threes, naked and in long grass, asleep
as often as not.
</P>
<P>
   It is permissible to doubt that these were scenes that Sargent
himself witnessed in France in the fall of 1918, though the subject
matter recurs elsewhere in the show _ most notably in his
watercolors of the black work force who were building a friend's
villa in Florida in 1917. An almost sainted innocence is the mark
of these studies.
</P>
<P>
   He could be very grand, too, when the subject encouraged it, as
in the glorious ``Garden Near Lucca'' (circa 1910). The mix of
sculpture, architecture and a cascade of convolvulus is one of
Sargent's strongest inventions. The best things in this show take a
little finding, but it's worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Singer Sargent Beyond the Portrait Studio: Paintings,
Drawings and Watercolors From the Collection'' is at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)
535-7710, through Sept. 24.

SOUZA CARDOSO: A DAZZLING FLASH, REFLECTED AT LAST UPON HISTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Modernism may or may not be over, but that hasn't
kept historians from adding names to its roster. With more and more
names from more parts of the world, it is at last being defined as
a multinational, multicultural phenomenon, which it always was.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest additions is the Portuguese painter Amedeo de
Souza Cardoso, who arrived in Paris in 1906 on his 19th birthday,
drank the elixir of the new and in a very short period produced a
little newness of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Souza Cardoso loved Paris and probably would have spent most of
his life there, but World War I began while he was on a visit home,
and Portugal's neutrality barred him from re-entering France. And
his work might have remained more visible if he had not died during
the worldwide influenza epidemic of 1918, a month shy of his 31st
birthday and just two weeks before the Armistice that would have
allowed him to return to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last few decades Souza Cardoso's achievement has
gradually resurfaced, first in Portugal, where he is by now
something of a national treasure, and then in the rest of Europe.
Now it is being seen in the United States in its first solo
exhibition, a show of works borrowed primarily from the Gulbenkian
Museum in Lisbon and organized by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in
Washington and Portugal's Culture Ministry. By some serendipity of
scheduling, a New York stop has been added, at the AXA Gallery in
Manhattan, the space formerly known as the Equitable Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Both the show and its catalog (the first of Souza Cardoso's work
to be published in English) were overseen by Jack Cowart, formerly
deputy director and chief curator of the Corcoran, now executive
director of the Roy Licthenstein Foundation. After opening there
last fall, the show traveled to the Arts Club in Chicago, a natural
choice, as that city is the only place in the United States where
paintings by Souza Cardoso can be seen. The Art Institute owns
three, all from the bequest of Arthur Jerome Eddy, one of the first
American collectors of 20th-century art, who purchased them from
the 1913 Armory Show. Two of the Chicago paintings are in this
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   It is an exciting show, exemplary of the dropped-from-the-sky
genre of retrospective. It has only 49 paintings and drawings, but
it reveals an artist who imbued nearly everything he touched with a
distinct sense of emotional and formal concentration.
</P>
<P>
   The works reveal Souza Cardoso to be a master draftsman whose
earlier drawings imitate the sharp black and white of modern
woodcuts and elaborate the landscapes of his childhood into manic,
revved-up patterns. His later drawings are so hyper-refined, they
suggest Ingres high on Cubism.
</P>
<P>
   But the show also introduces an artist who was equally gripped
by painting as a physical process, one whose last Cubist works,
created in Portugal during the war, are unusual for their robust
color, solid visual structure, compartmentalized space and
extensive use of physical texture and collage. Resplendent in the
show's final gallery, these works don't present a single object
seen from multiple viewpoints in the manner of orthodox Cubism.
Instead they present a kind of cultural continuum that mixes
objects, abstract motifs, bits of Portuguese folk art and stenciled
words and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   These works in particular earn Souza Cardoso a place among an
array of talented outsiders who journeyed from the margins to the
heart of modernism, took what they needed and combined it with
elements that reflected their own personal and cultural roots. His
American counterparts include Marsden Hartley, Gerald Murphy and
Stuart Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Souza Cardoso's story suggests a confident self-starter of the
first order. Photographs show that he had Picasso's dark Iberian
looks, only more handsome, and a similarly solid, energetic
physique and combative attitude. He almost invariably looks
straight into the lens. In one photograph he stands with his legs
apart, like a young boxer. In another he poses with friends, bare
chested, a brocade bedspread across his lap, a crown of flowers on
his head. The group is supposed to be imitating Velasquez's
``Borrachos,'' but he looks like something straight out of
Carravaggio.
</P>
<P>
   In a third, his eyes smolder beneath the rim of a big, dark
fedora while he caresses a guitar. Not only did he know how to
play, but according to a label in the exhibition he also
accompanied himself while singing fado songs for friends in cafes.
Occasionally he wore a magnificent Alentejo cape, possibly the only
one is Paris, which was worn in his country only by noblemen.
</P>
<P>
   The son of wealthy vintners, Souza Cardoso grew up on the family
estate in Manhufe, near Armarante in northern Portugal. He showed
an early talent for drawing. After studying architecture in Lisbon
he convinced his parents to send him to Paris. Within a year he had
forsaken architecture for painting, by far the livelier art of the
moment. (Cezanne's paintings were seen for the first time in the
Salon d'Automne of 1907.) Over the next few years he studied
painting at the Academie Viti, submitted to what he referred to as
``French artistic imperialism'' and ventured far beyond the circle
of Portuguese artists who had been his first companions in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He became friends with Brancusi, Archipenko, Diego Rivera,
Apollinaire and especially Modigliani, with whom he staged a joint
exhibition in 1911. By then Souza Cardoso had already shown his
work in the Salon des Independants. He would show there again in
1912 and 1914, as well as in the Salon d'Automne.
</P>
<P>
   The current show begins with works made in 1911; they reflect
attention to the stylization of Art Nouveau and the ``primitivism''
of Henri Rousseau. The most striking work in the first gallery is
``Leap of the Rabbit,'' which depicts the animal suspended over a
cluster of tropical plants like a fish in an aquarium. Everything
about this painting conveys effortlessness and ease: the lightly
worked surface, the outlined flowers above, the odd little colored
discs below (early hints of the influence of Delaunay's Orphism)
and other touches of color, the rabbit's startled masklike face and
the body-paint patterns of its body.
</P>
<P>
   Little else in Souza Cardoso's work is quite so relaxed. Nearly
everything seems packed, almost tightly wound, as if he was
determined to get the most out of every inch of available surface.
His maniacally patterned landscapes seem to presage Art Deco as
much as they reflect the influence of Art Nouveau. Sometimes they
are the settings for exotic hunting scenes, as in ``The Tiger'';
sometimes for cavorting nudes that suggest an awareness of
Picasso's ``Demoiselles d'Avignon.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all is a drawing of an aristocratic couple standing in a
garden. The encroaching plant life elaborates the male of the
species, who already wears wildly checked jodhpurs, into a kind of
peacock.
</P>
<P>
   In the show's middle section, Souza Cardoso comes to grips with
Cubism and Futurism, usually buoyed by Delaunay's strong colors. At
times Souza Cardoso resurrects antiquated themes that evoke his
Portuguese heritage, depicting a cavalier and a prince mounted for
the hunt in pale paintings that look a little like tapestries.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Abstract Composition'' (1913), probably one of the
earliest completely nonrepresentational paintings of the 20th
century, he reduces the world to transparent spheres of radiant
color. He then applies this scheme to ``Don Quixote,'' a large 1914
painting in which the spheres tumble and spin, curving down toward
the strange red and black eyes and masklike face of the patient
steed Rocinante, who drinks water from a stream.
</P>
<P>
   In a small horizontal abstraction from 1913 Souza Cardoso
flattens the Cubist grid and extends it almost to the edges of the
canvas, creating a shadowy nocturnal space that he livens up with
red and white.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how he got from these Cubist variations to the
commanding works in the last gallery, with their carefully deployed
planes of color, their textural variety and their surprising
additions, like the Johnsian stenciled letters and little bits of
mirror. Perhaps distance from his beloved Paris actually helped, or
he benefited from continued contact with the Delaunays, who spent
most of the war in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   But especially in works like ``Entrada'' and ``Painting,''
styles, spaces and objects seem to break down into a kind of
superbly controlled chaos held in suspension, like the wall-eyed
rabbits of Souza Cardoso's early paintings and drawings. Call these
last works post-Cubist. They show an artist working ahead of his
time, moving toward a future that he would never reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Edge: A Portuguese Futurist _ Amadeo de Souza Cardoso''
is at the AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Ave., at 51st Street, (212)
554-1704, through Sept. 16.

 &HT;    GORE'S EFFORTS TO REACH OUT TO WOMEN NO ACCIDENT
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (p) Politics
categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCRANTON, Pa. _ Vice President Al Gore's so-called ``progress
and prosperity'' tour has taken on the same ``family friendly''
tone that has characterized nearly every facet of his presidential
campaign in recent weeks, a reflection of the importance he and his
strategists have placed on winning the vote of women this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than the board room economics of world trade, Gore is
focusing more on what he describes as the ``kitchen table''
economics of working families: affordable health care, pre-school
and after-school programs, quality education and protected
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident. Women constitute 53 percent of the nation's
voting population, and in the last two presidential contests, women
have given the Democratic nominee, Bill Clinton, his winning edge.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, though, Gore has trailed Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, the likely GOP presidential nominee, in various national
polls. And most troubling to the Gore campaign is that in many of
those polls, the vice president has trailed Bush among women,
sometimes by as much as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's performance among women recently prompted a stern warning
from prominent Democratic pollster Celinda Lake: ``A Democratic
presidential nominee cannot win without the support of women.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Washington Post-ABC Poll, which was published this
week, Gore ran roughly even with Bush among women, 48 percent to 46
percent, hardly enough to overcome Bush's lead among men, 51
percent to 43 percent, in the Post-ABC survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls are just moving pictures,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane
said Wednesday, as the vice president's ``prosperity'' tour entered
its second day. ``But to the degree that they are moving, they are
moving in the right direction. By this fall, we're confident that
women will recognize which presidential candidate is making
proposals relevant to their daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is counting on winning ovebout being
compassionate won't do anything,'' she said with a reference to
Bush's signature campaign slogan of ``compassionate conservatism.''
The vice president is ``promising things that are going to help me
where I live,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor was impressed after watching Gore in a 90-minute
televised forum sponsored Monday night by Oxygen, the new cable
television network developed by Oprah Winfrey and devoted to
women's issues. ``He was really honest and understanding,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions from a studio audience of 150 women,
Gore repeated many of his family-oriented proposals, rarely
contrasting himself with Bush, with one major exception: Gore's own
support for abortion rights, coupled with a pledge to appoint
Supreme Court justices he believes agree with the constitutional
right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue in the forefront of this year's debate in
this presidential election,'' Gore said, ``and let me just state
clearly again: I support a woman's right to choose. My opponent
does not.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore avoided any mention of abortion during his visit to
Pennsylvania on Wednesday. But he could not avoid a local
controversy over his pro-choice position. His scheduled appearance
at Scranton's Mercy Hospital was cancelled at the last minute after
Bishop James C. Timlin said he opposed allowing him to speak at the
Catholic facility. Gore appeared instead at the offices of Allied
Services, a not-for-profit company that specializes in
rehabilitation and nursing home care.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen promoted the Trenton, N.J., event Monday as: ``Al Gore
gets in touch with his feminine side.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, Gore has attempted to get in touch with the
``feminine side'' of American politics almost since the beginning
of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. And it
has only intensified in the year since his eight-months-pregnant
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, introduced him at his official
kick-off.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Gore and his wife, Tipper, joined talk show host
Rosie O'Donnell at a midtown Manhattan day care center where the
vice president played in the sandbox and sang his ABC's with 3- and
4-year olds.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, he made an impromptu stop at another daycare
center his motorcade passed enroute from the local pharmacy to his
health care forum.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noticed the crowd of children with crayon-scrawled
``Welcome to Scranton'' signs and stopped to chat with them for
about 10 minutes as Gore campaign film crews recorded the event,
possibly for the ``family issues'' campaign ads to be aired in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a president who understands what these kids need,''
said Dottie Shoemaker, an assistant teacher and cook at the United
Way-run center, which cares for 84 children ranging from 9 months
to 10 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has a problem in his efforts to connect with women that
Clinton never had, namely George W. Bush. Bush split the women's
vote in defeating Texas Gov. Ann Richards in 1994, then won 65
percent of that vote in his landslide re-election in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   GOP pollster Linda Divall said the governor has been able to
close the so-called gender gap by talking about issues that have
traditionally benefitted Democrats _ education, health care and
Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   At the mid-day forum on health care Wednesday, Gore called for
the creation of a Health Care Trust Fund as a first step toward
universal health care coverage for Americans. Gore's plan calls for
first extending coverage to children, then to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   He also underscored his desire to set aside Medicare funds so
they cannot be used for purposes other than the federal health
insurance program for 40 million elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore is scheduled to visit Cincinnati, where he is
expected to outline tax cuts targeted to middle-class working
families _ ``tax cuts to let families live their values _ to help
you save for college, pay for health insurance and build additional
security for your retirement,'' he said in the speech Tuesday
kicking off his ``prosperity'' tour.

 &HT;    U.S. COMMISSION TO STUDY 'SENIORITIS' IN HIGH SCHOOLS
 &HT;    380&AMP;adds
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Education Secretary Richard Riley created a
national commission Thursday to conduct a $1.1 million, year-long
study of ``senioritis'' _ the malaise that leads students to slack
off in their final year of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of our high school seniors are checking out once they
have filled out their college application or received an early
acceptance notice from college,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that helps explain why, among those graduates who go on
to college, one-third have to take remedial courses and one-fourth
never earn a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students who aren't college-bound often drift through their
entire senior year with no sense of direction,'' Riley continued.
``These young people really do have a serious case of the 'who
cares?' syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   He announced his action to more than 1,500 high school educators
and other participants in his department's conference on
``reinventing high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the audience nodded with recognition. In interviews
afterwards, several admitted the syndrome was common when they were
in school. That may be why many parents and teachers tolerate it,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of seniors, they start to fade out about
February,'' said Delores(cq) Brown of the Prince Georges Public
Schools in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have all their graduation credits, they're tired, and
they're ready to move on to the next phase in their life,'' she
said. ``It's very hard for the kids to stay focused when the
returns are intangible. Maybe more courses should be required.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few educators bristled at Riley's generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of kids study harder in the last two years,'' said Myra
Ross of Amherst Regional High School in Massachusetts. ``Once they
figure out the reasons for studying hard, they find focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Patton of Kentucky will head the panel, officially
named the Commission on the High School Senior Year. Its mission
will be to find ways to transform a year-long wait for the senior
prom and graduation ceremony into a year of educational activities
_ possibly including internships, service projects or advanced
study _ that help students move more smoothly into college, work
and adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Riley said that later this month he will name two vice chairs
and the rest of the commissioners, who are to include four students
and four members of Congress, as well as teachers, administrators,
university presidents, youth experts and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Patton said the commission will conduct studies; hold hearings
this fall for experts, students and recent graduates; issue an
interim report in December; hold more hearings, and issue a final
report next June.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has raised $740,000 of the $1.1 million budget. That
includes $400,000 from the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation of
Flint, Mich., $250,000 from the Education Department, $50,000 from
the Carnegie Corporation of New York and $40,000 from the Woodrow
Wilson National Fellowship Foundation of Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Patton, a former chairman of the Education Commission of the
States, said two incidents impelled him to take on the challenge of
finding ways to make the last year of high school more productive:
</P>
<P>
   _ His daughter Bambi taught him that reluctant students can be
motivated. When he and his wife informed Bambi that they had
received a notice that she was failing in high school, she asked
him, ``Dad, if I make the dean's list, will you get me a
Corvette?'' Figuring she couldn't, he took up the offer; she made
the dean's list, and he bought Bambi the car.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Kentucky, which uses test scores to evaluate the success of
its schools, scores rose for high schools when the tests that had
been given to laid-back seniors were instead given to strivers in
their junior year.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some educators at the conference blamed senioritis on the
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start immunizing them against senioritis in February, when
we talk to the seniors in small groups and warn them not to get on
cruise control,'' said Matt Bugg, principal of the high school in
LaQuinta, Calif. ``If they get their (college) acceptance letter
and go on auto-pilot, we remind them that a lot of colleges will
surprise them and withdraw the offer if their grades drop in the
last semester.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said that schools need to offer the students more
than one last school year consisting of seven periods a day, five
days a week.
</P>

   ``We have some of our teachers stationed at the local community
college, so kids in 11th and 12th grade can take a mix of college
and high-school courses, if that's what prepares them for what they
want next in life,'' said Terry Peluso, an assistant superintendent
for instruction at Campbell Union High School in San Jose, Calif.

   School-to-Work officials in Washington said the biggest recent
study of what high school seniors think about school is a survey of
8,663 Colorado seniors that was released last year by that state's
Schools-to-Careers program.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how often they were bored in class, 66 percent said
``most'' or ``half'' of the time, 33 percent said ``once in a
while,'' and 1 percent said ``never.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they most strongly motivated when they were interested
in the subject (96 percent), liked the teacher (79), had a
knowledgeable teacher (78) or saw how the class related to their
career interests (62).
</P>
<P>
   They said they are most interested in classes that involve
active, hands-on chances to apply a lesson (74 percent), watching
videos (68 percent) or solving real-life problems (61 percent).

that the medium's portrayal of dads is a classic case of reverse

to Father Knows Squat. There's some truth in that but there's more.
Actually, TV's portrayal of fathers today is richly diverse, from
loving, anxiety-riddled Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) on ``NYPD
Blue'' to struggling , deeply flawed Jake Manning (Jeffrey
Nordling(CQ)) on ``Once and Again.'' Ray Barone on ``Everybody
Loves Raymond'' is a weak but caring dad while Ken Titus on

 &HT;    It's all about riding Wild mountain ride
 &HT;    By David Tulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A hazy sun peeked through fingers of fog from Black
Mountain tickling the Blue Ridge Parkway. The road ahead invited us
to test its smooth, wide asphalt bent merrily around forested
hillsides. When I spotted my riding partners disappearing in a full
lean around the next curve, it dawned on me what the Honda Hoot in
Asheville, N.C., was all about. Riding.
</P>
<P>
   While the springtime gathering in Daytona Beach is about seeing
and being seen in bumper-to-bumper traffic rumbling loudly down
Fla. A1A, its northern counterpart in the lush Appalachians is
about riding challenging roads and smelling pines and damp leaves,
with cool mountain breezes cleansing your thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The South's two biggest motorcycling events couldn't be more
different. What started out six years ago as a brand-specific
gathering of Honda machinery has evolved into a general celebration
of motorcycling.
</P>
<P>
   This year, most major motorcycle manufacturers are joining the
party for a week of riding, seminars and old-fashioned Southern
hospitality Wednesday through June 24.
</P>
<P>
   Even America's venerable Harley-Davidson line participated last
year, offering test rides on its sporty Buell motorcycles just
steps away from rivals BMW, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Victory and
Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the twisty mountain roads, downtown Asheville's laid
back charm is part of the lure for riders. And local business
owners are more than happy to welcome the 10,000 riders who drop an
estimated $7.5 million on lodging, sightseeing and retail
purchases, according to the city's Convention and Visitor's Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown streets are wall-to-wall motorcycles, hundreds of
chromed cruisers sharing parking spots with gaggles of tourers and
flocks of sport bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on their immaculate yellow 1997 six-cylinder Honda
Valkyrie, a pair of newlyweds in their 30s from Williamsburg, Va.,
took in the Haywood Street scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daytona was our first motorcycle event together, but it's not
a riding experience,'' said Gary Williams.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Colleen, added, ``Daytona is one big people party, and
we're too old for that kind of partying.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple also owns a 1995 Harley cruiser. ``We can wear
leather or shorts, it doesn't matter to us. And we belong to both
HOG (Harley Owners Group) and HRCA (Honda Rider's Club of America)
so we're not snobs. The Hoot is about riding,'' said Gary Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, to learn the latest trends in motorcycling, you first
had to crank up your scooter for the scenic, but wet, 25-minute
ride from downtown Asheville to Windy Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Curious llamas looked up from their corral as a hundred
motorcyclists listened to the motorcycle industry lunch ride at
Freedom Escape Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorcycling is enjoying its biggest and best success we've
ever had. There's an incredible increase in young riders, off-road
riders, and we're paying attention to female riders, and the rapid
growth in their numbers as well,'' said Gary Christopher, Honda's
senior manager for motorcycle press.
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki's Mel Moore summed things up by saying, ``These are the
golden years of motorcycling, so enjoy them.''

DIGITAL `GYPSIES' CREATE MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' blasts off this weekend from movie theaters
around the country, with an often-striking blend of 2-D animated
characters and gorgeous 3-D computer-generated backdrops.
</P>
<P>
   The film, produced and directed by veterans Don Bluth and Gary
Goldman, is far from perfect, with a disjointed plot that doesn't
always make sense. But it's a fun ride. Its look was enlivened by a
team of self-described ``digital gypsies'' headed by two veterans
of George Lucas' operations, using remarkably inexpensive
technology to quickly craft some of its most eye-popping scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The two, David Dozoretz and Paul Martin Smith of Persistence of
Vision Digital Entertainment, had key roles on ``Star Wars: Episode
1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' as previsualization effects supervisor
and editor, respectively. They'll begin work any day now on the
next episode of ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   But between those two sagas, they got a call from 20th Century
Fox to create the ``wake angels'' and ``ice crystals'' scenes, and
to finish a third, the ``gas trees.''
</P>
<P>
   The three scenes, all stunning, were surprisingly created using
mostly off-the-shelf software and Apple Powerbook laptop computers.
And they did it fast, creating 124 effects shots in a
breathtakingly brief 58 days, which may be a world land speed
record for such normally time-gulping work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardware we used was pretty interesting,'' said Dozoretz.
``It wasn't $3 million of Unix(-based mainframe computers). We did
a lot of work on Powerbooks. You can spend half a million dollars
for all these huge servers, or you can buy 10 Macs.''
</P>
<P>
   That fast-and-cheap approach makes the results particularly
remarkable (and remarkably inexpensive), pointing once again to
where filmmaking is headed, even in one of its most tech-dependent
areas. Dozoretz, for one, is excited about the prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' Dozoretz said. ``This digital revolution
is so fabulous. You're not just editing shots any more, you're
editing stuff in the shots. The digital revolution is as big to
film as sound was. We're changing from a photographic medium to a
painterly medium.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the film's Web site, at www.afterearth.com, is
handsomely and interestingly done, with Quicktime movies of
interviews with a number of the film's principals, and clever use
of sound among other features. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Surfing Mars
</P>
<P>
   The initials in ``Titan A.E.'' stand for ``After Earth,'' for
what happens after our home planet is destroyed by an alien
species. On a somewhat less dramatic scale, NASA is planning
another kind of ``After Earth,'' sending a manned expedition to
Mars by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many challenges in that expedition will be
communication. And among the people trying to figure out how to
make it all work is Vint Cerf, the one-time UCLA researcher who
co-wrote and continues to tend the TCP/IP protocols that make the
Internet function.
</P>
<P>
   Cerf, speaking recently to the Internet Society's Los Angeles
chapter (he's the international chairman), talked a bit about the
challenges of keeping people in touch when it takes 40 minutes to
say hello.
</P>
<P>
   Cerf, now with MCI-Worldcom, is working with Mars mission
planners at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge.
And he has found the challenges of communicating with a future Mars
team go far beyond just those 40-minute delays caused by distance.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest complication is that the two planets are moving at
different speeds, he said. That enormously complicates
communication basics like data transmission rates and error
checking. And of course things like solar flares, and even the sun
itself, can interfere, making only one-way or no transmission
possible at some periods.
</P>
<P>
   So Cerf and the JPL are busy constructing an interplanetary
Internet, with a first-ever standardized communication system that
will be on all future space missions as they head into the void.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Network being created at JPL is ``the gateway to the
Mars frontier,'' Cerf said. ``We hope as each mission is launched,
we'll be able to assemble another leg of the network. We are
definitely going to have a two-planet Internet by 2008. The
Internet Society's motto is, 'The Internet is for everyone, even
martians.'''
</P>
<P>
   Want more information? Go to www.gip.org or www.ipnsig.org. You
can also look at the presentation slides Cerf used in his
wide-ranging talk at isoc.org/internet.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dale Earnhardt has slipped quietly into the No. 2 spot
in the Winston Cup standings, but his legion of fans has been
anything but silent.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt backers began lighting up the switchboard at Atlanta
Motor Speedway on Monday, one day after the 49-year-old veteran
finished second at Michigan Speedway. The race moved Earnhardt to
the runner-up position in points, 98 behind leader Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Intimidator'' is tied with Richard Petty for the most
Winston Cup championships with seven each. And AMS is the site of
the final event of the season, the NAPA 500 on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   So, some Earnhardt fans are planning far in advance for the
possible historic moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we've had some calls from the Earnhardt fans _ people who
haven't been here in a few years,'' said Ed Clark, AMS president
and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are milestones in any sport,'' Clark said, ``but if Dale
could win an eighth championship, it would be a major milestone for
his career and the sport as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup schedule has not reached the halfway point yet,
but the 15th of 34 races will be Sunday's Pocono 500. Unlike the
past several years, Earnhardt has been consistent all season.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has finished in the top 10 in 11 races and in the top
three in six races. His lone victory of the season was by a couple
of inches over Labonte in the first Atlanta race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a few years ago, people would tell you (an eighth title)
would never happen,'' Clark said. ``But you can never rule out a
competitor like Dale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has got some good cars to work with this year, and I think
that his back problems _ which required offseason surgery _ were
bothering him more than he let on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like he is feeling better,'' Clark said. ``He looks
like his old self. Whatever it is, the fire is back in Dale again.
</P>
<P>
   As always, when Earnhardt is in the championship race, the
residual effect is felt all over NASCAR, especially at the ticket
booth.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Page, president and general manger of Sears Point Raceway,
said he noticed an increase in Earnhardt fans calling about next
weekend's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime Earnhardt is doing well, fans seem to come out of the
woodwork to support him,'' Page said. ``And if he continues to do
well and stay in the points race, it will generate a ton of
attention for the sport.''

 &HT;    COELHO RESIGNS AS GORE CAMPAIGN CHIEF; DALEY NAMED
 &HT;    740&AMP;add
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Vice President Al Gore's campaign underwent its
second major makeover in a year Thursday when Tony Coelho resigned
as chairman for health reasons and was replaced by Commerce
Secretary William Daley.
</P>
<P>
   The affect of the change at the top of the Gore campaign was not
immediately apparent, but comes at a crucial time. With only five
months remaining before the general election, Republican rival
George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, stubbornly holds a slight
lead in the polls and the Democratic vice president is searching
for a coherent campaign message.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore is losing an effective strategist in Coelho, he also
is free of further political embarrassment over a government ethics
investigation of his outgoing campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   And in Daley, he has a seasoned political operative with
experience in four presidential campaigns and a household name in
the crucial electoral state of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton always respected his (Daley's) political
judgment,'' said Frank Greer, who was President Clinton's chief
media consultant in 1992. ``In fact, I was surprised he (Daley)
didn't run the reelection campaign (in 1996). He understands the
modern political campaign, much more than Tony ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley, 51, a banker and lawyer by trade, came to Clinton's
assistance in the dark days of the 1992 New Hampshire primary amid
news reports of Clinton's marital infidelity, his avoidance of
military service during the Vietnam War and drug experimentation as
a Rhodes Scholar in England.
</P>
<P>
   Daley ran the 1996 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
Most recently, he was one of the major forces behind the
administration's push for normalized trade relations with China.
The measure passed the House and awaits Senate action.
</P>
<P>
   He also is the brother of Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and son
of the legendary city boss, Mayor Richard J. Daley. His first
exposure to presidential politics was as a teenager at the 1960
convention that nominated John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, widely regarded as the most politically savvy of Clinton
cabinet members, will officially assume his campaign post July 15,
just weeks before the national conventions of both parties. But he
plans meetings with Gore strategists this weekend in Washington
before visiting the Gore campaign headquarters in Nashville next
week.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate announcement from the White House on a
replacement for Daley in the final seven months of the Clinton
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Coelho's resignation drew a surprisingly
partisan response from the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish (Coelho) well and hope his health improves,'' said
Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes. ``I wonder whether naming a new
chairman involves yet another reinvention of the Gore campaign.
Which Vice President Gore will campaign next week?''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, 58, hospitalized in Virginia since Monday night with
diverticulitis, an inflammation of the intestine, issued a
statement saying he was stepping down from the Gore campaign on the
advice of his doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctors have told me that I need to slow down, eat better
and travel less for a period of time,'' his statement said.
``Unfortunately, none of this advice is consistent with the rigors
of chairing a presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent telephone interview with The Associated Press,
Coelho also disclosed that his doctors had warned that seizures
from the epilepsy he has suffered from most of his life could
increase in frequency with the pace of the upcoming general
election.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign announced Coelho's resignation in a prepared
statement as the vice president flew from New York to a
family-owned food wholesaler in the Cincinnati area to promote tax
cuts targeted to middle class families as part of his ``progress
and prosperity'' tour of battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   Later, with Daley at his side, the noticeably upbeat vice
president met with reporters in the wholesaler's warehouse to
discuss what impact Coelho's departure and Daley's arrival will
have on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Coelho led this campaign to a tremendous victory in the
primaries, and he has put an incredible team in place for the
general election,'' Gore said. As for Daley, ``he has done an
outstanding job in everything he has done,'' Gore added. ``I'm
thrilled that he has agreed to take over the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he did not anticipate any other major changes in his
campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Story can end here. Optional add follows &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coelho notified Gore of his decision to step down during a
telephone conversation late Wednesday. Gore then consulted by
telephone with his wife Tipper, who was campaigning in Florida,
before calling Daley shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Daley joked that he initially thought the vice president was
calling about being his running mate. He said he eagerly accepted
the chairmanship because ``it is the most important election that
most of us have been involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho took control of the Gore campaign in May 1999, bringing
political focus and fiscal discipline to a bloated and spendthrift
organization. With primary rival Bill Bradley showing surprising
strength in the Democratic contest, Coelho engineered a crucial
early endorsement of Gore by the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gore chose Coelho after extensive consultations with
Daley.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho oversaw the tactical move of the Gore campaign from
Washington to Nashville last fall and helped hone the attacks that
quickly ended Bradley's dreams of upsetting the vice president in
the Democratic presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   But with his political skills, Coelho also brought controversy.
He had resigned from a California congressional seat in 1989 amid
charges that he had failed to disclose a $50,000 loan he had
received from a Beverly Hills savings and loan association.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Congress, he became wealthy as a Wall Street and
Washington consultant and as a member of scores of corporations. He
was the chief Democratic strategist in the 1994 election that led
to the first Republican majority in the House of Representatives in
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Coelho served as the American ambassador to the the
1998 World Exposition in Portugal. But earlier this year, he became
the focus of a government investigation stemming from a State
Department audit that questioned his handling of the finances
related to the Exposition.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Coelho's ethical problems was a concern in
relation to his campaign against Bush, Gore replied, ``Not in the
least.'' And the vice president declined to respond to Bush's
prediction, made two weeks ago, that the Gore campaign would
eventually ``dump'' Coelho.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment on that, nor would I dignify that with a
comment,'' Gore said.

 &HT;    CLINTON ANNOUNCES GRANTS TO CLOSE HISPANIC EDUCATION GAP
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced more grants Thursday to
help close a long-standing shortfall in educational achievement
among Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of gaps that we all want to close. Most
of them are narrowing, but we've still got a lot of work to do,''
Clinton told legislators and educators attending a Session on
Improving Hispanic Student Achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic Education Action Plan program will be increased by
$436 million to support academic programs, student services and
faculty development for Hispanic students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the funds would address several goals over 10
years:
</P>
<P>
   _ Enrolling children in quality early childhood programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improving proficiency in English.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing test scores.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing high school graduation rates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Doubling college graduation rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing this achievement gap is a challenge that may seem
daunting now, but it will seem inevitable once we do it,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, addressing the one-day session at the
White House via satellite from New York, also announced that
federal agencies, corporations and non-profit groups would jointly
provide outreach programs and technical assistance to Hispanic
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never be satisfied with a Hispanic dropout rate that
hovers around 30 percent. We have to do better,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the partnership, to be called the 2010 Alliance,
``is designed to to remind the nation of these goals, and to spur
commitments at every level of government in the private sector to
help meet them.''
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Council of Economic Advisers released at the
conference says the high school completion rate for Hispanics is 63
percent compared with 88 percent for whites and African Americans.
That gap ``must decrease,'' said panelists, ``in order for
Hispanics to compete in the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the session, panelists broke into groups to discuss Clinton's
plan to improve all levels of education, from preschool through
college, among Hispanic students. Higher achievement levels can be
obtained by tackling the problem at the grass roots, said
panelists.

   HARVARD-BSCHOOL (Boston) _ The Harvard Business School, the West
Point of big business, has transformed itself to maintain its
dominance in the new economy. Its general management course has

NO NOD FOR JACK E. ROBINSON, BUSH AIDES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ Governor George W. Bush will not under any
circumstances endorse Jack E. Robinson for Senate, senior Bush
aides said Thursday, despite Robinson's prediction that an
endorsement was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived in the Bay State Thursday after campaigning earlier
in Maine, where he unveiled a major policy initiative for the
disabled, proposing to spend $880 million over five years to help
the disabled gain increased access to jobs, housing, and public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He then flew to Boston, where he raised between $1 million and
$1.5 million in campaign contributions at two fund-raisiers, party
officials said. Robinson, who is waging a troubled Senate bid
without the support of the state Republican Party because of past
allegations of sexual misbehavior, paid to attend the first Bush
fund-raiser, a $1,000-per-person event.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush declined to give Robinson his support. And during an
afternoon session with reporters at Logan International Airport,
Bush denied he had ever heard of the candidate, despite Robinson's
claims of knowing the Bush family for years.
</P>
<P>
   Following the example of Governor Paul Cellucci, who disavowed
any relationship with the Robinson campaign in March, the Bush
campaign also ruled out the idea of backing the Republican
candidate, even though he is trying to unseat Democratic Senator
Edward M. Kennedy, said Bush communications director Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no endorsement planned, and there will be no
endorsement, planned or otherwise,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, flanked by Governor Paul Cellucci and Lieutenant Governor
Jane Swift as he stood under grey skies on the tarmac, said he
would discuss the Robinson matter with the governor. He declined to
dismiss Robinson outright, but did say: ``It's hard to endorse
somebody you've never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier television interview, Robinson insisted he would
prevail in his effort to win Bush's endorsement, even though
Cellucci had written him off. ``We don't need Govenor Cellucci to
get to Governor Bush,'' Robinson said. ``I've known the Bushes a
lot longer than Cellucci has.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush spent the morning focusing on an issue that had
been a priority of his father's administration: Assisting the
disabled. The proposal was divided into three pillars: Promoting
independent living for the disabled, making the workplace more
hospitable toward handicapped employees and encouraging better
handicapped access to community life.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement timed to coincide with the 10-year
anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act,
Bush said he would spend the $880 million to help the disabled gain
access to jobs and enjoy the benefits of technological advances. He
also proposed reforming the Section 8 Housing program to allow the
disabled to use their housing vouchers as a down payment on a
house, an initiative he said would cost $20 million in federal
matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $10 million would be used to help organizations
that are currently exempt from complying with the ADA regulations,
so that they could rebuild their facilities to accommodate the
disabled. Currenty, churches, mosques, synagogues and other civic
organizations do not have to comply with wheelchair and other
building regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the ADA, and I'm really proud that it was my
father's signature that made the law become real,'' the Texas
governor said. ``People with disabilities confront hardship every
day of their lives. To me that leaves our society with a simple
choice, whether to add to that hardship or to try to lessen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, however, policy was overshadowed by
political developments, including confirmation that Bush's former
rival, Arizona Senator John S. McCain, will speak at the Republican
convention next month and play, in the words of one aide, a
``prominent role.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides also confirmed they had discussed the idea of not
having a keynote speaker at the convention, in order to create an
``untraditional convention atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters later in the day, Bush also refused to
cede Massachusetts to his rival, Vice President Al Gore, despite
the state's overwhelmingly liberal politics. ``Wait a minute!''
Bush said, laughing, when a reporter suggested he might not win the
state in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize this is a Democrat state, but there have been some
notable exceptions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second of last night's fundraisers, a dinner in Boston's
financial district, cost $20,000 per couple and officially
benefited the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to fly to Ohio and Kentucky Friday for
campaigning. He is not scheduled to return to Boston until Oct. 3,
when he will debate Vice President Al Gore in the first of a series
of presidential debates.

CRIME WORSE THAN EVER IN YEARS AFTER MURDER OF IRISH CRUSADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Four years ago, Veronica Guerin, a reporter whose work
shone a relentless light on this country's burgeoning underworld,
was shot dead as she sat in her car at a traffic light, and Ireland
was changed utterly.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, organized crime was all but ignored and gangland
leaders operated with relative impunity. But while laws aimed at
the underworld have been toughened and those who murdered Guerin
have been brought to justice, the problems she exposed have only
gotten worse. Ireland is awash in drugs, and organized crime,
despite unprecedented pressure by police, has never been more
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Guerin has been forgotten. With the fourth
anniversary of her murder upcoming June 26, a memorial to her was
recently unveiled on the campus of Trinity College. Last month,
during a conference in Boston, the Vienna-based International Press
Institute honored Guerin. And Friday, a film based on the last few
years of her life, ``When the Sky Falls,'' opens in Dublin and
London.
</P>
<P>
   But in the four years since her murder, the number of heroin
addicts in Dublin has nearly doubled to about 13,000, health
officials say. Drug pushers have slashed the price of heroin and
junkies can get a fix for about $5, the cheapest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Junkies walk the streets aimlessly or lounge bleary-eyed in the
city's parks and public places. One day last week, a couple of
addicts lay passed out, in an unconscious embrace, on a bench
outside the gleaming Financial Services center at the mouth of the
River Liffey, a temple to Ireland's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Guerin, 38 at the time of her death, exposed the venality of
Dublin's gangsters, the obscene profits they were making by turning
one generation after another into heroin-addicted zombies, and the
seeming inability of the Irish authorities to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   For that she was first shot in the leg as a warning, then, when
she wouldn't back off, assassinated. In response to the public
outrage at her murder, which cost Ireland its most courageous
reporter and a 6-year-old boy his mother, the government passed
sweeping laws allowing authorities to seize the assets of anyone
who cannot explain where he got his money.
</P>
<P>
   The Garda Siochana, Ireland's national police force, carried out
the biggest criminal investigation in the history of the Irish
Republic, which led to the arrest and conviction of several men who
carried out her murder.
</P>
<P>
   The underworld leader who allegedly ordered her murder, John
Gilligan, will soon go on trial, and there seems little doubt that
he will spend the rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the war over Northern Ireland winds down, the battle
over the lucrative narcotics trade has heated up. Police resources
that used to be spent on anti-terrorism are now devoted to
combating drugs. But it is a Sisyphean task. Many Irish gangsters
have simply picked up and moved to the Netherlands, where the use
of some narcotics is decriminalized, and police are not as
aggressive in going after drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cusack, who covers law enforcement for The Irish Times, said
the laws created after Guerin's murder have helped the police seize
more than $20 million in criminal assets, but haven't curtailed the
influence of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now just an offshore outpost of a European criminal
problem,'' said Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   The gangsters who killed Guerin hoped they would silence other
reporters as well. To some extent, they have, said Emily O'Reilly,
who wrote a book about the murder and its aftermath. Guerin was
famous for confronting criminals face-to-face. No one has done that
since, said O'Reilly, who says such restraint is a sign of prudent,
not frightened, journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Her book, ``The Life and Death of a Crime Reporter,'' was
critical of Guerin for taking what O'Reilly considered unnecessary
risks and personalizing journalistic attacks on reputed criminals.
But O'Reilly reserved special condemnation for Guerin's editors at
the Sunday Independent, whom O'Reilly accuses of not doing enough
to dissuade Guerin from risking her life even as they failed to buy
her a life insurance policy. The newspaper eventually gave Guerin's
husband a large lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Guerin was killed, her replacement, Liz Allen,
scaled a fence to confront Gilligan's wife at home, and he later
called Allen to deny involvement in the murder. O'Reilly said Allen
has since been advised by her editors not to engage in the kind of
confrontations that made Guerin famous.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Kealy, the Sunday Independent's deputy editor and news
editor, denied that he or other editors had ordered Allen to steer
clear of criminals. But he acknowledged that Guerin's murder, which
he and others thought unimaginable before it happened, changed the
way editors assess the risks to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were careful with Veronica,'' Kealy insisted. ``And there
are things we can do to protect Liz.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Guerin felt the need to confront criminals in person
to get their side of the story is that Ireland's strict libel laws
make it legally risky to cast aspersions in print, even on
gangsters. There has been no political groundswell to change the
laws, Cusack argues, because they benefit politicians who do not
have to worry about scrutiny of their personal lives or of the
widespread corruption now plaguing the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new movie and the renewed focus on Guerin's life have
encouraged antidrug activists in some of Dublin's poorest
neighborhoods. At a special screening of the film, Sadie Grace, who
coordinates the Dublin Citywide Antidrugs Campaign, asked for a
moment's silence to remember Guerin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children are being killed on a weekly basis here and
nobody cares,'' said Grace. ``If the government cared the way
Veronica Guerin cared, we wouldn't be having the deaths we're
having.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggie O'Kane, a reporter for The Guardian, a leading British
newspaper, does not think that the authorities' inability to curb
the kind of crime that Guerin put in the spotlight is a slight to
her memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just read the autobiography of Martha Gellhorn, who was
Ernest Hemingway's companion, and it made me think of Veronica,''
O'Kane said. ``When she was in her 80s, Gellhorn pondered her own
legacy, concluding that while maybe not one word she wrote had made
any difference, that was nothing to regret. Her duty, she said, was
to try to make a difference. And Veronica tried. God knows,
Veronica tried.''

BACK FROM NORTH, SOUTH KOREAN LEADER SAYS `NEW DAY IS BEGINNING' 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SKOREA-NKOREA-ASSESS, SKOREA-NKOREA-REACT) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ In a triumphant return home from his summit
meeting with North Korea, President Kim Dae-jung on Thursday told
jubilant South Koreans that ``a new day is beginning'' for their
divided nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Pyongyang, I realized Pyongyang is our land.
People in Pyongyang are our people. And they have deep-rooted love
for their southern compatriots,'' the South Korean president said
in an address at the airport as he returned from three days of
talks with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the juncture of opening a new chapter in our
history, putting an end to 55 years of division and hostility,''
Kim Dae-jung told the thousands of children and officials who
turned out to give him a hero's welcome.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, the president's motorcade drove past cheering
crowds, as tens of thousands of colorful balloons were released
into the skies over downtown Seoul. As the limousines moved through
the city, many South Koreans sang ``Our Wish Is Unification,'' a
song popular on both sides of the two nations' heavily fortified
border.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the two leaders also sang the song at a
lavish banquet while joining hands.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving home, the South Korean leader tried to calm
concerns among his allies in Washington and Tokyo that security
concerns had been ignored during the talks. During his speech at
the airport, Kim Dae-jung said that he and Kim Jung Il had indeed
had frank discussions on sensitive security issues, including the
North's nuclear and missile programs as well as the 37,000 U.S.
soldiers stationed in the South.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean president did not describe in detail what he
and the North Korean had had said about the issues, which were not
mentioned in their final agreement signed on Wednesday. He only
said their talks had been frank and productive.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Dialogue was very useful, and I was able to confirm that there
are things that have a bright prospect for resolution,'' the South
Korean president said. He added that they also talked about South
Korea's controversial National Security Law, which is frequently
used to crack down on leftists and North Korean sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, which produced a common agenda for national
reconciliation and _ theoretically _ eventual reunification, will
of course face many obstacles before it is implemented. Still, the
agreement was widely praised Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in the case of the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the
agreement constitutes a major change toward peace,'' said Japan's
prime minister, Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   China, communist North Korea's one remaining true ally, also
hailed the accord in unusually strong terms. ``The Chinese side has
positively rejoiced over the success of the summit and wishes to
extend its congratulations,'' said Zhu Bangzao, a foreign ministry
spokesman in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States, which has continued to station troops in
South Korea to defend against attack from the north, was
considerably more guarded in its praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, a reduction in tensions is important, but on the
specific issue of possible missile threats, I haven't seen nor
heard of anything in the summit that negates that,'' said Richard
Boucher, the State Department spokesman. The Clinton
administration, citing the potential threat from North Korea's long
range ballistic missile program, has proposed developing an
anti-missile shield to guard against what it considers ``rogue
states'' like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian Foreign Ministry had nothing but praise Thursday
on the outcome of the summit. The two Koreas ``will have to do a
great deal of difficult work to overcome the mutual prejudice and
mistrust that had been accumulating for decades,'' a ministry
statement said. ``Russia intends to make an active contribution to
this process.'' And, in fact, President Vladimir Putin is to make
the first visit by a Russian president to North Korea this year,
probably in July.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The final accord also included agreements on family reunions,
political prisoners, and a common pledge not to engage in offensive
military operations against each other. And the two sides covered
other things as well, like rail connections, hotlines between
leaders, offices in each other's capitals and joint economic
development projects.
</P>
<P>
   While the two countries have agreed to many things in the past,
it has never been done at the level of a summit meeting _ and never
with such apparent goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a surprise greeting at the Pyongyang airport by
the 58-year-old Kim Jong Il, the meetings between the two men
seemed to evolve into a rolling, emotional getting-to-know you
party. So warm were the currents between them by the end that the
two men embraced firmly on the tarmac just before the visiting
leader boarded his return flight home.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean president's wife, Lee Hee-ho, wept as she
followed behind her 75-year-old husband to the departing plane
while thousands of official greeters waved pink paper flowers,
copies of the Kim Jong Ilia, a specially cultivated azalea that is
the North Korean dictator's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the goodwill, hard questions over the implementation of
the agreement are expected to emerge in the coming days. But few in
Seoul seem likely to forget the extraordinary distance traveled in
the short time since secret talks began between the two sides in
Beijing in April. So completely had their history of war and
hostile ideologies separated them, in fact, that even the Korean
language they both use had evolved in ways that made it difficult
to draft talking papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so exciting that I am sort of floating right now,'' said
Chang Ching-wee, a political scientist at Yonsei University. ``It
is difficult to think.''
</P>
<P>
   But Park then quickly grew sober and spoke of the difficult work
ahead that will be required to transform the diplomatic feats of
Pyongyang into lasting political achievements. ``It will take time
and continuous effort to implement what these two gentlemen have
agreed upon. Everyone is excited because this was so unexpected,
but there will be surely be difficulties ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials speaking off the record, and others who
watch relations between the two Koreas closely say that a rough
sequence of events has already been outlined, and that many of the
ideas emerged in rough form in six or more secret talks held before
the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to look at what just happened as
ceremonial,'' said one senior South Korean official. ``But many
points were worked on beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   He indicated that for each side to secure the other's
confidence, North Korea would make possible dramatic reunions for a
symbolic but significant number of the nearly 2 million South
Korean families which have lost contact with their relatives in the
north since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The South, meanwhile, will extend millions of dollars worth of
financial assistance to the North, whose collapsing barter economy
has suffered repeated famines in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Only after these steps have been reached will serious talks
begin on security issues, and a visit to Seoul by Kim Jong Il,
which is seen as am important gauge here of his commitment to
further progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hunch is that the two sides will work on the family issue
with the International Red Cross, and at least 100 families will be
brought together,'' said Park Young Ho, director of the Center for
North Korean Social and Human Rights. ``The north will also
probably cooperate in establishing lists of survivors. The
groundwork for all of this has already been laid, I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Many will also be watching for signs that North Korea is sharing
the news of these recent events in a more generous and
straightforward way than it has in the past, including during the
summit, when Kim Dae Jung's words were not broadcast to the
communist nation.
</P>
<P>
   This task will pose special challenges for a totalitarian
leadership whose censorship and manipulation of information is
extreme even by communist standards. According to South Korean
officials, Kim Jong Il himself has only spoken on the air in his
country once or twice at most since taking power after his father's
death in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many experts said there were reasons to hope that the
previously little known leader's self-assured performance during
the summit will encourage further confidence building and
moderation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had a real purchase on the strength of the hold the
regime has on its people,'' said Leon V. Sigal, a North Korea
expert at the Social Science Research Council in New York. ``All
this speaks of a lot of self-confidence which may mean they are
ready to begin doing things a bit differently.''

KOBE BRYANT FINDS HIS TRIDE IN OT THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The game was in overtime. The Lakers had just
lost Shaquille O'Neal to fouls. The capacity crowd at Conseco
Fieldhouse sensed that it was time, at last, for their Pacers to
pull it out.
</P>
<P>
   There was someone else who had other ideas. As Shaq took his
seat on the bench, 21-year-old Kobe Bryant, who pushes the
definition of precocious to the max, chatted up teammate Brian Shaw
during a break in the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this situation, Jordan wouldn't let his team lose,'' Bryant
told Shaw amid all the clamor. ``Why should I let this team lose?''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scored 6 of his 28 points in the final 2:33, including
the clincher with 5.9 seconds left, to give the Lakers a 120-118
victory and a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals. Los Angeles can clinch
its first title in 12 years with a victory Friday night in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Hoop historians may well look back on Wednesday's OT epic and
see it as a watershed moment in Bryant's young career. He's
completing his fourth NBA season and, with his compelling
performance Wednesday, is again eliciting comparisons to Michael
Jordan. He uses the same phrases (``my thought process was . . .
''). He makes the same gestures, such as the open hands out in a
calming maneuver. He plays a similar game, from the slashing, to
the top-of-the-key shots, to the hesitation jumpers in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't there yet, but the more we see, the more we think he's
got a chance.
</P>
<P>
   As he dropped two long jumpers, made the clincher on a
where-did-he-come-from? second chancer and, let's not forget, came
up with a huge block on Austin Croshere, his veteran teammate (and
former Jordan running mate) Ron Harper looked on in equal parts
admiration and wonder. Had he seen this before?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just oohing and aahing,'' Harper said. ``He is who he
is, a kid who loves the game and is happy to do his thing. He would
tell you, I was just having fun. That's fun to him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely the way Bryant described his feelings after the
big OT performance.
</P>
<P>
   This is fun for him. It's a moment he's been preparing for since
he started playing the game in Italy as the son of ex-NBA player
Joe Bryant. It's almost been scripted since then. He entered the
NBA after high school, already mature beyond his years because of
his European upbringing and family background. He ended up going to
the Lakers via trade in a deal that may well go down as one of
general manager Jerry West's best and boldest.
</P>
<P>
   And through some roller-coaster times, ranging from playoff
upheavals to coaching changes to spats with Shaq, it all has come
together this year. He's a consensus All-Star, a consensus
All-Defensive team performer, and, as we saw Wednesday, more than
capable of carrying a team when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   After O'Neal fouled out, LA coach Phil Jackson, who knows a
thing or two about Jordan, called for his spread offense, which
basically gives Bryant the ball as well as the green light. That
was all Kobe needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had that look in his eye that he was not going to be
denied,'' Shaw said. ``He is not affected by pressure at all. Not
at all. He is in attack mode all the time. We knew one thing. We
knew he wasn't going to pass, so it was good to get out of his
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Pacers figured that out and, eventually, made
Bryant give up the ball after he drained the two long jumpers. That
enabled him to sneak out from under the backboard to retrieve
Shaw's errant shot and coax in a reverse layup. It was his fourth
hoop of the overtime and capped a remarkable stretch in which the
Lakers converted on all eight possessions. By the time Reggie
Miller's potential winner bounced away, it was almost forgotten
that he had gone 47 minutes on a bum left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' saluted Larry Bird Thursday, himself no
stranger to such heroics. ``Every shot was, you know, all net. I
mean, it wasn't even close. He made big play after big play. I
thought Reggie came back and made some big plays, but we knew Kobe
was going to take over. It's just that we didn't stop him. And it
was awesome. I mean, he really played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant has been making a slow but steady case as the logical Air
Apparent since arriving in the NBA. Thursday, former Nets coach
John Calipari, who drafted Kerry Kittles instead of Bryant,
recalled seeing a talented kid with boundless promise during a New
Jersey workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners couldn't believe I was even considering Kobe,''
said Calipari, who had the eighth pick. ``My feeling was that he
and Kerry would be about the same for the first couple years, but
after that, this kid could be off the charts in five years. Kerry
was a safer pick. Plus, Kobe had never been through adversity and
this was, after all, New Jersey. And we were worried we'd be able
to keep him. His agent didn't want him there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant ended up going 13th in the 1996 draft to Charlotte who,
in an arranged deal, then sent him to the Lakers for Vlade Divac.
Less than one month later, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the
Lakers and the seeds were sown. But it was not until the arrival of
Jackson, Jordan's old coach, that Bryant, Shaq, and the Lakers got
it all together. Jackson encouraged Bryant to be more selfless, to
trust his teammates, to try and not do everything. Bryant ended up
leading the Lakers in assists and steals and was second in scoring,
rebounding, and minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson referred Thursday to the challenge of trying to keep
Bryant's ``impulsivity'' in check. At the same time, the coach also
knew when it was time to loosen the reins and, in that regard, he
and Bryant were on the same page in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   As they broke from a discussion following O'Neal's departure,
the two made eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had already said, `OK, OK,' '' Jackson said. ``That was
basically our check-off signal.''
</P>
<P>
   That also was the signal that every NBA team is going to see
more often in the coming years. As dominating as Shaq is and will
continue to be, it's terrifying to think of where Bryant might be
headed. He gave us all a sneak preview in Game 4. And, just like
Mike, he finished what he started.

 THE INVESTOR TASTE TEST: A DESIGNER PIZZA OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 18)  
 By   SANA9   SIWOLOP10   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philly &UR; 11 &LR;  cheese steak. Thai chicken with roasted peanuts and
ginger sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Purists may cringe, but these are the kinds of toppings that
California Pizza Kitchen sprinkles over its paper-thin crusts, to
the delight of new-wave pizza fans in 21 states.
</P>
<P>
   While the designer pies have won a following, the question of
whether investors will develop a similar taste will be answered
only in July, when the chain, based in Los Angeles, is expected to
go public.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the company had not set a price for its offering
or announced how many shares would be available. According to its
prospectus, it wants to use the proceeds to pay back about $40
million in bank debt and to buy back some of its $45.4 million of
preferred stock.
</P>
<P>
   The chain has had a mixed record since a pair of lawyers, Larry
S. Flax and Richard L. Rosenfield &UR; 12 &LR; , founded it 15 years ago.
During its first seven years, it had a relatively low-key growth
plan, gradually opening 23 restaurants. But in 1992, Pepsico bought
a controlling interest, and California Pizza binged &UR; 13 &LR; , opening 60
outlets in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that under Pepsico's stewardship, the chain showed
little aptitude for picking viable locations or maintaining
quality. In 1996, sales actually declined at restaurants open at
least a year. That year, Pepsico decided to focus on its soft-drink
business, and in 1997 Bruckmann &UR; 14 &LR; , Rosser &UR; 15 &LR; , Sherrill &AMP;
Co &UR; 16 &LR; ., a New York investment firm, bought a 67.4 percent stake,
which is now down to 39.5 percent. The founders remain co-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   After Pepsico's departure, the company closed 16 of the 60
restaurants it built in its fast-expansion days. It has since
followed a conservative growth plan and now has 100 restaurants to
its name, 74 of them company-owned. It has upgraded food quality
while keeping high service standards, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   California Pizza is part of what the industry calls the
casual-dining category _ a segment whose sales are expected to grow
8.7 percent a year over the next five years, according to
Technomic &UR; 17 &LR; , a Chicago consulting firm, versus just 5.7 percent
for the overall industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some of California Pizza's recent figures have been strong.
Sales at company-owned restaurants grew 6.1 percent in 1998, 4.1
percent in 1999 and 6.8 percent during the first three months of
2000. That compares with just 0.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers impress Ron Paul, president of Technomic &UR; 17 &LR; ,
because the casual-dining segment considers annual growth of 2 to 3
percent as ``pretty good.'' He also likes that the average check
for California Pizza customers is just $10.50; he thinks
casual-dining customers see $10-and-under bills as good value.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not the hottest market in which to sell
restaurant shares. The Standard &AMP; Poor's restaurants index is down
20 percent over the last 12 months. The new-issue market itself is
rife with postponements and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   California Pizza reported total debt of $40.1 million on April
2. Last year, earnings fell 48.6 percent, to $5.4 million, while
overall sales grew 7.2 percent, to $1.79 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While it is evident that premium pizza is not merely a fad, Phil
Lempert &UR; 18 &LR; , the editor of the Lempert &UR; 18 &LR;  Report, an industry
newsletter in Santa Monica, Calif., said California Pizza would
have to spend heavily on advertising to remind the public that it
also has other items on its menu.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Randall Hiatt &UR; 19 &LR; , a consultant at Fessel &UR; 20 &LR; 
International in Irvine &UR; 21 &LR; , Calif., question whether California
Pizza can expand effectively outside its Western base. He wonders
if the chain is now growing too slowly. While investors have
punished restaurant companies that expanded too quickly in the
mid-1990s &UR; 22 &LR; , he thinks they are now rewarding those that are
pursuing sustained growth, like the Cheesecake Factory and P.F.
Chang's &UR; 23 &LR;  China Bistro, whose numbers of outlets are growing at
least 15 to 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   California Pizza has opened only 10 company-owned restaurants
since the beginning of 1998; four are under construction. ``I don't
think the market will sustain low growth in this industry,''
Hiatt &UR; 19 &LR;  said. ``I think the company is going to have to expand
geographically.''(BOX) &QL;

THE TORTOISES AND THE HARES, IN A DEAD HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ill.)   (For release Sunday, June 18)  
 &HT;     By MARK HULBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do Internet-based newsletters have better investment records
than those of the stamp-and-post variety?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why investors would want an advisory service
that can deliver advice to them instantly over the Internet.
Newsletters that travel through the regular mail seem old-fashioned
and ill-equipped to deal with modern, whipsawing markets.
</P>
<P>
   My response: Don't worry whether a service delivers advice via
the Web. It has no discernible relationship to performance.
</P>
<P>
   I reached this conclusion after separating into two categories
all the advisory services I monitor _ those that use the Internet
to communicate with their subscribers and those that don't. To
include performance history for years before e-mail and the Web, I
also included in the first camp services that rely on faxes, phone
hot lines, and other means of quick communication.
</P>
<P>
   For the nearly 20 years from mid-1980, when I started monitoring
the newsletter industry, through April 30 this year, services in
the quick-communication group produced a 10.9 percent annualized
return, versus 10.5 percent for the regular-mail group. The
difference is small enough that the results could be called a
statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   My study took into account the fact that some advisers have
switched in recent years from an exclusive reliance on the mail to
quicker communication mediums _ their performance before the switch
was credited to the second group, their performance after the
switch to the first. Such services make particularly good
illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Consider BI Research, edited by Tom Bishop, who inaugurated a
telephone hotline at the beginning of 1996 and more recently began
communicating with subscribers via e-mail. I calculate that for the
12 years through 1995, during which Bishop relied solely on regular
mail, his advice produced a 14.2 percent annualized return _ half a
percentage point behind the Wilshire 5000. For the four-plus years
since then, his advice has produced a 15.2 percent annualized
return, 7.1 points behind the Wilshire.
</P>
<P>
   So while BI Research has had a slightly greater return after
shifting to quick access, relative to the broad market, its
performance has been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't a newsletter's ability to communicate quickly with
subscribers improve performance? My guess is that the advisers'
ability to make virtually instantaneous modifications to their
model portfolios can tempt them into self-destructive actions.
</P>
<P>
   An example of such behavior would be selling winning securities
too soon. All investors, of course, are vulnerable to this
tendency, known among behavioral researchers as the disposition
effect. But being able to communicate instantly with subscribers is
likely to heighten the temptation, which can have especially
damaging results in a bull market. I suspect that one intraday
price spike in a solid, long-term holding is more likely to
influence a sale if an adviser relies on the Web to reach clients.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Web-based letters may also be likely to exit
the market too soon. Researchers have found that advisers tend to
become more risk-averse as their perspective becomes shorter-term _
a tendency called ``myopic risk aversion'' by Richard Thaler, an
economics professor at the University of Chicago and Shlomo
Benartzi, an accounting professor at the University of California
at Los Angeles. An example of the effect: Investors who are
restricted from changing the asset allocation in their retirement
plans more than a few times a year tend to be more heavily invested
in equities than those who can alter it daily.
</P>
<P>
   Myopic risk aversion probably helped those advisers who used
quick communication during the spring correction in stocks. But
because the market should outperform other asset classes over time,
the tendency should eventually cause their returns to be lower than
they would be otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors shouldn't automatically dismiss a service
because it is Web-based. Rather, the lesson here is that one's odds
of success are not much influenced by Web sites, fax services and
hot lines.
</P>
<P>
   Internet revolution or not, the key to picking an adviser is a
good long-term record. &QL;

NEW HEDGE FUND WILL SEEK LOWER RETURNS, SOROS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Insisting that he plans to withdraw from hands-on
management of his huge hedge funds, which once swung the world's
markets, George Soros said Thursday that a $6.5 billion fund to be
introduced next month would seek lower returns and be run in part
by outside money managers.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, whose Quantum Fund has been hit by the resignations of
top managers and a flight of investors' cash, told reporters here
that his Quantum Emerging Growth Fund would be merged with the
Quantum Fund on July 1 to create the Quantum Endowment Fund. He
described it in a letter to shareholders as ``a structure that will
last beyond my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new fund would be less leveraged than the Quantum
Fund in its heyday, when Soros, the Hungarian-born financier,
became known for coups like betting against the pound during the
1992 British financial crisis. The move reportedly netted Soros $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement comes after weeks of turmoil that began
when two senior managers, Stanley Druckenmiller and Nicholas
Roditi, left in April. Since March, assets in Soros' funds have
dropped to $11 billion from $19 billion as investors withdrew and
technology stocks fell. ``The bubble has been pricked,'' Soros
said, referring to so-called new-economy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Soros' funds have averaged 32 percent returns by
making big, leveraged plays on bonds, commodities, currencies and
stocks. He said his new fund would rely less on borrowed money than
in the past. ``In my old age I have become conservative,'' Soros,
69, told reporters here. ``I'll be happy if I average 15 percent
rather than 31 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros indicated that, as he pulled back from day-to-day
management to concentrate on philanthropic funds, his 36-year-old
son, Robert, would adopt an increasingly central role in the
family's financial empire. ``It would be a big mistake for me to go
back into the ring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soros said he would put more of his money into more stable real
estate and private equity. And, he said, roughly half of the assets
in the reorganized fund would be managed by up to 20 outsiders. The
portfolio will be spread over real estate, ``macro'' bets using
less borrowed money, private equity and stocks, which will account
for half of the fund's assets, he said. The change will mean that
about 100 Quantum Fund traders and money managers will lose their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reorganization is almost done,'' Soros said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have led some analysts to conclude that the Quantum
Fund is far more a personal investment vehicle than in the past.
Soros acknowledged that ``outside money is probably less than 40
percent'' and said the reorganized fund ``fits my personal needs
better than the previous one.'' &QL;

AT&AMP;T SEALS $44 BILLION DEAL FOR MEDIONE GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Thursday officially closed its $44 billion acquisition of
MediaOne Group, cementing the revamped Ma Bell's new role as the
nation's largest cable television provider, with 16 million
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's filing of closing papers in a Delaware court also makes
it instantly Massachusetts' dominant provider of cable TV and
high-speed Internet access, and clears the way for it to buy cable
franchises in Boston and 38 suburbs from Cablevision and heavily
upgrade them for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne's cable customers in 175 Bay State communities and its
155,000 RoadRunner high-speed Internet access customers in
Massachusetts and New Hampshire can expect to see new ``AT&AMP;T
Cable'' and ``AT&AMP;T Broadband'' logos on their bills and trucks
within two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   Closing the MediaOne deal _ which will require AT&AMP;T to sell off
major US cable interests within 12 months _ was the main condition
before it could complete its deal to buy the Greater Boston
Cablevision franchises, which have lagged far behind MediaOne in
rolling out broadband-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the way is clear for AT&AMP;T to move forward with that
acquisition,'' said MediaOne spokesman Richard D. Jenkinson. AT&AMP;T
expects to take over the Cablevision franchises by the end of this
year, as part of a complex swap of systems in New York and
Massachusetts and cash payments.
</P>
<P>
   The MediaOne deal is a key element of AT&AMP;T's $100 billion-plus
move into owning cable systems across the United States as part of
a master strategy of using upgraded cable lines to provide
telephone and Internet service across much of the country, with
major clusters in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has also bought Charter Communications franchises in 53
Worcester-area communities, and with the Cablevision deal closed
will have franchises in 267 of the Bay State's 351 cities and
towns.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen M. Connolly, an AT&AMP;T spokeswoman, said ``there might be
some minimal shifts of individuals'' in Massachusetts who work for
AT&AMP;T and MediaOne, but overall the company expects to add many new
jobs here selling AT&AMP;T-branded telephone service over upgraded
MediaOne franchises. AT&AMP;T's cable and broadband operations are
based in suburban Denver.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials had said they did not expect to close the deal
until early August, after the expiration of a period during which
Time Warner Entertainment _ in which MediaOne holds a 25.5 percent
stake _ could have vetoed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   A Time Warner spokesman confirmed his company blessed the
closing but would not comment on whether that was any part of an
overall deal to resolve several nettlesome disputes between AT&AMP;T
and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials have been hoping to reach a deal to offer their
phone service over Time Warner lines, perhaps in exchange for
selling the minority stake MediaOne holds in Time Warner
Entertainment and offering access to America Online _ which is
buying Time Warner _ on its cable modem services.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the Federal Communications Commission's approval
of the deal, within a year AT&AMP;T must either divest MediaOne's Time
Warner stake, or AT&AMP;T programming interests including Liberty
Media, or interests in cable systems serving 9.7 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has made no comment on which option it will pursue and has
suggested it could meet the FCC's mandate with a step short of an
outright sale of the programming interests or by persuading the FCC
it overestimated AT&AMP;T's influence in cable systems in which it
holds a minority interest.
</P>
<P>
   Based on AT&AMP;T's Wednesday closing price, the MediaOne
acquisition is now valued at about $44 billion, down sharply from
the $58 billion price tag when the deal was announced last year,
because of the swoon in AT&AMP;T shares since then.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said MediaOne shareholders can choose to receive either
95 shares of AT&AMP;T for every 100 shares they own plus $36.27 a share
in cash, or $85 a share in cash, or 149.12 shares of AT&AMP;T for every
100 MediaOne shares they own.
</P>
<P>
   However, the latter two options are subject to pro-ration,
depending on how many people want stock and how many people want
cash. The actual amount of stock and cash people receive depends on
how many people choose what option, with AT&AMP;T setting an overall
package of 606 million shares of AT&AMP;T common stock and $23 billion
in cash to buy MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every MediaOne shareholder says, `I want $85,' that will
never happen,'' Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, AT&AMP;T shares closed
at $34.1875, up 68.75 cents.

KOREA RAPPROCHEMENT SEEN AS VICTORY FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with SKOREA-NKOREA)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Perhaps no outside country has more to gain from peace
on the Korean peninsula than China. And so, as the leaders of North
and South Korea ended their three-day summit meeting with an
agreement and a hug, Chinese officials were understandably elated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese side believes that the summit has produced
important results and is a major event of historic significance,''
said Zhu Bangzao, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. ``It will make a
valuable contribution to the maintenance of peace and stability on
the Korean peninsula. The Chinese side is heartily pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the meeting in Pyongyang in many ways represented a
triumph of Chinese diplomacy, said diplomats and policy experts,
because China _ the only major power to have longstanding
diplomatic relations with both sides _ was instrumental in bringing
the Koreas together.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea had to decide it wanted to do this,'' said Zhang
Xiaojin, a professor of international relations at People's
University in Beijing. ``But compared with other countries, China
had an important role.''
</P>
<P>
   China shares a long border and an even longer communist
brotherhood with North Korea. It fought alongside North Korea in
the Korean War of 1950-53, and for the last decade, since the fall
of the Soviet Union, it has been North Korea's only significant
ally.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, with its pursuit of economic reform and
foreign investment, China has cultivated increasingly close
political relations as well as a brisk trade with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that China has had relatively stable diplomatic ties to
both states since it established relations with South Korea in 1992
has required a delicate balancing act and forced upon China a
certain sense of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, China has fretted about the possibility of
armed conflict on the peninsula and about the dire condition of the
North Korean economy _ which has prompted hundreds of thousands of
North Koreans to flee illegally into China.
</P>
<P>
   David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at George
Washington University, said, ``China's first goal is not to have an
imploding North Korea at its border, and everything else works
backwards from that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To that end, China has supplied North Korea with food and fuel
during its severe food shortages of the last six years. Chinese
diplomats have long encouraged North Korea to follow in China's
footsteps: adopting outward-looking reforms in order to revive its
moribund economy.
</P>
<P>
   Until several months ago, that advice seemed to be falling
mostly on deaf ears, with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il,
rebuffing numerous invitations to visit Beijing. In private,
Chinese officials often expressed frustration with Kim.
</P>
<P>
   But the momentum shifted dramatically this spring as North Korea
made overtures to a number of Western nations, establishing
diplomatic ties with Italy and Australia. And just weeks ago, Kim
made the long-awaited visit to China. It was his first official
trip abroad since he became his country's leader after his father's
death in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Kim spent three days in Beijing, meeting with Chinese leaders
and touring some of China's most successful high-tech enterprises.
He told Chinese officials that he was impressed with the country's
rapid economic development, commenting that he hardly recognized
Beijing from his last visit, 17 years earlier. He indicated that he
planned to follow the Chinese model.
</P>
<P>
   But the summit meeting this week, with the two Korean leaders
clearly getting along well together, was perhaps more successful
than the Chinese could have dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the Chinese government was happy because North
Korea has been in a very deep economic crisis, and this kind of
friendly dialogue may lead to more support from South Korea _ and
that puts less pressure on China,'' said Professor Zhang.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy experts added that the subtle Chinese diplomacy
that culminated in the summit might also have reset the
geopolitical balance in northeast Asia, diminishing the role of the
United States in particular. China had long feared, they said, that
a reunified Korea might be dominated by the South, an ally of the
United States for more than 50 years, and thus tied into the U.S.
defense structure, putting U.S. weapons directly on the Chinese
border. But that seems less likely now.
</P>
<P>
   By cultivating strong relationships with both North and South,
``China has brought both parties under their tutelage,'' said
Shambaugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have co-opted South Korea and maneuvered the U.S. pretty
much out of this chapter,'' he said. ``Seoul looks as much to
Beijing now for guidance as to the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   In officials statements, China _ whose stated policy is never to
meddle in the affairs of other countries _ took no credit for the
outcome. And in the many official accounts and commentaries in the
state media Thursday, enthusiasm was tempered by the awareness that
nothing on the divided peninsula is likely to be simple.
</P>
<P>
   The ``historic handshake'' created ``favorable conditions for
the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia,
as well as the peace and stability of the world at large,'' said an
article in Thursday's People's Daily, the official Communist Party
newspaper. ``The world welcomed the historic handshake of the
Korean nations. Of course there is still a lot to do afterward, and
the two sides should continue to make an effort.''

BAY STATE SIXTH IN FEDERAL R&AMP;D FUNDS

   WASHINGTON _ Fueled by medical and graduate reserch programs,
Massachussetts received the sixth-highest amount of federal
research and development funds in 1998, according to a study
released Thursday by the Rand Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Massachussetts, you have one of the premier medical
research units in the Boston/Cambridge area,'' said Donna Fossum,
senior policy analyst for the report.
</P>
<P>
   California topped the list, with more than $14 billion in
federal money for research and development,followed by Maryland,
Virginia, Georgia, and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Massachussetts was awarded $3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When research dollars are broken down by population, Washington,
D.C., ranks first with $5,139 per person, while Massachussetts
comes in fifth with $587 per person.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have are not only university- and college-based
graduate research programs, you have institutions that do nothing
but graduate work and medical research,'' Fossum said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the research and development money goes into
university programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research and development portfolio encompasses the safety
of food to preserving wildlife to national security to going to the
moon,'' Fossum said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a migratory bird station in Maine is reflected in
the state's No. 46 ranking, while forestry research is a major
contributor to New Hampshire's No. 33 standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a state in this country that isn't playing a
critical role,'' Fossum said. ``It matters to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has the only laboratory in the country for
researching theeffects of cold weather on the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high north. Where else can you study this kind of
activity?'' Fossum asked.

   PIPELINE-SAFETY (Washington) _ The federal agency responsible
for pipeline safety is a weak, overly compliant regulator that
seldom imposes fines when violations are found, and even then often

that the Office of Pipeline Safety fails to fully involve state

opera, it's an attempt to recapture the zeitgeist of ``Star Wars''

Nothing,'' nor is it an eye-filling starfest like his shot-in-70mm
``Hamlet.'' It's a slight, whimsical version of one of the Bard's
lesser, least performed comedies, not very convincingly updated to
1939 and goosed up with some broad comic effects and a series campy
production numbers featuring songs by such '30s tunesmiths as
George Gershwin, Cole Porter and Jerome Kern.

Girls,'' a ``When Harry Met Sally ... '' for the college set. My,
how the classics have changed.

SENATE VOTES $8.5B CAP ON BIG DIG FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Delivering a formal slap in the face to
Massachusetts' ``Big Dig'' and its hosts, the US Senate Thursday
voted to deny paying any more of the $8.5 billion in federal funds
approved for it until government and project leaders sign an
agreement promising never to ask for any more cash for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The voice vote was largely symbolic, because state and project
officials had already agreed to a cap of $8.549 billion in federal
assitance for the project, whose cost has spiraled from $2.6
billion in 1985 to $13.6 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   That deal will be cemented Friday, when Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority Chairman Andrew S. Natsios will hand-deliver to the US
Department of Transportation a signed document agreeing to the cap
and several other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, in fact, what the senator's amendment says, and what we
agreed to when we testified before the senator's committee,'' said
Turnpike Authority spokesman Joe Landolfi, referring to Senator
John McCain, a vociferous Big Dig critic and author of the measure
capping funds for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in no way going to impact the construction of the
project,'' Landolfi said.
</P>
<P>
   The formal language means it would be far more difficult to
squeeze more cash out of the federal government for the massive
highway remodeling project should the need and the political will
to do it surface.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts lawmakers don't expect to ask for more money for
the project, given the negative publicity associated with the cost
overruns. ``They know we can't go to the well again,'' said an aide
to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The signed agreement also locks in the Turnpike Authority to the
$8.549 billion in federal aid, of which $5 billion has been spent.
But the McCain amendment, if it bacame law, would further hamstring
the state in requesting more help down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Turnpike Authority was hoping that the signed agreement
would dissuade McCain, a Republican from Arizona, from inserting
the language into the Senate Transportation Appropriations bill.
``It obviously, for some reason, did not,'' Landolfi said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``we can live with it,'' he added. ``We agree with the
cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Language similar to McCain's amendment is in the House version
of the transportation funding bill. But the language does not block
all the Big Dig money pending a signed agreement, said Karin
Walser, an aide to Representative J. Joseph Moakley, Democrat of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to become law, it will have to happen in
conference,'' when House and Senate negotiators work out a
compromise version of the bill, Walser said.
</P>
<P>
   The funding limit is part of a 12-point Project Partnership
Agreement Natsios will bring to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement includes a commitment by Big Dig officials that
the controverial project will not siphon money away from other
transportation needs in the state.
</P>
<P>
   That element also requires a separate agreement between the
state and 13 regional planning boards on funding for non-Big Dig
transportation projects. The last of these sub-agreements was
reached Thursday, said Luisa Paiewonsky, director of planning for
the Massachusetts Highway Department.
</P>
<P>
   The state also agrees in the Natsios document to submit detailed
financial updates to the Federal Highway Administration every six
months, and to provide extensive data and records to outside
monitoring agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to provide timely access to Big Dig records and
employees could result in a withdrawal of funding, under the
agreement being delivered Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios will also deliver an update on Big Dig's financial plan,
reporting that the cost overrun on the project is $1.84 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That number shows that the federal government was closer to the
truth. On Feb. 1, Big Dig officials acknowledged that they had $1.4
billion in cost overruns. A separate audit by the federal
government put the number at between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Former Big Dig chief James J. Kerasiotes was fired earlier this
year over the finance debacle, and replaced by Natsios.
</P>
<P>
   McCain held hearings on the Big Dig project last month, lashing
out at Big Dig officials, private contractors, and government
authorities for their ``complete and utter failure'' in handling
the project's fiscal crisis. He warned then that the project could
end up costing as much as $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project has suffered from gross mismanagement and what
appears to have been a complete lack of critical federal oversight.
It has experienced billions of dollars in cost overruns,'' McCain
said in submitting his amendment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not my intention to stop the Boston project,'' McCain
said. ``The project should be completed as quickly and as fiscally
responsibly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged that the officials involved had agreed to
the $8.549 billion cap in the hearings. But ``if it isn't in a
statute or in writing, then where is it?'' the senator asked. ``The
answer, of course, is that it doesn't currently exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts delegation was at a loss to explain why McCain
would insist on the amendment when the formal agreement was about
to be signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew this was in the works,'' said a staffer to a
Massachusetts lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain's amendment is a non-issue,'' said Kyle
Sullivan, an aide to Senator John Kerry,
</P>
<P>
   McCain aide Pia Pialorsi seemed surprised when told of the odd
timing of the amendment and of Natsios's plan to deliver the signed
agreement. But ``it's just to put it in the law,'' she said.

<P>
   KANDAHAR, Afghanistan _ The tour through the minefield began
near one of the main roads, among the houses where the little
children were playing.
</P>
<P>
   Mohid Hashim, who leads a mine-clearing team, shouted at the
youngsters in Pashto, ``Hey, don't you know that red flag means
it's dangerous here?''
</P>
<P>
   The children scurried away, but as always they would meander
back. Housing is impossibly scarce here in war-devastated Kandahar,
the second-largest of this nation's cities. Several families have
taken shelter surrounded by the rubble of what is called Minefield
179, willing to risk the explosives buried in their new backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan, one of the world's most enduring battlegrounds, is
also among its most booby-trapped landscapes. It has an estimated 5
million to 7 million of the deadly devices concealed in the rocky
soil _ about one for every three of the nation's people.
</P>
<P>
   But in a place where even a scrap of good news has become as
rare as a peaceful summer, there is some cause for thanks. A
mine-clearing operation, perhaps the largest in the world, has in
10 years managed to reduce the number of maiming explosions by
half. Each day now, only 10 to 12 people make a misstep that blows
them apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we are still scared of explosions, but I have eight
children, and a father cannot keep that many small ones from
running around,'' said Abdul Nabi, a poor laborer who has built a
home in the minefield from stony debris and cornstalks.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He had come out of his dark hovel into the fierce light. Two of
his youngsters had been traipsing among the piles of crushed brick,
chasing each other through a labyrinth of jagged half walls. About
15 yards from his door, a man in a hard white helmet was doing the
tedious work of ``de-mining,'' carefully probing and digging.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The father did not want to be harshly judged. This is
Afghanistan, he explained, and there have been 21 straight years of
war. Many of the ordinary rules of rational behavior have by
necessity been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged defensively. ``Where else is there for us to live?''
he said. ``As they started clearing the mines, people began moving
in. We have a good space here.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``de-miners'' work for a variety of international charities
under the auspices of the United Nations. There are 4,800 people
involved, split into teams throughout the country. In 10 years,
more than 1 million explosive devices have been safely exploded or
dismantled, said Richard D. Kelly, who manages the program.
</P>
<P>
   Minefield 179, about the size of a football field, is among the
last contaminated grounds within Kandahar itself. Excavation at the
site has been going for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 11 mines have been unearthed, as well as 80 ``UXOs,''
shorthand for ``unexploded ordinance'' that includes rockets, bombs
and grenades. Some 30,000 metal fragments have also been found.
Those objects further slow the monotonous work, since each one has
to be uncovered carefully to be sure that it is not deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Sattar is a merchant of some means, but even he decided to
accept the risks of living in the minefield. His family owned
property within No. 179. He rebuilt his house in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He answered a knock on his handsomely painted front door. ``Yes,
there is some danger, but it does not bother me,'' he said with
more nonchalance than bravado. ``The U.N. found a mine under the
corner of our house some time back, and the other day they found
another one about 20 yards from here. But soon all the mines will
be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his five children stood with him. Just a few feet away,
on the other side of a brick wall, one of the men in helmets was
busy ferreting through the unpredictable soil.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all up to Allah,'' Sattar said of the danger. ``You must
have faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Afghanistan is not alone in its land mine infestation,
though it is surely among the most afflicted. Estimating global
numbers is very difficult, but Angola, Cambodia, Iraq and Egypt
also finish near the top of most lists.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, large numbers are not as important as strategic
location: how many people live near the minefield, how much fertile
land is unusable.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, and driving it out
took a decade. The Soviet troops were orderly in configuring their
minefields, forming broad protective arcs around key roads, cities
and dams. The groups of Afghan mujahedeen, who battled each other
after defeating the Soviet army, were more haphazard with their
placements _ indeed often random.
</P>
<P>
   They all used the gamut of insidious devices. Fragmentation
mines leapt into the air, spraying a thousand steel splinters like
little daggers. Blast mines tore off limbs while propelling dirt,
gravel and bone fragments into the fresh wounds. Triggering
mechanisms were often disguised as a pen or a pack of a popular
brand of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 most countries in the world signed a treaty renouncing
use of antipersonnel mines, although those not signing included the
United States, China and Russia. President Clinton pledged to join
the majority by 2006, giving Washington time to develop
alternatives to what is considered an important defensive weapon.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Military observers say that a modest amount of mine installation
continues in Afghanistan as the Taliban, who control most of the
country, try to complete their conquest of a well-armed opposition.
But most devices in the ground are the afterlife of earlier
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of them ban-the-mines people,'' said Ross
Chamberlain, an Australian explosives expert who had joined the
walk through No. 179. ``If someone's coming to attack your house,
you've got a right to defend yourself any way you can. But do it
right. If you've put mines in, it's your job then to take them
out.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The men now taking them out in Afghanistan are local people,
hired at a starting salary of $100 a month. This is a top wage
these days, but the work is perilous, and there is no glamour to it
_ no cinematic images of a heavily perspiring man snipping colored
wires. The main danger comes from the boredom of sifting through
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, five de-miners have been killed in
Afghanistan. ``One was sheer stupidity,'' said Chamberlain. ``The
guy hit an anti-tank mine with a pick. Just a mess. It took 40
minutes to gather up the pieces, and they still haven't found his
helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The tour continued. Minefields 178 and 180 looked a lot like No.
179. Minefield 232 was at the edge of the city in an open field
with wheat planted nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The final stop was Kandahar's main hospital, back toward the
center of town. In some cities, finding the recent victim of a land
mine explosion might be catch as catch can, but the overcrowded
wards here almost always have someone newly mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, there were two, and the one who was awake was named
Abdul Khaliq. He was 14 and scrawny, lying in a corner bed near a
window.
</P>
<P>
   His left leg had been gone for two weeks. A bulky white bandage
covered the stump, and every now and then he rubbed it with his
fingers. His right leg and thighs and chest had also been hurt, but
the most striking thing about him was the stunned look in his eyes,
as if he was frozen in that instant he heard the blast and flipped
into the air.
</P>
<P>
   It had happened as he ran up a small hill outside of the city,
chasing friends over familiar ground. For years, they had crossed
that terrain. Nothing before had ever exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing,'' he said weakly. ``We were playing.''

SENATE VOTES $8.5B CAP ON BIG DIG FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Delivering a formal slap in the face to
Massachusetts' ``Big Dig'' and its hosts, the US Senate Thursday
voted to deny paying any more of the $8.5 billion in federal funds
approved for it until government and project leaders sign an
agreement promising never to ask for any more cash for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The voice vote was largely symbolic, because state and project
officials had already agreed to a cap of $8.549 billion in federal
assitance for the project, whose cost has spiraled from $2.6
billion in 1985 to $13.6 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   That deal will be cemented Friday, when Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority Chairman Andrew S. Natsios will hand-deliver to the US
Department of Transportation a signed document agreeing to the cap
and several other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, in fact, what the senator's amendment says, and what we
agreed to when we testified before the senator's committee,'' said
Turnpike Authority spokesman Joe Landolfi, referring to Senator
John McCain, a vociferous Big Dig critic and author of the measure
capping funds for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in no way going to impact the construction of the
project,'' Landolfi said.
</P>
<P>
   The formal language means it would be far more difficult to
squeeze more cash out of the federal government for the massive
highway remodeling project should the need and the political will
to do it surface.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts lawmakers don't expect to ask for more money for
the project, given the negative publicity associated with the cost
overruns. ``They know we can't go to the well again,'' said an aide
to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The signed agreement also locks in the Turnpike Authority to the
$8.549 billion in federal aid, of which $5 billion has been spent.
But the McCain amendment, if it bacame law, would further hamstring
the state in requesting more help down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Turnpike Authority was hoping that the signed agreement
would dissuade McCain, a Republican from Arizona, from inserting
the language into the Senate Transportation Appropriations bill.
``It obviously, for some reason, did not,'' Landolfi said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``we can live with it,'' he added. ``We agree with the
cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Language similar to McCain's amendment is in the House version
of the transportation funding bill. But the language does not block
all the Big Dig money pending a signed agreement, said Karin
Walser, an aide to Representative J. Joseph Moakley, Democrat of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to become law, it will have to happen in
conference,'' when House and Senate negotiators work out a
compromise version of the bill, Walser said.
</P>
<P>
   The funding limit is part of a 12-point Project Partnership
Agreement Natsios will bring to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement includes a commitment by Big Dig officials that
the controverial project will not siphon money away from other
transportation needs in the state.
</P>
<P>
   That element also requires a separate agreement between the
state and 13 regional planning boards on funding for non-Big Dig
transportation projects. The last of these sub-agreements was
reached Thursday, said Luisa Paiewonsky, director of planning for
the Massachusetts Highway Department.
</P>
<P>
   The state also agrees in the Natsios document to submit detailed
financial updates to the Federal Highway Administration every six
months, and to provide extensive data and records to outside
monitoring agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to provide timely access to Big Dig records and
employees could result in a withdrawal of funding, under the
agreement being delivered Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios will also deliver an update on Big Dig's financial plan,
reporting that the cost overrun on the project is $1.84 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That number shows that the federal government was closer to the
truth. On Feb. 1, Big Dig officials acknowledged that they had $1.4
billion in cost overruns. A separate audit by the federal
government put the number at between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Former Big Dig chief James J. Kerasiotes was fired earlier this
year over the finance debacle, and replaced by Natsios.
</P>
<P>
   McCain held hearings on the Big Dig project last month, lashing
out at Big Dig officials, private contractors, and government
authorities for their ``complete and utter failure'' in handling
the project's fiscal crisis. He warned then that the project could
end up costing as much as $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project has suffered from gross mismanagement and what
appears to have been a complete lack of critical federal oversight.
It has experienced billions of dollars in cost overruns,'' McCain
said in submitting his amendment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not my intention to stop the Boston project,'' McCain
said. ``The project should be completed as quickly and as fiscally
responsibly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged that the officials involved had agreed to
the $8.549 billion cap in the hearings. But ``if it isn't in a
statute or in writing, then where is it?'' the senator asked. ``The
answer, of course, is that it doesn't currently exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts delegation was at a loss to explain why McCain
would insist on the amendment when the formal agreement was about
to be signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew this was in the works,'' said a staffer to a

BACKSTREET BOY PLANS LUPUS BENEFIT TO HONOR HIS SISTER'S MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL DEYOUNG   
 The Gainesville Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just because you're one of the biggest pop stars in the world,
with millions of dollars in the bank and millions of adolescent
fans hanging your picture on the wall, doesn't mean you're not a
human being with a loving family. Some things still hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Howie Dorough of the Backstreet Boys is living proof.
</P>
<P>
   Dorough's sister Caroline Cochran died almost two years ago of
complications from lupus, a disease that attacks the body's immune
system. ``She was 37 and the mother of two kids,'' Dorough, a
native of Orlando, Fla., said in a telephone interview. ``It's
something that's affected my family and our lives quite a bit,
seeing her go through this for 13 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorough, 26, who lives with his family in Orlando, has organized
a benefit concert June 25 at the Universal Citywalk complex in
Orlando. ``The Backstreet Boys do a lot of charity work,'' he said,
mentioning the Elton John AIDS Foundation and Sting's Rainforest
Foundation International. ``I started talking with my family: Why
don't we just set up our own foundation and hopefully raise
awareness?''
</P>
<P>
   Dorough's sister Angie Herring, who runs his fan club, is
organizing the benefit, which includes an auction, to raise money
for lupus research and education, and financial aid for patients
who cannot afford treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Dorough will perform ``Fly to Heaven,'' an original song about
Caroline Cochran, with another sister, Pollyanna. ``I've called a
lot of friends of mine in the industry, and sent out a lot of
invites, and we're hoping to get a lot of responses back,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. McLean, another Backstreet Boy, will probably be there,
Dorough said. Confirmed performers include the Nelson twins,
Deborah Gibson and the actor Sherman Helmsley of ``The
Jeffersons,'' who's planning a stand-up comedy routine. Tickets for
the event, which will take place at the Groove nightclub, are $75
and $200.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities including Mariah Carey, Shania Twain and Shaquille
O'Neal have donated personal items for the auction, as have Donough
and his fellow band members.
</P>
<P>
   Recording of the third Backstreet Boys album begins in Los
Angeles next month; Dorough and his band mates have been
collaborating with writers including Dianne Warren and Babyface.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, the Backstreet Boys' sales records have
been eclipsed by fellow teen-age pop acts 'N Sync and Britney
Spears.
</P>
<P>
   Dorough said the band isn't worried. ``We really try to
concentrate on just making good music for our fans and having the
respect of the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try not to get too caught up at all in the sales and
everything. It's always thrown in our face, but there's enough out
there for everybody. And everybody has their time.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album should be out by Christmas. Meanwhile, Dorough has
a benefit to plan, and his sister's memory to honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never think it's going to take somebody out of your
life,'' he said. ``In the back of our minds, we thought it was just
one of these diseases that you could live with. Some people can
live with it for a long time, and some people it hits really
quickly, and all of a sudden they die.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Curators at the Austin Museum of Art wanted to
create a virtual tour on the Web of their new exhibit, ``Liberated
Voices: Contemporary Art From South Africa,'' and some folks at
Dell Computer Corp. came up with a clever solution.
</P>
<P>
   Using Flash technology, the museum's Web site (www.amoa.org)
features images of two of the exhibit's works that, as the user
moves the mouse arrow around the images, project captions of
additional information about the art or about South African history
as it relates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's figuring out a way of communicating with people not just
in the traditional sense,'' said Ashley Blake, spokeswoman for
Dell.
</P>
<P>
   The museum calls the technology X-Ray Artvision, and plans to
expand it to future exhibitions. ``This is an educator's dream,''
said Katy Hernandez-Cowles, head of education at the museum.
``We're kind of expanding the education of this exhibit beyond the
gallery walls and beyond the county and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials are encouraging area school teachers to use the
Web site in the classroom as an introduction before coming in to
see the works in person.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, an underwriter of the exhibit, which is on display until
Aug. 13, also provided computers at the museum for visitors to
access the redesigned Web site, which includes links to South
African newspapers and the Museum for African Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is also facilitating e-mail dialogue between museum
patrons and some of the African artists.

 &HT;    Artists, industry pros in town to discuss music, Net impact
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the kind of statistic that is keeping music industry
leaders awake at night: A survey out this week found that 38
percent of Internet users _ 35 million Americans _ have downloaded
music from the Internet, yet only 2 percent said they paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey of 2,503 Americans, by the Pew Internet &AMP;
American Life Project, has deepened fears of the Recording Industry
Association of America and such artists as Metallica and Dr. Dre,
who have criticized users of Napster and other software programs
designed to share music files online.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some artists _ notably struggling bands having a hard time
breaking through _ are cheering such findings, noting they point up
new ways that the Internet is changing not only how we listen to
music, but how musicians get the word out to potential fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another marketing tool,'' says Atlanta-based band manager
and promoter Wayne Briggs. ``Everyone loves to discover. That's one
thing that's really cool about the Internet _ you can go there and
discover something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Briggs is one of a handful of music industry experts who will
converge on Atlanta this weekend for the ChangeMusic Atlanta
conference and music festival.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is sponsored by CMJ, the publisher of CMJ New
Music Report, a weekly publication that provides airplay data and
new music news and reviews to radio programmers and music industry
professionals. It was first published in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day event, which opens today, is expected to draw more
than 600 artists and music industry professionals to explore the
impact and possibilities of new technology in the music business.
Thousands more will likely attend the musical performances taking
place in 18 venues across Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants will be less well-known artists for whom
the Internet is proving to be an effective new way to get the word
out.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: El Pus, a hip-hop-infused Atlanta alternative
rock band managed by Briggs, whose Web site (www.elpus.com) has
helped generate local buzz about the band. Briggs reports that a
number of fans have come to shows after checking out the Web site
and hearing the tracks available there.
</P>
<P>
   Local musician Lee Cuthbert, who maintains the Web site for her
band, Gentle Readers (www.gentlereaders.com), has also discovered
that an online presence has several advantages. ``The biggest
benefit for us has been the dates page'' listing upcoming shows,
she says. ``We have a mailing list with a few hundred names on it,
but those folks sometimes trash their e-mail or lose their
postcard, but they can always find the latest show info.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites may have other advantages, Cuthbert says. They can be
fun, in a way that a public relations agency or record label might
not encourage. For instance, Cuthbert's comments on the band's
photos and the disclaimer at the bottom of the dates page _ ``all
Gentle Readers' shows are guaranteed to be spoken word, modern
dance and puppet-free'' _ liven up a visit to her band's site.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet presence alone isn't going to bring success. While
the Gentle Readers' site is a helpful tool, for instance, the band
doesn't always benefit monetarily. ``We don't sell much merchandise
off the Web,'' Cuthbert notes. ``Our label sells more than we do
electronically, but that has been the least utilized part of our
site.''
</P>
<P>
   CMJ founder and CEO Robert Haber adds that while the Internet is
proving to be yet another way for launching a band, ``there's
nothing that's ever going to replace a band touring, marketing and
promoting on the road. The Internet in and of itself will never
break a band.''
</P>
<P>
   The ChangeMusic festival, sponsored by Haber's company, is an
outgrowth of the CMJ Music Marathon _ an annual New York showcase
and music industry gathering, which celebrates its 20th anniversary
this fall. Organizers decided to expand the reach of the Music
Marathon this year by providing several regional events. Atlanta is
the first stop; S, to the $250 premium pass, which includes the
opening night party, performances and events. For daytime events
and panels, passes start at $95. For more info, see the CMJ Web
site (www.cmj.com) or call 1-877-633-7848.

 &HT;    Giving dads their due
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday is Father's Day, and the conventional TV wisdom is that
the medium's portrayal of dads is a classic case of reverse
evolution, from Ward Cleaver to Homer Simpson _ Father Knows Best
to Father Knows Squat.
</P>
<P>
   There's some truth in that, but there's more. Actually, TV's
portrayal of fathers today is richly diverse, from loving,
anxiety-riddled Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) on ``NYPD Blue'' to
struggling , deeply flawed Jake Manning (Jeffrey Nordling) on
``Once and Again.'' Ray Barone (Ray Romano) on ``Everybody Loves
Raymond'' is a weak but caring dad, while Ken Titus (Stacy Keach)
on ``Titus'' is strong and uncaring.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Hal (Bryan Cranston), the 40-going-on-14 dad on
``Malcolm in the Middle.'' That's Hal of the hairiest back on the
planet, disco dude on roller skates, who can't quite decide whether
he's disciplinarian or enabler to his sons' antics.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's hilarious rerun (8:30 p.m. on Fox), Hal skips work,
gets the boys to bug out from school, and they all play hooky at a
stock car race. The final scene, with Hal returning home thinking
he's fooled wife Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), is priceless.
</P>
<P>
   Also of note for dads:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Story of Fathers and Sons'' (8 p.m. Saturday on ABC) _ A
rerun from last Father's Day, this special looks at the joys and
sorrows of fathers and sons, with testimony from Los Angeles Lakers
star Shaquille O'Neal, teen heartthrob Zachery Ty Bryan and actor
Edward James Olmos.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sporting Lawns'' (9 p.m. Sunday on HGTV) _ If you're a dad
whose theme song is ``I fought the lawn, and the lawn won,'' check
out this special that combines lawn care and sports. It looks at
groundskeepers and their equipment at baseball and football
stadiums and golf courses like Pebble Beach in California.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Man Show'' (10 p.m. Sunday on Comedy Central) _ This is
the second-season premiere of this sketch show for frat boys and
those who wish they still were _ wildly uneven, occasionally
hilarious and always politically incorrect and testosterone-addled.
Sunday, the boys go to a professional wrestling school and offer
the usual quotient of breast and flatulence jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Today
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Piano Grand!: A Smithsonian Celebration'' (8 p.m. on
WPBA/Channel 30) _ Billy Joel hosts this special noting the more or
less 300th anniversary of the invention of the piano.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The 2000 Alma Awards'' (9 p.m. on ABC) _ For these Latin
American entertainment awards, all eyes will be on Jennifer Lopez
and Christina Aguilera, who share entertainer of the year honors
(along with Ricky Martin). But also deserving of your attention is
the deliriously versatile Ian Gomez, who's honored for appearing on
three series simultaneously: ``The Drew Carey Show,'' ``Norm'' and
``Felicity,'' where his character, Javier, ended the season with a
gay wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Croc Week'' (8 p.m. on Animal Planet) _ Cable channel Animal
Planet's breakout star, Steve Irwin, is the focus of a week of
specials. Australian ``Crocodile Hunter'' Irwin, whose fearless
and/or insane approach to handling crocodiles and snakes in the
wild has been spoofed by ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``South
Park,'' is known for his catch phrases ``Crikey!'' and ``Holy
Smokes, that was close!'' First up tonight: ``Spitting Cobras'' at
8 and ``Crocodile Hunter's Wildest Home Videos'' at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Movies
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Birds'' (8 p.m. Friday on American Movie Classics) _ AMC
kicks off a weekend of Alfred Hitchcock flicks with this 1963
classic about feathered fiends.
</P>
<P>
   Other Hitch highlights on AMC:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Notorious'' (2 p.m. Saturday) _ Several critics pointed out
similarities between the plot of ``Mission Impossible: 2'' and that
of this 1946 movie, in which Cary Grant sends his beloved, Ingrid
Bergman, off to seduce and betray the ex-Nazi (Claude Raines) he's
trying to capture. But Grant doesn't do many flying kicks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Vertigo'' (8 p.m. Saturday) _ Nothing is as it seems in what
many buffs consider Hitch's best: James Stewart tries to mold Kim
Novak into his lost love in what might be called ``Pygmalion'' in
hell.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Psycho'' (10:30 p.m. Saturday) _ It's impossible now to
re-create what audiences first felt in 1960 when Janet Leigh took
her famous shower.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rear Window'' (8 p.m. Sunday) _ Stewart again, in a
wheelchair, with Grace Kelly in the blonde role and a very scary
Raymond Burr as the heavy. Even heavier are the sexual subtexts of
Stewart's voyeurism and Kelly's frustration.

   GORE-COELHO (Washington) _ In yet another reshuffling of his
presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore announces that Bill
Daley, the secretary of commerce and a shrewd operative in
Democratic politics, will replace the campaign chairman, Tony
Coelho. Coelho, who was hospitalized Monday night with an inflamed
colon, said he decided to step down on the advice of his doctors,
but many Democrats said the move was not a huge surprise, given the
way Gore's campaign has been struggling. By Richard L. Berke.

the Smithfield hog plant here is the value of a sharp knife. The
second thing you learn is that not everyone has to work with a
knife. Whites, blacks, American Indians and Mexicans, they all have
their separate stations, but it is blacks and Mexicans that are
left to battle over the dirty jobs at the factory, one of the only
places within a 50-mile radius in this muddy corner of North
Carolina where a person might make more than $8 an hour. While
Smithfield's profits nearly doubled over the past year, wages have
remained flat. So a lot of Americans have quit and a lot of
Mexicans have been hired to take their places. But the workers see
one another, more than management, as the problem, and they see the
competition in skin tones. By Charlie LeDuff.

DALEY TAKES OVER FOR AILING COELHO AS GORE CAMPAIGN CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tony Coelho resigned as chairman of Al Gore's
presidential campaign Thursday, giving the vice president a welcome
opportunity to bring in Commerce Secretary William Daley to run his
fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise resignation of Coelho, who cited health reasons, is
the latest sign of turmoil at Gore campaign headquarters, which
made a ballyhooed move from Washington to Nashville after stumbling
last year, and will now be working under its third leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if this is yet another effort of the Gore campaign to
reinvent itself,'' said Karen Hughes, communications director for
Republican candidate George W. Bush. ``Which Vice President Gore
will campaign next week?''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic operatives were more sanguine about the sudden
turn of events, saying that Daley shared many of Coelho's
strengths, and few of the former chairman's weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Though Coelho is credited with reviving and honing the Gore
campaign operation after joining it in May 1999 _ so that it
soundly whipped challenger Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries
_ he made enemies in the process and was forced by ethical
questions to maintain a low public profile.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Coelho has came under fire as the Gore campaign seemed
to lose some of the discipline and vigor with which it had
dispatched Bradley, and Bush climbed in the public opinion polls.
Foes sniped at Coelho for an imperious style, and there were
reports that he was tired and looking for a face-saving exit.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, an experienced political hand who Gore has long wanted to
bring into the campaign, was rumored to be Coelho's successor. No
action was taken, however, until Coelho checked into a hospital in
suburban Virginia this week for treatment of abdominal pain.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho said Thursday that an attack of diverticulitis, an
inflammation of the large intenstine, and a series of epileptic
episodes forced him to submit his resignation. ``My doctors have
told me that I need to slow down, eat better and travel less for a
period of time,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, none of this advice is
consistent with the rigors of chairing a presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, 58, who has important ties to congressional Democrats
and party fund-raisers, will remain as an adviser to the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's attorney, Stan Brand, said Thursday that a Justice
Department ethics investigation of Coelho's handling of funds when
he representing the United States in a 1998 trade fair in Lisbon
had ``nothing to do with his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation is where it was. It is ongoing. There has
been no change in status or circumstance,'' Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   As a Commerce secretary, longtime Democratic pol, and son of a
legendary Chicago mayor, Daley has his own extensive ties to the US
business, political and fund-raising communities. He shares
Coelho's decisive style and, not having to worry about ethical
questions, will be freer to represent the campaign on television.
</P>
<P>
   Daley ``has a very, very good political mind. Very good
instincts,'' a former associate said. ``He is a very good
strategist. Very decisive. Very confident. Very, very solid.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Gore who wooed the Commerce secretary, and Daley who
played hard to get, the associate said. ``It was definitely them
coming to him. If your last name is Daley, that is how you work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had asked Daley to chair his campaign last year, but Daley
turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   Daley is the 51-year-old son of the late Chicago Mayor Richard
J. Daley and brother of the current mayor, Richard M. Daley. He is
a trusted adviser of President Clinton and played the lead role in
winning approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement in
1993; in hosting the 1996 Democratic National Convention in
Chicago; and in shepherding through legislation to normalize trade
relations with China this year.
</P>
<P>
   Daley has advised Gore that the path to victory lies in steady
hard work and progress, not dramatic flailing. ``Hit singles,'' he
has told the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the campaign is in very good shape. We have to
implement the game plan laid out,'' Daley said after flying in from
Washington to join Gore at a campaign stop in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are talking about some of the people in Democratic
circles who have established themselves as a sage, steady
strategist,'' said Charles A. Baker, a veteran Massachusetts
political operative with ties to the Gore campaign, ``on anyone's
list Bill Daley is on the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chairman will inherit from Coelho a smoother-running,
better-funded campaign whose message, fund-raising and targeting
operations are in the hands of veteran Democratic operatives like
Carter Eskew, Bob Shrum, Michael Whouley, Tad Devine, and Donna
Brazile.
</P>
<P>
   Though there may be additional personnel changes as Daley brings
on his own talent, no one in Nashville expects a purge. Longtime
Gore aides like Peter Knight and Roy Neel are expected to retain,
if not increase, their access to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy coming in is a very good thing,'' said one top-ranking
campaign official. ``As he steps into Tony's shoes, the important
thing to remember is that we have built a campaign that is ready to
move into the fall at full speed. This was a very easy decision for
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican campaign operatives, however, said Daley's arrival
was a sign that Clinton White House and national Democratic
officials were increasingly worried about Gore's lackluster spring,
planning for the August convention, and their ability to beat Bush
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's departure ``might indicate that a lot of people in the
administration are worried about the direction of the Gore
campaign,'' said Hughes. She said the Bush campaign, despite its
problems in the Republican primaries, has not faced any major staff
shake-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, visiting Boston Thursday, said Daley ``seems like a pretty
darn efficient fella,'' but that candidates make the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking at an appearance with Daley at a wholesale food
market in Cincinnati, said: ``Bill Daley has done an outstanding
job as commerce secretary; he has done an outstanding job in
everything he has done. I'm thrilled that he has agreed to take
over the campaign.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE,' starring Martin Lawrence. Directed by Raja
Gosnell (PG-13, 97 minutes). This fitfully amusing film, starring
the comic whirligig Lawrence, could best be described as
``Stakeout'' goes ghetto, with a touch of ``Tootsie'' for flava _
er, flavor. Lawrence plays Malcolm, an FBI agent with a penchant
for doing undercover work in full body makeup. Here he impersonates
Big Momma, a stubborn old Southern woman. Why? Big Momma's
granddaughter is on the run because her ex-boyfriend, Lester, a
murderous bank robber, has escaped from prison. Malcolm believes he
can use her to get to Lester. This isn't much of a movie; it looks
like a series of baseball card shots and may have the worst rhythms
ever in a film directed by a former editor (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `DINOSAUR,' with the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard and
Ossie Davis. Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton (PG, 90
minutes). Reputedly the most expensive animated feature ever made,
Disney's showcase of computer animation technology begins with a
breathtaking sequence, a visual and sonic extravaganza that the
rest of the movie never quite lives up to. The story, of a young
dinosaur raised by lemurs who must lead a herd of his fellow
reptiles to safety after an asteroid strikes the earth, is cobbled
together from other Disney plots. But the effects _ the dinosaurs'
movements and their nearly seamless insertion into real locations _
will impress skeptical grown-ups. More important, the film, in
spite of some potentially upsetting scenes of carnivorous mayhem,
will delight children and whet their desire for the inevitable
tie-in merchandise (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `FANTASIA/2000,' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial
version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of animation and
classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the
original film (the wonderful ``Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' starring
Mickey Mouse). ``Fantasia/2000'' is more backward-looking than
futuristic. The two best segments are ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty
Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld
set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's
``Firebird'' Suite), in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around
the globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the
planet's life forms. Celebrity introductions lend the film the feel
of a deluxe corporate promotion. At the Sony Imax Theater, Broadway
at 68th Street (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `FREQUENCY,' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed by
Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ``Back to the Future'' meets
``Field of Dreams'' meets ``It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ``The
Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental
supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Caviezel is a morose
young policeman who contacts his dead father, a heroic firefighter,
on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the accident that
cost him his life. From here, the two collaborate on changing other
aspects of the past and on catching a serial killer. There are
enough testosterone tears to soak Shea Stadium (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `GLADIATOR,' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott
(R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one
bothered to ask: what would happen if someone decided to film the
imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial?
Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in
the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is
admirable but repellent. As the noble Roman general who ends up
fighting for his life, Crowe gives a performance with ball-of-fire
intensity, suffused with a movie star's impatience. He holds the
movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `GONE IN 60 SECONDS,' starring Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi,
Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall and Christopher Eccelston. Directed
by Dominic Sena (PG-13, 119 minutes). A remake of a movie so
insubstantial that its title seems to refer the length of time it
would linger in a viewer's memory. Cage, who has gone prematurely
blond, is the world's best car thief. He is dragged out of his
apparently lucrative go-cart business and returns to auto theft to
save the life of his brother (Giovanni Ribisi). With a magnetic
cast of crooks and cops, it's mindless hot-rodding entertainment, a
film so glossy and impersonal that you will sympathize more with
the cars than the people (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   `HAMLET,' starring Ethan Hawke and Liev Schreiber. Directed by
Michael Almereyda (R, 112 minutes). Almereyda has rooted his
voluptuous and rewarding new adaptation of Shakespeare's play in
today's Manhattan. The city's contradictions of beauty and squalor
give the movie a sense of place, and New York becomes a complex
character in this vital and sharply intelligent film. Often shaded
in lush, soothing hues of blue, ``Hamlet'' exudes an intoxicating
masochism in which half the cast is battling despondency and the
other half has the glint of imminent insanity. Here the melancholy
of Hamlet (Hawke) over the death of his father is almost a state of
grace: It gives him a sense of purpose that the other characters
lack. The director's rigorous trimming has a boldness and vivacity
that make this version exhilarating while leaving Shakespeare's
language and intent intact (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `HIGH FIDELITY,' starring John Cusack, Jill Peterson, Iben
Hjejle and Joan Cusack. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 107
minutes). Although its setting has been moved from London to
Chicago, the screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling 1995
novel is wonderfully true to the spirit of the book. Cusack has one
of his juiciest roles in Rob, a 30-something record store manager
and vinyl fanatic sorting through the ``Top 5'' breakups in his
disastrous romantic history while trying to salvage his latest
relationship. The movie hilariously captures the mind-set of
not-so-young men for whom pop music is a kind of religion and hip
musical taste an ultimate measure of a person's worth (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST,' starring Kenneth Branagh, Nathan Lane,
Matthew Lillard, Alessandro Nivola and Alicia Silverstone. Directed
by Branagh (PG, 95 minutes). Branagh has decided, for no particular
reason, to festoon an early Shakespeare comedy with classic show
tunes and classic Technicolor movie-musical cinematography. His
cast consists mainly of attractive young movie actors, most of whom
are not terribly adept at singing, dancing or reciting Shakespeare.
But the stumbling amateurism is not without charm. Branagh throws
it all together with the gusto of a man playing a tuba with a bass
drum strapped to his back while his pet monkey leaps around with a
squeeze box. It's not art exactly, or even music, but it's
occasionally entertaining, albeit in an annoying kind of way
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `M:I-2,' starring Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton and Anthony
Hopkins. Directed by John Woo (PG-13, 120 minutes). Cruise returns
as the daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt in Woo's loud, flashy,
incoherent new blockbuster. The film is jampacked with movie
references _ to Hitchcock, to the first ``Mission: Impossible''
movie and to Woo's earlier, and superior, Hong Kong action films _
but it's at once overheated and flat. The plot, involving killer
viruses, is baffling rather than twisty. The introduction of a love
interest ( Newton) who also happens to be the bad guy's
ex-girlfriend adds an element of melodrama that's more grating than
affecting. Some good car chases and explosions, though (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SHANGHAI NOON,' starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Directed
by Tom Dey (PG-13, 110 minutes). Chan is one of the great physical
comedians, and this martial arts western spoof is a high-spirited,
marvelously silly showcase for his talents. Chan plays Chon Wang,
an Imperial Guard dispatched from Beijing to the Old West to rescue
a princess played by Lucy Liu. But the heart of the movie is the
interplay between Chan and Wilson, who depicts his inept outlaw
sidekick with goofy, spacey charm. After the glum bullying of
``Gladiator'' and the noisy bombast of ``M:I-2,'' it's refreshing
to see a movie so good-natured, so confident in its ability to
provoke not queasy awe or numb exhaustion, but pure delight
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SMALL TIME CROOKS,' starring Woody Allen and Tracey Ullman.
Directed and written by Allen (PG, 95 minutes). The sweet, funny
wisp of a movie starts out as a parody of ``Big Deal on Madonna
Street,'' then turns into a child's-eye ``Bonfire of the Vanities''
before returning to its original mode as a caper comedy. Allen and
Ullman are Ray and Frenchy Winkler, an inept thief and ex-con and
his upwardly mobile wife, whose cookie business takes off and
allows her to indulge her dream of being a Park Avenue hostess. If
the movie suffers severely from attention deficit disorder, the
jokes are funny (but mild) and the screwball comic tone is
impeccably sustained. Ullman (putting on her Fern Rosenthal voice)
and Elaine May (as Frenchy's dimwitted cousin) are delightfully
goofy (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SUNSHINE,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle,
Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180
minutes). In Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history,
Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family _
grandfather, father and son _ who endure the corruption of the
Austro-Hungarian empire, the viciousness of fascism and the
brutality of Communism. Fiennes' performances, and those of Ehle
and Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life)
help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of
the story is crudely told, ``Sunshine'' is nonetheless a serious,
humane and thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated
and painful historical experiences (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `U-571,' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon
Jovi, David Keith and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow
(PG-13, 120 minutes). Mostow, whose previous film, ``Breakdown,''
was a marvel of B-picture minimalism, shifts from the wide-open
spaces to the cramped interior of a World War II submarine movie.
McConaughey, whose knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he
were cramming for finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a
Nazi code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and
his crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mostow
does a fine job of building tension, given that he is working in a
minor genre whose climactic notes you will know if you have ever
seen a movie set on a sub (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE VIRGIN SUICIDES,' starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods and
Kathleen Turner. Directed by Sofia Coppola (R, 97 minutes).
Coppola's directorial debut, adapted from Jeffrey Eugenides' 1993
novel about the self-destruction of five sisters in a 1970s
Michigan suburb, shows her to be a filmmaker with fine visual and
emotional instincts, adept at matching the book's hypnotic, sensual
black humor. The movie's best moments have an inspired feeling of
playfulness and freedom matched by Dunst's smart, beguiling
performance as Lux Lisbon, whose sexual awakening propels her and
her sisters to their doom. But despite Coppola's keen instincts,
and the beautifully understated acting of Woods and Turner as the
Lisbon parents, ``The Virgin Suicides'' is marred by the
self-conscious aestheticism and emotional detachment of its source
(Scott).

SOUTH KOREANS VIEW PACT WITH JOY, RELIEF AND CAUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with SKOREA-NKOREA) 
 By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ From farmers tilling rice paddies to
workers in neckties walking busily through high-rise office
buildings, South Koreans were both elated and relieved _ and a bit
wary _ Thursday as their president brought back promises of peace
and reconciliation from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, I saw things happen that I never imagined would
take place,'' said Kim Bok-young, 50, who runs his own business
selling children's clothes, as he waited for a cab in downtown
Seoul. ``In our hearts, I think we have already achieved
reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing that sentiment was Jang Young-joo, a 47-year-old
government worker who was holding a South Korean flag in front of
City Hall in a crowd of hundreds trying to catch a glimpse of
President Kim Dae-jung's motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the negative feelings are gone, and now I want
reunification as soon as possible,'' Jang said. ``We're brothers
and sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   For the younger generation of South Koreans, recent images of
North Koreans broadcast on televisions across the nation were
enough to dispel negative stereotypes ingrained since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, I was taught that North Koreans were
strange,'' said Kim Jung-joon, a 22-year-old medical student, as he
sat in a Starbucks coffee shop in Seoul, preparing for final exams.
``But after seeing them on TV, they weren't as weird as I
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a nation with old memories of the Korean War and fresh
scars of a devastating economic crisis, the prospect of ties with
North Korea seemed both daunting and outright scary.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling out weeds from her rice paddy in Pyongtaek, a city some
40 miles south of Seoul, Kim Ok &UR; - &LR; su, 75, let out a deep breath
when asked how she felt about the possibility of reunification or
expanded exchanges with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much, but I think there will be many difficulties
after reunification, and lots of money we'd have to spend,'' Kim
said shyly, as she wiped away sweat from her forehead. ``My
youngest boy lost his job after the IMF,'' she added, alluding to
the economic crisis that broke out in late 1997, causing South
Korea to turn to the International Monetary Fund for emergency
loans. ``He still hasn't found a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion about North Korea led Kim to reminisce about the
Korean War, which started 50 years ago. The memories may have
become hazy, but judging from her expression, they are still
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commies came to our village with guns and took our food
and wouldn't even let us leave our lights on at night,'' she said.
``They killed a lot of people here. Just thinking about commies
makes me shudder.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping for a cold drink and a cigarette at a grocery store
less than a mile away from Kim's rice paddy, Song Yoon-sup, a
36-year-old truck driver, said he felt awkward and worried because
of the enormous changes that took place over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until just recently, we were cursing North Korea and vowing to
defeat them,'' Song said. ``And all of a sudden, we're calling Kim
Jong Il `chairman,''' a reference to the North Korean leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does all of the change mean that two of our countrymen would
have to feed one North Korean,'' he wondered, ``or does it mean
increasing their productivity by transforming them to become
capitalists?''
</P>
<P>
   Such harsh realists were not difficult to find back in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Keun-hong, a business consultant wearing a pressed linen
suit and a smart hairdo, was in no hurry to see North and South
Korea unite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope reunification does not happen until 15 to 20 years
later, and even then, I hope only a partial reunion would happen,''
said Kim, 29. ``I am still suspicious of their theatrics, and the
financial costs would be hard to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   But many ordinary South Koreans clearly felt that the first step
had been taken on the path toward a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we were able to open our hearts and talk with
each other is incredible,'' said Kim Bok Young, the owner of the
children's clothing company. ``Now it's time to tackle the
objectives one at a time.''

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Fighting between Ethiopian and Eritrean
soldiers paused Thursday as ministers from both nations prepared to
sign a preliminary cease-fire on Sunday that would involve yet
another role for United Nations peacekeepers in a conflict in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the two-year war _ which has cost tens of thousands of
lives _ seems decisively closer to an end. Thursday top ministers
from each nation were preparing to travel back to Algeria to sign
the document brokered there by the Organization for African Unity
over the last two weeks. On Wednesday night, a final hurdle was
cleared when Ethiopia accepted the plan, which Eritrea approved
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Outside officials said they were cautiously optimistic that this
was the first concrete step toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a simple `OK, we will not shoot,''' said a
senior administration official in the United States, which was
deeply involved in negotiating the deal. ``It's a very solid
foundation to deal with remaining issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that in signing this they are
committing to resolving these issues politically and peacefully and
not through the barrel of a gun,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for an immediate cease-fire and the creation of a
15-mile buffer zone, outside the range of most artillery fire, to
be patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers. That buffer zone would be
entirely in Eritrean territory, reflecting the gains Ethiopia won
on the ground in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said the signing would be only the first step
toward a resolution of the conflict. The heart of the final deal is
an independent commission to establish the border between the two
nations officially, a complicated process involving century-old
colonial treaties that are far from clear. Disagreement over who
owned what, in fact, set off the war in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a question of what will happen in the next weeks
or months, in the time between the signing and the arrival of the
first peacekeepers. Ethiopian forces will remain on Eritrean
territory until then _ and for two weeks afterward _ and no one
rules out further skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both sides, however, said Thursday that they
would respect the cease-fire and that they would now turn their
attention to the demarcation of their 620-mile border. The issue
may be particularly important to Eritrea because Ethiopian troops
have not only pushed it out of the disputed areas but now occupy
land that unquestionably belongs to Eritrea.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Territorial gains mean nothing,'' said Yemane Ghebremeskel, a
spokesman for the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopian officials, denying that their losses were huge, cast
the war as a protection of their sovereignty, which they say
Eritrea violated by moving troops into several areas along the
border it claimed as its own in May 1998. Selome Taddesse, a
spokeswoman for Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, said she
believed it would be proved that the territory belonged to
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident we have nothing to lose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war began, Ethiopia and Eritrea had been allies, with
growing economies and a close friendship with many Western nations,
the United States chief among them. In 1993, Eritrea, for a
generation the northernmost province of Ethiopia, won its
independence, though the new border between them was never
officially marked off.
</P>
<P>
   A series of border skirmishes escalated quickly into full-scale
warfare, with long lines of trenches, tanks, artillery bombardments
and air raids. In the process two nations considered to be the most
stable on the Horn of Africa _ in the same region as Sudan and
Somalia, in a near-constant state of war _ were also thrown into
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both nations, as well as Western countries
looking to restore that stability, say they hope they can begin to
concentrate again on developing their now-demolished economies.
</P>
<P>
   One major issue outstanding is exactly what role the United
Nations will play and when. A U.N. spokeswoman, Marie Okabe, said a
three-member planning team was expected to go Algeria this weekend
to begin preparations for the deployment of peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, the Security Council has not decided whether to
actually send them. So there are no estimates of when they could
go, from which countries and in what numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes at an awkward time for U.N. peacekeeping
operations in Africa, only weeks after dozens of peacekeepers were
kidnapped in Sierra Leone. That debacle has cast doubt on a planned
operation for Congo, in which 5,537 peacekeepers and observers have
been approved to shore up a shaky peace deal among six nations
fighting there.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said, however, that the peacekeeping operation
in Ethiopia and Eritrea would be far more straightforward:
peacekeepers could be deployed along a clearly established front
line between opposing armies that have largely fought by the
generally accepted rules of war. There are none of the irregular
forces or renegade rebel troops that can make peacekeeping
operations far more complicated, uncertain and treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very different operation,'' the U.S. official said.
``But obviously the parties are going to have to live up their
agreement. And there is no justifiable reason for guns to be fired
once this agreement is signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the vague language of the preliminary peace agreement,
there are already differing interpretations in how each side views
the peacekeepers' role. Taddesse said the peacekeepers must be
confined to the buffer zone in Eritrea. Ghebremeskel, the Eritrean
spokesman, said he understood that peacekeepers were to patrol both
sides of the border.

SHOOTING INCIDENT DELAYS U.N. VERIFICATION OF ISRAELI EXIT FROM
LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>

   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations is hoping to finish up the
job of verifying that Israel has withdrawn from southern Lebanon,
but its work was frustrated Thursday when Israeli soldiers fired
shots near a U.N. team visiting one of the last remaining unchecked
border sites.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli authorities expressed regret over the incident, which
forced the postponement of an expected announcement here that the
border verification was complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was a stupid mistake and let's get on with the
verification tomorrow,'' said a U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard. He
and other officials expressed confidence that the tortuous task
could be completed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Four shots were fired into the air and a fifth into the ground,
just yards from the deputy commander of the U.N. peacekeeping
contingent in southern Lebanon. The shots forced the inspection
team, consisting of U.N. and Lebanese military officials, to
retreat from the immediate area.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation that Israel has left southern Lebanon would allow
the United Nations to start deploying its own peacekeepers on the
border and give the signal for the Lebanese government to reassert
its authority in southern Lebanon.

ELIAN'S MIAMI RELATIVES ASK FOR REVIEW OF COURT DECISION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez
on Thursday asked all 12 judges of the federal appeals court based
in Atlanta to reverse a decision that would allow the boy's father
to take him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a panel of three judges from that court dealt a
major setback to the relatives who have been trying to keep
6-year-old Elian in the United States. The three judges ruled
unanimously that the Immigration and Naturalization Service, part
of the Justice Department, had the authority to decide that only
Elian's father could act for such a young child in immigration
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, opposes the request for
asylum filed on the boy's behalf by the Miami relatives. Gonzalez,
who has been living with his son in a leafy Washington neighborhood
while the legal case is being decided, has said he will return to
Cuba with Elian as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives, who had been given 14 days to appeal the
panel's decision of June 1, filed papers Thursday contending that
the judges had misinterpreted the law and the Constitution. In
particular, they argued that the judges had neglected to consider a
Supreme Court ruling issued last month, which they contended should
have a substantial effect on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel based its ruling largely on a 1984 Supreme
Court decision that executive branch agencies like the immigration
service are entitled to wide discretion in interpreting their own
regulations. While the judges gave broad hints that they did not
agree with the immigration service's decision to deny an asylum
hearing, they were emphatic that the agency's officials were free
to make a decision without judicial interference as long as it was
not unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although courts should not be unquestioning, we should respect
other branches' policy-making powers,'' the judges wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the Miami relatives say that the three judges
ignored a ruling the Supreme Court handed down on May 1. In that
case, the justices ruled 6-3 that courts need not defer to an
executive agency decision that is ``contained in an opinion
letter'' as opposed to a ruling made after a formal procedure in
which notice is given and comment is taken from the public.
</P>
<P>
   The May 1 ruling came in a Texas case in which the justices
rejected a Labor Department ruling and said public employers, like
state governments and their agencies, can require employees to take
compensatory time off at specific times.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service's decision on whether a 6-year-old like
Elian could seek asylum independently from his father was an agency
interpretation of the existing law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This error undeniably affected the outcome of this case,''
said the brief filed on behalf of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   To secure a rehearing, Lazaro Gonzalez and his family would have
to convince at least seven of the 12 judges on the 11th Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals. The odds are generally against obtaining
such a review because of the momentum provided by the earlier
opinion. But if the Miami relatives should succeed, Elian's case
would carry on for weeks, if not months, as the full 12-member
court reviewed the case from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   If the full court denied the request for a rehearing, it would
set in motion a process that would allow Juan Miguel Gonzalez to
take Elian back to Cuba in a matter of days. The boy's father is
under a court order not to remove Elian from the United States. But
the three-judge panel said the order would be lifted as soon as it
issued a mandate enforcing the ruling. Under normal circumstances
that would occur seven days after the final decision at the appeals
court level.
</P>
<P>
   That means, for example, if the full court declined to hear the
case, Juan Miguel Gonzalez would be free to return to Cuba with
Elian seven days later.
</P>
<P>
   The only remaining remedy for the Miami relatives would be to
seek an emergency stay from the Supreme Court within those seven
days. But that would be a remote possibility if the appeals court
decided against them because the Supreme Court issues such stays
only in cases in which there is a substantial likelihood of
success.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who has been resolute in insisting
that the boy belongs with his father, said Thursday that she hoped
``that the matter could be considered and ruled upon promptly and
that we can go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Juan Miguel Gonzalez and the Justice Department have
until Tuesday morning to file a reply brief with the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was picked up floating on an inner tube in the Caribbean
after the boat in which he and his mother had been bound for
Florida capsized. His mother and 10 others drowned, and Elian was
placed by the authorities with Lazaro Gonzalez in Miami. After Juan
Miguel Gonzalez came to the United States on April 6 with his wife
and Elian's half-brother, the Miami relatives refused to relinquish
custody, which resulted in a raid by federal agents, who seized the
boy on April 22.

WORLD BANK BLAMES DIAMONDS AND DRUGS FOR MANY WARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rebels fighting civil conflicts around the world
are more often motivated by greedy pursuit of lucrative
commodities, like diamonds and drugs, than by political, ethnic or
religious goals, a World Bank study released Thursday concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, which studied 47 civil wars that took place from
Afghanistan to Zimbabwe between 1960 and 1999, found that the
single biggest risk factor for the outbreak of war was a nation's
economic dependence on commodities. Eagerness to profit from
coffee, narcotics, diamonds and other gemstones prompts outbreaks
of violence and determines their strength over time, the study
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds are the guerrilla's best friend,'' said Paul Collier,
the author of the study and director of research in the economics
department of the World Bank, based in Washington. ``Civil wars are
far more likely to be caused by economic opportunities than by
grievance.''
</P>
<P>
   The report points to numerous specific examples. Sierra Leone's
civil war is primarily about the control of diamond mines in that
nation, the report says. In Nigeria, the Biafran secessionist
movement involved a struggle for control of an oil-producing
region. Collier likened the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
rebel group to a sizable narcotics corporation, with 12,000 paid
fighters and $700 million in annual revenues from drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The study's conclusions are sweeping. Rebels typically claim
that they are fighting their governments to right religious, ethnic
and political wrongs, the study says, but those are often either
coincidental or after-the-fact justifications for war. The study
suggests that many rebel groups are no more moved by ideological
aims than the Mafia is.
</P>
<P>
   By analyzing a database of civil conflicts, the study found that
the degree of social inequality, the openness of the political
system and even the extent of ethnic diversity are poor predictors
of civil war. Not all commodity-rich nations are embattled _
geography, education levels and per capita income matter greatly _
but the availability of commodities to plunder is their single
biggest common problem, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   The study makes valid points that could be useful in preventing
or resolving civil conflicts, said Edward N. Luttwak, a senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Western nations could crack down on the illicit sale of these
commodities to limit rebellions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Luttwak contended that some of the study's broad conclusions
go too far. Many conflicts involve genuine political and social
agendas, even when control of commodities is also an issue, he
said. He pointed to Sudan and Myanmar, formerly Burma, where some
rebels have sustained rebellions against the government but have
not prospered greatly from commodities. And it would be hard to
make the case that the Yugoslav civil war was primarily about
commodities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collier said his study did not make a distinction between
bandits who launch a rebellion solely for financial gain and
self-described freedom fighters who decide to challenge the
government because they have been persecuted unjustly. But he said
his data strongly suggest that whatever the original motivations,
violent civil conflicts tend to be sustained by the pursuit of
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The study says the best way to prevent conflict and restore
peace is to effectively control commodity production and to wean
nations away from a heavy dependence on cash crops and natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels should be barred from selling ill-gotten commodities on
the international market and governments should use profits from
commodity sales to provide social services, which would undercut
popular support for rebellions, the study says.

ROBERT TRENT JONES SR., PROLIFIC GOLF COURSE ARCHITECT, IS DEAD AT
93 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J., Va., Ala., N.Y., England)   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Trent Jones, the golf architect who designed or remodeled
more than 500 courses, and who once made a hole in one to justify
his redesign of a hole, died on Wednesday night at his home in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had been in poor health since having a stroke last
summer, had retired to Florida. But for most of his career he
worked out of offices in Montclair, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In his seven decades as golf's most prolific architect, Jones
logged an estimated 8 million miles in creating more than 350
courses and remodeling more than 150 others, including 79 that were
used for the U.S. Open or other national championships. His courses
endure in 45 states and 35 foreign countries on every continent
except Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun never sets,'' he enjoyed saying, ``on a Robert Trent
Jones golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   His death came on the eve of the U.S. Open, which began Thursday
in Pebble Beach, Calif. He had become linked to that championship
because so many were played on courses he either designed or
remodeled.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Trent,'' he was a small, cherub-faced man, but his
sometimes sadistic use of huge bunkers, ponds, creeks and
undulating greens often angered the touring pros, especially during
the U.S. Open. Jones believed he was merely defending par against
the evolution of golf equipment and the golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shattering of par without a proper challenge is a fraud,''
he often said. ``I make them play par.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jones redesigned the fourth hole at the Baltusrol Golf
Club's Lower Course in Springfield, N.J., before the 1954 U.S.
Open, some members thought the par-3 over a pond was unfair. He
offered to play the hole along with Johnny Farrell, the club pro,
and two members while other members watched.
</P>
<P>
   Playing from the 165-yard members tee, Farrell and the two
members each hit their ball on the green. Jones stepped up and
swung his 4-iron. His ball landed on the green and rolled into the
cup for a hole in one. Turning to the assembled members, he said:
``Gentlemen, the hole is fair. Eminently fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Jones worked on 21 courses that would hold the
U. S. Open, notably Oakland Hills in Birmingham, Mich., in 1951.
None of the world's best golfers broke par-70 that year until the
final day when Ben Hogan, the winner, shot 67 and Clayton Haefner
shot 69.
</P>
<P>
   At the presentation ceremony, Hogan said, ``I'm glad I brought
this course, this monster, to its knees.'' At a reception later,
Hogan turned to Jones' wife, Ione, and said, ``If your husband had
to play this course for a living, he'd be on the bread line.''
Jones relished retelling both of Hogan's comments.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1970 U.S. Open at Hazeltine National, the touring pro
Dave Hill, who had shot 75 and 69, publicly criticized Jones'
design. Asked what the course lacked, Hill said, ``Eighty acres of
corn and a few cows.'' Asked what should be done to correct the
course, Hill said, ``Plow it up and start over.''
</P>
<P>
   High winds had created high scores. When the winds eased, Tony
Jacklin won that Open with 281, 7-under par. Hill was second at
288, even-par.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is a form of attack and counterattack,'' Jones often
said. ``It offers a golfer his personal challenge of combat. He
attacks the course and par, the architect creates fair pitfalls to
defend its easy conquest. The architect calls on his ingenuity to
create a hole that will reward only achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones collaborated with the late Bobby Jones, the legendary
golfer (no relation), in designing Peachtree in Atlanta. At Bobby
Jones' request, he also redesigned the 11th and 16th holes at
Augusta National, the site of the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his 21 U.S. Open courses, Jones worked on 12
courses that have held the PGA Championship and six that held the
World Cup. He designed Valderrama in Spain, the site of the 1997
Ryder Cup matches, and the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club course in
Manassas, Va., the site of the 1994 and 1996 President's Cup
matches.
</P>
<P>
   He created a putting green at the White House for President
Eisenhower, as well as a hole with three different tees at Camp
David, the president's weekend retreat in Maryland. Jones' clients
included the Rockefeller family, the Aga Khan and King Hassan II of
Morocco. But among his last designs were 18 public layouts in
Alabama, the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at a piece of ground,'' he said, ``and you know
instinctively what makes a great hole. There is a flow and rhythm
that you can feel. You think how to stake it out, then use logic to
make the right choice. It's like a jigsaw puzzle. But you have play
golf well, too. You have to know the value of shots, how far the
ball will go and what it will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is survived by his two sons, Robert Trent Jr. and Rees,
both prominent golf architects who have been involved in more than
250 courses. His wife died in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ince, England, on June 20, 1906, he was 6 when he
accompanied his parents to East Rochester, N.Y., where he later
caddied at The Country Club of Rochester. He soon developed into a
scratch golfer, and was the low amateur in the 1927 Canadian Open.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, Jones met and was inspired by Donald Ross, the
Scottish golf architect who was designing Oak Hill in Rochester. At
Cornell, Jones studied surveying, agronomy, landscaping,
horticulture, architecture and sketching.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first architect inducted into the World Golf Hall of
Fame. He was a founding member and a former president of the
American Society of Golf Course Architects and the first recipient
of its Donald Ross Award. He was the author of ``Golf's Magnificent
Challenge'' and edited ``Great Golf Stories,'' an anthology.
</P>
<P>
   Golf was always in his thoughts. After suffering a stroke once,
he awakened in his hospital bed to see his two sons at his bedside.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing here?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a little setback,'' he was told. ``You had a stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have to count it?'' he said. &QL;

MICROSOFT ADVANCES APPEALS COURT FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: ``findings'' in 9th graf is cq) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Continuing the battle of the briefs, Microsoft told
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on
Thursday that it should ignore a government brief asking it not to
begin work on the company's antitrust appeal until the Supreme
Court decides whether to take it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, the 19 state attorneys general who are
their partners, and the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, are
all working to move Microsoft's appeal directly to the Supreme
Court, under an obscure law known as the Expediting Act. But the
company wants its case heard first by the Court of Appeals, which
ruled in its favor in a previous case.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-page brief filed Thursday afternoon in response to a
government filing on Wednesday, Microsoft raised a potentially
important argument: it asserted that the states are not covered by
the Expediting Act, which allows direct appeal of significant
antitrust cases ``in which the United States is the complainant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the states dispute that
interpretation, but all parties acknowledge that they are debating
an unsettled area of the law with no direct precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a court ruling in Microsoft's favor on this point would
damage the direct-appeal effort, probably ensuring that the appeals
of the federal and state cases against Microsoft would be heard by
the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   That court has shown that it is eager to take the appeal, and
analysts say they believe that Microsoft's chances would be better
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department declined to respond to Microsoft's brief
Thursday, though it remains possible _ even likely, given the legal
maneuvers of the last week _ that the department will file its own
brief on the subject later.
</P>
<P>
   But the department already addressed the issue of the Expediting
Act at length in a brief filed with Jackson on Tuesday. In that
brief, and in Microsoft's offering Thursday, both sides extracted
isolated moments or statements from the long antitrust trial to
support the view that the two cases should or should not remain
joined for appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal cases were researched and prepared
separately but filed jointly and consolidated for trial. The brief
filed by the Justice Department on Tuesday noted that at the start
of the antitrust trial, Microsoft ``called consolidation
`unquestionably appropriate' because of `the same factual and legal
theories' that `go to the very heart' of both suits.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that Jackson ``entered a single findings of fact, a
single set of conclusions of law and a single final judgment in the
case.'' Jackson ordered a breakup of Microsoft and restrictions on
its conduct last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's brief notes that the states asked for the right
to conduct separate cross-examinations during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear which court will settle the debate. But the
Court of Appeals may already have its own opinion. When the judges
decided on Tuesday that the full court, not the usual three-judge
panel, would hear the case, they issued two separate orders, one
for the Justice Department and the other for the states.

MURDOCH'S NEWS CORP. BRANCHING OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. been left behind in the digital
age?
</P>
<P>
   After an early and expensive Web fiasco, the company, which owns
Fox television, Twentieth Century Fox, HarperCollins and a
worldwide collection of other media assets, has kept a low profile
on the Internet. Murdoch has publicly criticized the pending sale
of Time Warner to America Online and has said that Internet
companies are valued far too highly for News Corp. to consider a
similar merger.
</P>
<P>
   But since the AOL-Time Warner linkup, Murdoch has been working
feverishly to put in place a huge media-technology deal of his own
that will answer questions about his digital strategy.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Friday, News Corp. will file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to sell shares in a new company holding all the
interests in satellite television that it has been building up over
the last decade _ including the vast Star system in Asia, BSkyB in
Britain, and stakes in other systems in Europe and Latin America
that collectively reach 100 million homes in 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect the new company, which will use some variation
of the Sky name, to be valued at more than $40 billion, almost as
much as the parent company. With the company expected to raise
perhaps $5 billion, it will be the largest media offering in
history.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly the sort of financial engineering that has been
the hallmark of the News Corp. But what does satellite television
have to do with the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Everything, in the News Corp.'s view. As Internet connections
become faster, people will gravitate to video content rather than
just words and pictures, it figures. More important, now that cable
and satellite systems are moving to digital transmission, the
channel-changing box is turning into a specialized computer that
can deliver interactive information games and shopping over the
television screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average household spends seven hours in front of the
television,'' said Peter Chernin, the president of News Corp.
``Imagine what we can do if we change the relationship from one way
to two way.'' (Murdoch, the 68-year-old chairman, declined to be
interviewed, citing his treatment for prostate cancer.)
</P>
<P>
   The set-top box could also become the hub of a network linking
other household devices from telephones to power meters, especially
for homes without a computer. By creating Sky and using the money
from the offering to deploy those boxes rapidly around the world,
News Corp. hopes to head off other competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for many homes outside the United States, that box may
be the only computer in a household and could be the hub that links
to other household devices, from telephones to electric meters,
each of which could generate fees for the box's owner. So News
Corp. has realized that its television business can be transformed
into something that is as much a technology network, if it moves
fast enough. It is talking about bringing in a technology company,
like Microsoft or a wireless telephone player, as a major investor
in Sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving from a television world to a multimedia world in
which we can create an array of content services and applications,
for satellite, wireless and other platforms,'' said Chase Carey,
the co-chief operating officer of News Corp., who become president
and chief executive of Sky, based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another motive for the creation of Sky, one that
has little to do with new technology and everything to with the
panic of television programmers during the two days last month when
Time Warner pulled Disney's ABC off its cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world moving to five, six seven major media companies,
you don't want to be in a position where you have to count on
others,'' said Chernin, ``You need to have enough marketplace
dominance that people are forced to deal with you.''
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. itself had to enlist the help of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani to get Time Warner Cable to carry the Fox News Channel in
New York. While News Corp. does not have any cable or satellite
distribution of its own in the United States, it hopes that Sky's
dominance of television distribution outside of the United States
will give it increased bargaining clout with the media companies
here.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say that News Corp. plans to keep Sky out of
the United States. It has tried and failed several times to build
or buy a satellite broadcasting system here.
</P>
<P>
   If Sky's shares are valued as high as the company hopes,
analysts say it will try to use that stock to buy EchoStar
Communications Corp. or DirecTV, the most valuable asset in General
Motors' Hughes Communications unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``By setting up a financial vehicle for its satellite assets,
News Corp. will have a means of using a high-multiple currency to
make acquisitions, and GM Hughes is a natural target,'' said Ed
Hatch, a media analyst at SG Cowen.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was speculation a few months ago that Murdoch was
considering a bid for General Motors solely to get at DirecTV. The
car business, presumably, he would jettison as an unneeded
byproduct.
</P>
<P>
   Chernin declined to comment on the GM talk but he hardly
disclaimed interest in DirecTV. News Corp., he said, has long
believed that owning content like programming and distribution like
satellite systems is equally important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are great arguments and debates about whether content is
king or distribution is king,'' Chernin said. ``At the end of the
day, scale is king. If you can spread your costs over a large base,
you can outbid your competitors for programming and other assets
you want to buy.'' (In England, this week, News Corp. exercised the
power of its scale, when BSkyB won the rights to the top soccer
league, bidding 1.1 billion pounds.)
</P>
<P>
   But Chernin said Sky would have a strong business even without a
satellite company here. It will have a toehold in interactive
television in the United States through its 20 percent stake in the
soon-to-be-merged TV Guide Gemstar. TV Guide magazine still has 10
million subscribers, but the company is now focused on producing
electronic program guides used on set top boxes to select from the
hundreds of available channels.
</P>
<P>
   Even outside the United States, News Corp. will face a
considerable challenge tying together its holdings. The only part
of the Sky empire it owns outright is Star in Asia. The rest are a
collection of partnerships, but Carey insists that in most
countries News Corp. has effective management control, despite the
ownership stakes of local partners.

 UNDATED: partners.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, News Corp. has been negotiating, so far
unsuccessfully, to bring more partners into Sky in other regions.
Jean-Marie Messier, the chief executive of Vivendi, has publicly
expressed interest in linking its 49 percent of Canal Plus,
Europe's largest pay television service, to Sky. But that was
before he began negotiating to buy Seagram and its Universal movie
and music studios. Carey said that News Corp. is not in discussions
with Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is to say that people in any country will want to shop
or read information on a television screen, given the disappointing
results of earlier trials?
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. has been emboldened by the experience of BSkyB, which
made a pre-emptive move to convert its system from analog to
digital signals starting in 1998. By giving away set-top boxes
worth $200, the company converted 3.4 million of its 4.2 million
subscribers to the digital system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to more channels, BSkyB offers an interactive
television service called Open, with the usual crop of information
pages on news, weather and sports. But use has been far higher than
other such services. Half of the customers use it at least once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. is hardly alone in betting on the future of media
convergence. America Online is about to introduce its own AOL TV
set-top box. Microsoft has gussied up its WebTV product. In Europe,
moreover, companies are lining up to pay as much as $5 billion for
licenses to offer the next generation of wireless telephone service
called 3G, which is also capable of delivering high-speed data
services.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. has not bid for wireless licensees. But it figures
that Sky's position straddling media and technology will let it cut
deals to merge wireless services with its Sky offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies just bid a lot of money for 3G licenses so
they can compete with four other companies that offer the same
thing,'' Carey said. ``They are going to need to differentiate
their cell phone services and clearly we can bring our brands, our
content and the services we are developing.''

ANALYSIS: THOUGH HOPEFUL, U.S. OBSERVERS PUZZLED BY NORTH KOREA'S
MOTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SKOREA-NKOREA) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The agreement signed at the summit in Pyongyang on
Wednesday, just days shy of the 50th anniversary of the start of
the Korean War, was brimming with words that heralded the arrival
of peace. Yet the two countries are still technically at war, and
no one wants to raise the question of who would govern a unified
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's prime minister likened the breakthrough to the fall of
the Berlin Wall, yet the DMZ, or demilitarized zone dividing the
two Koreas, remains firmly in place, an ugly barbed-wire scar
running across the Korean Peninsula. There is no popular uprising
against the communist government in the North, and no serious
discussion of removing the hundreds of thousands of troops and a
terrifying concentration of weaponry that line both sides of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, U.S. officials trying Thursday to puzzle their way
through North Korea's apparent, or at least public, change of
attitude said they saw the first real glimmer of hope that one of
the last remnants of the Cold War could gradually erode, and that
North Korea might soon be regarded less as a rogue state and more
like just another failed state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly what's going on is hard to read,'' said Nicholas
Eberstadt, a longtime Korea scholar in Washington. ``Kim Jong Il
proved that he really is a movie-maker, and he made himself the
star,'' Eberstadt said, referring to the North Korean leader's
obsession with the cinema, which once led him to kidnap a South
Korean director and a famous actress to build him a film industry.
</P>
<P>
   But no one in Washington pretends to understand the rest of the
script in Kim's latest production. In meetings at the White House
and the State Department on Thursday, some wondered aloud whether
the sudden emergence of the reclusive North Korean leader was a
one-time anomaly or a radical change of strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Is he prepared to pull his troops back from the demilitarized
zone and dismantle the tens of thousands of mortar and missiles
that could destroy Seoul in an hour? And, if so, should the United
States be ready to talk about pulling its 37,000 troops out of the
Korean Peninsula, as the North has demanded for years? Could a
country whose major export consists of missiles and arms shipped to
the Middle East break himself of the arms trade, or satisfy the
United States that it should be removed from the State Department's
list of terrorist nations?
</P>
<P>
   If it did, the desperately poor country would suddenly be
eligible for aid from the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund. But the aid would inevitably come attached to communications
technology, an influx of foreigners and outside ideas _ all
anathema in a country where radios can only be tuned to the
official government stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly has to be taken as a change in North Korean
tactics in how to engage the world,'' said Robert Gallucci, who
negotiated the 1994 deal with North Korea to freeze its nuclear
program and is now dean of Georgetown University's school of
foreign service. ``Whether it is a strategic change, or whether
this is truly a new North Korean approach to the world, it is
simply too early to know. There is a lot of history here: War,
terrorism, nuclear ambitions, incidents at sea, that suggests the
need for a lot of caution.''
</P>
<P>
   None of those issues were discussed at length at the summit. But
South Korean officials who telephoned Washington on Thursday said
that President Kim Dae-jung had raised the questions of North
Korea's nuclear program and missile exports in his talk with his
North Korean counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   But he did so chiefly to alert him that these issues remain
major stumbling blocks, according to U.S. and South Korean
officials, and he made no effort to address them in a summit that
was mostly about setting a tone of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The full briefing for U.S. officials will come Friday and this
weekend, when South Korea's national security adviser arrives in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   So the Clinton administration Thursday was clearly trying to
balance caution with encouragement for Kim Jong Il, a man until
recently regarded as an Asian Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of euphoria in the south,'' said one
senior administration official who has been deeply involved in
negotiations with the North for years. ``But is there a change in
the million-man army? In the missile program? In the North's
nuclear ambitions?''
</P>
<P>
   The only conclusion the administration could safely reach, he
said Thursday afternoon, was ``not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of the new opening by the North will be plumbed
repeatedly in the next few months _ by South Korea, Japan and the
United States. The United States has missile talks with the North
that begin in a few weeks. Japan is negotiating a possible
resumption of diplomatic relations _ if it can resolve the issue of
Japanese women believed kidnapped by the North, and the country's
continued harboring of members of the Japanese Red Army terrorist
group. South Korea, once the euphoria dies down, will learn whether
the exchanges of families, the communications links and the
cultural exchanges _ all promised before _ turn into reality.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that with this week's summit, the
Clinton administration finds itself at a very different place than
it was six years ago this week. At the time the United States was
about to support sanctions against North Korea for its refusal to
allow inspectors to visit the site of its suspected nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was warned by his top military advisers that the North
could make good on its threat that it would respond to the
sanctions by invading the south. Clinton was about to order more
troops to the region, to back up the B-2 bombers he had recently
dispatched to within easy reach of the DMZ.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a policy of rapprochement that the administration entered
reluctantly _ at the urging of Kim Dae-jung when he came to office
two years ago _ has radically changed the atmosphere. The mystery
is whether it has also changed the nature of the North Korean
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The larger North Korea issues for the White House may well fall
to the next president. Al Gore or George W. Bush may have to face
the question of whether there is a justification for keeping U.S.
troops in South Korea if the threat they have deterred since 1953,
when the Korean War came to an uneasy armistice, no longer appears
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   And Gallucci noted Thursday that the decision over whether to
develop and deploy a national missile defense _ a $60 billion
program in which North Korea has long been cited as the most urgent
``rogue state'' threat _ might have to be rethought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have based the logic of the system on the threat from North
Korea, and the assumption that its leaders are not impressed by
ordinary nuclear deterrence,'' the former nuclear weapons
negotiator said. ``If it turns out that we are revising our
thinking about those North Korean leaders, then it suggests that we
might have to reassess the whole plan.''

RENO SAYS DEFENDANTS FACING 
DEATH PENALTY DESERVE BETTER LAWYERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno, lending her voice to a
raging national debate over capital punishment, said Thursday that
too many people on trial for their lives have incompetent attorneys
defending them.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, the nation's top prosecutor, called on states to ensure
that defendants _ especially those charged with a capital offense _
receive adequate representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not be prosecuted for a capital crime until they
have a lawyer who can properly represent them and they have the
investigative and other resources necessary to properly investigate
the charges against them,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states bear a responsibility in terms of prosecution to
ensure that if they're going to prosecute, they should make sure
that the person being prosecuted has competent counsel. And if the
person can't afford it, that it be provided in real terms, not just
in name.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno called it ``critically important'' that defendants facing
the death penalty have access to all forensic and investigatory
resources that will permit them to pursue their claims of
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very important that all defendants charged with
crimes that have significant sanctions, that clearly people charged
with a capital crime should have . . . good lawyers who can
properly represent them,'' she said. ``In too many instances in
this country, people charged with capital crimes do not.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno recalled her years as a Miami prosecutor and the day a man
walked through the courtroom after his death sentence had been set
aside and his conviction overturned after spending 21 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget turning around and looking over my
shoulder at that man who walked out of the courthouse free for the
first time in 21 years and to think that he could have gone to the
electric chair for a crime I did not think he committed,'' Reno
said. ``We just can't do that. We cannot let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's comments came as national attention has focused on the
death penalty partly because of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
presidential campaign as well as a recent event in Illinois, a
university study and pending federal legislation critical of
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who had allowed 131 executions during his 5 { years in
office before granting a 30-day reprieve to a convicted killer June
1 to pursue DNA tests, has campaigned as being tough on criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a fellow Republican, declared in
February a moratorium on executions in that state. Ryan called for
the halt after the convictions of 13 death-row inmates in Illinois
had been overturned since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Columbia University reported Monday that two-thirds
of all death penalty cases appealed between 1973 and 1995 were
riddled with such serious errors that the verdicts were overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, explaining
the difficulty of finding competent lawyers to handle death-penalty
cases, said the lawyers most likely to accept court appointments to
these trials are the least experienced or least competent. These
attorneys are most likely to have the fewest clients and,
therefore, greater time and inclination to take the low-paying
criminal cases, the group added.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has proposed legislation that would
require states to create agencies to appoint experienced lawyers
for defendants facing the death penalty and to ensure that these

   The Ford Taurus factory in Atlanta has no air-conditioning to
ward off the sweltering heat of Georgia summer. Its scuffed, black
concrete floors and sooty ceiling beams hold the grit of 53 years
of car-building. While orange robots dodge and weave to weld car
roofs and sides, hundreds of men and women work on the assembly
line. To all appearances, it is an utterly ordinary car factory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Atlanta plant is, in fact, special. According to a
highly regarded annual study released Thursday, the factory is the
most efficient in North America, representing the first time that a
U.S.-owned auto plant has surpassed Japanese-owned factories on
this continent in labor productivity.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, productivity has improved across the U.S.-owned
auto industry in recent years. While a Ford plant ranked as No. 1,
the biggest overall efficiency gains last year took place at
General Motors, once known for inefficiency. Ford is the most
efficient U.S. automaker, although its performance was marginally
worse by some measures last year because of the production of very
big, complicated vehicles like the new Ford Excursion sport
utility.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, Detroit automakers have gradually
made up much, though certainly not all, of the productivity gap
between U.S.-owned factories and those owned by the Japanese. They
have done so not primarily through the use of high-tech computers
and robots, although they have integrated such equipment into their
factories, but through improved management and organization,
according to Harbour &AMP; Associates, which issued Thursday's report.
And while Japanese automakers continue to set the standard in
quality, better management is helping Detroit automakers start to
catch up in reliability, too, although precise estimates vary
widely for how much the quality gap has closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of overall performance, not just labor productivity,
they continue to close the gap,'' said Ronald Harbour, the
consulting firm's president. ``But the Japanese are not standing
still and still lead in quality, productivity and manufacturing
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, when competition with Japan bordered on a
national obsession, the productivity gap between U.S. and Japanese
factories, particularly auto factories, was a major preoccupation
for politicians, corporate executives, and investors alike. Ten
years of economic stagnation in Japan and the rise of America's
high-tech industries have pushed auto productivity comparisons out
of the limelight. But while the nation's attention has moved on to
Microsoft and the Internet, much has changed in the nation's auto
factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, there was a widely held, popular view that Japan
represented the economic future,'' said Robert Shapiro, the
undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs. ``Since the 1980s,
the U.S. auto industry has recovered very nicely, and in part that
reflects productivity gains.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, GM, Ford Motor and Chrysler, now a division of
DaimlerChrysler, required more than twice as much labor as their
Japanese competitors to build a car. Today they need 18 to 50
percent more hours of labor in the factory. That is still a hefty
disadvantage, to be sure, but it is manageable because manual labor
now accounts for only a tenth of the cost of a car as other
expenses, like design and engineering, have grown.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's problem is that it has been unable to improve
management practices at all factories. But a few of Detroit's
best-run factories are now as efficient as the Japanese operations
or more so, according to the study by Harbour, a consulting firm in
Troy, Mich., with which the seven leading automakers in North
America share confidential productivity data each year. Auto
factories in Japan are slightly more efficient than Japanese-owned
factories in the United States, because they are closer to some of
their suppliers, but the gap with these factories has narrowed as
well, Harbour said.
</P>
<P>
   The most productive factories are not distinguished by a higher
degree of automation than their competitors. Robots are now
commonplace for physically strenuous or dangerous tasks, but human
beings have proved themselves less expensive for many other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most automated assembly plant in North America,
Mitsubishi's mid-size car factory in Normal, Ill., also had some of
the lowest labor productivity last year because so many employees
were constantly required to keep the robots maintained and
repaired, Harbour said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What really seems to separate the productive factories from
inefficient ones is something more basic than automation, and yet
more complex. ``It's good management,'' Harbour said.
</P>
<P>
   What particularly efficient factories have in common, he said,
is that they seldom shut down their assembly lines in the middle of
a shift, so they rarely require unscheduled overtime to meet
production quotas. American-owned assembly lines suffered frequent
shutdowns until recently, because workers were absent or auto parts
reached the assembly line that were defective or did not fit
together easily. For many years, the assembly lines of
Japanese-owned factories have almost never stopped in the middle of
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Senior managers at Japanese automakers tend to say that high
productivity comes from a constant attention to detail, advice that
U.S. automakers are starting to follow. ``There is no silver
bullet,'' said Daryl Wilson, Toyota's vice president for
manufacturing in Canada. The Toyota Corolla factory in Cambridge,
Ontario, was North America's most efficient in 1998 before being
displaced by Ford's Atlanta factory last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Ford's factory in Atlanta, strong labor-management relations
have permitted more attention to detail. Absenteeism is currently
running 3 percent, just half the rate at many factories in Michigan
and Ohio. But the rate used to be 2 percent, and the increase
upsets Steve Trousdale, the chairman of the local unit of the
United Automobile Workers union, who is determined that the Atlanta
factory not be chosen for layoffs in the next recession.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Trousdale sent a strongly worded letter to every union
member. ``Attendance must improve,'' it said. ``If AWOLs go down,
job security goes up,'' the letter continued. ``You must be
responsible and come to work!'' the letter concluded, in bold face,
capital letters printed in extra-large type.
</P>
<P>
   The national leadership of the UAW discourages competition
between union locals for fear that automakers will play them off
against each other. But Trousdale, elected by the workers in
Atlanta, disregards such concerns. ``I've got to look at what is
good for the Atlanta work force,'' he said last month at the
factory. ``I don't really look at what somebody else thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Atlanta factory still has union work rules guaranteeing
that workers with the most seniority receive the easiest jobs, a
system that limits management's flexibility. Japanese automakers,
which are non-union, do not face such rules, and they organize
their employees into more flexible teams that take whatever tasks
most need doing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Todd Cooper, a 32-year-old worker on the assembly line and a
former electrician on construction sites, has the grueling task of
putting 35-pound dashboards into cars day after day, but said he
accepted the unchanging rhythms of the seniority system. ``I don't
have to work outside in the cold and the rain,'' he said last
month, eating a sandwich from his lunchbox while sitting,
exhausted, on a crate next to the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Windsor, Ontario, DaimlerChrysler is also paying close
attention to details. Sandra Bouckley, the company's manager of
advanced minivan manufacturing, is trying to change the way her
company prepares for the introduction of a new model.
</P>
<P>
   When Chrysler redid the minivan in 1995, it closed its minivan
factories in Windsor and St. Louis for nearly three months to
replace equipment, losing sales. This year, Bouckley has already
installed much of the new equipment during weekends and by
extending the assembly line so that there is room for old and new
machinery. The Windsor factory will only be closed for two weeks
between models as a result.
</P>
<P>
   That is a big improvement, but Japanese automakers sometimes
change models in a day, by making even more elaborate preparations.
Moreover, DaimlerChrysler will close its St. Louis minivan factory
for seven weeks this summer because the company is not yet able to
change over two factories quickly at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a philosophical, technological deviation from the way
we've always done business, and we decided we'd test it in
Windsor,'' Bouckley said.
</P>
<P>
   GM was the least efficient automaker in North America in
stamping car hoods, doors, roofs and other parts out of big sheets
of steel until Joseph Spielman became GM's vice president for metal
parts stamping in 1994. Now it is the most efficient of the Big
Three in stamping by some productivity measures but trails well
behind Honda and Toyota. Spielman has managed this partly by
standardizing equipment: he reduced the number of sizes of stamping
presses to 57 to just 6, for example.
</P>
<P>
   That made it easier to service the machines and exchange parts
among them, allowing GM to make do with only 200 stamping presses
instead of the 350 it had in 1993. Since each press is as big as a
Boeing 737-300 and carries the same price tag, $32 million, the
investment savings have been huge. But GM has not been able to
reduce employment to match because of its restrictive labor
contracts, Harbour said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to improve upon Spielman's self-description: ``6 foot
6-1/2 and 250 pounds of romp and stomp.'' But as far as the UAW and
its members were concerned, Spielman had a little too much romp and
stomp until recently. Upset by his demands for better productivity,
workers at a factory in Flint, Mich., launched a strike two years
ago that crippled the automaker's production for two months,
costing it $2 billion in after-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the strike, both sides have been committed
to greater cooperation, and Spielman became an outspoken advocate
of worker involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't me out there with a cattle prod or a whip, it's
people out there saying, ``This is ours, this is our plant,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-collar workers in factories are now in close touch with
white-collar engineers sitting at computers in office buildings.
Workers with questions about blueprints used to be told to mail
letters to the engineers, waiting two weeks or more for a reply.
Since January, workers have been sending e-mail to engineers, using
personal computers in the factories. Spielman requires the
engineers to respond within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   James DeLair, the local union vice president in Flint, said that
the changes have been noticeable. ``There seems to be a whole lot
more interest in what the worker has to say,'' DeLair said. ``The
working relationship, hourly to salaried, could still use
improvement, but upper management wants to make things better.''

BUSH'S TUTOR ON FOREIGN POLICY HAS REPUTATION FOR BRILLIANCE AND
DARING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Arrayed behind George W. Bush as he unveiled his
nuclear policy initiative last month were two former secretaries of
state, two former national security advisers and a former secretary
of defense.
</P>
<P>
   But once Bush and his formidable lineup of older men left the
stage, the foreign policy expert who fielded questions on the
specifics of the Texas governor's proposal was not Henry Kissinger
or Colin Powell. It was 45-year-old Condoleezza Rice, a black
college professor who is tutoring a presidential candidate who
concedes that he has much to learn about the world.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear policy speech provided the ideal platform for Rice,
the chief foreign policy adviser for Bush, to shine. Russia, its
nuclear arsenal, and America's defense posture are areas that she
has studied for years, both as a professor of political science at
Stanford University and as a Russia specialist on the National
Security Council in the first two years of the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now she plays what she calls ``quarterback'' for a disparate
foreign policy team, the ``Vulcans,'' whose mission is to prove
that Bush has enough global brainpower to be president. (The
advisers take their name from the ancient god of the forge, whose
statue is found in the steel town of Birmingham, Ala., Rice's
hometown.)
</P>
<P>
   Rice is closest by far to the candidate, whom she isleading in a
grand global tutorial as she tries to convince others that what he
lacks in international knowledge and experience he makes up for in
what she calls ``good instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   But a series of interviews indicate that Rice is much less
sure-footed when the terrain is unfamiliar. Her silky voice becomes
choppy, her crisp sentences vague.
</P>
<P>
   She takes a dim view of American military intervention,
particularly for humane reasons, but declines to specify the
circumstances in which the use of force would be justified. She
proposes ``perhaps skipping a generation'' of weapons technology to
build armed forces that are ``lighter and more lethal,'' but won't
say which hardware and weapons systems could be sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the summit meeting of the leaders of South and
North Korea, she labeled North Korea a ``rogue state'' but did not
lay out a scenario for dealing with it except to say that ``the
North Koreans should know that this is not all positive carrots,
that there's a potential stick out there.'' And she calls America's
one-China policy, a linchpin of American foreign policy that
regards Taiwan as part of mainland China, a ``holding device.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice herself admits that there are vast swaths of the world that
are new to her. ``I've been pressed to understand parts of the
world that have not been part of my scope,'' she said. ``I'm really
a Europeanist.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first book was a learned work on the Czechoslovak army;
another book she co-authored on the reunification of Germany in
1995 was extremely well-received.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is talked about in Washington circles as a shoo-in for
national security adviser if Bush makes it to the White House,
perhaps twinned with Powell as secretary of state. When Bush was
asked in a telephone interview about the possibility of having two
African-Americans leading his foreign policy team, he said, ``It's
way too premature.'' When Rice was asked the same question, she
replied, ``It's really not appropriate to talk about a cabinet
until he's won.'' As for Powell, his answer was more concise:
``Nice try.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, an only child raised in a segregated, bourgeois district
of Birmingham, Ala., and originally destined to be a concert
pianist, can dazzle on many a stage. At a recent Republican
fund-raising reception in Silicon Valley, she sang part of the Star
Spangled Banner (the obscure second verse). She played The Battle
Hymn of the Republic on a grand piano. She showed off snippets of
fluent Russian. And she delivered _ with no notes _ a 20-minute
speech praising the potential of Bush to lead the world.
</P>
<P>
   She knows how to be stridently self-confident. (``I have a
really good memory.'' ``I am a really fast writer.'' ``There was a
time in my life when I knew the general staff of the Soviet Union
better than it knew itself.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Condi's entire life has been a high wire act,'' said Coit
Blacker, a fellow professor at Stanford and a former Russia
specialist on the Clinton administration's National Security
Council and a close friend of Rice. ``She can stand up in front of
a crowd and wing it. I have been with her any number of times when
she's about to give a speech and she writes it on the back of an
envelope on the drive over. It springs from deep confidence but
also a tendency to engage in death-defying acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice has been performing since her parents pushed her onto the
stage for her first piano recital at the age of four. When she
realized she was not good enough for a concert career, she turned
to academic pursuits, becoming a professor and eventually provost
at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Now, besides a warm friendship, Rice and Bush seem to share a
similar view of the world. It is a balance-of-power, realist
Republican approach that is generally short on details and might be
summed up like this: strengthen America's military, scale back
military commitments abroad and focus on the big powers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton administration, Rice argued in an article in
Foreign Affairs, ``national interest'' was too often replaced by
``humanitarian interest'' or the interests of ``the international
community.'' Instead, she suggested, the United States should take
the attitude that what is in its own interest _ spreading democracy
and free trade, for example _ is good for the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has unabashedly shown his dependence on the daughter of
educators who started her political life as a Democrat, switched
sides in 1982, informally advised Democrat Gary Hart on foreign
policy in his 1988 bid for the presidency and has called herself
``an all-over-the-map Republican.'' Rice is a fit for Bush.
``There's a real chemistry between them,'' said Dov S. Zakheim, one
of the ``Vulcans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be around her,'' Bush said. ``She's fun to be with.
I like lighthearted people, not people who take themselves so
seriously that they are hard to be around.'' Besides, he said,
``She's really smart!''
</P>
<P>
   Bush feels comfortable asking her the most basic questions, like
the location of a country. ``I've heard Condi talk about layers of
knowledge, how there's a surface layer down to layer three, and
that she's gradually increasing the layers of knowledge'' said
Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush has identified Rice as the person who ``can explain to me
foreign policy matters in a way I can understand.'' When Hughes
recently showed him a news article about the strife in Sierra
Leone, Bush told her to ``call Condi and see what she thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice's role is all the more critical because Bush doesn't like
to read briefing books or papers on the nuts-and-bolts of national
security, and his lack of experience in foreign affairs has raised
questions about his preparedness for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   When a writer for Glamour Magazine recently uttered the word
``Taliban'' _ the regime in Afghanistan that follows an extreme and
repressive version of Islamic law _ during a verbal Rorschach test,
Bush could only shake his head in silence. It was only after the
writer gave him a hint (``repression of women in Afghanistan'')
that Bush replied, ``Oh. I thought you said some band. The Taliban
in Afghanistan! Absolutely. Repressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice might not have been able to provide much help here. Asked
in an interview to support her assertion in her recent article in
Foreign Affairs that Iran is trying to spread ``fundamentalist
Islam'' beyond its borders, she replied, ``Iran has been the state
hub for technology and money and lots of other goodies to radical
fundamentalist groups, some will say as far reaching as the
Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   When reminded that Iran was a bitter enemy of the Taliban and
that the two countries had almost gone to war against each other in
late 1998, she replied, ``They were sending stuff to the region
that fell into the hands of bad players in Afghanistan and
Pakistan.'' She did not identify ``the bad players.'' (In a
subsequent conversation, she said that of course she knew that Iran
and the Taliban were enemies).
</P>
<P>
   On Iraq, she believes that President Saddam Hussein is an evil
man, but declined to say what a George W. Bush administration would
do to get rid of him. Asked about a proposal once floated by Bush's
number two foreign policy adviser, Paul D. Wolfowitz, that the
United States should create a mini-state inside Iraq headed by an
opposition government until Saddam is overthrown, she replied,
``I'm not going there.''
</P>
<P>
   But she did have this message for the Iraqi leader: ``Saddam
Hussein should know that if there is a George W. Bush
administration, he is going to be taken very, very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her deliberate vagueness in areas with which she is
unfamiliar, she has a reputation for being a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   For the nuclear policy speech last month, which called for
building a strong national missile defense system combined with
reductions and possibly unilateral cuts in America's nuclear
arsenal, Rice said she played a central role. She began working on
what she called ``a sustainable position on nuclear policy'' at a
``Vulcans'' policy retreat a year ago and continued developing
ideas with the eight-member group, which includes former senior
Pentagon and State Department officials such as Wolfowitz, Robert
Zoellick, Richard L. Armitage and Richard Perle.
</P>
<P>
   She spent endless hours with Bush himself, going over the speech
line by line, explaining the implications of every issue. When he
didn't want to read the questions and answers about the speech
prepared for him, she and Wolfowitz drilled him verbally instead.
</P>
<P>
   She also sought out Kissinger, Powell, former Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft
and others, soliciting their views, sending them drafts of the
speech, coaxing them into attending the event.
</P>
<P>
   Rice and Bush got to know each other in 1995, when she traveled
to Austin at the invitation of former President George Bush. She
and the younger Bush bonded over baseball, as Bush, then a co-owner
of the Texas Rangers, showed off his display cases full of signed
baseballs. Rice, a self-described fanatical sports fan, told
stories about Willie Mays, whom her mother had once taught in high
school. ``Governor Bush was very impressed,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   They met again at the Bush family vacation compound in
Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1998. While she ran on the treadmill, he
rowed and pedaled. ``What about relations with Russia, what about
relations with China?'' Rice quoted Bush as asking. ``What about
the state of the military?''
</P>
<P>
   Rice is used to maneuvering among powerful men. She sits on the
boards of corporations such as the Charles Schwab Corp. and the
Chevron Corp., which has even named a Bahamanian-flagged
supertanker after her.
</P>
<P>
   Her mentor at the University of Denver was Josef Korbel, the
father of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who helped her
``fall in love'' with Russian history, she said. As a
freshly-minted Ph.D. in 1981, she joined the Stanford faculty. In
1993, she became the youngest, the first female and the first
non-white provost. Faced with a $43 million deficit, she cut
services and fired staff with only limited consultations with the
faculty. ``I don't do committees,'' she said. (She is on leave from
the faculty, although she has resigned her position as provost.)
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Rice is a fitness enthusiast. She does strength
training twice a week with Stanford's football coach and endurance
training with a second Stanford coach twice more. Single, she said
she does not do recreational reading (no novels) and does not have
fun by accident. ``I schedule fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A headline in the current issue of George Magazine, which
included eight photos of Rice in the gym, reads, ``Bush's
Kissinger. She Can Kick Your Butt, Too.'' Indeed, said Armitage, an
assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration, ``I
would bet that if you look behind her, the ground is littered with
the bodies of those who underestimated her.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rice is determined to see her star pupil make it to the
White House, she insists that she is not wedded to the idea of
serving in government again. She lasted only two years in the Bush
administration before she went back to Stanford. Scowcroft, her
former boss, said in an interview that she left to find a spouse
and have a family. Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman,
said, ``I offered to marry her every other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice winced when told what her two former colleagues said about
her, explaining that the reason for leaving was a bit different.
``I wanted a life,'' she said. ``These jobs are all-consuming. And
I have strong reservations about going back to that all-consuming
life.''

MORGAN STANLEY SELECTS INVESTMENT BANKER TO RUN BROKERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the brokerage business, the climb to the top ranks of
management almost always started from a stockbroker's desk in a
local branch. But, suddenly, the route to the top has been diverted
through business schools and investment bankers' offices on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. said Thursday that it had
chosen John Schaefer, a longtime investment banker to run its
brokerage operation, the second largest in the country. The
appointment came a few months after the biggest brokerage firm,
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., named another former investment banker,
Stanley O'Neal, to run its brokerage network.
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Neal, Schaefer is the first person to hold his new job
who never was a stockbroker. The similarities do not end there:
Both men are 48, and each has a master's degree in business
administration from Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about rewarding the most senior broker any more,''
said Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``We're
past that stage. It's about getting the most strategic thinker in
place. Things are changing so quickly in the brokerage business,
there's no room for error.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the changes is Internet technology, which
ushered in cheap, online stock trading and led investors to
question why they were paying commissions of $200 or more to place
trades through brokers. Morgan Stanley and Merrill both capitulated
last year and, over the objections of their armies of brokers,
introduced online trading with commissions as low as $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   The integration of new technology into Morgan Stanley's various
businesses has been Schaefer's primary focus as the firm's chief
strategic and administrative officer for the last two years. He
also is the co-chairman of a committee that oversees the firm's
investments in electronic securities exchanges and other areas of
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer, who was not available for comment, succeeds James F.
Higgins as president and chief operating officer of the firm's
private client group. Higgins, 52, is assuming the title of
chairman of the group, which was the Dean Witter brokerage firm
before Dean Witter merged with the Morgan Stanley investment
banking firm in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins, who has run the brokerage operation for 12 years, also
was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer inherits a group of more than 13,000 brokers who have
been wrestling with the merger of self-service investing with their
traditional service of personally advising clients on how to manage
their money. Last year, after operating its online-trading service
as a separate division under the brand name of its Discover credit
card, Morgan Stanley renamed it Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online
and rolled it in with the rest of the firm's brokerage operations.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley announced that shift with great fanfare, a step
ahead of Merrill Lynch's introduction of online trading, but Morgan
Stanley has guarded information about how well its online service
has been received.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Witter could have had a big head-start online against its
Wall Street competitors. It was the first to experiment with
trading over the Internet when it bought Lombard Brokerage, a small
San Francisco-based online brokerage firm, in 1996 for about $60
million. But Higgins and other Dean Witter executives feared the
reaction of its brokers to the new threat and did not embrace the
new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Roach, who founded Lombard and helped run Dean Witter's
online business until earlier this year, said Schaefer's experience
in dealing with new technology made him an ideal choice to succeed
Higgins. ``He really gets it,'' said Roach, the chief executive of
an Internet startup called eLance.com. ``He's a great leader. He's
absolutely direct. He's opinionated but he listens.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Witter's brokers historically have been less productive
than their competitors at Merrill Lynch and the Salomon Smith
Barney unit of Citigroup, analysts said. Some analysts believe that
lag results in part from Dean Witter's reluctance to open its sales
network to products, such as mutual funds, from other companies.
While other brokerage firms are struggling to get their brokers to
sell their own funds, as many as 70 percent of the funds sold by
Dean Witter brokers are their own funds.

 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Trent Jones, the golf architect who designed or remodeled
more than 500 courses, and who once made a hole in one to justify
his redesign of a hole, died on Wednesday night at his home in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had been in poor health since having a stroke last
summer, had retired to Florida. But for most of his career he
worked out of offices in Montclair, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In his seven decades as golf's most prolific architect, Jones
logged an estimated 8 million miles in creating more than 350
courses and remodeling more than 150 others, including 79 that were
used for the U.S. Open or other national championships. His courses
endure in 45 states and 35 foreign countries on every continent
except Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun never sets,'' he enjoyed saying, ``on a Robert Trent
Jones golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   His death came on the eve of the U.S. Open, which began Thursday
in Pebble Beach, Calif. He had become linked to that championship
because so many were played on courses he either designed or
remodeled.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Trent,'' he was a small, cherub-faced man, but his
sometimes sadistic use of huge bunkers, ponds, creeks and
undulating greens often angered the touring pros, especially during
the U.S. Open. Jones believed he was merely defending par against
the evolution of golf equipment and the golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shattering of par without a proper challenge is a fraud,''
he often said. ``I make them play par.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jones redesigned the fourth hole at the Baltusrol Golf
Club's Lower Course in Springfield, N.J., before the 1954 U.S.
Open, some members thought the par-3 over a pond was unfair. He
offered to play the hole along with Johnny Farrell, the club pro,
and two members while other members watched.
</P>
<P>
   Playing from the 165-yard members tee, Farrell and the two
members each hit their ball on the green. Jones stepped up and
swung his 4-iron. His ball landed on the green and rolled into the
cup for a hole in one. Turning to the assembled members, he said:
``Gentlemen, the hole is fair. Eminently fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Jones worked on 21 courses that would hold the
U. S. Open, notably Oakland Hills in Birmingham, Mich., in 1951.
None of the world's best golfers broke par-70 that year until the
final day when Ben Hogan, the winner, shot 67 and Clayton Haefner
shot 69.
</P>
<P>
   At the presentation ceremony, Hogan said, ``I'm glad I brought
this course, this monster, to its knees.'' At a reception later,
Hogan turned to Jones' wife, Ione, and said, ``If your husband had
to play this course for a living, he'd be on the bread line.''
Jones relished retelling both of Hogan's comments.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1970 U.S. Open at Hazeltine National, the touring pro
Dave Hill, who had shot 75 and 69, publicly criticized Jones'
design. Asked what the course lacked, Hill said, ``Eighty acres of
corn and a few cows.'' Asked what should be done to correct the
course, Hill said, ``Plow it up and start over.''
</P>
<P>
   High winds had created high scores. When the winds eased, Tony
Jacklin won that Open with 281, 7-under par. Hill was second at
288, even-par.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is a form of attack and counterattack,'' Jones often
said. ``It offers a golfer his personal challenge of combat. He
attacks the course and par, the architect creates fair pitfalls to
defend its easy conquest. The architect calls on his ingenuity to
create a hole that will reward only achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones collaborated with the late Bobby Jones, the legendary
golfer (no relation), in designing Peachtree in Atlanta. At Bobby
Jones' request, he also redesigned the 11th and 16th holes at
Augusta National, the site of the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his 21 U.S. Open courses, Jones worked on 12
courses that have held the PGA Championship and six that held the
World Cup. He designed Valderrama in Spain, the site of the 1997
Ryder Cup matches, and the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club course in
Manassas, Va., the site of the 1994 and 1996 President's Cup
matches.
</P>
<P>
   He created a putting green at the White House for President
Eisenhower, as well as a hole with three different tees at Camp
David, the president's weekend retreat in Maryland. Jones' clients
included the Rockefeller family, the Aga Khan and King Hassan II of
Morocco. But among his last designs were 18 public layouts in
Alabama, the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at a piece of ground,'' he said, ``and you know
instinctively what makes a great hole. There is a flow and rhythm
that you can feel. You think how to stake it out, then use logic to
make the right choice. It's like a jigsaw puzzle. But you have play
golf well, too. You have to know the value of shots, how far the
ball will go and what it will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is survived by his two sons, Robert Trent Jr. and Rees,
both prominent golf architects who have been involved in more than
250 courses. His wife died in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ince, England, on June 20, 1906, he was 6 when he
accompanied his parents to East Rochester, N.Y., where he later
caddied at The Country Club of Rochester. He soon developed into a
scratch golfer, and was the low amateur in the 1927 Canadian Open.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, Jones met and was inspired by Donald Ross, the
Scottish golf architect who was designing Oak Hill in Rochester. At
Cornell, Jones studied surveying, agronomy, landscaping,
horticulture, architecture and sketching.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first architect inducted into the World Golf Hall of
Fame. He was a founding member and a former president of the
American Society of Golf Course Architects and the first recipient
of its Donald Ross Award. He was the author of ``Golf's Magnificent
Challenge'' and edited ``Great Golf Stories,'' an anthology.
</P>
<P>
   Golf was always in his thoughts. After suffering a stroke once,
he awakened in his hospital bed to see his two sons at his bedside.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing here?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a little setback,'' he was told. ``You had a stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have to count it?'' he said. &QL;

GORE PROPOSES $500 BILLION TAX CUT OVER 10 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCKLAND, Ohio _ Expecting a shower of gold at the end of the
month when new budget surplus estimates are released, Vice
President Al Gore said Thursday that he would offer Americans $500
billion in tax cuts over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The amount is twice what Gore had proposed earlier and half of
what Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival, has
proposed. Gore has been extremely critical of Bush's proposal,
saying the nation cannot afford it and the vital programs and
entitlement benefits would have to be cut to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides said the chief difference between their proposals was
that Gore's tax cuts would be limited primarily to families with
children and aging parents. Bush's income tax cut of $1.3 trillion
over 10 years would apply to people across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is basing his proposal on the expectation that the federal
budget surplus will expand by perhaps $1 trillion. He had already
proposed the broad outlines of most of the tax cuts, but Thursday
he offered estimates of how much money he would devote to each.
</P>
<P>
   In a discussion at a food warehouse here, Gore said his plan
would cover long-term care, college tuition, day care, relief for
parents who stay at home with infants and relief from the so-called
marriage penalty, which has long been proposed by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the $500 billion would include tax-free
retirement accounts to supplement Social Security, the details of
which he said he would discuss next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tax relief package for middle-income families can help to
solve the most important challenges that families face today,''
Gore said. ``This package, big as it is, stands in sharp contrast
to an alternative that would completely eliminate the budget
surplus and threaten the underlying prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion here in a Cincinnati suburb came on the third day
Gore's ``progress and prosperity tour,'' which is designed to take
the vice president to battleground states and give him a chance to
highlight the booming economy and get some credit for it.
</P>
<P>
   The tour is premised on the Gore campaign's belief that the
economy is the vice president's trump card in the election. He says
the unprecedented growth in the economy has given the nation the
luxury of talking about ``big ideas,'' though on his tour he has
mostly offered new ways of spending the burgeoning surplus rather
than wrestled with philosophical choices.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But he is also proposing ways to make money. At two fund-raisers
in New York on Wednesday night, he gave a mini preview of a speech
on the environment that he plans to make the week after next, when
he will argue, as President Clinton has, that protecting the
environment does not have to mean sacrificing the economy, and that
in fact money can be made off cleaning up the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the third week of this series of speeches, I'm going to be
talking about how we can create millions of good new jobs by
investing in the new technologies that are far more efficient that
will position us to be more competitive, that will put us in first
place in the 21st century in making and selling the kind of
products that people all over the world in crowded, polluted cities
are trying to buy,'' he said to financial donors.
</P>
<P>
   Showing some eagerness on the subject, he brought it up later
and more explicitly to another group of financial donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there has been a kind of massive denial about
it,'' Gore said, ``the opportunities for business and for creating
new jobs and transforming our technological base to create the new
products that the rest of the world is clamoring to buy _ more
efficient engines, better industrial processes, new cars and trucks
_ we ought to be making them and selling them to the rest of the
world, where their desires for a higher standard of living are
climbing rapidly but they're choking on their pollution and the
rest of the world has far worse pollution than anywhere in the
United States outside of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax credits that he outlined Thursday would: make up to
$10,000 in college tuition costs tax deductible; give care-givers a
$3,000 tax credit to help care for elderly parents; provide a tax
credit for after-school programs; make the existing child-care tax
credit refundable.

`SURVIVOR' BREAKS ANOTHER RATINGS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS's enormous summer hit, ``Survivor,'' soared to new ratings
heights Wednesday night, pulling in more viewers than CBS has had
on any Wednesday night since the Nielsen Media Research company
transformed its ratings system in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks of growing ratings persuaded CBS to announce
formally Thursday that it would broadcast ``Survivor II: The
Australian Outback'' in the middle of the coming television season,
starting in January or February.
</P>
<P>
   Given the impact that ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
had on the past television season, when it expanded from a summer
show to a regular-season show, ``Survivor,'' a reality-adventure
series, has the potential to reverse CBS's ratings fortunes,
possibly making the network a contender for overall television
leadership next season.
</P>
<P>
   CBS began asking for participants for the next edition of
``Survivor'' following its broadcast Wednesday night. It also
announced that it would move up the starting date of its follow-up
reality show, ``Big Brother,'' one day, to Wednesday, July 5, at 9
p.m., to take advantage of the big audience flowing out of
``Survivor,'' which will be shown from 8 to 9.
</P>
<P>
   This week, without the impediment of ``Millionaire,'' which ABC
had placed opposite ``Survivor'' during the first two weeks of its
run, ``Survivor'' added about 5 million viewers, for a total of
just over 23 million.
</P>
<P>
   That was about seven million more viewers than NBC attracted
with Game 4 of the National Basketball Association finals Wednesday
night. It was also more viewers than ABC had for any episode of
``Millionaire'' last August, when that show quickly established
itself as a television phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Survivor'' eclipsed viewing levels for one of
CBS's biggest sports events, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association basketball championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, ``Survivor'' proved to be an especially powerful
draw with young viewers, bringing in more viewers between the ages
of 18 and 34 than any series show that played on CBS all last
season.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, a young participant was voted off the island
where the show is being staged. Stacey Stillman, a 27-year-old
lawyer from San Francisco, was eliminated in a vote by her
teammates. In the first two shows, two participants in their '60s
were voted out.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives predicted Thursday that the show would do even
better as the weeks go on and the countdown to a final survivor
continues. The show is to run through August, with the final
episode coming down to two survivors, one of whom will win $1
million. A winner will be selected by the seven previously rejected
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous losing contestants, Stillman made numerous
television appearances Thursday, on CBS's ``Early Show'' and on
CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. She also appeared on ``Late Night With
David Letterman'' on CBS Thursday night. &QL;

ASLEEP AT THE BOOKS: A FRAUD THAT WENT ON AND ON AND ON 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Were the books ever honest at CUC International?
</P>
<P>
   The biggest accounting fraud ever _ one that cost investors $19
billion and involved more than $500 million in phony profits over
just three years, now turns out to have gone on almost forever.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmo Corigliano was a 23-year-old accountant for Ernst &AMP;
Whinney when he joined CUC in 1983, the same year it went public.
``The activities had started about then,'' Corigliano told Judge
William H. Walls this week, as he pleaded guilty to fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Faking the numbers, he said, ``was my job, and my superiors were
encouraging me.''
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano, who rose to become CUC's chief financial officer, is
likely to end up in prison. He and a number of his subordinates are
cooperating with prosecutors, who are clearly gunning for his
bosses at CUC.
</P>
<P>
   But for investors, the most interesting question is not whether
Walter A. Forbes, CUC's founder, will go to jail. It is how this
fraud managed to go on so long. The Securities and Exchange
Commission is sure it started by the late 1980s and thinks it may
have begun in 1985 or before. It ended in 1998, after CUC merged
with HFS to form the Cendant Corp., and a CUC accountant spilled
the beans.
</P>
<P>
   For all those years, the books were audited by Ernst &AMP; Young or
its predecessor, Ernst &AMP; Whinney. In hindsight, they missed more
than a few red flags. A report by Arthur Andersen, another
accounting firm hired after the fraud was exposed, described
meetings in which Ernst &AMP; Young officials asked questions and got
odd answers. In one case, there was no explanation or documentation
for $25 million in profits. The auditors decided that was not a
material amount, and let it go. The Andersen report did not
criticize Ernst &AMP; Young, but that was no surprise. Ernst &AMP; Young
had refused to supply information or allow its people to be
interviewed until Andersen promised not to comment on the quality
of the Ernst &AMP; Young audits.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC says that the fraud was easier to pull off because CUC
officials knew which subsidiaries would be audited, and therefore
hid the most obvious frauds in subsidiaries that they knew the
auditors would not look at.
</P>
<P>
   As the fraud grew, CUC's old tactics of inflating revenues and
suppressing expenses were no longer adequate. So it took to
manipulating merger reserves, which are supposed to cover one-time
costs related to takeovers and are often ignored by investors. The
reserves became a cookie jar in which operating losses could be
fraudulently concealed. Unfortunately for CUC, some of its
acquisitions were such dogs that the merger reserves were soon
exhausted, making it necessary to make more acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Did the auditors know what was going on? They deny it, and there
is no proof they did. But they didn't show much suspicion when
confronted with some odd-looking transfers of funds between various
accounts. Abraham Briloff, an emeritus professor of accounting at
Baruch College, studied the Andersen report and concluded that
``the auditors were fooled because, in some measure at least, they
wanted to be fooled.'' Had they blown the whistle, people would
have asked why they had not done so years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   That is not, needless to say, the way they see it at Ernst &AMP;
Young. ``That suggestion is offensive,'' said Kathryn Oberly, the
firm's general counsel. ``The CUC people were so determined to fool
the auditors that they could fool any audit firm or any team of
auditors.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors may not find that especially reassuring.

COMMENTARY: WHO LOVES YOU, BASHAR BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to understand Syrian politics today, after Hafez
Assad's death, go to the video store and check out three movies:
``Pinocchio,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``Godfather II.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio'' is useful because if you believe that Bashar Assad
has, by himself, orchestrated his own smooth succession to his
father, well, then I have some lakeshore property in the Syrian
desert I'd like to sell you. Bashar is Pinocchio; the real question
is who is Gepetto? Who is pulling the strings behind the scene? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, Bashar's only title was head of the Syrian
Computer Society. Within hours after his father's death he was
named the armed forces commander, and the Syrian parliament passed
a law lowering the minimum age of the Syrian president from 40 to
34. Bashar is 34. You have to love that. They didn't bother with 30
or 25, they went right to B-34. Bingo. Who whispered to the
parliament to do that? Bashar alone? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to assume that Bashar is simply a puppet. He
appears more serious than that. But it would be unwise to assume he
is ruling alone. His father met a lot of opposition when he tried
to elevate Bashar earlier. So Bashar needs friends. For the moment
a coalition of Alawite tribal elders, key army officers and his
sister's powerful husband, Gen. Asef Shoukat, seem to have come
together to back him. This means that the real question is not
simply what sort of Syria does Bashar want, but what sort of Syria
do his Gepettos want.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a coalition of the family, the elders and
the chieftains who have decided that Bashar offers the best vehicle
for survival, because with Bashar they can present a united front
against the great challenges ahead,'' said Rob Satloff, head of the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ``He offers the image of
a liberalizer, perhaps enough to keep Syria's Sunni majority from
exploding after the passing of the reviled Hafez, but not one who
will go too far. He offers the image of an economic reformer, who
can entice foreign investment and economic aid, but not one who
will crack down on corruption too harshly. And with Bashar they
have someone who, unlike his father, might actually smile at
Israelis, without giving away anything in substance.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to our next film, ``The Wizard of Oz.'' You know the
scene _ the one where Dorothy's house lands on the Wicked Witch and
all the munchkins come out to sing ``Ding, dong, the witch is
dead.'' That is exactly how many Syrians feel today about the end
of Assad's cruel tyranny. Syria's Sunni elite, and the rising new
generation, are hungry to join today's global conversation.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to understand Syria today, study Iran. The Iranian
mullahs kept the lid on almost as tight as Hafez did, but when they
finally had an election 75 percent of Iranians voted for the leader
who wanted to loosen the lid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The single most underestimated force in international affairs
today is what happens _ thanks to globalization _ when we all
increasingly know how everyone else lives. People everywhere start
to demand the same things, and when they can't get them, they get
frustrated. No wonder the Syrian lawmaker Youssef Jedani was quoted
in The New York Times as saying of Bashar: ``There are very high
expectations, because he's young and open and wants to give more
liberty and democracy.'' But Jedani added: ``I think he'll follow
the same rhythm as his father. You can't go fast here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah? There is a lot of repressed energy in Syria, and the
young will not put up with indefinitely from Bashar what they put
up with for so many years from his father. Managing that pent-up
energy may be Bashar's biggest challenge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Provided Bashar survives _ which brings us to ``Godfather II.''
No sooner was Hafez dead than his brother Rifaat, who in 1982 saved
the family's rule by crushing the Muslim fundamentalist uprising in
Hama, claimed Syria's leadership. Rifaat is in exile, but he
controls an Arabic satellite TV station, which he uses to beam
messages into Damascus. Could Bashar ever do to Rifaat what Michael
Corleone did to his brother Fredo when he proved disloyal in
``Godfather II'' _ have one of his thugs take Fredo fishing and
then shoot him in the head? If I were Rifaat, I wouldn't go fishing
with any strangers.

PUTIN CALLS ARREST OF MEDIA COMPANY OWNER `EXCESSIVE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that
prosecutors had gone ``too far'' in jailing the owner of Russia's
largest independent media company two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that this is excessive,'' Putin said
during his state visit to Berlin. ``I think it should have been
possible to handle this without an arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's remarks were the first time that he has criticized the
detention of Vladimir Gusinsky, the owner of Russia's largest media
company, Media-MOST, an influential amalgam of newspaper, radio and
television interests that had been critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has repeatedly insisted that he cannot influence the
actions of Russia's prosecutor general, Vladimir Ustinov. And
Thursday Putin stopped short of saying the case against Gusinsky
was without merit.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments raised questions not only about the arrest, but
about Putin's control over his Kremlin aides, many of whom he
inherited from President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin was not aware of Gusinsky's arrest, as he has said
before, and did not approve of it, as he said Thursday, the
question was who ordered it, and why. Some in the Russian capital,
including Gusinsky's aides, traced the actions against Media-MOST
to Alexander Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff, who is close to
the inner circle of the former Kremlin regime, known in Moscow as
the ``family.''
</P>
<P>
   And if senior Kremlin officials had acted behind his back, the
question was whether Putin would try to take action against them,
and thus test his political independence. The Russian president is
expected to return to Moscow on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility was that Putin was simply trying to distance
himself from a decision that had sparked intense criticism at home
and abroad. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott appeared
in an unusual taped interview on Gusinsky's NTV television network
Thursday and warned that government interference with the press
will hurt Russia's standing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday Robert Strauss, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia,
canceled plans to lead several top U.S. business executives to
Moscow for a meeting with Putin. The trip was to have been
conducted under the auspices of the U.S.-Russia Business Council, a
Washington trade association. Strauss, who said he knew Gusinsky
when serving in Moscow, said it would be inappropriate to promote
commercial investment there now because the jailing of the top
media executive well known for criticizing Putin ``raised political
and legal questions'' about Russia under its new president.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of embezzling
millions of dollars in state property. He has denied the charges,
and his detention is widely seen in Russia as a
politically-motivated campaign against a powerful media tycoon who
had criticized the government and made enemies in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year old Gusinsky owns the nation's only independent
television network, one that avoided the Kremlin's embrace during
the recent parliamentary and president elections, and has provided
reasonably objective coverage of the brutal war in Chechnya. He
also controls several important publications.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was put in jail, Russia's most powerful business
tycoons have assailed the move, fearing it could be the start of a
crackdown that could lead to their detention as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky remains in the Butyrskaya prison. The chief prosecutor
in the case, Valery Nikolayev, said that charges would be brought
against Gusinsky on Friday, and suggested that Gusinsky might be
released afterwards pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   As the furor over the arrest continued, Geni Reznik, Gusinsky's
lawyer stood outside the prison and read a two-page handwritten
statement that he said came from his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political intrigue organized by high-ranking
representatives of the government who consider freedom of speech a
danger,'' the statement said. ``During the first interrogation, I
witnessed a laughable scene as two investigators quarreled and
interrupted one another for half an hour as they tried to say what
they suspect me of.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Thursday, Putin said Gusinsky should not have
been jailed, but merely questioned. Rather than put him in jail,
``It would have been possible to insist that he not leave the
country,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ustinov, the prosecutor general, is believed to have been
appointed by Putin at the insistence of Kremlin aides who are close
to members of the Yeltsin family and the financier Boris
Berezovsky, including Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff.
Virtually nobody in Russia believes that the prosecutor is truly
independent of powerful political and financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   One view of Putin's role is that he is not yet fully in control
of the Kremlin, but is dependent on aides like Voloshin, who helped
bring him to power. That runs counter to the image that Putin has
sought to foster of a decisive leader who is determined to bring
order to Russia. The other view is that Putin was disingenuous when
he insisted he was not behind the campaign against Gusinsky.

COMMENTARY: OTHER PEOPLE'S ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to feel unloved in the middle of a big election year.
Al Gore wants your vote so badly he'll come to your house and spend
the afternoon telling you about the Industrial Revolution _ if
you'll only ask. George W. Bush has probably already memorized your
kids' ages, and given you a nickname.
</P>
<P>
   This is all presuming, of course, that you live in Pennsylvania
or Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Have you noticed, people, that some voters are way more equal
than others? The presidential candidates are running ads already,
trying to win the hearts of Americans in some state other than
yours. Campaign committees in Washington are planning to pour
millions of dollars into a handful of congressional races in
districts where you don't live. The speaker of the House has
already told Republican incumbents to raise money for those
candidates or risk being transferred to the Subcommittee on Toxic
Waste next fall. Your representative, who was supposed to be
devoting his or her time to licking your local-voter boots, has
been re-assigned to collect cash for the wooing of people in San
Pedro, Calif., or northeast Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   First they gerrymander us into one-party fiefs. Then they tell
us they only care about the swing districts. Then they complain
about voter apathy.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of congressional districts in which the
election has already been called due to lack of interest. Louisiana
may not have a single contested race in its seven-member
delegation. ``I don't know if people mind or not,'' said Trey
Ourso, the executive director of the Louisiana Democratic State
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Given my neighborhood's electoral history, I've resigned myself
to having Jerrold Nadler as my congressman until one of us dies.
(In Nadler's case even that might not work, since the district has
been known to keep voting for the incumbent after he has moved on
to that great Public Works hearing in the sky.) Still, the local
Republicans try. They almost always put a name on the ballot, even
if it's just a tourist who happened to wander by the party
headquarters while looking for Grant's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Local politicians don't actually care much about who gets
elected to Congress, a place that provides very little patronage
compared with something really important, like, say, the state
Senate. Still, the rest of us tend to see Congress as a big deal,
and we like to be able to pretend we have some say over who goes
there. Michael Moore, star of ``The Awful Truth'' on the Bravo
Network, has begun to protest uncontested elections by running
ficus plants against shoo-in candidates. ``If no human beings will
run, we're going for another species,'' he said, after his ficus
was booted out of the New Jersey primaries by the Board of
Elections.
</P>
<P>
   If there was ever a community in need of a maverick potted plant
it's Chelsea, Mass., a seaside municipality that is represented by
a congressman, state senator and state representatives all of whom
are entirely unopposed for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional fund-raiser, Massachusetts has already
been deposited by both parties in Al Gore's column, and crossed off
their list of concerns. Even if the polls start to show that Gore's
hold on the state is looking shaky, the vice president will not
come by to shore up his support, because he will be too busy
remaining under the bed in a fetal position.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Massachusetts Democratic Party is trying to knock
the Republican Senate candidate off the ballot so Ted Kennedy will
be just one Libertarian shy of automatic re-election. The party
executive director, Mark White, said his staff performs this kind
of service on its own whenever the opposition looks like an easy
target for a legal challenge. So far, nobody has ever called to say
he'd rather take his chances with the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the candidates, there are other things they can be doing
with their time than campaigning,'' White added.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: MICROSOFT TRIES A FIRESIDE CHAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The latest installment in Microsoft's campaign to win
the hearts of American consumers is a television commercial titled
``Vision.'' It is the third in a series of commercials in which
Microsoft's leaders describe the company's values and its
importance to the economy. The first began shortly after a federal
judge ruled in April that Microsoft had repeatedly violated the
nation's antitrust laws. The current installment began running
Sunday, four days after the judge ordered that Microsoft be split
in two. Microsoft is appealing both the legal ruling and the
breakup order. The producer of the ad is McCann-Erickson/A&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, is seated,
wearing a thick blue sweater. His hands are folded with one elbow
resting on a table. The setting, at the company studio, is wood
tones and personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Beside Gates on the table are a coffee cup, paper and pen,
carefully placed to look casual. It is as if Gates had just paused
from contemplation for a few words with the camera. As he speaks,
the camera moves closer to him and slightly to his left. His words
are accompanied by the soft strains of an acoustic guitar.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: The commercial consists entirely of Gates speaking
about his company:
</P>
<P>
   ``The next generation of software is being developed right here.
It will understand your voice, anticipate your needs, protect your
privacy and connect you to the Internet wherever you are. It will
help your children learn, and give businesses new tools to succeed
in the coming digital world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been writing great software for the past 25 years. It's
what we're all about. It's our passion, and it always will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: Some competitors will cringe at the declaration that
Microsoft products, especially its Windows operating system, are
``great software.'' And whether computers will soon do all that
Gates says is open to question. But how can you argue with vision
and optimism? It has certainly worked for Gates so far.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: The commercial is the equivalent of a ``fireside
chat'' with Gates. He presents the benevolent face of Microsoft _ a
hard-working paragon of American capitalism, laboring daily to make
better software to improve people's lives. It is a visual antidote
to the portrayal of Microsoft in the antitrust trial as a bullying,
arrogant monopolist. No arrogance in this commercial, which even
helpfully identifies Gates, in white letters, as the chairman and
co-founder of Microsoft, in case any Martians are tuning in.

ANTIQUES: COSTLY MOVE IN PARIS, BUT TYPICAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Russia)  (EDS: medaillons in penultimate graf is cq.) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quirky. Eccentric. Self-assured. Amusing. All over the place.
Modern. Spontaneous. Competitive. Expensive. Charming. Arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the adjectives people use to describe
Jean-Marie Rossi, considered the doyen of Paris antiques dealers.
Rossi is a big man (6-foot-5) with a large personality. After 44
years in business, he recently moved his gallery, Aveline, to the
Place Beauvau on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, across the street
from the Elysee Palace, the home of the presidents of France.
</P>
<P>
   At great expense, he hired a renowned Paris decorator,
Francois-Joseph Graf, to transform two floors of a private house
built in 1771 into a large, spacious, light-filled gallery. He then
installed the antiques himself, creating vignettes with clever
combinations of furniture, paintings, porcelains and objets d'art.
</P>
<P>
   Moving was an expensive gamble for someone at this stage of his
career, but he dismissed such talk. ``I paid for it with one Roy
Lichtenstein painting,'' he said. ``I bought `The Ring' in 1963 for
6,000 francs and sold it for 12 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossi may or may not be the oldest of the great Paris dealers;
nor is his taste the most classical. While he is known, as his
first wife and current gallery director, Barbara Hottinguer, put
it, as an ``extreme connoisseur'' in 18th-century furniture from
France, Italy, Germany and Russia, he sells things from many
periods, specifically from the time of Louis XIII through the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what's unpredictable _ with life, women, interiors and
objects of art,'' said the dealer, who is married to his fourth
wife, Marie. ``I like Frank Lloyd Wright and Brancusi. I like
whatever is modern for its period. I don't care what century it is
as long as it's original.''
</P>
<P>
   His client list includes Rothschilds, Helene David-Weil, Henry
Kravis, the Getty, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Louvre, the
Musee d'Orsay and the Toledo Museum of Art. The big-name designers
who shop at his gallery include David Mlinaric of London; Alberto
Pinto, Jacques Garcia and Jacques Grange of Paris and David Easton,
Duane Hampton, Juan-Pablo Molyneux and Peter Marino of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also have 40-year-olds buying in the gallery,'' he said.
``Both European and American.'' Rossi insists that his staff treat
everyone with courtesy, so Americans in jeans feel welcome. He does
not want the gallery to be intimidating, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rossi is not like other dealers,'' said Tony Victoria, a New
York dealer specializing in French antiques. ``He's respected
because he puts together modern and antique. He's a flamboyant
figure in a staid world. He has flair. He is always putting wild
modern stuff like Lucite with 18th-century antiques.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria, who recently opened a second, more modestly priced
French antiques shop on Main Street in Bridgehampton, N.Y., added:
``Rossi is no old-fashioned, true-blue,
18th-century-French-furniture dealer, like Jean-Paul Fabre, who is
the touchstone of authenticity in Paris. Rossi has a wide
intellect, but he's equally known for a sense of humor _ and tongue
to match _ which is unknown in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria said his father used to buy from Rossi's partner,
Maurice Aveline. ``When Jean-Marie took over, it got too
stratospherically expensive,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi does have a reputation for very high prices. He would not
disclose them but said he was willing to spend a lot _ perhaps more
than anyone else _ for top merchandise. ``Everyone has taste, but
good taste costs a fortune today,'' he said. ``It's like wine. If
you order the most expensive wine in a restaurant, you normally get
the best. In the 1940s and 1950s you could build great collections
without a lot of money. Now, unfortunately, you need money. In a
way, it's easier when it's expensive. You have less competition.''
</P>
<P>
   His prices are defended by Leon Dalva, a French furniture dealer
in New York. ``There's a small group of us trying to uphold the
standard,'' he said. ``We have competed with Rossi at auction, and
sometimes we dealers fall in love with a thing and feel we have to
have it at any price. People think we always buy cheap and sell
dear. It's not true. French furniture from the 18th century is the
most beautiful furniture anyone has ever made. It's expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalva said he admired Rossi because he also bought ``outlandish,
amazing things from the 19th century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rossi was the first to buy things of that period,'' he said.
``They were not copies of anything, but real 19th-century
originals.''
</P>
<P>
   Didier Aaron, a Paris dealer who has known Rossi for over 40
years, said: ``Like me, he buys whatever he likes. It's not work
for us; it's a passion. It is not a question of price. If you have
good taste, you can buy things from any century or style.''
</P>
<P>
   Khalil Rizk, director of the Chinese Porcelain Co. in New York,
said that Rossi ``is all over the place, but with his eye even
normal pieces seem to take on an aura.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossi also works hard. He is training his 26-year-old daughter,
Marella, in the gallery. After receiving a degree in art history at
the Sorbonne, studying at the Louvre and at Versailles and taking
the Christie's art education course, Rossi began to work at Aveline
a year ago. She has created its Web site (www.Aveline.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Father goes to Drouot every day,'' she said, referring to the
French auction house. ``Last Sunday, he flew to London for a
Sotheby's furniture sale preview. Three months ago, he bought 10
percent of the Karl Lagerfeld sale in Monaco.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossi, the son of a French mother and an Italian immigrant who
ran a ball-bearings factory, studied law and was certified as a
government notary. It was a gentlemen's profession, but he loved
the world of art and antiques more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 25, I asked Maurice Aveline if I could help him,''
he said. ``He was a well-known dealer. I did administration and
learned how to restore pieces. Eventually I took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Today his inventory is unpredictable. Most classic, perhaps, is
a Louis XVI architect's table stamped by G. Jacob, one of the best
names in 18th-century French furniture. The deceptively plain
mahogany table has a top that tilts up to form a writing surface.
The top is supported by several slim columns designed to hold
oversized portfolios. Some columns have garlands of olive leaves
carved on them. The table looks modern enough for a SoHo loft.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are a pair of German commodes from
about 1770, highly ornamented, from a chateau in the Duchy of
Limbourg. The demilune commodes are creamy white and decorated with
gilded Corinthian capitals, medaillons, portraits and trellis work.
They are as dazzling as anything from Pavlosk Palace outside St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a very tall, revolving Japanese bookcase made for
the World's Fair in 1867. The columns are faux bamboo wood
decorated with bronze Japanese dragons. ``It would have been the
most modern thing at the fair,'' Rossi said.

SECURITY COUNCIL ASKS CONGO'S NEIGHBORS TO ASSIST IN ENDING
CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council Thursday urged visiting
ministers from a half-dozen African nations embroiled in the war in
Congo to join in seeking a way out of the desperate conflict that
continues to devastate Africa's largest country.
</P>
<P>
   The message repeated as two days of talks got under way here was
that the United Nations could accomplish nothing to stem such
carnage and alleviate Congo's suffering without active help from
its African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   France, which holds the council's rotating presidency this
month, circulated a new draft resolution that expressed ``deep
concern'' over the continuing hostilities in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The draft resolution demanded ``the orderly withdrawal of all
foreign forces'' from Congo, with a four-month deadline for Rwanda
and Uganda to pull out their troops, which battered the city of
Kisangani earlier this month in fighting one another. Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe have supported Lauren Kabila's government in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution welcomed the participation in Thursday's meeting
of a political committee formed under the ceasefire agreement
reached last July in the Zambian capital, Lusaka. Senior officials
at Thursday's session came from Congo, Angola, Rwanda, Uganda,
Zambia and Zimbabwe, as well as two Congolese rebel movements and
the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of achieving any consensus was underscored when
Rwanda's foreign minister, Ande Bumaya, said that Rwandan troops
could not leave without security guarantees that Hutu rebels would
stop using Zaire as a base for attacking his country.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council previously authorized the dispatch of 5,537
peacekeepers to Congo, but there has been a mounting reluctance to
commit them to monitoring a ceasefire that has yet to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general's special representative to Congo, Kamal
Moranje, told the council Thursday that the troops earmarked for
peacekeeping in the country were not nearly enough, and said an
extra battalion was needed just to prevent new fighting over
Kisanagani. He also proposed extending the date now set for a
peacekeeping contingent to begin deploying in Congo early next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The chief U.S. representative, Richard Holbrooke, who visited
the region five weeks ago with other council representatives, said
there was ``no excuse for what happened in Kisangani,'' where the
latest fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan troops killed at least
160 Congolese civilians and injured another 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting, Holbrooke said, made it more difficult to recruit
peacekeeping forces to go to Congo because the duty had become more
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected writing off Congo as a failed nation. ``States
don't fail,'' Holbrooke said. ``Leaders do.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Security Council last week, Secretary General
Kofi Annan asked council members to make it clear to the warring
parties in Congo ``that their assurances of support for the peace
process and guarantees of security and freedom of movement can no
longer be taken at face value, but must be reflected in their
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan pointed out that one-third of Congo's population, or 16
million people, critically needed food, more than 1.5 million were
displaced and 5 million were completely or partially isolated from
their traditional supply routes. He also referred to a cholera
outbreak and mounting HIV infection rates.

NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA WANT TO MARCH TOGETHER AT SYDNEY GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moving in `s' category) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   North and South Korea on Thursday pushed for cooperation on the
athletic level, as well as the political. Both sides are speaking
encouragingly about the possibility of marching together at the
opening ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney,
Australia, on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for North and South Korea to march under the
Olympic flag, as well as the flags of the two nations, Olympic
officials said. The countries would field separate teams for
competition in Sydney, but they are being encouraged to send a
joint team to the 2001 world table tennis championships in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Un-yong, a member of the International Olympic Committee and
the Parliament from South Korea, proposed the joint march last
month to Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the IOC.

NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA WANT TO MARCH TOGETHER AT SYDNEY GAMES

<P>
   North and South Korea on Thursday pushed for cooperation on the
athletic level, as well as the political. Both sides are speaking
encouragingly about the possibility of marching together at the
opening ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney,
Australia, on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for North and South Korea to march under the
Olympic flag, as well as the flags of the two nations, Olympic
officials said. The countries would field separate teams for
competition in Sydney, but they are being encouraged to send a
joint team to the 2001 world table tennis championships in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Un-yong, a member of the International Olympic Committee and
the Parliament from South Korea, proposed the joint march last
month to Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the IOC.

THE MODEL FROM VW HAS TIRES OF CLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE KREBS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As it asking too much to expect that someone would spend $70,000
to $100,000 for a lump of brown clay with four wheels?
</P>
<P>
   A life-size, two-ton clay model of the Volkswagen New Beetle
(the real thing sells for $16,000 or so) went on the auction block
at Christie's last week.
</P>
<P>
   And it stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few people bid on the clay model, which was part of
Christie's 20th century decorative arts sale, and those bids failed
to reach critical mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a few bids, and they got close to our minimum bid
requirement,'' Margaret Doyle, a Christie's spokeswoman, said.
``But it didn't sell. We are disappointed. A lot of people looked
at it when it was on display in our gallery. It stood out, that's
for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle would not divulge the minimum bid requirement; the sale
catalog listed it at about $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   No full-size clay auto models are known to have been auctioned,
Christie's said. More typically, the clay is reused or destroyed
during the process of measuring for molds used in production.
</P>
<P>
   The clay model will return to the Volkswagen Design Center in
Wolfsburg, Germany, where it was produced in 1995.

HBO _ A `VITAMIN' FOR BOXING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Seth Abraham was running the NBA, there's no
doubt - you'd be watching a Lakers-New York Knicks final series
right now. There'd even be a good chance of a Lakers matchup
against the unretired Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson ... don't worry, that would be all worked out
somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Abraham is only the CEO and president of Time
Warner Sports. He just has the last word in what HBO and its
pay-per-view arm TVKO presents in the boxing world.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Oscar De La Hoya and Sugar Shane Mosley will be
hooping it up Saturday night at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing in sports are the elite matchups,'' Abraham
said from his New York office this week before jetting out to L.A.
for the aforementioned superbout. ``Better that the Lakers are in
the NBA Finals than Portland because from a marquee matchup, the
general public wants to see Shaq, not Sabonis. And the public wants
De La Hoya-Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in these elite matchups, and I'll continue to
believe in putting out lots of money so we can use our influence to
make these happen. That's what helps erase some of the problems
that the sport of boxing will always have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sport will always have a common cold with trials and
suspect mandatory title defenses ... there's so much wrong. But HBO
can be the vitamin of boxing, putting on these big fights to better
the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   In some corners, Abraham and HBO have become more than a remedy
but are viewed as part of the illness.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who has already fought 15 times on HBO cards, is
under contract to the premium pay channel through 2001. Last week,
the network signed Felix Trinidad, who defeated De La Hoya for his
title this year, to a long-term deal that'll begin with a bout July
22.
</P>
<P>
   HBO also has locked up contracts with Lennox Lewis, the
undisputed heavyweight champ in most people's eyes. It has the
flamboyant Prince Nasheem Hammed. It has Mosley. It has Fernando
Vargas. And although Roy Jones Jr. has only one more fight left on
his HBO contract, it'll probably retain him.
</P>
<P>
   That makes quite a murderer's row of fighters committed to a
network that makes it clear that it's not a promoter or manager in
the seedy boxing game.
</P>
<P>
   But fights have been part of HBO's makeup since the network
launched in late 1972. Three months into it, HBO was putting on its
first fight - George Foreman vs. Joe Frazier from Jamaica. In '75,
it showed the Muhammad Ali-Frazier ``Thrilla in Manila'' - the
first HBO presentation transmitted by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, more than 100 world championship fights had taken place
on the network, involving everyone from Mike Tyson (who signed with
HBO long before he was a champion), Evander Holyfield, Sugar Ray
Leonard and Marvin Hagler (another HBO original signee).
</P>
<P>
   The reason HBO has become such a boxing fixture in the past
decade is because of Abraham and the aggressive work of Lou
DiBella, who recently left as the company's head of programming.
DiBella developed another tier of matchups - one where the fighters
and managers could be guaranteed of repeat appearances and work
their way into the major spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a revolutionary force,'' HBO boxing broadcaster Jim
Lampley said. ``He proved not every fight had to be a showcase. It
dramatically broadened the pond and opened more options for
matchmaking. Outside of ESPN and USA Network, there wasn't any
talent development organism in the boxing TV world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou forever changed the way TV executives did their
business,'' Abraham admits. ``He became proactive as a matchmaker.
But let's make it clear - we're not managers. We're TV networks.
Many people in the boxing community have labeled HBO as a promoter.
We're not a promoter. We don't house fighters. People who know that
business like Don King and Bob Arum know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our influence is our checkbook.''
</P>
<P>
   With DiBella only a consultant to HBO, the thought might be that
the network will lose some of its clout with Kerry Davis replacing
him in that negotiation role. But Abraham doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about how boxing has been marginalized, or it
appeals to only a niche audience,'' Abraham said. ``It might be
true in other places, but not at Time-Warner. For us, it's anything
but an outpost.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Showtime as their chief rival, HBO continues to have
serious game when it comes to locking in matchups. For example,
talk of a Tyson- Lewis fight on Showtime have been ongoing, but as
Showtime's Jay Larkin said recently, ``hell will freeze over before
HBO allows Lennox Lewis to fight Mike Tyson on Showtime ... there
will be pork chops growing on the palm trees of Tel Aviv first.''
</P>
<P>
   And De La Hoya's future with the network will also depend on
what happens Saturday. A rematch with Trinidad is something HBO
badly wants, but if that doesn't happen, they'll focus attention on
making a Trinidad-Vargas matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday's fight impacts everything,'' Abraham said. ``It's
right on the San Andreas fault and the tectonic plates will shift
after Saturday, no matter who wins.''
</P>
<P>
   And HBO's Richter scale will be there not just to measure it,
but to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-mile drivers: It's practically unheard of that a network
will commit to four-day coverage of a major golf tournament, but
that's what NBC began Thursday with this weekend's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, thank you, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Can't really go wrong, though, with it being the 100th such
event from as majestic a venue as foggy Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   While CBS gets the annual honors of the PGA Tour event from
Pebble Beach each January, NBC got its first crack at doing an
event from the Monterey Peninsula when it carried last summer's
U.S. Amateur championship.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports executive producer Tom Roy said: ``We used the
Amateur to test out different angles, and the one thing I'll say
about Pebble is the way other broadcasters have shown events from
here has really accentuated the beauty, but the first time I played
here I didn't realize just how good each and every one of these
holes are. So we've really gone the extra effort to show angles
that do show just how tough these holes are instead of just one
camera behind the green.''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing viewers might not readily notice: Roy has done
everything possible not to get NBC camera towers in the way.
Thursday's incredible coverage proved he was on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate seeing our own equipment in the shots,'' he said. ``I
just want to see the pristine beauty of the golf course and the
players. We specifically designed our coverage and our layout to
avoid seeing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``On holes where you have vistas where a green may be at the top
of the horizon, I purposely don't put a camera tower there. So at
17, if you stand on the tee, you can look straight over the ocean
instead of seeing a camera tower out there.''
</P>
<P>
   One more cool tool in NBC's arsenal (which will be introduced
this weekend) is a boat camera, shooting live from the Pacific
Ocean toward the course. Roy said technology used from coverage of
the America's Cup - putting the camera on a gyromount so it won't
flop around as the surf hits the boat - goes into this device that
will give new looks to the ocean holes 4 through 10 and then to the
magical 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually happens to be prettier looking from the ocean back
toward the land,'' Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   If that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   Bob Miller, who just finished his 27th year as the Kings'
play-by-play man, completes the trifecta of Los Angeles' Hall of
Fame broadcasters with his inclusion Thursday in the Hockey Hall of
Fame in Toronto. After Vin Scully and Chick Hearn into the baseball
and basketball shrines, Miller becomes the 22nd hockey broadcaster
to be inducted, honored with the Foster Hewett Memorial Award,
named for the longtime Toronto Maple Leafs announcer. ``I'm very
honored and very surprised,'' Miller said from his West Hills home.
``It's such a thrill. You know, there were times under (former
Kings owner) Jack Kent Cooke when I thought there'd be no way I'd
last a week on the job. This honor was the farthest thing from my
mind then.'' Miller, who now has a lifetime contract with the
Kings, will be inducted in ceremonies Nov. 13. ``I just hope we
don't have a game that night,'' Miller added.

IN RACING MONEY DOESN'T GUARANTEE SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dale Earnhardt Jr. signed with Budweiser for a reported $10
million a year in 1998, it was the most money ever given to a
rookie driver and one of the largest primary sponsorships in
NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years later, it's a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon recently signed a five-year deal with DuPont that
reportedly will pay him $20 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Valvoline, which has become synonymous with Mark
Martin, is leaving his car after 12 years and will be replaced by
Pfizer's Viagra brand. Reportedly, Pfizer will pay Martin $12
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   As Winston Cup racing becomes more complex and more top teams
run closer together, money becomes a key factor in achieving and
sustaining success.
</P>
<P>
   More money means more research and development, which might
allow you to find an aerodynamic edge in the body or a few extra
horsepower in the engine, and that might mean the difference
between winning and losing.
</P>
<P>
   But money, by itself, does not win races. The key is still
having the right people on your team to build the cars and the
right people to drive them.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is a perfect example of that. Even without the new DuPont
deal, his team was generally considered the best funded on the
circuit, having perhaps $30 million or more to spend annually.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, crew chief Ray Evernham left and took three
or four key people, including Ed Guzzo, Evernham's right-hand man
when he ran Gordon's team. After those losses, Gordon is no longer
in the elite classification.
</P>
<P>
   When good people leave, they are difficult to replace because
there are not that many around. Perhaps Gordon can rebuild; maybe
with the new influx of cash he can simply buy the talent he needs.
But keeping key personnel together is still critical in developing
a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, despite rule changes, new cars and
whatever else has affected the sport, a time-tested group of teams
have stayed consistently on top. Bobby Labonte, Rusty Wallace, Dale
Earnhardt, Mark Martin and Dale Jarrett are always right there.
Since he's been with Martin and Jack Roush, Jeff Burton is another.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has also been in this group, but he has slipped a bit
this year, and money alone won't bring him back.

   Finalists Picked For Tate Prize
</P>
<P>
   The Tate Gallery in London has announced the finalists for its
2000 Turner Prize, the prestigious $32,000 award given annually to
a British artist under 50.
</P>
<P>
   Every June when the list is released, it is met with a certain
amount of criticism. One year it was attacked for excluding women
and another year for including only women. One year people said it
was lacking in painters in favor of video artists. This year's list
_ three men and one woman _ includes two painters. Three of the
four artists are not British-born.
</P>
<P>
   None are among the trendy YBAs, or ``Young British Artists.''
The native Briton, Glenn Brown, was included in ``Sensation: Young
British Artists from the Saatchi Collection,'' shown at both the
Royal Academy in London and the Brooklyn Museum, but he has never
been considered one of the high-profile YBA's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've moved on,'' said Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate.
``This year's list shows a depth and range of cultural focus.'' He
added that the three artists who are not British-born have lived in
the London area for more than 10 years, in part because London has
good art schools and is a stimulating place for young artists.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Brown, a photo realist painter, the list includes
Michael Raedecker, a painter whose work incorporates thread and
embroidery; Tomoko Takahashi, whose sprawling installations
incorporate detritus and snapshots; and Wolfgang Tillmans, a
photographer known for his still lifes of clothes and portraits.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists' work will be on view at the Tate Britain at
Millbank from Oct. 25 to Jan. 14 . The winner is to be announced on
Nov. 28th. Antiquities Acquired
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth went shopping at this
week's antiquities sales in New York and ended up buying two
exceptionally rare pieces: a Greek vase from the fifth century B.C.
and a bronze Roman head dating from about the first century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The vase, which the museum bought at Christie's for $1.7
million, was from the collection of Elie Borowski, a collector and
curator of antiquities at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.
Dating from around 480 B.C., the vase measures 11{ inches in
diameter and has painted scenes on both the interior and exterior.
</P>
<P>
   The head, which the Kimbell bought at Sotheby's for $4.5
million, a record for a classical antiquity and an ancient bronze,
measures 11} inches in height. A Roman copy of a lost Greek
original, the head is believed to have been discovered in the 16th
century and was acquired by the 18th-century Venetian collector
Bernardo Nani. More recently it was owned by Hans Calmann, an Old
Master drawings dealer in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two objects will transform our classical collection, which
hasn't been one of our strongest departments,'' said Timothy Potts,
director of the Kimbell. ``There hasn't been anything like these
pieces on the market for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian Photographs
</P>
<P>
   Building an impressive photography collection has been a high
priority for the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. When it opened its
$50 million building in March, the museum had its first permanent
photography gallery. In January it acquired 22 photographs by
artists including Diane Arbus, Gerhard Richter and William
Eggelston. Recently, its photography curator, Anne Wilkes Tucker,
has turned toward collecting Italian photographs from the 1940s and
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   She approached Giorgio Borlenghi, a Houston real estate
developer, and his sister Ermy, both contributors to the museum and
both acquainted with this period in Italian photography. With money
from Giorgio Borlenghi and his wife, Cathy, and Ermy Borlenghi and
her husband, Gordon Bonfield, along with help from some trustees,
the museum formed the Carla and Lorenzo Borlenghi Collection, named
after Giorgio and Ermy's parents.
</P>
<P>
   The collection consists of 18 photographs by photographers who
worked in Florence, Milan, Venice and Rome. ``There were different
aesthetics and schools,'' Tucker said. ``Rome was the center of
paparazzi photographs, while Florence and Venice produced work that
was more formalist and abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the photographs acquired five by Tazio Secchiaroli.
Secchiaroli, who died two years ago, was the celebrity-hounding
photographer who was the inspiration for Paparazzo, the central
character in Federico Fellini's 1960 film ``La Dolce Vita.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the Italian photographs would be part of an
exhibition going on view in February 2002.
</P>
<P>
   New Costume Curator
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the much-publicized cancellation of the Coco
Chanel retrospective, which was to be the Costume Institute's big
exhibition in December, officials at the Metropolitan Museum issued
a statement saying that the death of Richard Martin, its chief
curator of the Costume Institute, last November made the Chanel
show impossible to organize. He had initiated the show, and the Met
had no one to fill his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   While people in the art and fashion worlds expressed strong
views _ both for and against canceling the show, which was to be
financed by Chanel _ and with no one inside the museum able to plan
such a complex project, the museum may have felt more pressure than
ever to name a successor to Martin.
</P>
<P>
   This week it announced that Harold Koda, an associate curator of
the Costume Institute in the mid-1990s, was returning as its
curator-in-charge. Koda is to start at the Met on Nov. 6 after
serving as a co-curator with Germano Celant of the Giorgio Armani
exhibition that opens at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Met also announced that James C.Y. Watt, a senior curator
and expert of Chinese art, had been named chairman of the museum's
department of Asian art. He succeeds Wen Fong, who is retiring on
June 30 and will become a curator emeritus. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   For a one-step action plot, assign a huge task and allow no
time. In this case the object is to steal 50 automobiles and have
them on a container ship in four days. ``These are not Honda
Civics,'' says Memphis Raines ( Cage), a former master car thief.
You could pay $150,000 for some of these vehicles _ snarly new
Lamborghinis and Ferraris, a 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500, a 1962
Aston Martin DBI.
</P>
<P>
   So switch off the brain ignition and get ready for a summer
clang-banger of an auto show and demolition derby courtesy of the
producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who wrecked a lot of stuff in ``Con
Air,'' also with Cage, a few summers ago.
</P>
<P>
   Situations like these call for another action staple: the
legendary pro who has sworn off whatever bad thing he was so good
at doing but is forced to resume with extreme reluctance. Memphis,
lately a legitimate go-cart dealer, returns because of his little
brother, Kip ( Ribisi), who is still stealing cars.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of swift, computer-assisted thievery, Kip still throws
a brick through one plate-glass window and drives the Porsche
through another plate-glass window. Little wonder he is behind in
his deliveries to Raymond Calitri ( Eccleston), an auto-theft
impresario eager to meet his quotas and uphold his reputation in
South American stolen-car circles.
</P>
<P>
   Handcuffing Kip to a car about to be crushed in a scrap-yard
compactor, Calitri summons Memphis and tells him to steal 50 cars
in the time allotted or his brother is a bouillon cube. All right,
all right, says Memphis, who then proceeds to fritter away three of
the four days rounding up his old car-stealing crew. With but hours
left, Memphis and associates start picking off the treasured 50.
Everybody drives very fast, and there are a lot of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ People get roughed up and so do the paint jobs.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ Memphis and a colleague ( Jolie) get into the carnal
spirit while waiting for a couple to start lovemaking and become
distracted enough not to notice that their purple Ferrari is being
stolen. But this being a PG-13 movie, things are too hot not to
cool down.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ Some strong cussing can be heard over the engines'
scream.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 11 _ The film is not suitable for young children, but
for age 10 or so some parents may relent.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP _ Those cars. Those chases.

   Big Momma's House
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lawrence, Nia Long, Terrence Howard, Ella Mitchell, Paul
Giamatti, Jascha Washington
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Raja Gosnell
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 _ 97 minutes
</P>
<P>
   To trap an escaped killer named Lester ( Howard), an F.B.I.
agent named Malcolm ( Martin) and his partner, John ( Giamatti),
trail Lester's ex-girlfriend, Sherry ( Long), who they hope will
flee and lead Lester to her grandmother's house in suburban
Georgia: Big Momma's house.
</P>
<P>
   A stakeout is set up across the street, but the opportunity to
get into the place to plant surveillance devices presents itself
when Momma ( Mitchell) departs for an extended time away. Malcolm
then decides to become the woman, which plays into Lawrence's
considerable talent for transformation and introduces elements of
``Tootsie.''
</P>
<P>
   To impersonate Big Momma, an extremely large woman, Malcolm
applies great slabs of latex to all parts of his body. The face
especially threatens to slide south, and at one point Malcolm,
making an emergency exit from an upper floor, falls through the
bottom of the rig.
</P>
<P>
   But he certainly fools Sherry, who appears on Momma's doorstep
with her young son, Trent (Jascha Washington). Along with the rest
of the town, Sherry takes to the imitation Big Momma as if she were
the genuine article. Malcolm appreciates Sherry, too, particularly
in abbreviated outfits, but ogling from within Big Momma's
mountainous folds gets awkward.
</P>
<P>
   As Momma, Malcolm finds out that he's a prolific cook of greasy
baked goods and a midwife. (``It's a baby!'' he shrieks during a
birth.) He's also a jivey preacher, a gospel belter and, stirring
in Malcolm's talents, a pretty fair playground basketball player.
Granny's got game, but then Lester appears and Malcolm is forced
into some police activity. Finally the real Big Momma returns, and
there are romantic matters to straighten out.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ Quite a bit, but always comic and plainly so.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ There is the childbirth scene, and Malcolm's Big Momma has
a hard time containing her lust for Sherry.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ The bathroom variety, loud and crude.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10 _ The movie is both relatively harmless and
basically inappropriate for small children.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 _ Lawrence is gamey, but he is a funny man. Children
would have a good time. Parents must decide.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP _ Why, sure.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai Noon
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu, Xander Berkeley, Walton
Goggins, Roger Yuan, Brandon Merrill
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Tom Dey
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 _ 110 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Unwillingly betrothed to a chubby fellow who stuffs himself with
cupcakes, Princess Pei Pei ( Liu) is luckily kidnapped and ends up
in Nevada, where, the year being 1881, Indians are warring and
Chinese slave laborers are building a railroad. Sent in pursuit, a
detail of imperial bodyguards brings an emperor's ransom to be
offered for her return.
</P>
<P>
   The most determined of the emperor's men, Chon Wang ( Chan),
falls in with a blond, very relaxed train robber named Roy O'Bannon
( Wilson) and rescues a little girl after a wild brawl with a
half-dozen Crow warriors. That makes him a hero in an Indian
village, where he puffs too much peace pipe and wakes up with the
chief's daughter ( Merrill), to whom he is married forthwith.
</P>
<P>
   Many martial arts altercations lie ahead for Chon Wang
(pronounced John Wayne by this time in his adventures), who in best
Jackie Chan fashion erupts as if a string of firecrackers had gone
off in his trousers. O'Bannon, a New Age forerunner, has calming
advice and a habit of disappearing in a crunch. The princess
meanwhile decides she will stay in Nevada to help her laboring
countrymen. Could it be that she has fallen for Chon Wang? And what
is to be done with all that ransom?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ The hand-to-hand combat is furious, funny and partly
realistic. People also get shot and killed, but the cumulative
effect is humorous. &QL; 
SEXA tepee tryst is revealed the morning after.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ Some rowdy cowboy talk.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 8 _ Chan is a delight at any age, but all this would
be confusing, overwhelming and just not right for the little ones.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-10 _ The film is a bit of a gray area at this level.
Parents know best.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP _ Fine.

GOVERNMENT REPORT BLASTS FEDERAL OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal agency responsible for pipeline safety
is a weak, overly compliant regulator that seldom imposes fines
when violations are found, fails to fully involve state officials,
and often ignores reforms demanded by Congress, according to an
independent study of the agency released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office's conclusions about the Office of
Pipeline Safety largely confirm complaints raised by Washington
state lawmakers and citizens in the wake of last year's deadly
gasoline pipeline leak and explosion in Bellingham, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Since the June 10, 1999, accident, which killed three people,
the pipeline safety office has been criticized by lawmakers and
residents alike for not moving faster and more aggressively to
ensure that the web of pipelines nationwide are safely maintained
and operated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the GAO's report ... paints a picture of an
agency that places disturbing amounts of faith in the industry it
is supposed to regulate, and is either unable or unwilling to carry
out any of its responsibilities under the law,'' said Rep. John
Dingel, D-Mich., who asked for the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GAO report shows that in regard to accident data and in
other areas, OPS monitoring and oversight of the industry is
abysmal,'' Dingel wrote to Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
   The report was made public the same day that a Senate committee
approved legislation designed to significantly reform the way
pipelines are regulated. That step, along with the report, could
improve chances that Congress approves legislation this year to
make pipelines safer, said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scathing report that will give us additional ammunition
to push legislation forward,'' said Inslee, who is sponsoring a
bill along with Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Inslee said he will introduce a second bill next week to address
some of the specific problems highlighted by the General Accounting
Office, which is the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Among its findings:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The proportion of enforcement actions brought by the
Office of Pipeline Safety that resulted in fines fell from 49
percent to 4 percent between 1990 and 1998. Agency officials
defended that approach by saying working cooperatively with
companies allows problems to be fixed faster.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The agency has failed to put into place 22 statutory
requirements ordered by Congress. Twelve of them date from 1992 or
earlier. The agency has also ignored recommendations from the
National Transportation Safety Board, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that Office of Pipeline Safety did not act
``because it believes (the changes) would be too costly for the
pipeline industry compared to expected benefits.'' However, some
analyses of costs and benefits are flawed because the agency did
not consider all the benefits, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The number of major pipeline accidents increased by 4
percent a year between 1989 and 1998. Over that period, 226 people
were killed, more than 1,030 injured and $700 million in property
damaged. Pipelines carrying hazardous liquids, such as the one in
Bellingham, ``account for the smallest portion of total pipeline
mileage (but) have almost eight times as many major accidents per
mile as natural gas transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Kelley Coyner, the administrator of the Office
of Pipeline Safety, said: `We agree with GAO's recommendations. ...
The Office of Pipeline Safety is using its legislative authority
for regulating pipeline safety, testing and enforcement to the
maximum extent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the Commerce Committee yesterday unanimously
approved a bill that would require more frequent and thorough
inspections, better training for operators and more timely and
detailed public information about the location and condition of
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   It also would also increase fines that could be imposed, protect
``whistle blowers'' who report pipeline problems, and allow state
and local governments to offer comment on pipeline management
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would require pipeline operators to carry out a
detaalysis to determine potential risks along a pipeline and
adopt a plan for addressing problems where they exist. The plan
would also outline steps the operator would take to safely operate
the pipeline. States would be allowed to review the plans and
suggest changes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it would give the secretary of Transportation authority
to shut down a pipeline indefinitely in the event of an ``imminent
hazard'' and it lowers the threshold for reporting a pipeline spill
from 2,100 gallons to five gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash., praised
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bodes really well,'' Murray said. The GAO report also
``shows significant reason for taking action this year,'' Murray
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the outcome here,'' Gorton said. But for the bill to
move to the Senate floor, Gorton must convince Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that it can earn quick approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``His problem is not going to be any substantive concern with
the bill,'' Gorton said of Lott. ``It's going to be whether there
will be time to do it. If we can convince him that it would move in
a couple of days I think he'll bring it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That is by no means assured. There is opposition from oil-state
senators who believe the bill will lead to onerous, expensive and
not effective regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges will come from the other side as well. Environmental
groups and pipeline reform advocates such as SAFE Bellingham
believe the bill should be even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   The original bill, introduced by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was
named after two 10-year-old boys who were killed in the Bellingham
accident. The version approved yesterday did not include the name
because aides said they could not contact the parents in time to
find out if they agreed with some changes.

   VALPARAISO, Neb. _ The pond on Dave Barry's farm, once six feet
deep, has dried to a mud puddle, and the purple flowers on the
surrounding alfalfa are an ominous sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should reach two feet before it blooms, but it's only four
inches,'' Barry said the other day as a hot, dry wind ruffled the
stumpy plants. ``It's fit for a lawn mower. It's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in eastern Nebraska, in a swath of the Gulf Coast from
Florida to New Orleans, in the hills of West Texas and in Georgia
and Alabama, pockets of extraordinary drought, by some measures the
worst in a century, are baking farms and homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, alligators are roaming out of lakes and ponds that
have all but disappeared. In southeast Louisiana, rice crops and
drinking wells are being ruined by salt water that has seeped into
the parched aquifer. In West Texas, ranchers are selling off goats
and sheep as the grasslands dry up. In Georgia, the red soil is
baked hard as concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there this week, the first rain in months has fallen.
But far more will be needed and the damage is already done for many
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   John Saichuk, a rice specialist in Louisiana State University's
Cooperative Extension, said salt water that has been drawn into the
depleted aquifer is killing crops and can also ruin the soil and
next year's crop.
</P>
<P>
   In Concho County, Texas, Lance Rasch, the county extension
agent, said most ranchers have liquidated their herds, with only 25
percent of the livestock left compared with four years ago. Some
large ranches have no livestock at all, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not just farmers are feeling the effects.
</P>
<P>
   In the lush suburban neighborhoods of Tampa and Atlanta, ``water
police'' roam, enforcing regulations to restrict watering lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Parched communities in northern Florida have become tinderboxes,
with almost daily brush fires in several counties. The smoke from
one brush fire that raged just outside Orlando earlier this month
set off fire alarms in a downtown hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the severity in some areas, the effects are not as
widespread as in some past droughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a drought of national geography,'' Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said. Glickman said it has not affected
prices and production of major crops like wheat, corn and soybeans
or pushed up food prices, as a nationwide drought did in 1988. ``I
don't believe we're going to have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, where the drought has hit, it has hit uncommonly
hard. Glickman said there is little precedent for the weather's
extreme volatility in recent years, with severe dry spells and then
torrential rain and floods. ``That's what's unusual _ those intense
weather patterns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Collins, chief economist at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture in Washington, saw serious effects on production of two
crops _ peanuts and cotton. In Alabama, which produces 10 percent
of the nation's peanuts, growing conditions for 83 percent of the
crop are poor, indicating sharply reduced harvests.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, source of half the nation's peanuts, 28 percent of
the crop has been caught in such conditions. In Texas, source of a
third of the nation's cotton production, the department says 21
percent of the current crop has been struck.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in parched areas who rely on irrigation have been hit
doubly hard, by the drought and the rising cost of the oil to drive
the irrigation systems. Sen. Bob Kerry, D-Neb., said that in the
state's southwestern corner, the cost of irrigating wheat has
jumped from $100 an acre to $200.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Gov. Mike Johanns of Nebraska declared a state of
emergency and sought aid for the most stricken counties.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Dutcher, the state climatologist, says the drought began
in the southeastern corner of the state in the middle of July last
year. ``It wasn't really until the month of September that we saw
everyone in the state go dry,'' Dutcher said. ``It was eight weeks
before anyone got precipitation at all. Then it was dry again until
February.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska wheat farmers depend on fall and spring rains to build
up moisture in the soil. With no rain, farmers found themselves
needing 25 inches of rain in a growing season that typically
provides 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now need 200 percent of normal rainfall,'' Dutcher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pastures didn't respond this spring,'' he said. ''We
didn't have the moisture for growth when it was cool, and the
temperature skyrocketed in May. We had 100 degree readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing that went down was the wheat crop. Harvesting
will begin this week, but our yields in a lot of places will be 50
percent or less. In the southeast, a lot of people are cutting the
wheat for grazing, as supplemental cattle feed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the governor said he would allow farmers in 46
counties to harvest grass along state and federal roads to feed
their animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the lack of moisture and the hot, dry winds, there's a
lot of fear,'' said Merlyn Carlson, Nebraska's director of
agriculture. ``As streams decline, we may have to restrict
irrigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has 13 million acres in corn, sorghum, and soy beans.
And 55 to 60 percent of this is irrigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Center-pivot irrigation has to run 24 hours a day,'' said
Dutcher. ``There's no moisture in the soil to rely on. Irrigators
will not be able to keep up with crop water demands. ``
</P>
<P>
   Barry, who farms 1,500 acres of corn, soybeans, and alfalfa, was
manning water pumps on his farm the other day, but only for 60
acres. ``The price of fuel makes watering corn that sells for $1.60
a bushel a waste of time,'' he said. ``Without rain, we'll have to
water for 60 days, and we'll lose $1 a bushel.''
</P>
<P>
   He has already moved his 160 cows, with their calves, to
pastures where it rains, 280 miles away, at a cost of $2 a mile. As
he drove away from his rock-hard alfalfa fields, which yielded only
a fourth of their usual harvest this spring, he passed Conservation
Reserve Program pastures, held in reserve for soil conservation and
wildlife. Today the Federal government released them for use by
farmers who want to rent them for grazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late for us,'' Barry said. ``I've moved my cattle.
People south of Lincoln sold theirs two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Roadside haying, which will begin next Monday, ``could help
some,'' he said, ``but there's bottles and cans and broke- off tree
stumps. You ruin as much equipment as you make in hay.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Unless rain falls soon, South Alabama could be facing the driest
first half of a year in this century. Already, Alabama has been
scorched by the worst drought since the 1950s with rainfall a foot
below normal in some areas this year and two feet below over two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Don Siegelman has declared a state of emergency in 19 of
the state's 67 counties. Faye and Joe Williams and her husband,
Joe, raise corn, cotton, peanuts, grain sorghum for their cattle on
1,000 acres in Newton, in the heart of the drought in far southeast
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal year, the 5-foot, 3-inch tall Williams could hide in
her corn stalks. This year, she noted, ``It's up to my waist.'' She
said, ``We didn't plant as much cotton as anticipated. We got all
of our peanuts planted but about a third came up.'' Williams one of
the farm's said the farm has two streams that have gone dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming has got way out of balance too,'' Williams said.
``Everything we have to buy is up, up, up but the prices are at a
standstill level.''
</P>
<P>
   On his farm near Montezuma, Ga., Lynmore James cannot graze his
cattle on barren pastures and the earth is baked hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't dig a hole'' James said. ``You can't get anything to
scratch the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get the blues,'' he added, ``but we try to keep in
good spirits. We go to church and we meet and talk about our
problems. ''
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Much needed rain fell on Wednesday in South Alabama and the
Florida Panhandle but unless the thunderstorms stick around for
days or even weeks the rainfall will not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, the first real rain in months fell on Tampa, and
people rushed outside to watch and to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think once the rainy season has begun, we might catch
up slowly,'' said a cautious Eric Oglesby, a hydrologist for the
National Weather Service at Ruskin, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In east Nebraska rain is spotty. It may rain an inch in Lincoln,
as it did this week, and only a few drops will fall on Barry's
farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a miracle to make a corn crop,'' he said.
``Ten inches have to go into the ground in the next ten days. An
inch isn't going to do us any good.''

LANDMARK STATUS FOR HARLEM BUILDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By NINA SIEGAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though their days were embittered by segregation and
prejudice, African-Americans in Jazz Age New York always suspected
that life was sweeter on Sugar Hill.
</P>
<P>
   As they gazed up the hill from ``the valley,'' as central Harlem
was sometimes called, Harlemites saw a shimmering bluff that would,
from 1929 until midcentury, become a hub of elite black society.
The names of those who lived there read like a Who's Who of black
history: Ralph Ellison, Thurgood Marshall, Joe Louis, W.E.B. Du
Bois, James Baldwin, Adam Clayton Powell Sr., Zora Neale Hurston,
Duke Ellington and Paul Robeson, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some seven decades after the grand 19th-century row houses,
brownstones and apartment buildings on Sugar Hill were first opened
up to black renters and home buyers, the neighborhood is expected
to become an official historic landmark on June 27, when the New
York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designates a section as
the Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill Historic District.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first phase of a process that will ultimately create
a historic district encompassing almost 400 buildings from 145th
Street to 155th Street, with jagged borders from Edgecombe Avenue
to Amsterdam Avenue. The next phase is expected to begin in July,
and the commission hopes the whole district will be designated as a
landmark by June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   One might expect that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has said that
he is looking to improve his relations with the city's minority
residents, would be shouting from the rooftops about the landmark
designation. Not so. In fact, the commission chairwoman he
appointed in 1994, Jennifer Raab, who is widely credited with
pushing through the designation after almost 15 years of inactivity
on the issue, is reluctant to call the district a ``black
district.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a phenomenal volume of perfectly preserved row
houses,'' Raab said. ``They have their stoops, their ornaments, and
it is remarkable in New York to find such a volume of intact
architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether she considers Hamilton Heights and Sugar
Hill a black historic district, Raab said, ``I will have to think
about that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Landmark designation is always a subject of debates, and talking
about race in any context is touchy. Landmarks officials seem to be
particularly wary of combining the two. They may be sensitive, in
part, because of previous accusations by some preservationists that
the commission has neglected Harlem since it designated the
Hamilton Heights Historic District, just south of the new district,
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Once the commission finally began carving out the new district
in an area almost consecrated in black lore, the debates became
more complicated: Should a historic district be created based on
its architectural merits or on its cultural history?
</P>
<P>
   This question is not unique to New York. In other cities where
``heritage tourism'' is encouraged in historic areas like
Bronzeville in Chicago's South Side and Beale Street in Memphis,
preservationists have also encountered difficulty in convincing
officials to define these areas as ``black historic districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill will be one of the largest
such districts in the nation when it is completed, it has not been
a simple matter to trumpet it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the historic row houses on the hill were designed for
rich white families at the turn of the century. It was not until
the end of the 1920s _ late in the Harlem Renaissance _ that blacks
were allowed to buy and rent the palatial homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the commission calls it, there's no question that
we're into a celebration of revolutionary terrain, because this is
the central launching pad for black leadership in postwar
America,'' said Carolyn Kent, a chairwoman of the landmarks
committee for Community Board 9 in West Harlem, which encompasses
the historic district.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, African-Americans are not the only ones living on the
hill, as more homes are owned or rented by Hispanic, Asian, West
African and white people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at it as a black district historically, but how can we
say that now?'' said George Goodwill, chairman of the community
board. ``It's tricky and it could become quite confrontational. I
try to stay away from controversy and let the name Sugar Hill speak
for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mayangar says she was the only white person living on West
147th Street between Convent and St. Nicholas Avenues in 1988, when
she bought a four-story brownstone for $300,000. She knew something
about the area's cultural history at the time, but moved in because
of its well-preserved homes and the prevailing sense of
neighborhood pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the architectural reasons we want to keep it that way, not
just the cultural reasons,'' she said, adding that two mixed-race
couples recently moved onto her block.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Landmarks Preservation Commission was created in 1965,
it has designated about 1,000 individual landmarks and about 70
historic districts. According to the commission's spokeswoman,
Terri Rosen Deutsch, cultural factors ``drove the designations''
for a few sites in the city, like the recently designated Charlie
Parker house on Avenue B. But, she added, ``I don't think there's
any building that you can look at that we designated solely for
cultural reasons. They all have some architectural merit.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is an increasingly vocal group of preservationists
throughout the city who would like to change that. One is Laura
Hansen, a director of Place Matters, a joint project of the
Municipal Art Society and City Lore, a cultural organization.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is sometimes hard to make the argument for cultural
designations. ``It's a lot easier to interpret how to regulate
something with architectural details, simply because there's a lot
of consensus in the architectural canon,'' she said. ``But with
cultural history, there's a lot less agreement about what should be
included.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuien Chin, coordinator of the Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill
Historic District Committee, said Sugar Hill was a test case. ``It
has presented a unique opportunity for the commission to really
grapple with the idea of cultural landmarking,'' she said. ``It is
an issue that is not unique to Harlem, but it's really important
here because it is one of the largest African-American communities
that has made such an impact on the history of its people, and it
should be acknowledged as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Some preservationists who argue this point say historic
districts like Greenwich Village and South Street Seaport are de
facto white historic districts.
</P>
<P>
   A loose-knit group of Sugar Hill residents first introduced the
idea of creating a landmark district there about 15 years ago, but
the commission lost their documentation, Goodwill of the community
board said. In 1994, when Raab became chairwoman, she announced
that one of her top priorities was Harlem; three years later, a new
group of residents formed a committee to push again for a historic
district.
</P>
<P>
   In the early planning stages, the commission focused on the
exquisite row houses on the side streets, but was skeptical about
including several large, more modern apartment buildings on
Edgecombe Avenue. To some neighborhood historians, the idea of
forsaking Edgecombe was unfathomable. The street sits on the cliff
above central Harlem, and the long stretch of towering apartment
buildings, many residents argued at commission hearings, were like
the gates of the Emerald City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgecombe Avenue is synonymous with Sugar Hill,'' Chin said.
``It was the first place that people think of when you mention
Sugar Hill.''

EXPERT WITNESS SHOCKED 
BY RACISM ALLEGATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
 TESTIMONY-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For more than two decades, Walter Quijano has
nudged his career as a clinical psychologist into becoming one of
the most respected expert witnesses in hundreds of criminal trials
across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Chief psychologist for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice
for more than five years and a former consultant for the Federal
Bureau of Prisons, Quijano has expertise in substance abuse
counseling, mentally ill prison populations, sex offenders and
other forensic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past 10 days, however, the 51-year-old Quijano has
seen his reputation plummet from respected social scientist to
pariah _ all because of racially tinged testimony he gave at a 1996
capital murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Quijano said Thursday of the fallout from the
Victor Saldano case, which the U.S. Supreme Court last week sent
back for a new sentencing trial.
</P>
<P>
   He initially viewed the court's action as one indicating some
procedural error involving the inadmissibility of evidence at
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then it turned ugly, and (people are saying) I am a
racist,'' said the Filipino-American. &UR;  &LR; ``That part shocked me.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked the attorney general's office to send him a copy of the
transcript of his testimony in the Saldano case ``because, my God,
if I am appearing racist in my testimony, I should apologize and I
should quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saldano case, however, is just the first of several capital
murder convictions that could be jeopardized by Quijano's
testimony. Since the Saldano ruling, Texas Attorney General John
Cornyn has identified six other capital cases in which the
psychologist gave somewhat similar testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Then earlier this week, the fallout spread to civil proceedings
against predatory sex offenders examined by psychologist Roger
Saunders, whose expertise has been called into question solely
because he is Quijano's associate.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys with the state prison system's Special Prosecution
Unit on Wednesday dropped trial proceedings against Terry D.
Ingram, the first Texas sex offender the state had hoped to force
into continued treatment and surveillance under a new Texas law.
Four other sex offender cases could be similarly affected because
Quijano or Saunders was scheduled to testify as an expert witness.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Saunders' credibility was impugned by Quijano's
testimony in the capital murder cases.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano said he and his partner, who practice in Conroe, Texas,
are among several psychologists with whom TDCJ has contracts to
examine sex offenders to determine if they should be subjected to
civil commitment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But Quijano insisted Thursday that statistical data about
over-representation of racial and ethnic minorities in Texas
prisons _ the kind of testimony that has jeopardized the capital
murder cases _ is not part of his evaluation of sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Although both types of cases involve the prediction of future
dangerousness, Quijano said Texas' sex offender commitment law is
so tightly written that experts can analyze only three issues:
whether the person's crime was predatory, whether it was violent
and whether he has a behavioral abnormality that likely will make
him a predator in the future.
</P>
<P>
   When one critic told Quijano that his discussion of race and
ethnicity equated to testifying that a person is genetically
predisposed to commit future violence, Quijano was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gosh, if that is how I am coming across, that is no
good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one weakness in my presentation is that I assume when
I say statistical significance, people know what statistical means
_ that it is simply a manipulation of numbers and that it is simply
a correlation, not a causation,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano's testimony in various capital cases ranges from the
mere use of the word ``race'' in one case to more lengthy
discussions about Hispanics, African-Americans and percentages of
different races and ethnicities in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The issue raised by Quijano about the Hispanic ethnicity of
Saldano, a native of Argentina, was one of 24 factors listed in a
chart to convince a Collin County jury that he posed a future
threat of violence and deserved to die for the 1995 murder of Paul
King.
</P>
<P>
   But Quijano said he has been working ``from the same outline''
for the past 25 years, regardless of whether he was testifying for
the defense or the prosecution. And never once _ until Saldano's
defense lawyers raised the issue on appeal _ has anyone criticized
or tried to bar his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   He said sometimes defense lawyers have asked him at trial to
elaborate on race or ethnicity. It offers a chance to explain that
minorities historically have faced disadvantaged upbringing that
mitigates against tough sentences, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people never had a chance,'' Quijano said.
``They grew up in a violent neighborhood, they grew up with an
education that's poor, nobody inspired them to go to school, there
are no jobs. In other words, I am describing a very horrible
upbringing that happens to minorities not because they are white or
black or green but because of lack of opportunities, historical
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Quijano is hoping his tarnished reputation is only a temporary
setback, but whether he has become such a lightning rod that
neither side will risk hiring him in the future remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter has a reputation for speaking the truth as he sees
it,'' said psychologist Windell Dickerson, who gave Quijano his
first job after he finished graduate school. ``You may or may not
agree with what he sees, and he may not always be politic about how
he words things.''

AUTO TECHNOLOGY: A HYBRID WITH BRAINS AND BRAWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hybrid-power vehicles, the engineers point out, can
come in all shapes and sizes. The first two on the market are the
two-passenger Honda Insight and the five-passenger Toyota Prius.
</P>
<P>
   They are notable for using electric motors to achieve remarkable
gasoline fuel economy. And they look like hybrids: eggy, sleek and
futuristic.
</P>
<P>
   But DaimlerChrysler is demonstrating another tack entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the red-meat hybrid, an SUV as brawny as a pure gasoline
version, in exactly the same body, with the same tough-looking
wheels and grille, and four-wheel drive. But this Dodge Durango is
modified to get 30 percent of its horsepower through an electric
motor instead of from the gasoline engine. As with the Japanese
entries, the result is better fuel economy. The improvement is just
three miles per gallon, but on a big sport utility like the
Durango, that is a full 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler showed the truck here recently at the conclusion
of the American Tour de Sol, an annual electric-car race.
</P>
<P>
   An early fan was Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who is chairman
of the Energy Committee. ``Feels like a normal car,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Insight, a two-seater that gets about 70
miles per gallon but owes part of that to its sleek form and
aluminum frame, or the Prius, which has a slightly boxy appearance,
the hybrid Durango prototype is indistinguishable from the gasoline
version _ unless you spot the ``state of charge'' meter on the
dashboard, or crawl under the front to see the 70-horsepower
electric motor, mounted sideways, that drives the front wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the soccer mom car,'' Senator Murkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, by far, the simplest of the three. The Insight has
an electric motor sandwiched into the drivetrain between the
gasoline engine and the manual transmission. The Prius has a
planetary gear, a specially developed device that means that at any
given moment, the electric motor can be working alone, or assisting
the gasoline engine, or draining energy from the gasoline engine to
recharge the battery.
</P>
<P>
   The Durango is far simpler; an ordinary V-6 gasoline engine in
the front drives ordinary wheels in the back, and the electric
motor under the front of the car turns the front wheels; the only
connection between the two drivetrains is the pavement. When the
driver pushes the brake pedal, the electric motor switches into a
generator, robbing the car of momentum and converting that into
current to recharge the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   If the batteries are depleted as the car cruises, the motor in
front will start letting the wheels drag a little and recharge the
batteries, using the pavement to transfer energy from the gasoline
system to the electric one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a leap in technology that can get you an instant
improvement,'' said William Craven, a project-management specialist
who works on the Durango and the Epic, the company's all-electric
minivan.
</P>
<P>
   His competitor, David Hermance, an executive engineer at Toyota,
whose car and its unusual gearing system is perhaps more of a leap,
put it differently.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, he said: ``There are three attributes
you're trading off _ emissions, fuel economy and acceleration, or
performance. You decide what it is you want your vehicle to do in
those three attributes, and then you size your internal-combustion
engine and your motor so as to get the combination you're
interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   To get acceleration, Hermance said, use a larger gasoline
engine; to get better fuel economy and pollution control, favor the
electric side.
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota relies on the electric motor alone when it is moving
slowly, and the Honda makes heavy use of the electric motor every
time the driver shifts to a higher gear; both shut off the gasoline
engine entirely when the car is waiting at a stop sign or red
light.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them were designed as hybrids, from the ground up. And
both, but especially the Honda, gain performance by shedding
weight. Their performance is good but nothing special.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Durango weighs the same in the hybrid version,
and performs about the same _ that is to say, like a hard-charging
bull. It has a slightly lower towing rating than the all-gasoline
version of the Durango. The Prius and Insight, on the other hand,
are unlikely candidates to tow anything.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler said that teaming the 3.9 liter V-6 with a Siemens
3-phase AC induction motor gave ``V-8 performance with better than
V-6 fuel economy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the parlance of this emerging technology, the Durango is a
``mild hybrid,'' and the Insight and Prius are ``heavy hybrids.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other differences. The Prius and Insight have no
direct cost comparisons, since they are not new versions of an
all-gasoline car, but both appear to sell at a modest premium above
what a conventional gasoline car that size would cost.
</P>
<P>
   American manufacturers suggest that Toyota and Honda are
actually taking considerable losses on each of the cars sold,
something that DaimlerChrysler does not seem willing to do.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler says each hybrid Durango would cost $3,000 extra
to make; it is lobbying for special tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese entries are on the road now. The population of
hybrid Durangos is one lonely preproduction prototype. If the
Chrysler division decided now to produce it, the hybrid would go on
sale in about three years.

FLAMBOYANT OIL INVESTOR IS SUED BY ASPEN GROUP FOR FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: skedded earlier as KAZAKSTAN-INVESTOR) 
 By STEVE LeVINE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ One of Viktor Kozeny's strengths has always
been audacity.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Kozeny, an investment promoter, graduated
from Harvard, returned to his Czech homeland, and persuaded 800,000
local citizens that they would earn 10 times their money by
investing with him. Labeled the ``pirate of Prague'' after he left
town with $200 million and most other participants in the
investment plan almost broke, Kozeny said it was ``hurtful'' to be
unappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting two years ago to Aspen, Colo., Kozeny awed the rich ski
town with his extravagance, which included buckets of beluga caviar
and $1,000 bottles of Chateau Petrus. Soon, Aspen people had
entrusted Kozeny with their money _ an estimated $450 million in
what would become another investment-gone-bad.
</P>
<P>
   When some complained, Kozeny accused them of ``rabid greed'' and
sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Kozeny, 36, appears in trouble because of what his
former Aspen friends call his own greed. His fortune is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   In the sternest and most detailed of a chain of legal setbacks,
U.S. District Judge Lewis Babcock said on Tuesday in Denver that
the Aspen group had a ``substantial likelihood'' of proving fraud
and racketeering against him.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also raised questions about the accuracy of a report
by the Zurich arm of the Chicago-based accounting firm Grant
Thornton LLP, which the plaintiffs say they relied upon in making
their investment.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves a venture, managed by Kozeny, to acquire
control of the lucrative state-run petroleum company in Azerbaijan,
a former Soviet republic adjoining the western Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, including the Wall Street hedge-fund manager
Leon G. Cooperman and an insurance giant, the American
International Group, are seeking $160 million, representing their
$141 million investment plus interest and legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman and AIG have obtained orders freezing Kozeny's assets
in from courts in Aspen, London, the Bahamas and the British Virgin
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The assets include some odd items, such as a couch hand-sewn
with 33 alligator skins, according to court documents. But there
are also art and furniture collections from the 17th, 18th and 19th
centuries; a wine cellar with 500 bottles of rare merlots and 23
cases of vintage Port, a sprawling Bahamas home, a London mansion
and a 23,000-square-foot Aspen chalet.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone at Kozeny's Bahamas home was busy in numerous
attempts to obtain comment. Kozeny also did not respond to an
invitation to present his side, conveyed through Jacqueline S.
Miller, his lawyer in Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The judges in all four courts have so far accepted the essence
of each other's findings. But Babcock's 41-page opinion is by far
the most comprehensive written analysis of the case, quoting the
judges in London and the British Virgin Islands, who said there was
a strong case of fraud, and largely accepting the plaintiffs' key
assertions of fact.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock wrote that the Aspen plaintiffs had demonstrated
evidence that Kozeny had ``engaged in racketeering activity by
perpetuating frauds and laundering monetary instruments or funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, which is not expected to be resolved until next year,
is emblematic of the boom-time fever that prevailed in the Caspian
region until about two years ago _ with its share of adventurers,
mysterious middlemen and outright con artists.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Kozeny bought his $19.7 million home on Red
Mountain in Aspen, a haunt of entrepreneurs seeking venture capital
from some of America's most receptive investors, and began holding
lavish parties. An affair on Dec. 20 included a private concert by
Natalie Cole and was said to have cost $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   At all of them he spoke of a killing to be made in Azerbaijan
oil. Many in the affluent crowd felt part of a fashionable Viktor
Kozeny club.
</P>
<P>
   A networking bacchanalia erupted. Neighbors, including Frederick
Bourke of Dooney &AMP; Bourke, a handbag company; and a Florida
investment adviser, Aaron Fleck, staked an estimated $50 million on
Kozeny's venture in Azerbaijan. Then, Fleck introduced Kozeny to
New York friends, including Cooperman, who assembled other
investors including AIG and a Columbia University trust fund. The
former Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, was persuaded not
only to invest, but to help lead a Washington lobbying effort that
Kozeny suggested would help the investment.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, however, the warm feelings about Kozeny soured.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan made clear that it was not selling its oil company.
And Kozeny's investment vehicle _ privatization vouchers and their
accompanying option certificates _ became worthless, mostly because
the oil company was thought to be the only Azerbaijani state
enterprise worth buying.
</P>
<P>
   Kozeny was unmoved when his American partners protested. He
countered that they had lost money in ``an extraordinarily reckless
and imprudent speculation.'' In court papers filed in Denver, he
said, ``The exhibits tell a story of the extraordinary risks men
possessed with rabid greed will take when they see a
once-in-a-lifetime chance to reap billions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozeny also blamed Azerbaijan's government, saying it had
deceived him. Azerbaijani officials have denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman declined to comment. But in the suit, he and AIG say
they sued Kozeny not over Azerbaijan's refusal to sell the oil
company but because, they contend, Kozeny defrauded them from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Their contract, they say, specified that they would not pay more
than Kozeny did for the vouchers and option certificates needed to
buy control of the Azerbaijani oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Kozeny bought his options for an average of 40 cents each,
according to documents and affidavits filed in Denver, then in
November 1997 persuaded officials in Azerbaijan to raise the price
to the equivalent of $25.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the official price, Cooperman and AIG wired $75.1
million to Kozeny's Swiss bank to cover the purchase of 3 million
options. That gave Kozeny an instant profit of $73.8 million, which
the suit asserts Kozeny diverted into his personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   According to bank documents filed in Denver, Kozeny spent $9.7
million of Cooperman's and AIG's money on his Aspen chalet. The
expenses included the construction of a gymnasium for his wife,
Ludka, and a suite of rooms for a woman described as his ``female
companion.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kozeny's instruction, the documents assert, workers built a
hiding place beneath his house, painting over a wall to camouflage
it, and created another hidden space in his closet.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman and AIG contend that another important reason they
were misled was a Grant Thornton report that, they say, vastly
understated Kozeny's inventory of vouchers and options. On May 23,
they filed six claims seeking a total payment of $160 million from
Grant Thornton, asserting that the report produced an erroneous
inventory on which they relied.
</P>
<P>
   The report, researched by Grant Thornton before their investment
was made, showed that Kozeny possessed just 300,000 ``extra''
options _ those not needed for his own investment.
</P>
<P>
   Dated March 24, 1998, the report was signed by Rolf Hess,
managing partner of the firm's Zurich office. The Grant Thornton
accountant who prepared the report, Ian Bryson, included a chart
dated March 13 that showed there were 10,156,000 extra options,
according to documents filed in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a memo written on June 29, 1998 by another Grant
Thornton accountant, Marlies Nievergelt, noted that in the previous
report ``we only showed 300,000'' extra options ``instead of
approximately 8 million.'' The memo said Kozeny had made $93
million on the option sales.
</P>
<P>
   Kozeny, the memo added, had instructed Nievergelt to ``make sure
that these figures are not being disclosed to anyone outside but
remain for internal use only for the time being.''`
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Hess said the March 24 report he
signed was not an official audit. ``Normally, firms are in trouble
if they sign an audit report that is not correct,'' Hess said.
``But we never acted as auditors, but as accountants and as
bookkeepers.''

   Asked about Bryson's inventory, Hess said: ``I can't comment on
that because I am not aware of any discrepancy. What is really
important is what Grant Thornton officially issued. If people have
internal documents, they might be preliminary and not a final
report.''

TEXAS A&AMP;M UNIVERSITY AWAITS 
WORD ON FUTURE OF BONFIRE

<P>
   HOUSTON _ After six weeks huddling with students, alumni,
parents and others, Texas A&AMP;M University President Ray Bowen is
scheduled Friday to announce the future of his school's most
venerable tradition _ bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   While Bowen has done a seemingly good job of keeping secret his
decision amid intense lobbying, a consensus of bonfire proponents
and opponents are prepared for this year's event to be canceled at
the College Station campus.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, most believe Bowen will appoint a panel to
determine if a safer, cost-effective design and construction
process can be established for future bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   Any subsequent one likely will be significantly smaller than
recent ones, which often exceeded the school-mandated 55-foot
height limit, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A special commission studying the cause of the Nov. 18 bonfire
collapse, which killed 12 and injured 27, determined it fell
because of poor construction techniques, inadequate supervision and
an unstable wedding cake design.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bowen) hasn't told me what he's going to do, but my gut
feeling is that this will be his approach,'' said Texas A&AMP;M Regent
Dionel Aviles of Houston. ``That seems to be what most people
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M chemistry professor Danny Yeager, a longtime bonfire
critic, said he also believed that will be Bowen's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's to the detriment of the university and to the
detriment of the students because it makes Texas A&AMP;M look
foolish,'' Yeager said.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the burning Aggie spirit, the bonfire has grown
from a small trash fire in 1909 into a mammoth timber tower
organized and built each year by students.
</P>
<P>
   If the bonfire is canceled this November, it would be only the
third time since 1909 it did not burn for the school's football
game against cross-state rival, the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, school officials canceled the bonfire in honor of the
slain President Kennedy. Last year, the bonfire was canceled after
the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be disappointed if it didn't occur this year, but we're
not going to erase safety in order to have a tradition,'' said
student government President Forrest Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen took on the one-man task of determining the future of the
bonfire after the special commission presented a report in May
outlining the cause of the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which cost the school $1.8 million, blamed the
entire Texas A&AMP;M culture for tunnel vision that blinded officials
to problems with the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   In making a decision, Bowen must look carefully at the
commission's judgment that the school likely could not adequately
train students to build a safe bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that were possible, it would be too costly to train new
students each year, the report determined.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there will likely have to be a major overhaul of
the entire bonfire process, starting with creating the first
blueprints for the structure if it is to continue. The commission
was critical of the way students passed down the design by word of
mouth each year, allowing for dangerous deviations.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition, Bowen must walk a tight political rope,
balancing safety concerns against intense pressure to continue the
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can get things done for a bonfire this
year,'' Aviles said. ``But you probably can in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the decision, most voiced support of Bowen, who
has said he will use his brain and not his heart to make a final
call.
</P>
<P>
   Students and former students have mounted lobbying efforts to
keep the bonfire burning. More than 8,000 signatures were presented
to university officials by students. The Association of Former
Students sent Bowen a letter urging him to continue some form of
the bonfire.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In yet another reshuffling of his presidential
campaign, Vice President Al Gore announced Thursday that William
Daley, the U.S. secretary of commerce and a shrewd operative in
Democratic politics, would replace the campaign chairman, Tony
Coelho.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, who was hospitalized on Monday night with an inflamed
colon, said he decided to step down on the advice of his doctors,
who urged him to restrict his travel and slow his pace. But many
Democrats said the move was inevitable, given the way Gore's
campaign has struggled in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Daley flew to Lockland, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb, from
Washington to join Gore at a prescheduled campaign event Thursday
afternoon as Gore advisers sought to project a sense of forward
energy and optimism despite the latest upheaval to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He is to visit the Gore headquarters in Nashville next week and
relocate there to become what Gore called a ``full-time, hands-on''
manager. He will leave his Cabinet post on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Coming less than five months before Election Day, the change
seems unlikely to bring any immediate strategic or visible changes
to the campaign. Even so, Daley is taking over at a time when
crucial decisions will have to be made about a running-mate, the
national convention and where to pump the campaign's resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to miss a beat,'' Gore told reporters at a
food warehouse as he announced Daley's appointment, the secretary
at his side.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Daley said of the campaign: ``I don't see any
problems whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley has never run a national campaign. But he is known as a
skilled manager who is highly regarded in Democratic circles, as
well as in the business community. In 1992, he helped the Clinton
campaign navigate the politics of the Midwest, the crucial
battleground for the coming general election. He is a son of the
late Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, who dominated Chicago politics
for two decades, and the brother of current Mayor Richard M. Daley.
</P>
<P>
   While the overhaul was prompted by Coelho's health, several Gore
campaign officials said that in recent weeks the vice president had
recognized that he needed to make changes in his campaign, which
seemed to drift after Gore clinched the Democratic nomination
nearly three months ago. Two people close to the campaign also said
that Gore's wife, Tipper, had expressed concerns about Coelho's
health for the past month or more, wondering whether he was up to
the job.
</P>
<P>
   And while Democrats hoped that the shift would energize the
campaign, it created another unwelcome distraction for Gore and
largely overshadowed his effort to promote the prosperity of the
Clinton years and offer new proposals that take advantage of the
growing budget surplus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Campaigns, generally, are not won or lost by campaign managers.
But Coelho's departure is significant because it reflects how, even
after years of preparation, Gore still has had trouble assembling a
stable inner circle to run his organization.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Gore's opponent, Gov. George W. Bush has maintained
the same tight circle since announcing his candidacy, and Bush's
aides seemed to take delight in the Gore campaign's woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder whether naming a new chairman involves yet another
reinvention of the Gore campaign,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the Bush
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's move also underscores worries among Democrats that
Gore needs to move quickly to energize his campaign as it prepares
for the Democratic National Convention, a time when the vast
majority of voters traditionally begin to pay close attention to
the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transition better be seamless, and it better be fast
because there is no time to lose,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J. ``George Bush is well-funded and well organized and clearly
has developed a sense of momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, of course, may not be Coelho himself, but
the overall health of the Gore campaign. ``If anyone understands
that you live or die by the sword it is Coelho,'' said Rep. Luis
Gutierrez, a Democrat from Chicago. ``He's a consummate politician.
I'm sure he left for two reasons: He's genuinely sick and he
understands there are genuine problems with the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to Coelho and Gore said the two never worked well
together, and that the vice president was increasingly bypassing
him and turning to other advisers like Carter Eskew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony and Al Gore never really liked each other,'' said a top
Democratic official who knows Coelho well. ``There's little mutual
respect and no affection. They're very different people.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gore named Coelho his campaign chairman in May 1999, the
campaign was beset by overspending, and many Democrats credit him
for cutting costs and successfully steering through a treacherous
series of primary contests.
</P>
<P>
   But other one-time allies said that his controlling personality
had led him to reach into virtually every aspect of the campaign
and that an abrasive manner had alienated many of those with whom
he worked, including Donna Brazile, the campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said, federal investigations into his past
financial activities created even more problems. For example, one
Gore ally said, Coelho could not be an effective spokesman for the
vice president because he declined to appear on television, largely
out of concern that he might be questioned about the federal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   While most of his problems were internal within the campaign,
Coelho also took the blame for one of Gore's biggest political
fiascos, his call for Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban
castaway, to be given permanent residence in the United States, a
position that put him at odds with President Clinton and others in
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore said today that he had expected Coelho to last
through November, if not for his health problems. And he said he
was not concerned ``in the least'' that the investigations of
Coelho would have undermined the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Coelho has had less of a role in running the
daily operation, as Tad Devine, one of Gore's top consultants, had
been shifted to a more central role at the campaign headquarters in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The news was delivered at campaign headquarters this morning,
and was not unwelcome. ``If you're in the doldrums, you need a
cathartic event to turn things around,'' said one adviser. ``Our
biggest challenge at this point is to stay disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Coelho acknowledged there had been
mistakes, particularly that the campaign allowed Gore to become
enmeshed in the Gonzalez case. But Coelho also said he brought
discipline and order to the campaign _ and stepped in so the vice
president did not have to make all the decisions. Asked if Gore was
a micro-manager in the mold of President Jimmy Carter before Coelho
took over, he said, ``I think he probably was. People said he did.
But since I've been on board, he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many inside the campaign and out perceived the illness as a
convenient cover for Gore to ease Coelho to the sidelines after a
somewhat tumultuous year-long reign.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat who works closely with the campaign said that while
Coelho's health concerns were ``legitimate,'' they also made for
``a very convenient'' excuse for Coelho to depart.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Coelho, who turned 58 Thursday, said the move came
strictly for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The call I made to the vice president last night informing him
of my doctor's advice is one of the most difficult calls I have
ever had to make,'' he said in a statement released by Gore
headquarters in Nashville. ``My doctors have told me that I need to
slow down, eat better and travel less for a period of time.
Unfortunately, none of this advice is consistent with the rigors of
chairing a presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Two people close to Coelho, who has epilepsy, said he had
suffered several seizures recently.
</P>
<P>
   Daley had been under consideration as a running mate for Gore.
But Gore said in an interview Thursday night that he removed Daley
from consideration because ``it is not possible to be a full-time
hands-on campaign manager all the way through the election and also
be a vice presidential running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has such confidence in Daley that he has offered him the
post in the first place before he turned to Coelho. Daley, who has
been commerce secretary since January 1997, resisted the
entreaties, saying he had not been in office long enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Thursday that Daley sprang to mind Wednesday night
immediately after he spoke with Coelho. Coelho had called Gore, who
was attending a fund-raising dinner in New York, about 11 p.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that after talking with Coelho, he talked with Frank
Hunger, his brother-in-law, who was with him in New York, and
called Mrs. Gore, who was campaigning in Florida. He said he then
called Daley in Washington after midnight, waking him up. Gore and
Daley said that neither of them had notified President Clinton
until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took his commerce secretary away before I told him,'' Gore
said, adding that he called the president Thursday morning.

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS - It's no longer a question of whether they'll win
the NBA championship or even when they'll win it. It's a question
of how.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it ends tonight, Monday or Wednesday, the story of the
1999-2000 Lakers deserves a great tagline.
</P>
<P>
   How should it end?
</P>
<P>
   It should end with one more Kobe Bryant lob pass and Shaquille
O'Neal dunk, symbolizing the two stars' synthesis, reliving the
signature moment of the classic comeback against Portland, bridging
the 12 years between this Lakers team and the Showtime champions
who gave us the Coop-a-Loop.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Robert Horry flying past three bigger
opponents to grab one more rebound and lay it in the basket.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Ron Harper driving for a textbook layup past
a guard who's 10 years younger and a step quicker.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Rick Fox luring one more opponent into a
charging foul, goading one more opponent into a shoving match,
giving one more referee a ``who, me?'' look.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Derek Fisher diving for one more loose ball,
leaving one more layer of skin on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Brian Shaw flinging in one more 3-pointer -
off the backboard for comic effect.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with John Salley dispensing one more one-liner,
matching his points-per-game average.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with the Lakers falling behind early, then
catching up and going ahead, then flinching at prosperity and
falling behind again.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Phil Jackson sitting calmly on the bench,
refusing to call time out, as his team gives up 20 points in a row
to make every other Lakers partisan break out in a cold sweat.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Glen Rice sitting next to Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with the Lakers on the court figuring out for
themselves what's going wrong and correcting the problem in the
nick of time.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Bryant breaking a leg in the first quarter
and scoring 20 points in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with an opponent causing injury by committing a
``flagrant'' foul against O'Neal - the injury to the opponent, not
Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with O'Neal sinking a free throw with seconds on
the clock to give the Lakers the winning point - after missing nine
in a row to make that necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Jerry West in hiding, too nervous to watch
the NBA Finals in person or on television, emerging only after
receiving the good news from a carrier pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Roy Firestone phoning to ask West, ``Who
won?''
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Jackson saying he's close to figuring this
team out.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Christina Fernandez Rice calling a press
conference to announce her husband Glen is trying free agency and
to charge that Jackson is to blame for the Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Dennis Rodman watching in a bar, Nick Van
Exel watching in Cancun, Kurt Rambis watching from the press table,
Del Harris reading the result off the stat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Jerry Buss celebrating with a girl and a
bottle of wine - the wine old enough to be the girl's mother.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with David Stern conducting the trophy
presentation on a satellite hookup from a WNBA game.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with Chick Hearn signing a contract extension to
keep him behind the Lakers microphone through the 2010 season or
through his 100th birthday, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   It should end with A.C. Green issuing one last warning against
proclaiming Shaq the new Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe the new Michael
Jordan or the 2000 Lakers the equals of the 1980s Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should end in a blowout. But we've always liked to prolong
things, to go down to the seventh game, and win in the fourth
quarter,'' Green said Thursday, as the Lakers, up 3-1 in the
best-of-seven-game series, pondered the possibility of an
uncharacteristically quick wrapup. ``As long as we win in the end,
I don't care if we kick the ball in (the basket).''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should just (begin ital)happen(end ital),'' Fisher said.
``I think for this basketball team, that's how it's been all year,
it's just happened. It hasn't been predetermined, it hasn't been
planned out, it hasn't been one guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can write a script for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   If I could write a script, the final act would be the lob.
Bryant driving, O'Neal spinning around an overaggressive defender,
Kobe catching O'Neal's eye, Kobe throwing it up, Shaq throwing it
down. The sudden blend of the fundamental and the spectacular.
Summing up the season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, summing up the playoffs, we might have to wait till
Game 7 for them to get it right.

IN DEATH ROW DISPUTE, A WITNESS STANDS FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: a Washington-datelined folo is attached) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nineteen years ago, Bernadine Skillern caught a quick
glimpse of a man who had just committed a nighttime murder in a
grocery store parking lot. She identified him in court as Gary
Graham in testimony so strong that, despite almost no other
evidence, a jury found him guilty and later sentenced him to death.
</P>
<P>
   With Graham scheduled to die next Thursday and death penalty
opponents mounting an all-out effort to stop his execution,
Skillern testified again Thursday, this time in the court of public
opinion. Again and again at an hourlong news conference, Skillern
repeated her unwavering belief that Graham was the man she had seen
shoot Bobby Lambert outside a Safeway supermarket in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Graham shoot and kill Lambert on that parking lot in
1981,'' said Skillern, 53. ``That has not changed. That is not
going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Skillern's emotional but unflinching appearance was a pointed
rebuttal in a public relations battle that, until now, has been
dominated by advocates for Graham.
</P>
<P>
   With protests planned in Texas for next week, the Graham case is
attracting national attention and creating a political headache for
Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee who has staunchly defended capital punishment in his state
despite growing outside criticism focusing on, among other issues,
the quality of legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's advocates say his original trial was a travesty: His
court-appointed lawyer, Ronald G. Mock, conducted virtually no
investigation of the case and put on new witnesses during the guilt
phase of the trial. Ballistics tests showed that a .22-caliber
revolver taken from Graham after his arrest did not match the
murder weapon. Two other witnesses who could have contradicted
Skillern's story were never called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other case that has more doubts of innocence today
than this man right here,'' said Lawrence C. Marshall, legal
director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern
University, which has helped exonerate nine death row inmates in
Illinois and has taken on the Graham case.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting before a bank of television cameras at a conference
table Thursday morning, Skillern said she decided to speak out
because of ``misinformation'' about the case in the news media. On
the night of May 13, 1981, when she witnessed the murder, Skillern
said, she waited in her car with her two youngest daughters, then
nine and five, as her 14-year-old daughter shopped inside the
Safeway. It was about 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   According to the trial transcript, Skillern testified that she
saw Graham ``off and on about 60 seconds, maybe a little longer.''
She told the jury she saw the side of his face, then she blew her
horn, at which point she looked directly at his face for ``a split
second, maybe a second.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, she repeated roughly the same story, saying that she
saw his face from different angles three or four times over a
period of 90 seconds. Looking through her windshield, she said, she
looked directly into his face when he walked in front of her
headlights, about a car distance away. She honked her horn, she
said, because she wanted to stop him from shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Don't! Don't shoot,''' recalled Skillern, who held
her news conference in the office of her spokesman, Rusty Hardin, a
former state prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier in the week, Graham's advocates
praised Skillern's sincerity but raised questions about the
reliability of eyewitness testimony in general, particularly in the
absence of other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Thompson, a rape victim from North Carolina, told of
identifying her attacker, who was convicted and sentenced to
prison, only to later discover from DNA evidence that she had
identified the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   So certain was she of her initial identification that when she
was later shown a photograph of the real assailant, she said it was
not him. (He was ultimately convicted, based on DNA evidence.)
</P>
<P>
   Graham's advocates have suggested that detectives steered
Skillern toward identifying Graham by manipulating mug shots and
the subsequent lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But Skillern disputed any suggestion that she had been unduly
influenced. She said that she had picked out Graham's mug shot, but
that she had wanted to see him in person to confirm her belief that
he was the killer. When she saw him in the lineup the next day, she
said, she shuddered with fear, not realizing that he could not see
her behind a glass wall.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles will vote on
whether to commute Graham's sentence or go forward with the
execution. In 1993, the Board voted against commutation but
then-Gov. Ann Richards granted Gray a 30-day stay of execution that
led to his case being re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who did plead guilty to a string of armed robberies, was
17 at the time of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Graham has already received one stay sets up a
tricky legal situation. Under Texas law, a governor is only allowed
to grant an inmate one stay of execution.
</P>
<P>
   As is his custom, Bush has remained silent about the Graham
case, but a campaign aide said the governor's legal advisers
believe that under the law Bush cannot grant a stay. Advocates for
Graham say the law could be interpreted to mean one stay per
governor, but they say commutation or a conditional pardon, which
can occur only with the parole board's blessing, to allow a new
trial is their real goal.
</P>
<P>
   Skillern has not spoken publicly about the case since Graham was
nearly executed in 1993. She said her testimony has altered her
life. She quit her job as an elementary school secretary because of
controversy from the trial, though she now works as a secretary in
a local school district. She said she has received death threats
and harassing telephone calls. But, she said, she has never changed
her mind about what she saw that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sure,'' she said. ``There's never been a doubt in my
mind. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEFENSE PURSUES HITMAN THEORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Graham's lawyers are pursuing a theory that the man
he was convicted of killing, Bobby Lambert, was actually murdered
by a hit man.
</P>
<P>
   Federal court records indicate that Lambert had been arrested in
Oklahoma City in August 1980 on charges of drug smuggling. Federal
officials had subpoenaed him in hopes that he would testify against
higher-ups in the alleged drug operation.
</P>
<P>
   Just prior to his murder, Lambert had been seen inside a grocery
store with a thick wad of bills. ``We thought he was killed for his
money, said Steve Beck, the head Drug Enforcement Administration
agent in Oklahoma City at the time of the murder, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But police found $6,000 in cash in Lambert's back pocket after
his killer fled. ``That makes it seem rather strange to me, that it
was a robbery,'' Beck, now a private investigator, said in a
telephone interview. ``That does cast a rather funny connection on
the shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston district attorney has dismissed the possibility of a
hitman as ``pure speculation.''

GOP FOLLOWS `SCRIPT' ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas., Va., Md., Okla., Pa.)   (Political Analysis) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans, warned by one of their pollsters
that the prescription drug issue could cost them their majority in
November, are following his script for defusing the issue almost
word for word.
</P>
<P>
   A memorandum from the pollster, distributed to the Republicans
at their caucus last week, suggested ``phrases that work'' on the
issue, including: ``Too many senior citizens are forced to choose
between putting food on the table and being able to afford the
prescription drugs they need to stay alive. In our great nation,
this is morally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, announcing the Republican drug plan for
government-approved and subsidized private insurance plans, Speaker
Dennis Hastert said: ``In fact, too many senior citizens and
disabled Americans are forced to choose between putting food on the
table and being able to afford the prescription drugs they need to
stay alive. In our great nation, this is morally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At a House hearing that day, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, chairman
of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, ``I really hope we can
proceed on this very, very important issue without turning it into
a political issue.'' The Republican leadership wants the bill voted
on before the July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   But five days earlier, Glen Bolger, a pollster with Public
Opinion Strategies, a Virginia firm, warned the House Republican
Conference that the prescription drug issue was a political problem
for Republicans. While the GOP has strong messages on other
important issues aside from drugs, ``Democrats enjoy a huge generic
advantage as the party best perceived as being able to handle this
issue,'' Bolger's memo said.
</P>
<P>
   However the issue may affect congressional candidates,
prescription drugs were the subject last week of Vice President Al
Gore's first national television commercial, which portrayed the
prospective presidential nominee as ``fighting for a prescription
drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolger advised the Republican House members in the memorandum
that the issue was ``very important'' to swing voters, including
``rural residents, rural women, white women, South residents, New
England residents, women, working women, homemakers, age 55-64, age
65 plus, women 18-34, 60-plus retired women.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited polls by others showing that only 20 percent of
Americans felt Republicans would do a better job ``helping elderly
Americans get access to affordable prescription drugs,'' while 53
percent said Democrats would do better. Based on focus groups he
conducted for the National Republican Congressional Committee,
Bolger said that people felt ``Republicans aren't doing anything
for seniors'' and that ``upset seniors don't believe politicians
(especially Republicans) understand how important and concerning
this issue is to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered the advice, ``It is more important to communicate
that you have a plan as it is to communicate what is in the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The pollster warned Republicans to beware of and answer
potential Democratic attacks like: ``Republicans are in the back
pocket of HMOs, insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies.
Republicans are out to protect the special interests, not the real
interests of senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority
leader who had a copy of Bolger's material, said at the White
House, ``The House Republicans have cynically cloaked in
pollster-provided rhetoric a prescription drug plan that benefits
insurance and drug companies far more than it benefits seniors
without drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of Bolger's advice dealt with how to sell the issue,
and his clients were plainly listening or reading.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested Republicans say of their plan, ``By making it
available to everyone, we're making sure that no senior citizen or
disabled American falls through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Rep. Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland told the House:
``By providing prescription drug coverage for everyone, Republicans
want to make sure that no senior citizen or disabled American falls
through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolger's memorandum said ``seniors like the idea of a voluntary
plan'' and repeatedly urged Republicans to stress that their scheme
was ``affordable.'' Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, chairman of
the Republican caucus, told the House: ``Our plan is voluntary. It
is also affordable and available to all.'' Rep. Sam Johnson of
Texas said the Republican plan provided ``coverage for all, and it
is coverage that will be affordable and available for all
seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bartlett, Watts, Johnson and Curt Weldon of
Pennsylvania all cited the food versus prescription drugs dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   But no one followed the Bolger script more earnestly than
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Bolger suggested, ``Our plan protects low-income seniors by
giving them prescription drug coverage, and offers ALL other
seniors a number of affordable options to best meet their needs and
protect them from financial ruin.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said: ``Our plan not only protects low-income seniors
who lack prescription drug coverage, it also offers ALL others a
number of affordable options to best meet their needs and protect
them from financial ruin.''
</P>
<P>
   The pollster wrote: ``A stronger Medicare with prescription drug
coverage is a promise of health security and financial security for
older Americans, and we're working to ensure that promise is kept.
America's senior deserve no less.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said: ``Strengthening Medicare and providing
prescription drug coverage is a promise of health security and
financial security for older Americans, and we're working to ensure
that promise is kept. Our senior citizens and disabled Americans
deserve no less.''`
</P>
<P>
   Bolger said Thursday afternoon that he was happy to see that his
advice was being taken.

LAKERS TRY TO STAY FOCUSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS - Last fall, Phil Jackson demurred, and a few
months later, he took the hem-and-haw approach. Then he delayed and
pondered and occasionally nodded with a smile, but each time he
skillfully avoided the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Lakers championship material? Their first-year coach
never was ready to make that proclamation - not after sweeping road
trips, nor after beating the league's best teams on their home
courts, nor after a trio of double-digit winning streaks.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)They're growing. They're making me believe.(end
ital) But never a plain, old, (begin ital)Yes, they could win it
all.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Now the Lakers need just one more victory over the Indiana
Pacers to claim their first NBA championship in 12 years. They can
get it as soon as tonight, in Game 5 of the Finals at Conseco
Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The coach can't undersell them anymore, just appreciate how far
they have come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've been waiting for the, you know, 'aha!' light to go
on in this team for some time, and it comes and goes,'' Jackson
said Thursday, a day after the Lakers' overtime win in Game 4.
``That's one of the reasons I felt that this was premature to kind
of expect anything of that nature yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain sense or a certain nature about a team when
they identify their opponent, they identify their defense, that
they're giving them the understanding offensively what they have to
do. That they get that instinct of how to do it. And it becomes a
matter of putting a puzzle together in a different way, a different
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Reshuffle the pieces and the Lakers have found new ways to
succeed. They won Game 2 of the Finals with Kobe Bryant injured,
took Game 4 with Bryant hobbled and Shaquille O'Neal having fouled
out.
</P>
<P>
   The championship is not yet theirs but certainly close. And the
Lakers are starting to feel the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really thinking about it, but I'm trying not to think
about it that much,'' said O'Neal, trying to follow his first MVP
award with his first ring, at age 28. ``We still have to win one
game. I don't want to get too amped up. We're going to be very
prepared (for Game 5), we're going to be loose. My guys are going
to be loose.... I'm sure if we get the win, I'm sure all the
emotions will probably come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, they already are seeping out. That giddy hug
O'Neal gave Bryant after Wednesday night's win. The relaxed poses
on the practice court Thursday. The satisfied smiles all around.
</P>
<P>
   Like kids ready to pounce on a new toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to feel like that a little bit,'' said Brian
Shaw, eyeing his first ring after 11 pro seasons with seven teams.
``We are all excited about the fact that we only have to win one
more game to close the series out and be crowned champions. You see
everyone a little more relaxed and having fun today.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the veterans of past championships - A.C. Green, Ron
Harper, Robert Horry and John Salley - are trying hard to remind
their teammates that there is still work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough, because you start losing your focus and your
concentration,'' said Green, who won titles with the Lakers in 1987
and '88. ``But it's up to the guys on the team and the coaches to
put everybody on the same page. I mean, you can't start sizing your
finger up and wondering, what am I going to do next week? All that
kind of stuff is celebration. This is still a business trip for us
and that's the message I've been trying to give to the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   To lose the championship, the Lakers would have to lose three
straight games. They haven't all season and don't appear ready to
start any new bad habits. But the Pacers have been competitive in
this series and as a veteran team doesn't seem likely to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   So Harper, who won three championships with Jackson's Chicago
Bulls, had a simple message for his teammates: ``The only thing I
told them is get some sleep, because it ain't going to be easy....
You have to earn the ring.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Across the bloody fields of Scotland, in the land
where the stage smoke swirls and the synthesizers scream like
banshees, strides a faceless figure in black, thudding along in
thick, corpse-kicking boots. Who is this masked man, speaking so
portentously about how ``foul and fair'' his day has been? At last
he raises the gleaming vizard of his helmet, and there, behold, is
a most familiar wide-browed visage: hey, it's one of America's most
popular television stars, and, boy, does he look as if he means
business.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the nearly anonymous entrance of Kelsey Grammer in the
blunt-witted new production of ``Macbeth'' that opened Thursday
night at the Music Box Theater under the direction of Terry Hands.
There seem to be at least two quite legitimate reasons for this
semi-incognito first appearance in the tragedy's title role by
Grammer, who is best known as the charmingly ineffectual shrink on
the hit sitcom ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it forestalls that disruptive shock of
recognition that might prompt some rowdy theatergoer to yell out,
``Where's Niles?,'' in reference to Frasier's television brother.
It allows the actor's voice, most un-Frasier-like here as it
solemnly intones Macbeth's opening lines, to introduce his
character without prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, in a play replete with images of dissembling _ in
which people must ``make our faces vizards,'' in Macbeth's words _
introducing the ambitious Thane under wraps makes thematic sense.
As Lady Macbeth (played here by Diane Venora) famously chastises
her vacillating husband, his face ``is a book'' that is all too
easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's what the script says, anyway. To tell the truth,
Grammer unmasked isn't that much more illuminating than he is with
his visor down. It's not that he is crippled by his high Q rating.
You don't think, ``Hey, look at old Frasier up there.'' On the
other hand, you never for a second think that a complicated,
conflicted character named Macbeth is up on the stage either, just
an actor speaking lines in a melodious bass voice.
</P>
<P>
   Grammer is by no means ill at ease with Shakespearean speech.
(He understudied the role of Macbeth in the ill-starred Vivian
Beaumont production of 1981 and received good notices for his
Cassio in the 1982 James Earl Jones-Christopher Plummer
``Othello.'') But he seems to have based his performance largely on
the first words of Hamlet's advice to the traveling players _
``Speak the speech, I pray you'' _ and then stopped right there.
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said of most of this production, in which
crisp, even violent enunciation is the dominant characteristic.
This is, after all, a ``Macbeth'' in which ``Lay on, Macduff'' is
delivered not to Macduff but to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Who says they don't do Shakespeare like they used to? Hands'
staging of the canon's most compact and fastest-moving tragedy
suggests what the barnstorming American companies of the 19th
century must have been like: potboiler productions emphasizing
melodrama over psychology, with a lot of stately actors planting
themselves like trees at the edge of the stage and declaiming
fiercely and nobly.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hands, whose 1984 Broadway productions of ``Cyrano de
Bergerac'' and ``All's Well That Ends Well'' for the Royal
Shakespeare Company are still fondly remembered, neglects more
contemporary touches. He and his designer, Timothy O'Brien, have
conceived this production in chic, spare basic black, from the
walls of the bare-bones set to the stark, funereal costumes that
would blend in easily at any Chelsea opening.
</P>
<P>
   Another nod to more recent vintages of ``Macbeth'' is evident in
those sinister muses, the three witches (Myra Lucretia Taylor,
Starla Benford and Kelly Hutchinson), who again show up as
battlefield scavengers, Mother Courage types gone toxic. (This is,
for the record, at least the third such variation on this idea that
I have seen.) They are, however, exceptionally loud and declamatory
witches, in keeping with the evening's overall tone.
</P>
<P>
   Hands' general intent appears to have been to present
``Macbeth'' as straightforwardly as possible, letting the ever
compelling story carry the audience along. Yet somehow this
streamlined, intermissionless version, which weighs in under two
hours, has a plodding quality that matches the lumbering and
circular steps with which the actors have been encouraged to move.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this lethargy has to do with an overriding
literal-mindedness. The sensibility comes across in the
radio-play-style sound effects by Tom Morse. (When someone says,
``I hear horses,'' there is an immediate obliging clip-clop.) The
same attitude surfaces more annoyingly in the annotative gestures
of the acting. When Macbeth begs the earth not to hear his
traitorous footsteps, he touches the ground; when he refers to the
contents of his wife's heart, he touches his chest; when he wonders
if that's a dagger he sees before him, he squints.
</P>
<P>
   Grammer basically has two gears here _ amoral, confident Macbeth
and tender, contrite Macbeth _ and he has pretty much worn them out
by the end of his second monologue. He also has a tendency,
especially with Venora, to jump with both feet from one mood into
the other, disregarding any steps between.
</P>
<P>
   Venora, a glamorous Shakespeare veteran who appears to better
advantage as Gertrude in the current Ian Schraeger-style film
version of ``Hamlet,'' at least conveys feelings of vicious
ambition and disgusted horror in the same instant. But she casts
her ambivalence with operatic grandeur and, like Grammer, she
sounds all her notes early on.
</P>
<P>
   In their scenes together, as they jerk abruptly between rage and
sorrow, contempt and affection, these Macbeths bring to mind Faye
Dunaway in ``Chinatown,'' turning her face from side to side and
repeating, ``She's my sister, she's my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   They do, however, provide one electric moment. That's when
Macbeth, having ``discovered'' the body of Duncan, describes the
mutilated king in sensory detail to a horrified crowd while staring
his wife hard in the eyes. It's a private coded declaration in a
public situation. ``See what you've made me do,'' he seems to be
saying. And it fully justifies Lady Macbeth's fainting in the next
moment.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the truth, though, this was the only scene in the entire
production that made me sit up straight and prick up my ears. The
rest of the evening holds no surprises. No one else in the cast
stands out, particularly, as being horribly embarrassing or
wonderfully inspiring. As a result, a work that traditionally
gallops off the page here does indeed creep in a petty pace from
scene to scene.

REPORT TARGETS DRUG OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An independent review of the White House drug
czar's office has found an understaffed and troubled bureaucracy
led by a director who is a ``high-pressure and military-oriented''
leader, driving many career professionals to quit.
</P>
<P>
   A 53-page report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, obtained by the
Boston Globe, was mandated by a House and Senate conference
committee, which was concerned about reports of problems in
employee retention and the management style at the Office of
National Drug Control Policy. The General Accounting Office is
overseeing the $125,000 report, which is ``still a work in
progress,'' a GAO official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A final report could be issued next week and would include
comment from the drug control office. The House and Senate asked
for an outside review to underscore the appearance of impartiality
in investigating part of the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   The report positively noted that the office has set clear goals
for reduced drug use around the country and is ``results-oriented
and effective in performing its responsibilities externally.'' It
called the organization ``generally sophisticated'' in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   But even with clearly defined goals, the office's own strategy
report issued this year found that it has come up short in the most
important measuring sticks of America's war on drugs. This year's
report found a record level of drug-related deaths in America and
some of the lowest prices ever for cocaine and heroin on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   The PricewaterhouseCooper review of the office's troubled inner
workings is at odds with the public face of its often-charming and
articulate director, Barry R. McCaffrey, who spends 54 percent of
his non-office time involved in media events _ making an estimated
386 public appearances a year, the report noted. In contrast, he
spends 43 percent of his time in policy-related matters.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent interviews, more than a dozen past and current
office workers have told the Globe that McCaffrey runs the
organization with the firm hand of the four-star army general that
he once was, causing morale among many to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The report also follows a lengthy New Yorker magazine story
sharply critical of McCaffrey's role in the Gulf War. The article,
written by Seymour Hersh, quotes by name several people who served
under McCaffrey's command saying that he unnecessarily attacked
fleeing Iraqi soldiers, killing an unknown number. McCaffrey has
vigorously denied any wrongdoing, saying Iraqi troops first fired
on his soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Pancho Kinney, the office's director of strategy, declined to
comment Thursday on the PricewaterhouseCoopers report. ``We would
be happy to comment on it once it is finalized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors, who based their conclusions on office
documents and interviews with 25 named employees with the office,
found it took the equivalent of 20 full-time workers to manage
McCaffrey's schedule, about one-seventh of the total office staff.
</P>
<P>
   In a section titled, ``Leadership Style: `He's difficult to work
for,'' _ an often-heard comment from staff members _ the report's
authors said McCaffrey's ``leadership style has been described as
aggressive, high-pressure, and military-oriented. Under the current
directorship, a military structure has been imposed on a previously
civilian culture. As incompatibilities have developed, people have
made the decision to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also said: ``The leadership is focused on `the
mission and the budget,' with little attention given directly to
the organization's people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the office experienced a turnover rate of 27 percent.
This year, the report estimated that turnover could increase to 38
percent, a reflection somewhat of the high number of political
appointments expected to leave after this fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey, a Boston area native, also has been unable to
consistently fill his deputy director posts, which have been vacant
73 percent of his four-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has often used acting deputy directors, which the
report noted ``serve at the pleasure of the director, but confirmed
deputy directors (by Congress) can only be dismissed by the
President or impeached by Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most bothersome aspects of the office's internal
workings, the report said, was the strong possibility of a loss of
continuity when McCaffrey leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   It said the ``authority and institutional knowledge are
concentrated centrally with the current director and . . . the
knowledge base appears to be weakened and vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that if McCaffrey had deputy directors in place,
``there would be less risk to the overall continuity and long-term
benefit of the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of deputy directors forecast by the end of the year,
when McCaffrey is expected to step down:
</P>
<P>
   ``Zero,'' the report said.

become a nation of peeping Toms. We like to watch, and we
especially like to watch real people in dangerous, pathetic,
embarrassing or scandalous situations. Of course, television by its
definition is voyeuristic, as are other forms of dramatic
entertainment. The audience sits and watches. Theatergoers watch
actors on a stage, who pretend nobody's watching. Movies take it a
step further, with the action tossed up on a huge screen in front
of an audience sitting in the dark. But television has that added
element of privacy that takes voyeurism to another level. If you're
watching something awful, nobody has to know. (Cox News Service

<HEADLINE>
FBI, US ATTORNEY BEGIN CRIMINAL PROBE OF `BIG DIG' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY AND THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The FBI and the US Attorney's office have opened a
criminal investigation into the ``Big Dig,'' sources familiar with
the probe said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After nine years of construction and three months of management
turmoil, law enforcement investigators are asking questions about
the massive cost increases that the now-$13.6 billion highway
renovation project has required since it began in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know who knew what, when,'' said one Central
Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel project official, who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents have interviewed at least two employees in the
Cambridge office of the Federal Highway Administration, according
to sources familiar with that office.
</P>
<P>
   The specific nature of the investigation could not be learned,
and it is apparently in the early stages. Officials for the FBI and
the US Attorneys office said they could neither confirm nor deny
the existence of any probe.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Landolfi, a spokesman for Turnpike chairman Andrew S.
Natsios, said he was unaware of a criminal investigation into the
Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is apparently not directly related to a civil
probe of the Big Dig's controversial insurance program, which is
being conducted in the office of US Attorney Donald Stern.
</P>
<P>
   It is also separate from a Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission
investigation concerning what Big Dig and state officials told Wall
Street about the financial condition of the project before
Massachusetts borrowed millions of dollars in the bond market late
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Said Landolfi, ``We are continuing to cooperate completely with
the US Justice Department investigation into the insurance
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides that and the SEC investigation, he said, ``We have not
been contacted by anyone else regarding criminal matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Dig officials made a sudden announcement on Feb. 1 that the
project would cost $1.4 billion more than expected. For six years,
Massachusetts Turnpike Authority Chairman James J. Kerasiotes, who
had overseen the project, had insisted that $10.8 billion would be
the final price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Federal transportation officials were furious about the
announcement of the cost increase, which took them by surprise only
hours after they had approved the state's Big Dig finance plan _
which did not reflect the whopping $1.4 billion jump in cost.
</P>
<P>
   The cost increase has since been adjusted to about $2 billion.
In its conceptual stages in the mid-1980s, the project carried a
cost estimate of only about $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The recent large cost increase surprised even officials in the
Federal Highway Adminstration office in Cambridge, which is both a
monitor and a partner in the highway, bridge, and tunnel project.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Markle, Massachusetts division administrator, was
reassigned by his superiors in Washington as a result of the
unexpected cost overrun. And, following a scathing Federal Highway
audit that charged Massachusetts officials with deceiving
Washington about the true cost of the project, Governor Paul
Cellucci fired Kerasiotes in April.
</P>
<P>
   The task force that audited the Big Dig concluded that ``senior
management of the Central Artery project had sufficient evidence of
the potential $1.4 billion cost overrun. The Central Artery project
officials deliberately, however, chose to withhold that
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after federal officials questioned Big Dig officials'
continuing insistence that the project would not cost more than
$10.8 billion, project director Patrick M. Moynihan wrote a letter
rejecting suggestions that costs were being underestimated, and
suggesting that the federal officials did not understand the
project's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to an estimate by the US Department of Transportation
inspector general's office last fall that construction costs could
soar an additional $942 million, Moynihan accused the federal
watchdogs of committing ``factual errors, misstatements, and
misleading calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet only about three months later he and his boss, pressed by
the Secretary of Administration &AMP; Finance, acknowledged the $1.5
billion increase.

   (NYT16) UNDATED -- June 15, 2000 -- VOYEUR-TV-COX -- We've
become a nation of peeping Toms. We like to watch, and we
especially like to watch real people in dangerous, pathetic,
embarrassing or scandalous situations. Of course, television by its
definition is voyeuristic, as are other forms of dramatic
entertainment. The audience sits and watches. Theatergoers watch
actors on a stage, who pretend nobody's watching. Movies take it a
step further, with the action tossed up on a huge screen in front
of an audience sitting in the dark. But television has that added
element of privacy that takes voyeurism to another level. If you're
watching something awful, nobody has to know. (Cox News Service

presidential election is already being called the cleanest and most
competitive in this country's tarnished electoral history. The
election is indeed expected to be tight. This is the first race
since 1929 that Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, faces the real possibility of losing the presidency.
Vicente Fox, an opposition presidential candidate, at a recent
campaign parade, who has mounted a strong challenge against
Mexico's ruling party, says he trusts the Mexico's elections
institute ``but it is not in control of the whole process.''

DALEY REPLACES COELHO AS HEAD 
OF GORE'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 

</HEADLINE>
 SHAKE-UP-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
LOCKLAND, Ohio _ As his campaign struggles to regain its footing,
Al Gore announced Thursday that Commerce Secretary William Daley, a
member of the prominent Chicago political dynasty, will chair his
presidential campaign.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daley, 51, will replace Tony Coelho, the hard-driving and
sometimes controversial political operative who informed Gore late
Wednesday that he was resigning for health reasons. Coelho entered
the hospital earlier this week with an inflamed colon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Daley has done an outstanding job as secretary of
commerce. He has done an outstanding job in everything he has put
his hand to,'' said Gore, as he introduced his new chairman during
a hastily called news conference after a campaign event in suburban
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, who flew to Ohio to meet the vice president after
accepting the job early Thursday, takes the helm of a bumpy
campaign that has made several transformations in an effort to win
over voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is about leadership. It is about setting the
tone for the new century,'' said Daley, who will move next month to
Nashville, Tenn., where the campaign is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Daley faces a number of challenges, including calming nervous
Democrats who have watched Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican candidate, successfully move to the ideological center
over the last two months while Gore appeared largely reactive and
unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   The new chairman will also be responsible for ensuring that the
Democratic Convention in Los Angeles in August runs smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Daley and Gore said they did not consult President Clinton
before they made their decision, but called him later. It is not
clear whether the president will name a new commerce secretary with
just over six months left before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he does not expect Daley to take the campaign in a
different direction, even though the vice president has lost some
ground against Bush since the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to miss a beat,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said the shake-up had nothing to do with
ethical problems that have dogged Coelho, who is being investigated
by the State Department for alleged abuses while he headed the U.S.
mission to the 1998 World Expo in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that the stress of the campaign had aggravated
Coelho's health problems, which also included three epileptic
seizures this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a wonderful chair and he's a wonderful friend and I
wish him well,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded with both sympathy and skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish Coelho well and hope his health improves,'' said Bush
spokeswoman Karen Hughes. ``I wonder whether naming a new chairman
involves yet another reinvention of the Gore campaign. Which vice
president will campaign next week?''
</P>
<P>
   The leadership changes came as the vice president spent the
third day of his ``progress and prosperity'' tour in Ohio
announcing an expansion of his tax cut proposals, made possible by
the growing surplus. Gore said he will propose $500 billion in tax
cuts over 10 years, up from $350 billion in reductions that he
unveiled last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said Gore was merely
following the Texas governor's lead in advocating tax cuts. Bush
has advocated tax cuts of about $1.3 trillion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The staff changes clearly overshadowed the tour theme, which is
intended to highlight the economic progress during the current
administration and the vice president's plans for using the bulging
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, the son of the late Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and
the brother of that city's current mayor, Richard M. Daley, is
considered a shrewd political operator. He led the Clinton
administration's efforts to pass a number of trade agreements,
including the North American Free Trade Agreement and recent China
trade pact.
</P>
<P>
   That could prove a sticking point in Gore's efforts to woo
organized labor, which largely opposed the agreements. Gore made a
point Thursday of calling John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO,
to inform him of the change.
</P>
<P>
   Named by Clinton to head the Commerce Department in 1996, Daley
has forged close relationships with business and was considered
part of the president's inner circle.

FOX: LAKERS SHOULD LEARN FROM PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS - They have passed nearly every test, and for their
Finals exam, the Lakers get a simple yes-or-no question: Have they
learned to throw the knockout punch?
</P>
<P>
   They hold a 3-1 lead over the Indiana Pacers, and have their
first chance to win the championship tonight in Game 5 at Conseco
Fieldhouse. But the Lakers have yet to close out a series on their
first try.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't proved we've learned anything yet,'' Rick Fox said.
``We've been known to let teams back into a series, so we'd like to
put that to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento came back from a 2-0 deficit and pushed their
best-of-five series to a fifth game. Phoenix went down 3-0, but the
Lakers could not sweep. They took a 3-1 lead on Portland and needed
three more games to win the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the Lakers 3-5 in elimination games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team is never out of a series until you put them away,'' Fox
said. ``We saw a Portland team down 3-1, just like this team is,
and we had a Game 7. That's not something we'd like to deal with
again.''
</P>
<P>
   No joy: General manager Mitch Kupchak, like executive Jerry West
earlier this week, said he won't enjoy this moment until the
championship is won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can really enjoy the Portland series or a
Sacramento series or the game (Wednesday) night, really, until it's
all over, and you're looking back on it,'' he said. ``I think from
an entertainment point of view, people who are basketball people
and fans in general can enjoy this team and what they've done to
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've been away from this level of play for over 10 years
now and we feel we've been in position to compete the last couple
of years. And we also know that getting in this position with
players being healthy, things falling the way they've fallen in the
playoffs, it doesn't come along very often. So we are in a
position, we're up 3-1, and we want to win the fourth game. And
that will be the time that we can sit back and say, 'Hey, this has
been a great year for this team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the famously wrought West won't be here to witness
the potential finale. ``There's no way,'' Kupchak said. ``There's
an excellent chance he won't even watch it. ... I can see how he
feels the way he feels. Because it is torture to sit and watch, but
you kind of have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The other rings: Kupchak said the Lakers would like to see Kobe
Bryant on the Olympic team this summer, provided Bryant's sprained
left ankle has healed. Bryant has been mentioned as a possible
replacement for the injured Grant Hill but has not said if he would
accept an invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in the '76 Olympics, and I know Jerry (West) played
in the '60 Olympics. Personally, I don't know why anybody would
turn down that opportunity to do it,'' Kupchak said. ``Our No. 1
concern is that he take some time off and get that ankle healed.
And actually I spoke to our team doctor this morning, and he does
need a degree of rest. ... But I don't know why if he's healthy,
why he wouldn't love to play in something like that. And as an
organization, if any of our players played in the Olympics, we'd be
happy for them and we'd be proud to have them on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Bryant, who played 47 minutes in Wednesday's
overtime win, said his ankle was no worse off. He received the
usual dose of therapy Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ankle feels pretty good right now, actually,'' he said.
``I kept the swelling down.''

   WASHINGTON (June 15) - Rep. Bob Borski, D-Philadelphia, did not
earn a dime outside of his government paycheck last year, while
Senate challenger Rep. Ron Klink, D-Murrysville, padded his pot
with stock dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the day when the press and anyone who cared,
stopped by the House Clerk's office to check out House member's
wealth, travel and earnings outside of their salary for 1999. They
earned last year an average salary of $136,000 each for their
service on the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Filings from the challengers for the lawmakers' seats were also
available in the clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
   Senate personal financial forms were released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding the exact amount of wealth each lawmaker held was
impossible to determine because values were given in broad ranges.
Primary homes and spouse's incomes were exempt from the filing.
</P>
<P>
   While Pennsylvania's Senate candidates would like to think of
themselves as sharing few interests, they both like stock market
investments.
</P>
<P>
   While Sen. Rick Santorum, R- Pittsburgh, earned $3,300 to $9,000
from mutual funds. Rep. Ron Klink, the democratic challenger,
earned from $1,204 up to $3,200 from dividends. He also sold joint
stock in Intel, K-Mart and others companies for a total ranging
from $50,000 up to $165,000.
</P>
<P>
   Klink also owned an IRA account with Paine Webber that was worth
$50,000 to $100,000. His wife's IRAs have a possible worth of
$102,000 up to $261,000.
</P>
<P>
   While Santorum is paying off two mortgages on his Pennsylvania
real estate, he did find room for giving. He donated to charity a
$500-fee he was paid for a speaking engagement with the Brent
Society in Falls Church, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Reps. Chaka Fattah and Bob Borski, both Democrats,
enjoyed travel at the expense of private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Fattah took trips to Palm Springs, Panama City and St. Croix -
paid by the Education Finance Council, Sallie Mae and the Caribbean
News respectively. Fattah was the only Philadelphia candidate with
debt - owing between $10,000 and $15,000 for a personal loan and
between $15,000 and $50,000 to the Law Office of Howard Goldsmith
in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Fattah is running for his congressional seat unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern Santa Fe picked up Borski's travelling tab
when he in May 1999 went from Washington to Chicago and then home
to Philadelphia. The lawmaker seemed content with his congressional
salary.
</P>
<P>
   A file for Borski's opponent Steven Kush, R-Philadelphia, was
not found at the House Clerk's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Bob Brady's opponent Charles Dougherty, a
Republican, earned a total of $75,266 as a consultant in 1999.
Among his consulting jobs was a stint with the Washington public
relations firm Cassidy and Assoc., which represents political
interests, and the Miss Philadelphia pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Brady was content with his salary and earnings from
dividends - ranging from $2,003 up to $10,400. He held assets worth
$182,000. And while he is an unpaid administrative assistant for
the Metropolitan Regional Council, the organization paid $6,624.80
for his pension.

 SILICON VALLEY BOOM PARTLY TO BLAME FOR ENERGY SHORTAGES  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Silicon Valley deserves plenty of credit for
fueling virtually unprecedented economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the tech industry's global headquarters also merits much of
the blame for Bay Area electricity shortages this week when record
high temperatures pushed the power grid to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for electricity in Silicon Valley is increasing by about
5 percent a year _ compared with a statewide average of 2 percent _
while no new power plants are slated to come on line until next
year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand will keep rising,'' said Larry Owens, head of customer
services for Silicon Valley Power, the municipal utility of Santa
Clara County. ``Through next summer at least, we will be having
more alerts on hot days, if not actual power outages.''
</P>
<P>
   Intermittent outages yesterday and rolling outages on Wednesday
had an impact on homes and businesses throughout the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   One leading Silicon Valley enterprise, insisting that its name
be kept out of print, said it lost $1 million an hour for the three
hours it was without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the Valley's thirst for juice to diminish. If
anything, experts say the local proliferation of computers and
info-tech hardware will continue making the Bay Area especially
susceptible to power shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's troubling,'' said Terry Winter, president and chief
executive of the California Independent System Operator, a
nonprofit agency that oversees electricity flow throughout the
state. ``Things have grown faster than anyone expected.''
</P>
<P>
   On a nationwide basis, a recent study claimed that growth in
Internet use has caused computers and computer peripherals to now
consume about 13 percent of available power, up from less than 1
percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the California Energy Commission disputed that finding,
insisting that computers actually account for about 4 percent of
national power consumption.
</P>
<P>
   What is indisputable, though, is that Silicon Valley requires
vast stores of electricity to power computer-intensive offices,
so-called clean rooms for chip production and ``server farms'' in
which whole buildings are given over to Internet-related data
processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The server farm thing was a shock to me, just how much load
you can put in a building,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with heavy power consumption for the hardware, he noted
that server farms require additional electricity for air
conditioners to counter all the heat generated by the machinery.
</P>
<P>
   In most areas across the country, power use is fairly evenly
divided between industrial, commercial and residential users. But
according to Silicon Valley Power, fully 90 percent of available
electricity in Santa Clara goes to industrial and commercial
customers.
</P>
<P>
   And even this might not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Bradley, director of environmental programs for the
Silicon Valley Manufacturers Group, an industry organization, said
a number of leading tech firms are now mulling installation of
their own power plants to guarantee an uninterrupted flow of
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood Shores, Calif.'s Oracle Corp. has taken the lead in this
regard, recently shelling out about $6.5 million for its own plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious issue for the economic vitality of the
Valley,'' Bradley said. ``Infrastructure investment has had a hard
time keeping pace with the Valley's growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, energy industry insiders and analysts say the current
situation of high demand and low supply in Northern California will
almost certainly add up to one thing: rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been undersupplied and the demand is just ravenous,''
said Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network,
a grassroots organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, she said higher electricity rates may be just the
incentive the energy industry needs to spur construction of new
power plants, which would boost supply and, potentially, result in
lower prices down the road.
</P>
<P>
   For most California energy users, electricity rates are now
frozen to stabilize the market as part of recent deregulation of
the industry. The rate freeze will end next year.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, this week's outages underline the unique
challenges of doing business in the Bay Area. Along with earthquake
danger, clogged roads and sky-high housing costs, companies also
must grapple with a less-than-reliable energy supply.
</P>
<P>
   The California Independent System Operator declared a Stage 1
power emergency on Wednesday, meaning that energy reserves fell
below 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a Stage 1 emergency, consumers are asked to voluntarily turn
off lights and assorted gadgets to reduce power use by as much as
possible. In a Stage 2 emergency, reserves fall below 5 percent and
power may be interrupted to some heavy users.
</P>
<P>
   A Stage 3 emergency, which has never been called on a statewide
basis, means energy reserves almost have been depleted and power to
all users may be cut at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. was taking no chances Wednesday,
cutting electricity to blocks of 35,000 Bay Area customers for as
long as 90 minutes at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The utility was instructed by the Independent System Operator to
continue interrupting service to some customers from noon to 6 p.m.
yesterday as hot weather persisted in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is adequate power _ until we get into situations that
are extreme,'' said Daniel Nix, deputy director of energy
information and analysis for the California Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   To improve reliability in Silicon Valley, he said the Bay Area's
only choice will be to build more power plants on the Peninsula and
in the South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   A new plant already is in the works for the San Jose, Calif.,
area but won't be operational until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   A Silicon Valley ``energy summit'' organized by the
manufacturers group last week focused on this trend, with
representatives of local companies, utilities and government
agencies comparing notes on the region's hunger for power, so to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   A task force is expected to be formed soon to explore ways that
Silicon Valley enterprises can address electricity providers' lack
of reliability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one clear lesson from this week,'' said Dan Richard,
senior vice president of PG&AMP;E. ``We need more power generation and
transmission in the area. There's simply no other way around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley has spurred a huge change in consumption,'' he
observed. ``We've got to get past local discomfort with building
new facilities or else we're going to continue having problems in
the Bay Area.''

 HOT JOB MARKET FORCES EMPLOYERS TO RECRUIT OVERSEAS  &HT;     By ABBY COHN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Talk about a long commute: Aurore Tachoires
traveled more than 6,000 miles to get to her $7.25-an-hour job at
Paramount's Great America.
</P>
<P>
   The college student from Paris is one of 100 international
students who are expected to help fill staffing needs at the Santa
Clara, Calif., theme park this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as a dream to come to California,'' said Tachoires, 19,
a chemistry and engineering student who wants to improve her
English skills and get a taste of American life during the next two
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to find a job here than in France,'' she said
during a break from loading children on and off pint-size rides in
the park's KidZville area.
</P>
<P>
   Great America, which employed just 15 international students
last year, plans to get dozens more in coming weeks from such
countries as Ireland, Latvia, Russia, Spain and Taiwan. The park
was so eager for extra help that it hired an outside agency to
recruit the students. Great America pays $9.75 for each hour the
students work to the agency, which in turn pays the students $7.25
an hour. to
</P>
<P>
   A sizzling economy has many other U.S. employers reaching out to
distant lands for summer help while local teens enjoy a job market
that's given them a broad selection of offerings and more leverage
in setting salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of opportunities out there,'' said Elaina
Vaughn, vice president of human resources at Great America, which
employs 2,600 workers during the peak season. ``The strong economy
has really lead us to use more innovative or creative recruitment
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Council on International Educational Exchange expects to
bring 26,000 foreign students to work in the United States this
summer, including about 1,000 in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, based in New York, helps these students
acquire visas that will allow them to work and travel in the United
States for up to four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a program that's set up to fill employers' job
shortages,'' said Pamela Posey, the council's director of
operations. ``It's just that American students have a lot of
choices right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign students are being recruited for jobs in everything from
amusement parks and casinos to restaurants and sports clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Bay Area, Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo is
hiring 340 foreign students this summer, while the company's
Waterworld USA park in Concord, Calif., expects to employ 40.
</P>
<P>
   With local unemployment figures hovering around 2.5 percent,
young workers are a hot item.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, competition is so fierce that a couple of months ago
Jack London Cinema 9 in Oakland, Calif., lost some employees to
restaurants where they had gone on their lunch breaks.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; ``We know everyone else is hurting, too,'' said Cinema 9
General Manager Terry Britt, who figures that four or five workers
were snapped up when they stopped for lunch at nearby eating
establishments.
</P>
<P>
   To try and stem a dizzying turnover rate, the theater complex,
which has a staff that will go from 70 to 130 this summer, boosted
salaries four months ago. Employees who were paid the minimum wage
of $5.75 an hour now can earn up to $7 hourly, Britt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from (losing) seven (employees) a week down to four a
week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While difficult for employers, incidents like this reflect a
robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer job market is a really good example of the effect
of strong economic growth,'' said Stephen Levy, director of the
Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. ``This is a
very strong job market and it is reaching down.''
</P>
<P>
   Other signs of a rosy employment picture for teens include:
</P>
<P>
   -- A plethora of help-wanted signs popping up in store
retailers' windows.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; ``If you walk up and down University Avenue (in Palo Alto,
Calif.), there are signs up all over the place,'' Levy said. ``It's
a very tight market.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand for workers by technology companies has probably
exacerbated the shortage of people ``scooping ice cream and waiting
tables,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   -- More aggressive recruiting by local employers on high school
campuses and at unemployment offices and job fairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several employers coming in,'' said Joan Karr, the
college and career adviser at Acalanes High School in Lafayette,
Calif. ``This is the first time I've experienced it.''
</P>
<P>
   In another first, Tonya Gardner, assistant regional manager for
Yogurt Park, visited the unemployment office in search of workers
for her three frozen yogurt shops in Walnut Creek and Danville,
Calif. Gardner, who is looking for 10 to 15 more employees, plans
to attend a job fair at the local branch of the state Economic
Development Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm praying I can find some good-quality kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At another job fair last month in Oakland, 44 employers showed
up, 12 more than last year, said Daryl Richardson, executive
director of the Oakland Mayor's Summer Jobs Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some great employers there,'' he said. ``It was a
pretty large list and they were looking for the youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the firms that attended was the local franchise for Pizza
Hut. Laura Hitchens, the company's human resource manager, reports
that recruiters have attended 23 job fairs locally so far this year
in a stepped-up effort to find employees.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Meanwhile, the turnout by young job seekers at the Oakland
fair was down. Richardson said 800 applicants showed up last month,
compared with 1,000 in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   -- Salary increases in an effort to lure young workers and
raises in hopes of keeping them.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, In-N-Out Burger boosted base salaries to $9 an hour
from $8.25. ``That gives us an advantage,'' said Ken Iriart, vice
president for human resources for the chain, which operates six
restaurants in the Bay Area. ``We pay well over the minimum wage,
so that helps us out.''
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't a bull market for everyone. Representatives of San
Francisco agencies that try to place low-income youth in jobs say
their task was made tougher this summer by the phase-out of a
federally funded job training program.
</P>
<P>
   A new program begins in July, and in the meantime, city
officials and the job agencies are asking private businesses to
donate funds to pay teens for jobs in the public sector and at
nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jobs really aren't the concern,'' said Liz
Jackson-Simpson, director of Jobs for Youth. ``It's having the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   She also fears that employers may be reluctant to hire younger
and less-experienced teens.
</P>
<P>
   At Marine World, officials said their decision to recruit
overseas is part of a corporate program that promotes cultural
exchanges between international students and park guests. All the
foreign students are over 18 years old and earn $6.50 to $7 hourly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do fill a need for us as well, so it's kind of a win-win
situation for everybody,'' said Lori Brooke, the park's human
resources manager.
</P>
<P>
   To help reduce housing costs, the international students are
placed in dormitories or apartments located by agencies that
matched them with their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Marine World pay about $250 a month for housing or
no more than 25 percent of their monthly income, according to David
Marzano, chief executive officer at Global Staffing Services, the
Atlanta firm that employs the students.
</P>
<P>
   In the South Bay, Tachoires is sharing quarters for $300 a month
with other foreign students in an apartment complex lined up by
Unyx International, the work-exchange program that contracted with
Great America.
</P>
<P>
   She describes the apartment as nice, noting the complex has a
swimming pool and Jacuzzi. But her apartment is about 15 miles from
Great America and Tachoires said it takes her an hour and a half to
get to work on public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Tachoires said her university wanted her to work in an
English-speaking country this summer to improve her language
skills.
</P>
<P>
   She isn't expecting to get rich. Instead, she wants to cover her
living expenses, the $1,500 in costs to get here and have enough
money at the end of her stay to travel around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can have extra money, I'll take it,'' she said, adding,
``It's not my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Niall Martin, 20, of Ireland, initially had hoped to spend the
summer in San Francisco, but housing there was too expensive. He
and several friends from Ireland
</P>
<P>
   are happy to work at Great America and hope to do some traveling
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Martin spent about $1,100 on his flight, medical insurance and
work permit, but he figures the money was well spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' he said, joking that he wants to
see if America is really the way it's described ``on `Jenny Jones'
and `Jerry Springer.' ''

 UNITED TO REDUCE FLIGHTS  &HT;     By PHAT X. CHIEM 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ United Airlines reaffirmed its pledge to decrease
flight delays at San Francisco International Airport by as much as
30 percent by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   During a wide-ranging discussion with reporters Thursday, United
Airlines President Rono J. Dutta said the carrier would attempt to
reduce delays by cutting back on the number of its flights,
reducing turn-around times for planes on the ground and scheduling
more flights during off-peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   United, which handles 55 percent of the traffic at SFO with 500
daily arrivals and departures, is implementing the measures to
appease airport officials who wanted the airline to reduce delays
by eliminating many of its short-haul flights. SFO suffers from the
worst delays of any airport in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta said many of the problems result from a confluence of
factors outside of United's control, such as the Bay Area's
ubiquitous fog and the airport's crowded, intersecting runways.
</P>
<P>
   While most major airports, such those in Chicago (where United
is based) and Los Angeles, handle an average of 110 arrivals per
hour, SFO handles only 60 in an hour. During bad weather, that
figure can drop to as low as 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the worst-performing airports in the nation,''
Dutta said. ``Unfortunately, we get a lot of the flack for it.
That's why we keep screaming for more runway capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutta said the situation at SFO speaks to a greater concern for
United and the rest of the airline industry: the need for more
runways and larger airports throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying problems of delays aren't going away unless the
federal government steps up and spends more money on airport
infrastructure. We're headed for an aviation crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Some steps are under way to address the capacity shortage at
SFO, including the opening of the new $3.2 billion International
Terminal Building, where United will have 14 new gates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the airport is studying the feasibility of
reconfiguring its four runways so that they are farther apart, a
move that would substantially increase air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta also spoke in detail about United's $11.6 billion merger
with US Airways, which has prompted antitrust concerns because the
combined airline would control 30 percent of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress and consumer advocates fear the merger,
which United hopes to complete by year's end, will lead to higher
airfares, fewer choices and a deterioration in service.
</P>
<P>
   But Dutta sought to reassure the public by reiterating United's
promise to freeze airfares for two years, with exceptions for
adjustments for higher fuel costs and other inflation-related
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Alan B. Wayne, United's regional director for governmental and
public affairs based in Los Angeles, said the carrier will continue
to adjust its schedules at SFO until it achieves the 30 percent
decrease in delays by September.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the airport expects and that's what we're working
toward,'' Wayne said. ``We're fine-tuning our schedules in the
interest of reducing delays at the same time still meet customer
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 18 months, United has cut flights at the airport to
230 a day from 260.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also is employing time-saving techniques such as
``closed loop flying,'' which uses the same aircraft to fly various
routes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the carrier has not consolidated its short-haul flights
and used larger planes to fly to cities such as Fresno and
Sacramento, as SFO officials have suggested. Instead Wayne said
United is opting to reduce delays through other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta noted that United has not increased the number of flights
at SFO in four years. But even as the carrier takes measures to
reduce flight delays, he said, other airlines ``keep jumping in and
making the problem almost worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutta noted United's measures to reduce delays come ``at great
cost to us in terms of revenues and market position. We don't know
how much longer we can keep going down this path. How much more can
we shrink and make room for someone else?''

 NET WORTH: PROFESSOR'S IRRATIONAL ROUTE TO `GENIUS' GRANT  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Matthew Rabin just won a MacArthur ``genius''
grant _ $100,000 a year for five years _ for his research on how
procrastination and other self-control issues affect economic
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin knows his subject matter. You might say he's a poster
child for procrastination.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old economics professor at the University of
California at Berkeley only recently opened a retirement account at
work, and only after he was prodded by family and assisted by
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   And Rabin admits he keeps too much money _ $20,000 to $50,000 _
in a checking account instead of in a long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that in five years, I'll have $500,000 in my
checking account,'' he quips. Make that $250,000 or so after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Rabin thinks traditional economic models _ which
assume that people act rationally, in their best long-term
self-interests _ are flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin is among a handful of leading figures in the emerging
field of behavioral economics, which applies psychology to the
dismal science.
</P>
<P>
   Take retirement. Most economists believe this is such an
important issue that everyone will automatically plan and save for
retirement. Therefore, government and employers don't need to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   But Rabin argues that most people will postpone anything that
involves immediate costs and/or delayed gratification. And the
higher the cost in terms of time and effort, and the greater price
of failure, the more they will procrastinate. That's why so many
people put off retirement planning for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks shockingly irrational to economists,'' Rabin says.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but procrastination also tends to be ``time
inconsistent,'' meaning that in the long-run we do want what's best
for us, but in the short term, we want it and we want it now.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you bring research subjects into a room and say,
``You can have $10 now or $15 in one week,'' some will choose each
option.
</P>
<P>
   But if the choice is $10 in 50 weeks or $15 in 51 weeks,
everyone will choose the latter. However, when the 50th week rolls
around, some will take the $10 rather than waiting another week for
$15.
</P>
<P>
   The ``real killer,'' Rabin says, ``is our overoptimism about our
discipline in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   His research shows that in most but not all cases, people who
admit they're slugs are better off than those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin is loath to suggest any practical applications of his
research, but when pressed, he had some advice.
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself: How many times have I told myself I'd do something
in the future? If you know you're a procrastinator, establish
deadlines, either external or internal. Get your friends to help.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin has enlisted Richard Thaler, another leading behavioral
economist at the University of Chicago. ``He offers external
deadline services. I owe him $1,000 if I don't switch my money out
of a checking account or submit a paper by a certain day.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers can also help, by offering in-house retirement
seminars that people can attend during their work hours.
</P>
<P>
   Government can help by imposing more investment deadlines,
similar to the April 15 cutoff for contributing to IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin concedes that not everyone is a procrastinator. ``Some
people can't enjoy themselves if they have a project hanging over
their head, so for them, immediate gratification is doing the
project now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabin says his collaborator, Ted O'Donoghue, is one of the few
people he knows who has no problems with self-control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our (research) papers are him observing me and writing
it down and me getting all the credit,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donoghue has heard that line before. ``Matthew thinks I behave
a little too rationally,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donoghue was a graduate student at Cal when he started working
with Rabin. Now he's an assistant economics professor at Cornell
University, although he's now on leave, working with Rabin in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   He describes his mentor as a ``character'' who wears nothing but
tie-dyed T-shirts, except for the time when he had to give a
presentation and showed up in a dress shirt with a tie-dyed tie.
</P>
<P>
   The MacArthur people ``made a good choice, given their stated
goals of helping people who are creative, but outside the
boundaries of traditional research,'' O'Donoghue says. ``We've met
resistance from some of the traditional sources'' of research
funding. The MacArthur money, and the attendant publicity, should
help.
</P>
<P>
   At one of his favorite cafes in the Castro district yesterday,
Rabin was conducting back-to-back media interviews and felt obliged
to pay for my coffee. When the guy behind the counter had to go to
the men's room, he asked Rabin to keep an eye on the till.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he figures I don't need the money,'' Rabin says.
</P>
<P>
   VALUE REVIVAL?: After more than five years of underperformance,
value stocks are making a strong comeback, according to a new study
by Paul Rabbit of Rabbit Analytics, a quantitative investment firm
in Hermosa Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 90 days, there was a tremendous shift toward
value,'' says Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   The market is roughly divided into two camps: value stocks have
relatively low price-earnings, price-to-cash-flow, price-to-sales
and price-to-book ratios. Growth stocks have high ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Rabbit says, growth has beat value. But its winning
streak may be over.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit compared the 20 percent of companies in the Russell 3000
index with the lowest PE ratios to the 20 percent with the highest
PE ratios.
</P>
<P>
   What he found: In the 90 days ending May 31, low-PE stocks beat
the Russell 3000 index by 7 percent, and high PE stocks lagged the
index by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   June, he says ``has been kind of drifty.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at other yardsticks, Rabbit found that stocks with the
strongest earnings surprises (growth stocks) lagged the market by
1.5 percent per month in the three months ending in May, after
beating the market by more than 1 percent per month over the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He also considered relative strength, a momentum indicator. In
the last 90 days, companies with high relative strength (growth
stocks) lagged the market by 4 percent per month, whereas in the
last 12 months, they beat the market by more than 3 percent per
month.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he found that companies with high dividend yields
(value stocks) beat the market by 2 percent per month in the past
three months, after lagging the index by 1 percent per month over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit says he's been a growth investor for the past six years
and is ``hesitant to say one should abandon growth. This economy
has grown in an unprecedented fashion, without inflation,'' because
of productivity gains from technology. ``I'm not convinced
productivity enhancement is over.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks investors should stay in technology, but ``I wouldn't
continue to buy growth stocks with impunity. One should pay
attention to value.''

RUSSELL REDUX: PRIVATE MAN BACK IN PUBLIC EYE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Wash., Calif.)   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, Bill Russell is back in public, emerging from his
quiet life on Mercer Island, Wash., as the white-bearded icon of
teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Celtics legend is now an ``original,'' who suggests
that viewers to ``ask for an original'' Coors beer in a commercial.
He was the subject of an HBO documentary that he and his adviser
pitched and the recipient of a $400,000 deal to write a book on
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   He is in demand as a motivational speaker at $25,000 a speech.
He is now so available to the Celtics that he attends events like
last Sunday's barbecue for season-ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, 66, last wore a Celtics uniform 31 years ago, and last
coached, to a 17-41 record, at Sacramento 12 years ago. Then he
seemed to disappear, more in the manner of Sandy Koufax, with
occasional sightings, than the full-bodied reclusiveness of J.D.
Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   Why resurface now, and with such gusto?
</P>
<P>
   At first, Russell said he did not know. ``I'll see if I can
figure it out,'' he said during one of two telephone interviews.
``Can I call you in a week or two?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he added, ``I wanted to be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinking behind Russell's planned renaissance was not his.
``My plan was to fade away,'' he said. ``I've tried to keep my life
as small as possible. I have some good friends, and I have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was not what his business adviser, Alan Hilburg, and
Russell's daughter, Karen, wanted for him. In the summer of 1998
they convinced him that the end of the millennium would spawn
retrospectives and lists about the 20th century's greatest athletes
and that he had to tell his story _ or others would.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about how much of today's generation doesn't know
basketball existed before Magic, Larry and Michael,'' Hilburg said.
``Bill told me that one of his grandchildren asked him, `Were you
as good as Michael Jordan?'''
</P>
<P>
   They convinced Russell that his singular identity _ the ultimate
team sports champion _ was valuable, but dormant. Russell had won
two National Collegiate Athletic Association championships at the
University of San Francisco, an Olympic gold medal and 11 National
Basketball Association titles in 13 years, but Jordan's Chicago
Bulls, with six titles in eight years, had come to symbolize the
greatest generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was comfortable with going home and closing the door, but
Alan and my daughter and a few friends said that wasn't right,''
Russell said. ``They said I shouldn't take my accomplishments in
silence. While I'm not completely comfortable with this, I can put
myself in a frame of mind where I'm not uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell's deference to his daughter and his adviser indicates an
apparent easing of his need to go his own way. ``When I was active
as a player, I always felt I was the only one on the planet who
knew what he was doing,'' he said. Tom ``Satch'' Sanders, a former
Celtics teammate, said: ``Everything's always been a personal
choice with Russell. He's charming if he wants to be. He's capable
of doing a lot more, but he never wanted to. But he was visible on
the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Cousy, another Celtics teammate, added, ``He's mellowed and
is allowing himself to reach out and communicate with people who
want to have a relationship with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside their unit, Cousy said, Russell was outgoing and witty,
but when faced with racism on the outside, he was uncommunicative.
``I think he's concluded that there's good and bad, but you can't
be consumed with the bad,'' Cousy said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Redux is, in essence, a product relaunch designed to
emphasize Russell's championship pedigree, not to deal with his
image, ingrained with the public as enigmatic and aloof. He still
refuses to sign autographs, preferring to speak to a fan or shake
his hand instead. He distinguishes between autographs for fans or
teammates and corporate deals to sign goods for a fee to sell to
serious collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to revive the Russell brand took shape in September
1998, when Hilburg invited Frank Deford of Sports Illustrated to
meet with Russell in New York. ``Russell couldn't say it out of
modesty,'' Deford said, ``but Alan said to Bill, `The millennium is
fading, and you're fading; you've got to make an effort to come
out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hilburg wanted Deford's input and wondered if he wanted to write
about Russell in Sports Illustrated. Deford's positive response led
Hilburg to ask if HBO Sports, where Deford also works, would want
Russell's cooperation for a documentary. Russell's name had not
been on HBOs radar screen as a possible subject because network
executives assumed he was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Deford's article was published in early May 1999, three weeks
before Russell's No. 6 uniform jersey was retired in an emotional
ceremony at the Fleet Center in Boston. In 1972, Russell had
demanded that his uniform be raised to the Boston Garden rafters
with no fans present. But because the Fleet Center gala was
organized by Karen Russell to benefit the National Mentoring
Partnership, Russell's favorite charity, he agreed to a public
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The event attracted a longtime nemesis, Wilt Chamberlain;
Russell's former coach, Red Auerbach; former teammates; and Larry
Bird and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The crowd's standing ovation moved
Russell to tears and a rapprochement with Celtic fans.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's elevated profile began to attract companies and
organizations eager to hear him speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is team effort,'' he said. ``Almost all successful
organizations are team efforts. What you have to find out in a team
is what are your strengths and how to use them effectively, and how
not to overuse them and underuse them.''
</P>
<P>
   Coors and Invesco, a financial services company, sought him out
for commercials. To push its slogan _ ``You Should Know What
Invesco Knows'' _ Invesco gleaned a 30-second snipped from hours of
interviews that discusses how he grabbed a rebound based on
calculating what the shooter ``does, what he thinks; under stress,
how he'll act.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Moran, a vice president of Invesco, said it chose Russell
in part because the company knew he would rank high on lists like
ESPN's ``SportsCentury'' top 50 North American athletes of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``He exudes wisdom,'' Moran said, ``and we were able to draw a
parallel between his specialized knowledge of rebounding and the
specialized knowledge we have in our field.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell met the Coors standard because his play was
``revolutionary or groundbreaking,'' said David Taylor, a Coors
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Hilburg said he and Russell are wrapping up two more deals and
are seeking an Internet deal. Russell has also agreed to write the
leadership book for Dutton.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Russell revival will earn enough to secure his
retirement, Hilburg said.
</P>
<P>
   One opportunity that Russell spurned was talking to ESPN for the
network's ``SportsCentury'' profile of him. He did not want to
dilute the impact of the HBO documentary, which premiered in April,
six months after the ESPN profile was broadcast. ``I had no regard
for contributing to it or helping it,'' he said. Yet, last
September, he appeared at the Times Square ESPN Zone restaurant to
promote ``SportsCentury.'' Why did he promote a series he would not
participate in? ``Alan asked me to do it,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   The longevity of Russell's renaissance may be up to Russell. He
could endure like Arnold Palmer, who is ageless in the marketing
world, or he could retreat to his serene life, with his companion,
Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said, ``Sometimes I read about the alcoholic's creed _
one day at a time.''

 NET WORTH: PROFESSOR'S IRRATIONAL ROUTE TO `GENIUS' GRANT  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Matthew Rabin just won a MacArthur ``genius''
grant _ $100,000 a year for five years _ for his research on how
procrastination and other self-control issues affect economic
decisions.
</P>
<P>

   The 36-year-old economics professor at the University of
California at Berkeley only recently opened a retirement account at
work, and only after he was prodded by family and assisted by
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   And Rabin admits he keeps too much money _ $20,000 to $50,000 _
in a checking account instead of in a long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that in five years, I'll have $500,000 in my
checking account,'' he quips. Make that $250,000 or so after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Rabin thinks traditional economic models _ which
assume that people act rationally, in their best long-term
self-interests _ are flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin is among a handful of leading figures in the emerging

<P>
   Take retirement. Most economists believe this is such an

<P>
   Finally, he found that companies with high dividend yields
(value stocks) beat the market by 2 percent per month in the past
three months, after lagging the index by 1 percent per month over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit says he's been a growth investor for the past six years
and is ``hesitant to say one should abandon growth. This economy
has grown in an unprecedented fashion, without inflation,'' because
of productivity gains from technology. ``I'm not convinced
productivity enhancement is over.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks investors should stay in technology, but ``I wouldn't
continue to buy growth stocks with impunity. One should pay
attention to value.''

UNDATED: portable televisions. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtually all of the entertainment units designed specifically
for cars use LCD screens. There are also floor-mounted
entertainment units designed for the amateur installer; they are a
step up from those that strap temporarily in place. A much bigger
step up is the ceiling-mounted, flip-down television monitor, which
is not recommended for amateur installers. The wiring has to run
inside one of the car's roof support posts and in the ceiling
cover.
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling-mounted televisions have some advantages. Although
they may partly block the rear-view mirror, they will not keep a
parent from reaching into the back seat, as some floor-mounted
units can. And they may also be better for passengers who suffer
from motion sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are finding out is, kids are more likely to get sick
looking down or level because when they look up they see the
horizon in the peripheral vision,'' Langenhorst said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Oman, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who has studied motion sickness for 25 years, agreed
that seeing the horizon might help. When someone watches television
or tries to read a newspaper in a car, he said, ``the motion you
are experiencing does not match the brain's expectations _ you
aren't creating the motion, and you don't have confirming visual
cues.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter where the screen is mounted, some people are
simply prone to motion sickness. Susceptibility decreases as
children mature so preteen-agers are most likely to become ill.
``The one thing users of TV can do is sort of pace themselves, and
if they feel queasy, look away,'' Oman said.
</P>
<P>
   Most mobile televisions use a VCR as the entertainment source,
and many offer jacks for video game consoles. Manufacturers say
more mobile DVD players are on the horizon, and they talk about a
convergence of Internet, navigation and entertainment material, all
accessible on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   As for watching television stations, some systems offer a tuner,
although the signal is not very good in a moving vehicle. ``It's
not going to be the quality TV you enjoy at home with cable,''
Mathews said.
</P>
<P>
   That's just as well, say some child-rearing experts, like Dr.
Dorothy Singer of the Yale University Family Television Research
Center. Although some bemoan the idea that television has invaded
another treasured family ritual, Singer is not concerned that
watching television or videos on trips will dangerously increase
the time spent in front of the tube. But she does recommend that
parents take along videotapes that are instructive and stimulating
and that can be discussed as part of the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think if you are going on a four-hour or five-hour
trip that you should have the TV on the whole time,'' she said. ``I
think that is feeding into the `TV is the baby sitter' attitude
that we fall into.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer recommends that parents use television as a reward if the
children play well together first. And that periods of watching
television be broken up with periods of talking or listening to
books on tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a book in and it really teases your imagination,'' she
said. ``It's like old-time radio. Anything that stimulates the
imagination is good, but when you watch TV, the images are provided
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents who want to heed her advice are in luck. Many
entertainment systems, some using wireless headphones, can
broadcast different programming to each person in the car. That
works out well for Davis and Nancy Weaver and their teen-age boys,
Matthew and Mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys have trouble agreeing on the same entertainment,''
Davis Weaver said. The adult Weavers have a similar problem: He
likes the occasional Faith Hill CD, while she likes to listen to
sports on the radio. With a 30-hour drive from their home in
Landenberg, Pa., to the Florida Keys ahead of them this summer,
they found a solution in a top-of-the-line van with a multizone
entertainment system that lets Davis Weaver listen to the radio
while his wife listens to music on a headset and the boys, also
using headsets, watch a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quiet in the car now,'' Weaver said. ``It's great. It's
nice to take a long trip.'' And now that his oldest son can drive,
Weaver will be able to spend some time watching the scenery and
listening to his favorite music on a headset without torturing the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a John Denver-type person,'' he said. ``My kids can't
stand John Denver.''

 HOT JOB MARKET FORCES EMPLOYERS TO RECRUIT OVERSEAS  &HT;     By ABBY COHN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Talk about a long commute: Aurore Tachoires
traveled more than 6,000 miles to get to her $7.25-an-hour job at
Paramount's Great America.
</P>
<P>
   The college student from Paris is one of 100 international
students who are expected to help fill staffing needs at the Santa
Clara, Calif., theme park this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as a dream to come to California,'' said Tachoires, 19,
a chemistry and engineering student who wants to improve her
English skills and get a taste of American life during the next two
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to find a job here than in France,'' she said
during a break from loading children on and off pint-size rides in
the park's KidZville area.
</P>
<P>
   Great America, which employed just 15 international students
last year, plans to get dozens more in coming weeks from such
countries as Ireland, Latvia, Russia, Spain and Taiwan. The park
was so eager for extra help that it hired an outside agency to
recruit the students. Great America pays $9.75 for each hour the
students work to the agency, which in turn pays the students $7.25
an hour. to
</P>
<P>
   A sizzling economy has many other U.S. employers reaching out to
distant lands for summer help while local teens enjoy a job market
that's given them a broad selection of offerings and more leverage
in setting salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of opportunities out there,'' said Elaina
Vaughn, vice president of human resources at Great America, which
employs 2,600 workers during the peak season. ``The strong economy
has really lead us to use more innovative or creative recruitment
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Council on International Educational Exchange expects to
bring 26,000 foreign students to work in the United States this
summer, including about 1,000 in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, based in New York, helps these students
acquire visas that will allow them to work and travel in the United
States for up to four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a program that's set up to fill employers' job
shortages,'' said Pamela Posey, the council's director of
operations. ``It's just that American students have a lot of
choices right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign students are being recruited for jobs in everything from
amusement parks and casinos to restaurants and sports clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Bay Area, Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo is
hiring 340 foreign students this summer, while the company's
Waterworld USA park in Concord, Calif., expects to employ 40.
</P>
<P>
   With local unemployment figures hovering around 2.5 percent,
young workers are a hot item.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, competition is so fierce that a couple of months ago
Jack London Cinema 9 in Oakland, Calif., lost some employees to
restaurants where they had gone on their lunch breaks.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; ``We know everyone else is hurting, too,'' said Cinema 9
General Manager Terry Britt, who figures that four or five workers
were snapped up when they stopped for lunch at nearby eating
establishments.
</P>
<P>
   To try and stem a dizzying turnover rate, the theater complex,
which has a staff that will go from 70 to 130 this summer, boosted
salaries four months ago. Employees who were paid the minimum wage
of $5.75 an hour now can earn up to $7 hourly, Britt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from (losing) seven (employees) a week down to four a
week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While difficult for employers, incidents like this reflect a
robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer job market is a really good example of the effect
of strong economic growth,'' said Stephen Levy, director of the
Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. ``This is a
very strong job market and it is reaching down.''
</P>
<P>
   Other signs of a rosy employment picture for teens include:
</P>
<P>
   -- A plethora of help-wanted signs popping up in store
retailers' windows.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; ``If you walk up and down University Avenue (in Palo Alto,
Calif.), there are signs up all over the place,'' Levy said. ``It's
a very tight market.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand for workers by technology companies has probably
exacerbated the shortage of people ``scooping ice cream and waiting
tables,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   -- More aggressive recruiting by local employers on high school
campuses and at unemployment offices and job fairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several employers coming in,'' said Joan Karr, the
college and career adviser at Acalanes High School in Lafayette,
Calif. ``This is the first time I've experienced it.''
</P>
<P>
   In another first, Tonya Gardner, assistant regional manager for
Yogurt Park, visited the unemployment office in search of workers
for her three frozen yogurt shops in Walnut Creek and Danville,
Calif. Gardner, who is looking for 10 to 15 more employees, plans
to attend a job fair at the local branch of the state Economic
Development Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm praying I can find some good-quality kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At another job fair last month in Oakland, 44 employers showed
up, 12 more than last year, said Daryl Richardson, executive
director of the Oakland Mayor's Summer Jobs Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some great employers there,'' he said. ``It was a
pretty large list and they were looking for the youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the firms that attended was the local franchise for Pizza
Hut. Laura Hitchens, the company's human resource manager, reports
that recruiters have attended 23 job fairs locally so far this year
in a stepped-up effort to find employees.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Meanwhile, the turnout by young job seekers at the Oakland
fair was down. Richardson said 800 applicants showed up last month,
compared with 1,000 in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   -- Salary increases in an effort to lure young workers and
raises in hopes of keeping them.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, In-N-Out Burger boosted base salaries to $9 an hour
from $8.25. ``That gives us an advantage,'' said Ken Iriart, vice
president for human resources for the chain, which operates six
restaurants in the Bay Area. ``We pay well over the minimum wage,
so that helps us out.''
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't a bull market for everyone. Representatives of San
Francisco agencies that try to place low-income youth in jobs say
their task was made tougher this summer by the phase-out of a
federally funded job training program.
</P>
<P>
   A new program begins in July, and in the meantime, city
officials and the job agencies are asking private businesses to
donate funds to pay teens for jobs in the public sector and at
nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jobs really aren't the concern,'' said Liz
Jackson-Simpson, director of Jobs for Youth. ``It's having the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   She also fears that employers may be reluctant to hire younger
and less-experienced teens.
</P>
<P>
   At Marine World, officials said their decision to recruit
overseas is part of a corporate program that promotes cultural
exchanges between international students and park guests. All the
foreign students are over 18 years old and earn $6.50 to $7 hourly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do fill a need for us as well, so it's kind of a win-win
situation for everybody,'' said Lori Brooke, the park's human
resources manager.
</P>
<P>
   To help reduce housing costs, the international students are
placed in dormitories or apartments located by agencies that
matched them with their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Marine World pay about $250 a month for housing or
no more than 25 percent of their monthly income, according to David
Marzano, chief executive officer at Global Staffing Services, the
Atlanta firm that employs the students.
</P>
<P>
   In the South Bay, Tachoires is sharing quarters for $300 a month
with other foreign students in an apartment complex lined up by
Unyx International, the work-exchange program that contracted with
Great America.
</P>
<P>
   She describes the apartment as nice, noting the complex has a
swimming pool and Jacuzzi. But her apartment is about 15 miles from
Great America and Tachoires said it takes her an hour and a half to
get to work on public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Tachoires said her university wanted her to work in an
English-speaking country this summer to improve her language
skills.
</P>
<P>
   She isn't expecting to get rich. Instead, she wants to cover her
living expenses, the $1,500 in costs to get here and have enough
money at the end of her stay to travel around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can have extra money, I'll take it,'' she said, adding,
``It's not my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Niall Martin, 20, of Ireland, initially had hoped to spend the
summer in San Francisco, but housing there was too expensive. He
and several friends from Ireland
</P>
<P>
   are happy to work at Great America and hope to do some traveling
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Martin spent about $1,100 on his flight, medical insurance and
work permit, but he figures the money was well spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' he said, joking that he wants to
see if America is really the way it's described ``on `Jenny Jones'
and `Jerry Springer.' ''

NAPSTER MANEUVERS FOR A COPYRIGHT BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Wash.)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Napster, an Internet music startup, and the
recording industry sharpened their legal strategies this week in a
battle with potentially broad implications for copyright law in the
Internet era. The moves were punctuated by Napster's disclosure
Thursday that it is hiring the lawyer who led the government's case
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The legal maneuvering is a precursor to a July 26 hearing in
federal court in San Francisco in a case that many see as a
landmark for unresolved Internet and technology-era copyright
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief filed late Monday, the Recording Industry Association
of America, which represents major record labels, argued that the
court should stop Napster from operating pending the outcome of the
trial. The brief said Napster is contributing to growing and
irreparable harm to the commercial music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif., responded Thursday, saying
it had hired David Boies, the Justice Department's special counsel
in the antirust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an obviously important case,'' Boies said in an
interview Thursday, explaining his decision to work with Napster.
``People are focusing on the music, but it's a case that raises
broader policy issues and legal issue'' about copyright law on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Napster makes software that can be used to share music files
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Napster asked Chief U.S. District Judge Marilyn Patel of the
Northern District of California to throw out the industry
association's suit, but on May 8 the judge denied the request,
setting the stage for the case to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The association brief filed Monday asserts ``over 10 million
Napster users are sharing tens of millions of copyrighted files.''
The brief states Napster is guilty of contributing to copyright
infringement because it knows of the practice, profits from the
practice and has the technological wherewithal to detect the
nefarious activity.
</P>
<P>
   Boies acknowledged Thursday that the recording industry may have
a point, though he argued that studies on the issue are
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief this week, the association cited a survey it
commissioned by the Field Research Corp., a San Francisco based
research firm, that stated 22 percent of Napster users said that
because of Napster, they don't buy CDs any more or buy fewer CDs.
</P>
<P>
   However, a study by the Digital Media Association released this
week stated that 59 percent of people who download or stream music
over the Internet said the activity has led them to later purchase
music.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said that the case will turn in part on a legal question:
whether the individual Napster users are violating copyright law.
He said Napster will argue they are not.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said that Napster users are participating on a grand
scale in a behavior that is widely accepted on a smaller scale
today. For instance, he said that individuals would not be sued for
copyright infringement for making a copy of a song or a television
movie for a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said he will argue that if the users of Napster are not
guilty of copyright infringement, than Napster itself cannot be
held accountable for abetting copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   However, the recording association argues that the behavior of
Napster users clearly is not legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not it is lawful for users to share music one on
one, on a small scale, there can be no question it is unlawful when
done on a large scale as with Napster,'' said Cary Sherman, general
counsel for the association.

 UNITED TO REDUCE FLIGHTS  &HT;     By PHAT X. CHIEM 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ United Airlines reaffirmed its pledge to decrease
flight delays at San Francisco International Airport by as much as
30 percent by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   During a wide-ranging discussion with reporters Thursday, United
Airlines President Rono J. Dutta said the carrier would attempt to
reduce delays by cutting back on the number of its flights,
reducing turn-around times for planes on the ground and scheduling
more flights during off-peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   United, which handles 55 percent of the traffic at SFO with 500
daily arrivals and departures, is implementing the measures to
appease airport officials who wanted the airline to reduce delays
by eliminating many of its short-haul flights. SFO suffers from the
worst delays of any airport in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta said many of the problems result from a confluence of
factors outside of United's control, such as the Bay Area's
ubiquitous fog and the airport's crowded, intersecting runways.
</P>
<P>
   While most major airports, such those in Chicago (where United
is based) and Los Angeles, handle an average of 110 arrivals per
hour, SFO handles only 60 in an hour. During bad weather, that
figure can drop to as low as 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the worst-performing airports in the nation,''
Dutta said. ``Unfortunately, we get a lot of the flack for it.
That's why we keep screaming for more runway capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutta said the situation at SFO speaks to a greater concern for
United and the rest of the airline industry: the need for more
runways and larger airports throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying problems of delays aren't going away unless the
federal government steps up and spends more money on airport
infrastructure. We're headed for an aviation crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Some steps are under way to address the capacity shortage at
SFO, including the opening of the new $3.2 billion International
Terminal Building, where United will have 14 new gates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the airport is studying the feasibility of
reconfiguring its four runways so that they are farther apart, a
move that would substantially increase air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta also spoke in detail about United's $11.6 billion merger
with US Airways, which has prompted antitrust concerns because the
combined airline would control 30 percent of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress and consumer advocates fear the merger,
which United hopes to complete by year's end, will lead to higher
airfares, fewer choices and a deterioration in service.
</P>
<P>
   But Dutta sought to reassure the public by reiterating United's
promise to freeze airfares for two years, with exceptions for
adjustments for higher fuel costs and other inflation-related
expense.
</P>
<P>
   Alan B. Wayne, United's regional director for governmental and
public affairs based in Los Angeles, said the carrier will continue
to adjust its schedules at SFO until it achieves the 30 percent
decrease in delays by September.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the airport expects and that's what we're working
toward,'' Wayne said. ``We're fine-tuning our schedules in the
interest of reducing delays at the same time still meet customer
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 18 months, United has cut flights at the airport to
230 a day from 260.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also is employing time-saving techniques such as
``closed loop flying,'' which uses the same aircraft to fly various
routes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the carrier has not consolidated its short-haul flights
and used larger planes to fly to cities such as Fresno and
Sacramento, as SFO officials have suggested. Instead Wayne said
United is opting to reduce delays through other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta noted that United has not increased the number of flights
at SFO in four years. But even as the carrier takes measures to
reduce flight delays, he said, other airlines ``keep jumping in and
making the problem almost worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutta noted United's measures to reduce delays come ``at great
cost to us in terms of revenues and market position. We don't know
how much longer we can keep going down this path. How much more can
we shrink and make room for someone else?''

IN DEATH ROW DISPUTE, A WITNESS STANDS FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct spelling of Graham in graf 17, beginning ``Next
week, ...'')  (EDS: a Washington-datelined folo is attached) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nineteen years ago, Bernadine Skillern caught a quick
glimpse of a man who had just committed a nighttime murder in a
grocery store parking lot. She identified him in court as Gary
Graham in testimony so strong that, despite almost no other
evidence, a jury found him guilty and later sentenced him to death.
</P>
<P>
   With Graham scheduled to die next Thursday and death penalty
opponents mounting an all-out effort to stop his execution,
Skillern testified again Thursday, this time in the court of public
opinion. Again and again at an hourlong news conference, Skillern
repeated her unwavering belief that Graham was the man she had seen
shoot Bobby Lambert outside a Safeway supermarket in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Graham shoot and kill Lambert on that parking lot in
1981,'' said Skillern, 53. ``That has not changed. That is not
going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Skillern's emotional but unflinching appearance was a pointed
rebuttal in a public relations battle that, until now, has been
dominated by advocates for Graham.
</P>
<P>
   With protests planned in Texas for next week, the Graham case is
attracting national attention and creating a political headache for
Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee who has staunchly defended capital punishment in his state
despite growing outside criticism focusing on, among other issues,
the quality of legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's advocates say his original trial was a travesty: His
court-appointed lawyer, Ronald G. Mock, conducted virtually no
investigation of the case and put on new witnesses during the guilt
phase of the trial. Ballistics tests showed that a .22-caliber
revolver taken from Graham after his arrest did not match the
murder weapon. Two other witnesses who could have contradicted
Skillern's story were never called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other case that has more doubts of innocence today
than this man right here,'' said Lawrence C. Marshall, legal
director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern
University, which has helped exonerate nine death row inmates in
Illinois and has taken on the Graham case.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting before a bank of television cameras at a conference
table Thursday morning, Skillern said she decided to speak out
because of ``misinformation'' about the case in the news media. On
the night of May 13, 1981, when she witnessed the murder, Skillern
said, she waited in her car with her two youngest daughters, then
nine and five, as her 14-year-old daughter shopped inside the
Safeway. It was about 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   According to the trial transcript, Skillern testified that she
saw Graham ``off and on about 60 seconds, maybe a little longer.''
She told the jury she saw the side of his face, then she blew her
horn, at which point she looked directly at his face for ``a split
second, maybe a second.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, she repeated roughly the same story, saying that she
saw his face from different angles three or four times over a
period of 90 seconds. Looking through her windshield, she said, she
looked directly into his face when he walked in front of her
headlights, about a car distance away. She honked her horn, she
said, because she wanted to stop him from shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Don't! Don't shoot,''' recalled Skillern, who held
her news conference in the office of her spokesman, Rusty Hardin, a
former state prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier in the week, Graham's advocates
praised Skillern's sincerity but raised questions about the
reliability of eyewitness testimony in general, particularly in the
absence of other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Thompson, a rape victim from North Carolina, told of
identifying her attacker, who was convicted and sentenced to
prison, only to later discover from DNA evidence that she had
identified the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   So certain was she of her initial identification that when she
was later shown a photograph of the real assailant, she said it was
not him. (He was ultimately convicted, based on DNA evidence.)
</P>
<P>
   Graham's advocates have suggested that detectives steered
Skillern toward identifying Graham by manipulating mug shots and
the subsequent lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But Skillern disputed any suggestion that she had been unduly
influenced. She said that she had picked out Graham's mug shot, but
that she had wanted to see him in person to confirm her belief that
he was the killer. When she saw him in the lineup the next day, she
said, she shuddered with fear, not realizing that he could not see
her behind a glass wall.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles will vote on
whether to commute Graham's sentence or go forward with the
execution. In 1993, the Board voted against commutation but
then-Gov. Ann Richards granted Graham a 30-day stay of execution
that led to his case being re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who did plead guilty to a string of armed robberies, was
17 at the time of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Graham has already received one stay sets up a
tricky legal situation. Under Texas law, a governor is only allowed
to grant an inmate one stay of execution.
</P>
<P>
   As is his custom, Bush has remained silent about the Graham
case, but a campaign aide said the governor's legal advisers
believe that under the law Bush cannot grant a stay. Advocates for
Graham say the law could be interpreted to mean one stay per
governor, but they say commutation or a conditional pardon, which
can occur only with the parole board's blessing, to allow a new
trial is their real goal.
</P>
<P>
   Skillern has not spoken publicly about the case since Graham was
nearly executed in 1993. She said her testimony has altered her
life. She quit her job as an elementary school secretary because of
controversy from the trial, though she now works as a secretary in
a local school district. She said she has received death threats
and harassing telephone calls. But, she said, she has never changed
her mind about what she saw that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sure,'' she said. ``There's never been a doubt in my
mind. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEFENSE PURSUES HITMAN THEORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Graham's lawyers are pursuing a theory that the man
he was convicted of killing, Bobby Lambert, was actually murdered
by a hit man.
</P>
<P>
   Federal court records indicate that Lambert had been arrested in
Oklahoma City in August 1980 on charges of drug smuggling. Federal
officials had subpoenaed him in hopes that he would testify against
higher-ups in the alleged drug operation.
</P>
<P>
   Just prior to his murder, Lambert had been seen inside a grocery
store with a thick wad of bills. ``We thought he was killed for his
money, said Steve Beck, the head Drug Enforcement Administration
agent in Oklahoma City at the time of the murder, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But police found $6,000 in cash in Lambert's back pocket after
his killer fled. ``That makes it seem rather strange to me, that it
was a robbery,'' Beck, now a private investigator, said in a
telephone interview. ``That does cast a rather funny connection on
the shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston district attorney has dismissed the possibility of a
hitman as ``pure speculation.''

FACING ELIMINATION, PACERS FACE LONG LIST OF WHAT-IFS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It has been a place of advantage all season long,
a place where hardly anyone wins besides the Indiana Pacers. So how
odd it would be for the Los Angeles Lakers to hug and dance while
wearing championship caps amid the throwback features of Conseco
Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, down by three games to one in the four-of-seven-game
National Basketball Association finals, claim they will not let
that happen, that there will be no Lakers' celebration at all, let
alone on their beloved floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have that,'' Indiana forward Jalen Rose said. ``We've
got to find a way to play with force and not let them celebrate on
our home court.''
</P>
<P>
   While almost no one except for the Pacers' players, coaches and
fans thought Indiana would win this series, the Lakers' coronation
is now all but inevitable. No team has recovered from a 3-1 deficit
to win a championship, and if the Lakers stumble Friday in Game 5,
they will have two chances to make amends at home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Pacers, at least on the surface, remain optimistic,
convinced that they will shock the basketball world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be easy, but at the same time I don't think
it's going to be as hard as it's made out to be,'' said Mark
Jackson, Indiana's point guard. ``It's going to be a difficult
task, but one that we can accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Pacers did not win Game 4, how will they manage to
defeat the Lakers even twice in a row?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indiana played a terrific game Wednesday on its home floor, and
still left disappointed. The Pacers foiled the best defense in the
league, shooting 50 percent from the field and scoring 118 points.
They hit 10 of 19 3-pointers and 24 of 28 free throws. Though
beaten badly on the offensive backboards, the Pacers stayed nearly
even off the glass over all, grabbing only three fewer rebounds
than the Lakers. And Indiana got 24 points from center Rik Smits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot the ball extremely well from the field, from the
3-point line, the free-throw line,'' said Indiana coach Larry Bird.
``It's very disappointing to lose a game when you shoot that well.
We felt we played very well. We just lost the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller, who had done slight damage to his reputation for
great clutch play by going 0 for 7 in the fourth quarters of the
first three games, was phenomenal in Game 4, making 6 of 9
3-pointers in scoring 35 points, including 19 after the third
quarter. But he missed a potentially game-winning 3-pointer in the
final seconds of overtime, and admitted that he will wonder about
the way things went.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of what-ifs, personally for myself,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three moves by the Pacers can be second-guessed.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was Miller's decision to shoot a 3-pointer instead
of a 2-pointer with Indiana trailing by 120-118 with 5.9 seconds
left in overtime. Shaquille O'Neal was on the bench after fouling
out, so why didn't the Pacers try to take their chances in a second
overtime?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so much worried about the shot because I had a great
look at it,'' said Miller, who had to arc the ball higher than
usual to get it over the outstretched arms of the 6-foot-10-inch
Robert Horry. ``But I was talking to Mark in the back, wondering if
we should have went for 2 or not. But with 5.9 seconds left and the
play we ran, that's not enough time to get a 2 off. If we're going
to lose, I want to lose with me shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Travis Best shot a 15-foot airball with three
seconds to play in regulation and the score tied.
</P>
<P>
   Why was Best shooting the ball instead of Miller or Rose? The
Pacers inbounded the ball to Best with 17 seconds remaining and he
pounded his dribble for 14 seconds. There was time to attempt to
get the ball to Miller, but Bird liked Best's matchup against
O'Neal, who had switched onto him off a pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked what I'd seen when Shaq was on him,'' Bird said. ``He
was trying to make a move. Shaq was backing up. He had a look at
the basket, just didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the issue of Smits' absence in the fourth
quarter. All series long the Pacers talked about needing to get
more production out of Smits, who averaged just 7.3 points and 4.3
rebounds through the first three games. He hit 11 of 14 shots
Wednesday night, only to be benched the entire fourth quarter. The
strategy was to play Sam Perkins and let him hack Shaq. Perkins
committed four fouls in the quarter, and O'Neal made 6 of 11 free
throws. When Smits went back into the game during overtime, he
scored 8 points. Would the outcome have been different if Smits,
who finished with four fouls, had played in the fourth?
</P>
<P>
   All but over the cliff, the Pacers said it is futile to ponder
what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no time to worry about that,'' Jackson said. ``If you
dwell on that, then this thing could be over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Conseco. &QL;

   THE REFORM PARTY: WAR CLOUDS OVER LONG BEACH
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's convention is taking on some of the trappings
of a World Wrestling Federation spectacle, with partisans
``woofing'' at each other on the Internet and demanding extra
security guards for the thriller of a nominating show in Long
Beach, Calif., in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``COME ON BABY, lets ROCK 'cause we've already LOCKED and
LOADED!!!!!!'' a Texas party functionary said in an e-mail exchange
between party members quarreling over Pat Buchanan's slow progress
toward the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Buchanan have no real candidate to oppose him and
have begun warning of credentials challenges and possible violence
at the convention. ``I anticipate some emotional, physically
aggressive people confronting other people,'' said Cedric Scofield,
a party committee member. ``We need more security.'' He proposed
that floor bouncers be hired.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerry Moan, the party chairman, said opponents of Buchanan's
views may present a bigger problem outside the convention center.
Accordingly, he has moved more funds to perimeter security.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH SNUBS KENNEDY FOE
</P>
<P>
   It would seem like an easy decision for the Republican
presidential contender to endorse the Republican challenger to Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. George W. Bush of Texas knows how to walk around a
political minefield when he sees one. Asked yesterday about Jack E.
Robinson, the only Republican candidate to collect enough
signatures to take on Kennedy, Bush said at Logan International
Airport in Boston, ``It's hard to endorse somebody I've never heard
of.'' Earlier in the day he told radio station WBZ: ``I'm very
close to Governor Cellucci. I'm going to take my advice from
Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   After some uncomplimentary news articles, Robinson, a
39-year-old businessman, released an 11-page list of embarrassing
incidents in his life. Cellucci, who had originally backed
Robinson, dropped his support.
</P>
<P>
   GOP AVOIDS FLORIDA FIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to avoid a divisive primary and protect their hold on a
U.S. Senate seat, Florida Republican leaders and Gov. Jeb Bush
orchestrated a political shuffle that left Rep. Bill McCollum as
the party's presumptive Senate nominee and shifted his chief
opponent to a race for state office. That opponent, state Education
Commissioner Tom Gallagher, announced Thursday that he would seek
his old job as insurance commissioner, deferring to McCollum in the
race to succeed Sen. Connie Mack, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum was far ahead in the money race but the primary was
likely to have been tough, and could have left the winner weakened
in the general election against the Democratic candidate, Bill
Nelson, the current insurance commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida Democrats are disappointed that the Republicans
will skirt an intramural fight, many believe that McCollum, who was
a House impeachment prosecutor, will make the better foil.

   The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the nation's gun

by Canada's 2 territories and 6 of its 10 provinces, the court
upheld the 1995 Firearms Act, which requires the licensing of all

A SON OF CHICAGO: WILLIAM MICHAEL DALEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif.)  (With GORE-COELHO) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To some, Commerce Secretary William Daley is as
affable, self-effacing and disarmingly smooth as any top-drawer
lobbyist in this town. To others, he is the perfect child of
Chicago's gritty machine politics: brass-knuckles tough, vindictive
and, at times, searingly blunt.
</P>
<P>
   But there is broad agreement among those who know him that Daley
is perhaps the best political mind in President Clinton's Cabinet.
And for that reason, many Democrats cheered the announcement
Thursday that Daley will be leaving the administration next month
to become chairman of Vice President Al Gore's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is genetically prepared for this,'' said Sen. Richard
Durbin, D-Ill. ``Politics is in his bloodstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley, the youngest son of Chicago's most famous mayor and the
brother of its current one, inherits a campaign that has been
described by some Democrats as adrift, dispirited and plagued by
divisions. And while no one expects Daley to fix all those problems
by himself, many Democrats say he brings the right mixture of tools
to the task.
</P>
<P>
   He is a centrist with strong ties to business leaders at a time
when Gore is trying to position himself as a prudent manager of the
economy. He is a consummate behind-the-curtains manager adept at
avoiding the kind of controversy that has at times bedeviled the
Gore campaign. And he is tough enough an infighter to enforce
discipline on a campaign that has sometimes lacked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know there is a price to pay if you cross him,'' said Rep.
Robert Matsui, D-Calif. ``And that's extremely important in running
a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Daley, 51, has been a central figure in the
administration's push to get Congress to give China permanent
normal trade relations. Congressional and White House officials
credit Daley not only with being one of the administration's best
lobbyists on the China bill, but also its chief strategist. It was
Daley who drew up the initial list of undecided Democrats to focus
on. And it was Daley who had the best instincts about how to handle
each one, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His instincts are such that he knows when to be exceedingly
blunt, and when to be softer and gentler in tone,'' said Charlene
Barshefsky, the U. S. trade representative. ``He is very affable
and on a dime can become very steely.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Daley's effective handling of the China bill did not sit
well with leaders of organized labor, and Daley will have to move
swiftly to smooth things over with Gore's union allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some wounds out there in the labor community that
need to be heeled,'' said Rep. Rod Blagojevich, a Chicago Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has never run for office, Daley has had ample
experience helping on the presidential campaigns of Walter Mondale,
Michael Dukakis and Clinton. But it was at his father's feet, and
in the mayoral campaigns of his brother, Richard, that Daley
clearly learned his politics.
</P>
<P>
   David Axelrod, a Democratic consultant from Chicago who has
worked for the Daleys, tells a story about how Daley responded to a
newspaper column by Mike Royko describing Daley and his brother,
Richard, as ``too dumb to tie their shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hollering back, Daley called the columnist and said,
``I just want you to know we're all wearing loafers now.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Daley's brother, John, fondly describes how his
younger sibling consistently escaped punishment at their Roman
Catholic school, even though he was engaging in the same kinds of
pranks as the other kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never got caught,'' said John, a Cook County commissioner.
``You couldn't talk the Jesuits out of anything. He just knew how
far to go. He was very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Daley's suave exterior can hide a vindictive
personality. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a Chicago Democrat, said that
Daley called his office and berated one of his aides after
Gutierrez endorsed former Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's the kind of Machiavellian person behind the
prince,'' Gutierrez said.

   William Michael Daley was born on Aug. 9, 1948 in Chicago, where
he stayed for all of his schooling: De La Salle High School, Loyola
University and John Marshall Law School.
</P>
<P>
   He was president and chief operating officer of the Amalgamated
Bank of Chicago from 1990 to 1993, and has been a partner in one of
Chicago's biggest law firms, Mayer, Brown &AMP; Platt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, after Daley helped run the Clinton campaign in
Illinois, the president tapped him to shepherd the North American
Free Trade Agreement through Congress. And in 1996, Clinton chose
him to replace Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, who had died in a
plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Loretta, have three children. The family still
resides in Chicago, where Daley returns on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Today, both Democrats and Republicans who support the China bill
lamented that Daley would not be around to help push the measure
through the Senate. But Democrats said they are counting on Daley
to bring the same efficiency to managing the Gore campaign that his
father brought to running Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill has the best political gut of anyone I've ever known,''
said Axelrod, the Chicago consultant. ``I think that is an
inherited trait.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton met with the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, for an unusually long session at the White House on
Thursday to try to set the stage for a summit meeting here, but
they did not resolve one of the immediate obstacles to convening
the meeting, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, efforts by the administration to get the summit meeting
off the ground are expected to accelerate in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The official said negotiations between Palestinian and Israeli
officials now under way in Washington would continue for the next
few days. The administration's senior envoy, Dennis Ross, will fly
to the region next week and Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright will go in 10 days to assess whether a summit meeting is
feasible, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, is reported to want the
three-way summit meeting _ Barak, Arafat and Clinton as mediator _
soon after July 4, a timetable that also dovetails with Clinton's
need to hold a meeting before the presidential election season gets
under way in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   During their more than three hours together Thursday, Clinton
and Arafat dwelled on all the major issues of a final peace accord,
paying particular attention to the proposed borders for a
Palestinian state, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   There was little discussion, he said, of Arafat's insistence
that the Israeli government proceed with the final withdrawal from
land on the West Bank called for in the Oslo accords of seven years
ago. Arafat has threatened that if the Israelis fail to make the
final pullout, which would give the Palestinians more than 80
percent of the territory on the West Bank, he would refuse to go
ahead with a summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared from the account by the senior administration
official that Clinton decided to defuse that immediate issue by
putting it to one side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't try to move him off it,'' the official said, adding
that the withdrawal remained ``very important'' to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader publicly kept up the pressure, saying as
he emerged from the White House that Barak was unwilling to do what
he had promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Barak up to this moment lacks a desire to work with us in
order to achieve a comprehensive lasting peace in the region,''
Arafat said. He singled out the slow rate of release of Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails. The Palestinian leader said that
Barak was offering to free only three prisoners. ``That's an
insult,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have sounded notes of guarded
optimism and then slight pessimism in the last two weeks as they
have concentrated on pushing the Israelis and the Palestinians
close enough on the issues to merit a summit meeting for a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In Lisbon two weeks ago, Clinton said that a summit meeting was
``in view'' but made clear that substantial progress was needed to
narrow the gaps on the vital issues of the shape of a Palestinian
state, the future of refugees and the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the White House does not want is a summit meeting that
collapses. ``For a date for a summit we have to be in a position to
have at least a reasonable chance to reach bridging solutions,''
the senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the official said, the two leaders are not yet
prepared to make the necessary decisions on the big issues, and the
talks between the negotiating teams have not yet played out.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's choreography for bringing the summit
meeting together includes a three-pronged approach: the
Palestinian-Israeli talks now in progress in Washington, involving
senior officials from both sides; visits by Albright to the region;
and one-on-one sessions of Clinton with Barak and with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Thursday's session at the White House appeared to
focus on Clinton's sounding out Arafat on what ground he was
willing to give and what Arafat needed from Barak to make a summit
meeting work.
</P>
<P>
   But a fundamental tension has infused the efforts since Clinton,
while in Lisbon, announced his desire for a summit meeting, Israeli
and Palestinian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Israeli side, ``there is a feeling that Arafat wants more
without giving,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, there is an intense frustration, a
Palestinian official said. Israel has threatened that if the
Palestinians reject its request to postpone the final pullout, it
will stick to a decision of the government of Benjamin Netanyahu
and give up only one percent of the West Bank.

SERB OPPOSITION LEADER IS SHOT IN MONTENEGRO 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ A well-known Serbian opposition leader,
Vuk Draskovic, was shot and wounded on Thursday night at his home
by gunmen, an adviser said. Draskovic was hit twice in the head
when attackers fired through a window from his garden, but he was
wounded only slightly, said Ognjen Pribicevic, Draskovic's chief
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hit in the ear and on the left side of the head,''
Pribicevic said, adding that Draskovic had been taken to a hospital
and was released in three hours.
</P>
<P>
   As leader of the largest opposition party, the Serbian Renewal
Movement, Draskovic is the most important opponent to President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. Draskovic has been leading a
campaign for early elections to remove Milosevic from power.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his charisma, he has failed to mobilize much support on
the streets in recent months or to unite convincingly with other
opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the government moved to close his party's television
station, Studio B, a sign of its irritation with its presence.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic apparently feared for his safety, and immediately
traveled to Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic in the Yugoslav
Federation, and asked for protection from President Milo
Djukanovic, who leans toward the West.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has repeatedly accused the government of trying to
kill him and has warned that Belgrade is waging a campaign of
``state terrorism'' to maintain its power.
</P>
<P>
   His party faults Belgrade for an automobile accident in the fall
in which Draskovic's brother-in-law and bodyguards were killed.
Draskovic adds that the truck that slammed into the car was
intending to kill him and his wife, who were in the same convoy.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials have also suggested that the government was
behind recent high-profile murders in Belgrade, including that of
Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic was watching television alone in his home in a seaside
resort, Budva, when the attackers fired at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   He thought that there were two attackers who approached through
the garden and broke the window glass as they fired, Pribicevic
said. Draskovic managed to escape to a neighbor's apartment, from
where he was taken to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   From the hospital, he spoke by telephone with his wife, who had
remained in Belgrade. He left the hospital for an unknown
destination.

BUCHANAN, IN NEW YORK, LINKS GANG SEX ATTACKS TO CRITICISM OF
POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Buchanan suggested Thursday that ``liberal
cop-bashing'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton and others had encouraged
the sexual assault spree by a gang of men in Central Park on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is running for president, launched, unbidden, into
an attack on the first lady and Senate candidate in the midst of a
news conference he held near the United Nations to denounce the
proposed creation of an international war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a Republican who is seeking to run as the Reform Party
candidate, suggested the Central Park sexual assaults were, at
least in part, the product of declining police morale caused by
criticism of police tactics over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liberal cop-bashing by folks like Hillary Rodham Clinton
is in part responsible for the new diminishment of the morale of
the police,'' Buchanan said at a news conference that was sparsely
attended, reflecting a significantly lower profile in his latest
bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it would not surprise me in the least,'' he said, ``if a
lot of these cops were far less aggressive in defending citizens,
and far less likely to get involved in what they ought to be doing
_ which is, quite frankly, busting a few heads and taking those
folks to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for an example of ``liberal cop-bashing'' by Clinton,
Buchanan noted the time she referred to the ``murder of Amadou
Diallo,'' just before the trial of the four police officers who
shot him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an outrageous, outrageous, slanderous, vicious,
stupid statement,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   The police officers were subsequently acquitted. Clinton has
said that she misspoke in describing the shooting as a murder, and
apologized for her remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, campaigning Thursday on Long Island, near the home base
of her Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, responded by attacking
Buchanan again. ``This is another in a long line of Mr. Buchanan's
attacks on people _ anti-Semitic comments, his racist and bigoted
comments,'' she said. ``So I'm not surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Thursday that she was ``outraged'' by the incident
in the park. And Buchanan described it as ``an act of barbarism and
animalism.''

   WASHINGTON _ Personal wealth and power do not necessarily
correspond on Capitol Hill, with some of the leading members of
Congress holding few assets and avoiding the booming stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, took the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader and a former
college professor, has no assets beyond a checking account. He
supplements his income of $151,800 with an annual teacher's pension
of less than $2,500, according to House personal financial
disclosures released Thursday. (Other lower ranking members make an
annual salary of $136,700.)
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, earned a salary of
$175,400 for 1999. He reported assets from investments and real
estate, but also had considerable liabilities. Hastert listed
property, including a 270-acre farm in Shipman, Ill., a town house
in Washington and an opera house in Plainfield, Ill. The building,
which he now rents out, once housed a theater and his father's
restaurant. Hastert valued the farm and opera house at $100,001 to
$250,000; rental income from the farm and opera house, he said, was
$15,001 to $50,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   He is paying mortgages on the property. And he signed loans for
home repair, and co-signed several loans with family members.
</P>
<P>
   The House minority leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, reported a
mutual fund worth $15,001 to $50,000, with several other
investments of less than $15,000. But the cost of education
countered his assets. Gephardt, who earned $151,800 in salary, owed
$50,001 to $100,000 on one student loan, and $15,001 to $50,000 on
another. He also borrowed $15,001 to $50,000 on his life insurance
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, and the House's
third-ranking Republican, valued his Exxon stock at $50,001 to
$100,000 and reported a bank account of $1,001 to $15,000. He has
no significant debt.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1970s, members of Congress have been required
each year to file broad financial disclosure reports that reveal
that they do not have holdings that might pose a conflict of
interest. The rules permit the members to provide a rough snapshot
of their assets and debts.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., was very active in the stock market last year, buying and
selling technology stocks. He made more than 100 stock transactions
last year, sometimes buying and selling stocks on the same day.
Torricelli's stock holdings were valued from $260,000 to $775,000,
for technology companies like Amazon.com and CompUSA Inc., the
computer retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Torricelli bought $1,001 to $15,000 worth of the
DrKoop.com stock on Aug. 5 and sold it the same day. He listed a
purchase of the same amount of Novell stock on Aug. 10 and sold it
the next day. And on Aug. 11, Torricelli bought $15,001 to $50,000
worth of AmeriTrade stock and sold it on Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who is a former investment banker,
reported assets of $1 million to $5 million and $500,000 to $1
million in two Merrill Lynch accounts. He also listed $100,001 to
$250,000 in a Longview Capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, John Rockefeller IV, D-W Va., reported three
blind trusts worth more than $80 million. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill.,
listed stock he owns in the Bank of Montreal that he inherited from
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Not all members of the Senate were drawn to the stock market.
Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., reported two credit union accounts
of less than $1,000, and at least $15,000 of debt owed to
Mastercard. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., held a Senate credit union
savings account of $1,001 to $15,000 and property in his home state
worth $200,001 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's disclosure statements, which were made public on
Wednesday, were not without some quirky details. Sen. John Breaux,
D-La.,, won $5,625 in prize money at a charity tennis tournament on
Long Island. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, received $241.68 for a
brief appearance on the CBS television series ``Walker, Texas
Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, earned composing income of $6,125 from Prime Recordings
Inc. of Provo, Utah, and royalties of $12,048. Hatch, who has
written lyrics for hundreds of songs, and has produced or
co-produced seven CDs, says on his Web site that his music focuses
on ``family, faith and love of country.'' He reported $500 of
royalties from MTV, the music television network.

SAYS REPORT FROM FOREIGN PRODUCERS 
</HEADLINE>
   U.S. CURBS ON STEEL IMPORTS ARE COSTLY, By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. trade restrictions on imported steel have cost
customers in this country as much as $150 billion in the last three
decades, according to a new study sponsored by foreign steel
producers.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by lawyers for foreign steel makers and
supported by the American Institute for International Steel, was
dismissed by the Clinton administration as biased.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-page study takes aim at U.S. anti-dumping laws that it
says protect domestic companies, including Bethlehem Steel and
USX-U.S. Steel Group, against more efficient competitors in Japan,
South Korea, Brazil and other nations. Those protections and some
government subsidies effectively raise the cost of everything with
steel components, from aircraft to kitchen utensils, it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``American consumers and taxpayers have paid a high price to
protect an antiquated industry that refuses to modernize and
compete fairly,'' said Horst Buelte, chairman of the steel group.
``The vital interests of many key U.S. business sectors have been
sacrificed to the narrow demands of the U.S. steel industry.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. steel-making companies have waged an intense campaign to
persuade the Clinton administration to protect them against some
foreign competitors in recent years. The companies pointed to a 30
percent surge in imports in 1998 that undercut the profitability of
domestic steel makers, forcing layoffs and plant closings.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the U.S. steel makers and unions, President
Clinton has imposed punitive duties on a wide range of steel
imports, saying they were sold in this country at artificially low
prices. In response this week, South Korea filed a case against the
United States at the World Trade Organization, protesting measures
Washington took to limit imports of line pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. LaRussa, acting under secretary of commerce for
international trade, called the study ``totally ridiculous and
absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to argue that the U.S. market is not the most
open market in the world, especially in steel,'' he said.

PUTIN CALLS ARREST OF MEDIA COMPANY OWNER `EXCESSIVE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS graf at end with quote from newspaper)  
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that
prosecutors had gone ``too far'' in jailing the owner of Russia's
largest independent media company two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that this is excessive,'' Putin said
during his state visit to Berlin. ``I think it should have been
possible to handle this without an arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's remarks were the first time that he has criticized the
detention of Vladimir Gusinsky, the owner of Russia's largest media
company, Media-MOST, an influential amalgam of newspaper, radio and
television interests that had been critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has repeatedly insisted that he cannot influence the
actions of Russia's prosecutor general, Vladimir Ustinov. And
Thursday Putin stopped short of saying the case against Gusinsky
was without merit.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments raised questions not only about the arrest, but
about Putin's control over his Kremlin aides, many of whom he
inherited from President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin was not aware of Gusinsky's arrest, as he has said
before, and did not approve of it, as he said Thursday, the
question was who ordered it, and why. Some in the Russian capital,
including Gusinsky's aides, traced the actions against Media-MOST
to Alexander Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff, who is close to
the inner circle of the former Kremlin regime, known in Moscow as
the ``family.''
</P>
<P>
   And if senior Kremlin officials had acted behind his back, the
question was whether Putin would try to take action against them,
and thus test his political independence. The Russian president is
expected to return to Moscow on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility was that Putin was simply trying to distance
himself from a decision that had sparked intense criticism at home
and abroad. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott appeared
in an unusual taped interview on Gusinsky's NTV television network
Thursday and warned that government interference with the press
will hurt Russia's standing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday Robert Strauss, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia,
canceled plans to lead several top U.S. business executives to
Moscow for a meeting with Putin. The trip was to have been
conducted under the auspices of the U.S.-Russia Business Council, a
Washington trade association. Strauss, who said he knew Gusinsky
when serving in Moscow, said it would be inappropriate to promote
commercial investment there now because the jailing of the top
media executive well known for criticizing Putin ``raised political
and legal questions'' about Russia under its new president.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of embezzling
millions of dollars in state property. He has denied the charges,
and his detention is widely seen in Russia as a
politically-motivated campaign against a powerful media tycoon who
had criticized the government and made enemies in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year old Gusinsky owns the nation's only independent
television network, one that avoided the Kremlin's embrace during
the recent parliamentary and president elections, and has provided
reasonably objective coverage of the brutal war in Chechnya. He
also controls several important publications.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was put in jail, Russia's most powerful business
tycoons have assailed the move, fearing it could be the start of a
crackdown that could lead to their detention as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky remains in the Butyrskaya prison. The chief prosecutor
in the case, Valery Nikolayev, said that charges would be brought
against Gusinsky on Friday, and suggested that Gusinsky might be
released afterwards pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   As the furor over the arrest continued, Geni Reznik, Gusinsky's
lawyer stood outside the prison and read a two-page handwritten
statement that he said came from his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political intrigue organized by high-ranking
representatives of the government who consider freedom of speech a
danger,'' the statement said. ``During the first interrogation, I
witnessed a laughable scene as two investigators quarreled and
interrupted one another for half an hour as they tried to say what
they suspect me of.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Thursday, Putin said Gusinsky should not have
been jailed, but merely questioned. Rather than put him in jail,
``It would have been possible to insist that he not leave the
country,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ustinov, the prosecutor general, is believed to have been
appointed by Putin at the insistence of Kremlin aides who are close
to members of the Yeltsin family and the financier Boris
Berezovsky, including Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff.
Virtually nobody in Russia believes that the prosecutor is truly
independent of powerful political and financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   One view of Putin's role is that he is not yet fully in control
of the Kremlin, but is dependent on aides like Voloshin, who helped
bring him to power. That runs counter to the image that Putin has
sought to foster of a decisive leader who is determined to bring
order to Russia. The other view is that Putin was disingenuous when
he insisted he was not behind the campaign against Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The first scenario, the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets observed
acerbically Thursday, ``means the presi- dent is weak and not in
charge.'' The second scenario ``means he is the main persecutor of
dissent.''

DALEY'S DEPUTY LIKELY TO BE NAMED ACTING COMMERCE SECRETARY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is likely to name Robert L.
Mallett, the deputy commerce secretary, as acting commerce
secretary to replace William M. Daley as a result of the
announcement that Daley would lead the Gore campaign, an
administration official said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the White House chief of staff, John Podesta,
convened a meeting Thursday afternoon to begin discussing
candidates to replace Daley for the six months remaining in
Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the White House had not made a final
decision whether Mallett would be formally nominated to succeed
Daley but that he was on a short list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mallett ranks as the No. 2 official at Commerce, he keeps
a relatively low profile. He is perhaps best known for his work on
developing trade ties with Africa and working on disease prevention
and poverty relief there. He also helps oversee the department's
many agencies, including the Census Bureau and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   A 1979 graduate of Morehouse College, Mallett attended Harvard
Law School and later worked as legal counsel to former Sen. Lloyd .
Bentsen, D-Texas, and as deputy mayor of the Washington city
government.

BOEING TO SELL ST. LOUIS PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. has put a St. Louis, Mo., manufacturing
unit on the auction block, taking an ambitious step in its campaign
to become a leaner player in the aerospace and defense markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced Thursday it is talking to a several
potential buyers about its St. Louis fabrications business,
expected to fetch hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the latest, and one of the strongest signs in recent
years, that Boeing is serious about shedding under-utlized plants
and assets as it strives to become a leaner competitor. The
potential sale, however, also left 1,665 Missouri-based employees
in limbo over their professional future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are really trying to rethink what they (should)
be doing and what they should not be ... doing,'' said Sam
Pearlstein, an analyst for First Union Securities. ``We have been
hearing (about) it for awhile, but we have never seen any major
steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives tried to assure the targeted employees
Thursday, saying they expect the new boss to hire most of the
workers.
</P>
<P>
   They backed up that assurance with provisions that call for the
final buyer to take on the existing pension plans and wage scales,
according to a congressional staffer briefed on the transition
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Boeing warned workers to brace for some initial
reductions once the deal is signed, which could take 3 to 6 months,
according to one union leader. Eventually the sale could create new
business and jobs at the facility, according to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   While the union can't block the sale, it ``can and will insist
that all current wages, benefits and other terms and conditions of
work remain in full force'' for the 1,127 union workers, said Tom
Buffenbarger, president of the International Association of
Machinists, in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Boeing had little choice but to sell an asset that
is only operating at 40 percent of capacity to an owner who could
perhaps expand the business and workforce, said Jerry Daniels,
president of Boeing's Military Aircraft and Missile Systems group
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a prime contractor, we must focus on the strategic aspects
of our business _ aerospace technology development, program
development and the core competencies at which Boeing is or intends
to be the best in the world,'' Daniels said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is also prepared to cut the plant loose because it will
make it easier for the company to land the lucrative Joint Strike
Fighter contract _ a federal prize worth as much as $300 billion _
and other customers, according to Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street embraced the move, perhaps viewing it as a sign that
Boeing is intensifying its campaign to strip away assets outside
its key businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pushed Boeing's stock up $1.56, or 4 percent, to
$40.38 in trading Thursday. By comparison, the broad Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 26.87 points, or .3 percent, to 10714.82.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fits in line with the company strategy to outsource more,''
said Christopher Mecray, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. ``It's a neat
strategy and we would like to see more of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The asking price for the unit, which builds parts and composites
for Boeing's missiles and military jets, such as the F/A-18 E/F and
the F-15, wasn't available. But, the price could reach roughly $225
million, according to Paul Nisbet, who tracks Boeing for JSA
Research. Nisbet based his analysis on the price the Carlyle Group
paid Northrop Grumman Corp. for an aerospace unit earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Local union officials and Boeing officials are already
discussing the proposed sale and plan to sit down next week to
discuss the transition, according to Rick Smith, president of the
Machinists District 837 in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also put the fabrication unit up for sale only a day
after its chief financial officer, Micheal Sears, told financial
analysts the aerospace giant is likely to accelerate its effort to
consolidate operations in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear where that effort will hit next, but financial
observers expect Boeing to put other assets on the market. While
Boeing officials declined to speculate on any potential moves, at
least one analyst suggested some facilities in Wichita, Kansas,
could be sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have been surprised if it (Thursday's announcement)
had been part of Wichita,'' said JSA Research's Nisbet. ``I think
they will continue to look for units that they can not too
painfully pull out and sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Another obvious candidate for consolidation is California, where
Boeing is likely to get rid of some satellite building facilities
after it acquires Hughes Space and Communication.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence Thursday the plan would extend to the
Pacific Northwest, but it's conceivable it could reach Portland and
the Seattle-area, according to one financial observer.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tim Flynn, a spokesman for IAM District 751, said he
had heard nothing about Boeing selling units in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   But, even Daniels said the company would have to perform with
less in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business philosophy at work here is pretty simple. If
we're going to be healthier, we're going to have to control costs
and do more with fewer assets,'' Daniels told the Associated Press.

OLD NEIGHBORHOODS APPRAISE DE LA HOYA, MOSLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An imposing two-story banner emblazoned with the
image of Shane Mosley adorns the front of a Denny's restaurant off
the 10 Freeway in Pomona, overlooking the town like a protective
father as his fight with Oscar De La Hoya approaches.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't miss it if you tried.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty miles away, the Oscar De La Hoya Youth Center has become a
pulsating hub - and godsend, according to some parents - in East
L.A. On this day, it's bustling with young boxers trying to emulate
the world champion while others play on computers and do their
homework.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Pomona, unaccustomed to a celebrity in their midst, are
kinder to their favorite son than those across town are to De La
Hoya. The Golden Boy, rich beyond his dreams, cannot win the hearts
of the predominantly Mexican-born population in his old
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many Pomona residents are only now learning of
Mosley, an undefeated fighter whose championship fight with De La
Hoya on Saturday at Staples Center is his first foray into big-time
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   They seem fascinated with his growing celebrity and pleased that
one of their own is making good.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, (begin ital)everyone(end ital) in East L.A. knows
about De La Hoya. Those who watched him grow up have a positive
image of the once-painfully shy boy while others - mostly the
Mexicans - appreciate his undeniable talent but find it difficult
to embrace him.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems clear: No one in either community is bigger than
Shane Mosley and Oscar De La Hoya at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   POMONA
</P>
<P>
   Pomona residents love talking about Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   The East-county town once produced a heavyweight champion, Mike
Weaver, but his star burned out quickly and he fought a generation
ago. Mosley, a young-looking 28, is fresh, exciting, charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   And he's one of theirs. Mosley could afford to live anywhere but
chose to buy a home a few blocks from the house in which he grew up
in Pomona, where his parents still live.
</P>
<P>
   He put it very simply: ``I like it here, I'm comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees at Denny's, which is owned by Miles Holland, a friend
of the Mosley family, all know him. He and his family have eaten
there regularly for years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after all the publicity surrounding Saturday's fight, more
and more people approach him with a big smile and an outstretched
hand. Their impressions? The first thing out of everyone's mouth is
the same: (begin ital)really(end ital) nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks to everybody, signs autographs. He's not conceited at
all,'' said waitress Belen Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   The affection goes beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Locals admit that if Pomona has an image, it's not necessarily
good. That's why they so readily embrace Mosley, who is nothing but
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He promotes a positive image,'' Holland said. ``And he cuts
through all the racial lines. He's just a good person, a successful
person who's still down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pomona has taken a lot of hits over the years, a lot
of negative stuff. When he stands up for Pomona, that's special.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Tharpe was Mosley's principal when the fighter attended
Roosevelt Elementary School, and now oversees Yorba Elementary,
where Mosley's 9- year-old son, Shane Jr., goes to school.
</P>
<P>
   Tharpe remembers the elder Mosley as a good kid from a good
family who had a ``big, beautiful smile.'' He never found trouble.
Today, the fighter speaks to grade-school children around town,
hoping to point them in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Manzanares, a friend of Shane Jr. at Yorba, is as big a
Shane Mosley fan as anyone on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great person for Pomona,'' the articulate fifth-grader
said. ``Sometimes on TV, he tells people he's from Pomona. Some
parts are bad and he still tells them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Araugo, the cook at Denny's and a resident of Pomona, is
proud to fix Mosley's meals. Araugo, a Mexican national, also is a
big boxing fan. His favorite fighter? No question: Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a home boy, a local guy,'' Araugo said proudly. ``And
he's going to take De La Hoya's (WBC welterweight) title on
Saturday. You just watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like De La Hoya. I've never liked him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EAST L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Velazquez, a part-time taxi driver and journalist in
Los Angeles, said he asked 100 passengers born in Mexico who they
hoped would win on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The result of his poll was predictable: 83 percent said Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Delgado, a 13-year-old born in Mexico and living in East
L.A., spends half his life at the youth center, which De La Hoya
established four years ago. Still, the boy, perhaps regurgitating
what he hears at home, didn't hesitate to express his dislike for
the center's benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really like Oscar,'' he said. ``He tries to be
Mexican, but he really isn't. His parents are, not him. He just can
never be.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one apparent reason Mexican nationals have a problem with
him. There are many others: the fact he twice beat Mexican idol
Julio Cesar Chavez, his pretty-boy image in a macho culture, his
sometimes-reluctant fighting style, perhaps the fact he tries
(begin ital)too(end ital) hard to earn their love and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Mexican-Americans, probably De La Hoya's strongest
fan base, he has his detractors. Their reasons? Jealousy, many
people suspect, or the fact he moved out of his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who has yearned to be universally loved, today seems
more willing than ever to accept the fact you can't please
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the facts of life,'' he said with a slight grin.
</P>
<P>
   However, all of the above is only half the story.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been touched by De La Hoya - even Mexican
nationals - often have a completely different opinion of him.
</P>
<P>
   Ask 12-year-old Jesus Salas, an aspiring boxer from the
neighborhood who trains at the youth center: ``He did all this for
us so we can come out and train, so we can succeed. He's proud to
be Mexican and it makes me proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Romy Diaz of East L.A., who has three kids who train and
study at the center: ``Hey, I'm a single mother. Where else would
my kids be? I notice a difference in them since they started coming
here, especially in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're learning more. Oscar's the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Rafaela Cortez, who still lives in the house next to the
four-unit apartment building in which De La Hoya grew up. She
remembers an active but quiet boy from a nice family who has
greeted her warmly when he has returned to the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good boy,'' she said through an interpreter. ``He's
doing a good job. The family was so poor. Now, he tries to help
people who are poor. I feel really proud of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he fights, I think, 'He has to win, he has to
win.'''
</P>
<P>
   Susana Ruiz, a Mexican national, runs a taco stand a block from
the youth center. She knows what some people say about De La Hoya
and is baffled by it. She sees clearly the value of the youth
center and other charitable commitments, the living proof that
those from East L.A. (begin ital)can(end ital) achieve tremendous
success in spite of obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   She even pointed out that he recently paid for the funeral when
relatives of a boy who spent time at the youth center were killed
in a car accident a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   This, she believes strongly, is what youngsters should strive to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand, I just don't understand,'' she said
through an interpreter, shaking her head. ``Since he was small, he
forced himself to work hard, to be someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who don't like him, they're jealous because they
can't do what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Few can, which is the reason people are talking about both
fighters - whether they like them or not.

LAZIO'S OPTION TRADING BEFORE '97 TAKEOVER IS CALLED UNUSUAL

 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY and FLOYD NORRIS    
 2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Rick A. Lazio entered Congress in 1993, he had an
unremarkable portfolio of personal investments. With mutual funds,
municipal bonds and a blue-chip stock or two, Lazio had salted away
his money in the kind of assets that countless other middle-class
suburbanites have embraced.
</P>
<P>
   But in August 1997, Lazio suddenly took what appeared to be an
uncharacteristic gamble: he spent $2,300 on speculative securities
trades in a company controlled by some of his campaign
contributors. The securities, called options, gave him the right to
buy shares at a fixed price for a limited time.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, Lazio's first foray into high-risk
options trading had paid off handsomely: stock in the company
soared on word of a possible takeover, and Lazio's $2,300 soon
became nearly $16,000, a roughly 600 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lazio, who is now the Republican nominee for the
U.S. Senate from New York, said there was nothing unusual about the
windfall. The spokesman, Dan McLagan, noted that a few months
earlier, Lazio had purchased stock in the company, Quick &AMP; Reilly,
a brokerage house, and that it had been the subject of takeover
rumors. Lazio had simply made a shrewd bet, McLagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Lazio decided to buy options for the first time,
instead of more stock in the company, McLagan said, ``We are not
talking about a tremendous amount of money. He was feeling bullish
on the company. It had good press and it was viewed as a takeover
target. So he invested a modest amount and was hoping for a good
return.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts in securities law, though, said Lazio's entry into
speculative options trading, coupled with his sizable short-term
profit on the deal and his relationship with company executives,
might have led to an insider-trading investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission had it been aware of the trades
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first-ever options purchase is always a red flag,'' said
Paul Gerlach, a partner in the law firm of Sidley &AMP; Austin and a
former associate director of enforcement for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his options profit, Lazio also made a 53 percent profit,
or $6,900, in Quick &AMP; Reilly stock in 1997 and 1998. Over all,
Lazio's trading in Quick &AMP; Reilly securities was far more
successful than any other trades he has made since going to
Washington, according to his financial disclosure forms.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Quick and Christopher C. Quick, former senior executives
of Quick &AMP; Reilly who along with other company executives have
donated at least $35,000 to Lazio's campaigns since 1995, said they
never discussed the company's stock with Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a director and an officer of Quick &AMP; Reilly, I had a legal
and ethical responsibility to the company and to the
shareholders,'' said Peter Quick, who was recently named president
of the American Stock Exchange. ``I absolutely did not talk to Rick
Lazio or any other investor about proprietary information.''
</P>
<P>
   While distinct in important respects _ Lazio engaged in a
different kind of speculation over a much shorter period, and did
not reap nearly as much money _ his options windfall contains some
echoes of the trading success of his Senate opponent, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton turned a $1,000 investment into nearly $100,000 over 10
months by trading in volatile commodities futures when her husband
was attorney general and then governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, by speculating and investing in Quick &AMP; Reilly,
Lazio was making a bet on a company over which he wielded influence
because he is on the House Banking and Commerce Committees. In
fact, members of the Quick family have been officers of the
Securities Industry Association, Wall Street's lobbying arm in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are no rules barring members of Congress from investing in
companies with interests before their committees, but some members
put their investments in blind trusts to avoid even the appearance
of a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Quick, a Long Island resident like Lazio, said in a
telephone interview that he knew Lazio from lobbying on Capitol
Hill. Lazio also serves on the Commerce subcommittee that oversees
many Wall Street issues.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $35,000 in campaign contributions made to Lazio by Quick
&AMP; Reilly executives, at least $8,000 came a month after Lazio sold
the options in September 1997. A Quick &AMP; Reilly subsidiary donated
$2,000 around the same time to a New York political action
committee set up by Lazio, Friends of Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio declined to be interviewed about Quick &AMP; Reilly or to
release copies of his stock-trading records and personal income tax
returns. Information about Lazio's trades was first gleaned from
annual financial disclosure statements that he is required to file
with the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The forms do not detail how much was paid for each share, or how
many shares were traded. That information was provided by Lazio's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal securities law, people are barred from trading in
a stock if they have obtained ``material nonpublic information''
from a company insider. It is legal to trade on the basis of
rumors, so long as the trader has not learned from an insider that
the rumors are true.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that Lazio's investments attracted the
attention of the SEC at the time. He described the investments in
financial disclosure forms in 1998 and they drew no publicity until
they were mentioned in an article in Newsday last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission usually begins such investigations when trading
volume and price movement before a deal is announced make it clear
that word of the deal has leaked. But such a circumstance was not
present in this instance, trading records show.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an extensive search of news articles before Lazio's
option purchase indicates that there was little public discussion
of Quick &AMP; Reilly as a takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   Options are speculative investments because they have only a
limited life. The option Lazio bought would have expired,
worthless, if the stock did not rise before Oct. 17, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's first purchase of Quick &AMP; Reilly came on Feb. 11, 1997,
a few weeks after he joined the House Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio paid about $25.50 a share, adjusted for a subsequent
split. The price rose above $26 when the split was announced a few
days later, but it soon slipped and by late June, Lazio's
investment was showing a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than take the loss, he bought more stock, paying $23.75 a
share on June 24, 1997. It was the first time he had ever added to
an existing holding since joining the House in 1993, records show.
</P>
<P>
   The date of the additional purchase, June 24, was also the day
that Quick &AMP; Reilly hired Gleacher NatWest, an investment banking
firm, to look for a company to buy Quick &AMP; Reilly. Quick &AMP; Reilly
hired Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Company to join the effort on July 10, 1997,
although neither action was disclosed to the public until several
months later.
</P>
<P>
   Volume in Quick &AMP; Reilly stock began to climb when Goldman Sachs
was hired, and the price began to edge up a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, 1997, Lazio bought the options on Quick &AMP; Reilly
stock. With the stock trading around $27 a share, Lazio bought
options entitling him to buy shares of Quick &AMP; Reilly for a price
of $30 anytime until Oct. 17, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,396 he spent on the options would vanish if the stock did
not rise above $30 before the expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   After the close of trading on Aug. 1, the Dow Jones News Service

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nineteen years ago, Bernadine Skillern caught a quick
glimpse of a man who had just committed a nighttime murder in a
grocery store parking lot. She identified him in court as Gary
Graham in testimony so strong that, despite almost no other
evidence, a jury found him guilty and later sentenced him to death.
</P>
<P>
   With Graham scheduled to die next Thursday and death penalty
opponents mounting an all-out effort to stop his execution,
Skillern testified again Thursday, this time in the court of public
opinion. Again and again at an hourlong news conference, Skillern
repeated her unwavering belief that Graham was the man she had seen
shoot Bobby Lambert outside a Safeway supermarket in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Graham shoot and kill Lambert on that parking lot in
1981,'' said Skillern, 53. ``That has not changed. That is not
going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Skillern's emotional but unflinching appearance was a pointed
rebuttal in a public relations battle that, until now, has been
dominated by advocates for Graham.
</P>
<P>
   With protests planned in Texas for next week, the Graham case is
attracting national attention and creating a political headache for
Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee who has staunchly defended capital punishment in his state
despite growing outside criticism focusing on, among other issues,
the quality of legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's advocates say his original trial was a travesty: His
court-appointed lawyer, Ronald G. Mock, conducted virtually no
investigation of the case and put on no witnesses during the guilt
phase of the trial. Ballistics tests showed that a .22-caliber
revolver taken from Graham after his arrest did not match the
murder weapon. Two other witnesses who could have contradicted
Skillern's story were never called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other case that has more doubts of innocence today
than this man right here,'' said Lawrence C. Marshall, legal
director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern
University, which has helped exonerate nine death row inmates in
Illinois and has taken on the Graham case.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting before a bank of television cameras at a conference
table Thursday morning, Skillern said she decided to speak out
because of ``misinformation'' about the case in the news media. On
the night of May 13, 1981, when she witnessed the murder, Skillern
said, she waited in her car with her two youngest daughters, then
nine and five, as her 14-year-old daughter shopped inside the
Safeway. It was about 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   According to the trial transcript, Skillern testified that she
saw Graham ``off and on about 60 seconds, maybe a little longer.''
She told the jury she saw the side of his face, then she blew her
horn, at which point she looked directly at his face for ``a split
second, maybe a second.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, she repeated roughly the same story, saying that she
saw his face from different angles three or four times over a
period of 90 seconds. Looking through her windshield, she said, she
looked directly into his face when he walked in front of her
headlights, about a car distance away. She honked her horn, she
said, because she wanted to stop him from shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Don't! Don't shoot,''' recalled Skillern, who held
her news conference in the office of her spokesman, Rusty Hardin, a
former state prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier in the week, Graham's advocates
praised Skillern's sincerity but raised questions about the
reliability of eyewitness testimony in general, particularly in the
absence of other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Thompson, a rape victim from North Carolina, told of
identifying her attacker, who was convicted and sentenced to
prison, only to later discover from DNA evidence that she had
identified the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   So certain was she of her initial identification that when she
was later shown a photograph of the real assailant, she said it was
not him. (He was ultimately convicted, based on DNA evidence.)
</P>
<P>
   Graham's advocates have suggested that detectives steered
Skillern toward identifying Graham by manipulating mug shots and
the subsequent lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But Skillern disputed any suggestion that she had been unduly
influenced. She said that she had picked out Graham's mug shot, but
that she had wanted to see him in person to confirm her belief that
he was the killer. When she saw him in the lineup the next day, she
said, she shuddered with fear, not realizing that he could not see
her behind a glass wall.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles will vote on
whether to commute Graham's sentence or go forward with the
execution. In 1993, the Board voted against commutation but
then-Gov. Ann Richards granted Graham a 30-day stay of execution
that led to his case being re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who did plead guilty to a string of armed robberies, was
17 at the time of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Graham has already received one stay sets up a
tricky legal situation. Under Texas law, a governor is only allowed
to grant an inmate one stay of execution.
</P>
<P>
   As is his custom, Bush has remained silent about the Graham
case, but a campaign aide said the governor's legal advisers
believe that under the law Bush cannot grant a stay. Advocates for
Graham say the law could be interpreted to mean one stay per
governor, but they say commutation or a conditional pardon, which
can occur only with the parole board's blessing, to allow a new
trial is their real goal.
</P>
<P>
   Skillern has not spoken publicly about the case since Graham was
nearly executed in 1993. She said her testimony has altered her
life. She quit her job as an elementary school secretary because of
controversy from the trial, though she now works as a secretary in
a local school district. She said she has received death threats
and harassing telephone calls. But, she said, she has never changed
her mind about what she saw that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sure,'' she said. ``There's never been a doubt in my
mind. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEFENSE PURSUES HITMAN THEORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Graham's lawyers are pursuing a theory that the man
he was convicted of killing, Bobby Lambert, was actually murdered
by a hit man.
</P>
<P>
   Federal court records indicate that Lambert had been arrested in
Oklahoma City in August 1980 on charges of drug smuggling. Federal
officials had subpoenaed him in hopes that he would testify against
higher-ups in the alleged drug operation.
</P>
<P>
   Just prior to his murder, Lambert had been seen inside a grocery
store with a thick wad of bills. ``We thought he was killed for his
money, said Steve Beck, the head Drug Enforcement Administration
agent in Oklahoma City at the time of the murder, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But police found $6,000 in cash in Lambert's back pocket after
his killer fled. ``That makes it seem rather strange to me, that it
was a robbery,'' Beck, now a private investigator, said in a
telephone interview. ``That does cast a rather funny connection on
the shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston district attorney has dismissed the possibility of a
hitman as ``pure speculation.''

JACKSON SET TO JOIN HANNUM IN RECORD BOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ In 1967 Alex Hannum set foot on a piece of
pristine NBA history. Ever since then he has been an island unto
himself, a survivor starved for more company. If it were up to him,
Hannum would have voted Bill Fitch onto his hallowed grounds in
1986, he would have voted Pat Riley on in 1994, he would have voted
Del Harris on and Chuck Daly on and Lenny Wilkens on, too.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there's a higher power at work. Not any network executive,
not the Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Fate is all.
</P>
<P>
   This being real life as the NBA knows it and not MTV or CBS or
NBC, there was no tidy script that assured a satisfying ending.
There was no guarantee that a coach who guided one team to pro
basketball's championship would win it all again with another
organization to render worthwhile all his sleepless nights and
physical suffering; all the backbiting and the backlashes; the
steady diet of two-legged rats.
</P>
<P>
   Destiny delivered NBA championships to Hannum when he was
coaching St. Louis in 1958 and Philadelphia nine years later. He
was the first coach to win NBA titles with two different teams.
Thirty-three years later, he remains the only one.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a lovely, rather lonely legacy. But Hannum, at long
last, is preparing for company. He's mulling over the wording of
the telegram he plans to send Phil Jackson in the event the Lakers
are able to close out Indiana in their best-of-seven championship
series.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson coached the Chicago Bulls to six NBA titles in eight
years before repairing to his ranch in Montana. He remained retired
for one year, until the Lakers' Jerry Buss and Jerry West offered
him the head seat at a Lakers' table that, while beautifully set,
had had Utah and San Antonio sweep the tablecloth right out from
under the players' noses in successive postseasons, creating a
terrible mess.
</P>
<P>
   In eight months Jackson has managed to sanitize things so that
Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal are breaking bread together and
passing the basketball and the team as a whole is defending so well
it cuts opponents off from second and third helpings of offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rooting for Jackson,'' Hannum said Thursday from his home
in San Diego. ``I can't think of a more deserving guy I'd wish
would get the honor (of joining his exclusive company.) I think the
guy is the greatest. I'm going over in my mind what I'm going to
say to him in the telegram. It'll be short and sweet but it'll
impart how much admiration I have for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers hold a 3-1 lead over the Pacers, and it wouldn't
surprise Hannum in the least if they send Indiana into a sticky
Midwestern offseason tonight, in Game 5 at Conseco Fieldhouse. It
would be just like Destiny, wouldn't you agree, to have Jackson
join Hannum's company exactly one year to the day after the Lakers
hired the ex-Chicago coach to help the Lakers out of their 12-year
championship slump?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great,'' Jackson said, smiling at the thought of
it.
</P>
<P>
   When Hannum heard last June 16 that the Lakers had hired Jackson
to replace Kurt Rambis (who had supplanted Del Harris earlier in
the lockout-shortened season), he knew his days as the only coach
to lead two different teams to an NBA title were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Hannum and Jackson already had so much in common, why shouldn't
they share this honor, too? Hannum played professionally with and
under Red Holzman in Rochester, N.Y. Jackson played professionally
for Holzman in New York, with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's longtime assistant, Tex Winter, played basketball with
Hannum at USC. Winter was the one who set up a lunch between Hannum
and Jackson (a few privileged others joined in) when the Bulls
played the Clippers at the Pond a couple years back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked basketball and found we agreed on many things,''
Hannum said. ``We both live by the credo that the game is the most
important thing, that it's about the fundamentals and having fun. I
remember walking away thinking I have complete respect for this
young coach. He's the glue in my opinion that holds that Laker team
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson doesn't come undone very easily. Opponents have put
together double-digit runs throughout the postseason, causing
Winter's hair to turn a paler shade of white. Time and again Winter
nervously has turned to Jackson to implore him to call a timeout,
only to see Jackson serenely studying his fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 54, is a communicator in the manner of a teacher, not a
tyrant. In his classroom, the triangle offense is a complex
equation and the hardwood floor the blackboard where his players
work out the answer, possession by painstaking possession.
</P>
<P>
   He is content to sit back and let his players problem-solve on
their feet because it's important to Jackson that they learn the
game of basketball and not simply regurgitate what he knows.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has been able to connect with everybody from the
wallflower (A.C. Green) to the class clown (O'Neal) to the whiz kid
(Bryant). If he has failed to reach anybody, it's Glen Rice, the
class rabble-rouser. And yet on Wednesday we couldn't help but
notice that Jackson ran the first play of Game 4 for Rice,
communicating his confidence in his frustrated forward without
saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil has always had the knack of getting his main players to
support the game he wants to play and then those guys lead
everybody else,'' said Jack Ramsay, who coached Portland to the NBA
crown in 1977. ``He just has that personal quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson burns his imprint into his teams. Sometimes, yes, with
incense - that ``aromatherapy stuff,'' as Bryant refers to it - but
always with the insight gleaned from a life lived uniquely as his
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He marches to his own beat,'' Ramsay said. ``He has his own
way of doing things, some of which fly in the face of traditional
coaching. He doesn't care. He's very confident, very calm. The
players see that. They like the fact he doesn't panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing yoga, bowing to Eastern religions, giving a nod to
Nietzsche; it's all consistent with Jackson's lifetime search for
peace and contentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about all the Zen stuff, all the trickery,'' said
reserve point guard Derek Fisher. ``It's really not that deep. His
composure and his poise; that's what sets Phil apart. All my
coaches have always been the kind to get after you. They rant a
little bit, they rave a little bit. That was part of the
adjustment, being around a coach who not many things seem to bother
him.''

NEW GOVERNMENT STANDARDS FOR BEEF USED IN SCHOOL LUNCHES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas)  By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has ordered new
health standards for the ground beef that the federal government
buys for the school lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, department officials said, the government
will require testing for disease-causing bacteria and set limits
for permissible levels. McDonald's and other large fast-food
companies already impose similar standards.
</P>
<P>
   Several consumer groups called attention to the lack of
government bacteria standards after one former school lunch
provider, Supreme Beef Processors of Dallas, won a court ruling
that allowed it to stay open despite having failed several
Agriculture Department inspections since April 1999. The department
announced this week that the plant had failed a fourth inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Under new regulations that use scientific testing at
meat-processing plants, the Agriculture Department should have been
able to withhold inspections, tantamount to suspending operations
at a meat plant, from Supreme Beef when it failed its third
inspection for salmonella contamination. But a permanent injunction
prevents the Agriculture Department from suspending inspections on
the basis of the failed salmonella tests.
</P>
<P>
   The order applies to ground beef in northern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Beef Processing has asked a judge to prevent the
department from using the salmonella standards ``as a basis to harm
Supreme Beef in any way, including the school lunch program.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the appeal, the department says it does not know if
its new purchasing standards, which take effect for the next buying
season, scheduled to begin shortly, will apply to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency is completely revamping our purchase specifications
and raising the bar for the next round of buying,'' said Ken
Clayton, associate administrator of the Agricultural Marketing
Service at the department. ``Our objective is to mimic what major
commercial users of ground beef are doing these days.'' That
includes testing for e-coli, salmonella and staphylococcus.
</P>
<P>
   The new specifications for school lunch purchases apply only to
ground beef bought by the federal government, not to ground beef
bought by school districts, which buy the majority of ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   When Supreme Beef failed its third salmonella test, the
Agriculture Department canceled its contract to buy ground beef for
school lunches, but it resumed purchases when it came to an
agreement with the company on what steps should be taken to comply
with the law. Now the government must recall all that is left of
the 2.3 million pounds of beef bought since February.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the department has sent a review team to the
Supreme Beef plant to look for other infractions, like mouse
droppings, exposure to unclean surfaces and improper temperatures.
Under ordinary circumstances, when the agency suspends inspection,
as it tried to do last year, it sends in a review team.
</P>
<P>
   If the review of the plant uncovers serious health risks, the
department will be able to shut the plant down because the judge's
final order does not prevent the department from closing Supreme
Beef if other unsanitary conditions are found.

DETECTIVES HOPE BASEMENT HOLDS CLUES TO BOY WHO DISAPPEARED IN
1979 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mont., Calif.)   By ROBERT D. McFADDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a spring day 21 years ago, 6-year-old Etan Patz
left his family's SoHo loft to walk to his school bus alone for the
first time, and vanished without a trace. Over the years, his
unsolved disappearance haunted investigators and came to symbolize
the agonies of families with children missing in America.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, the prime suspect in what investigators believe
was Etan's abduction and murder has been Jose A. Ramos, 55, a
former mental patient now imprisoned for molesting a boy in
Pennsylvania. While Ramos is said to have made admissions about
Etan, no proof _ or a body _ has ever been found. And Ramos is up
for parole in September.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, working with some urgency but quietly so as to
raise no false hopes of a breakthrough in the case, a dozen police
officers and detectives spent eight hours in the dark, filthy
basement of a tenement at 234 E. Fourth St. on the Lower East Side,
where Ramos was living on May 25, 1979, the day Etan vanished a
mile away.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected to find a body or even fragments of one after so
many years. In the boiler room, however, the police broke up a
rusted, unused 1939 coal-fired furnace and hauled it out in chunks,
and they carried away a dozen blue plastic barrels of ash and dirt
shoveled up from the basement floor. None of the officers at the
scene would comment on what they were up to.
</P>
<P>
   But Inspector Joseph Reznick, the commander of special
investigations, the Police Department's umbrella unit for major
cases and missing-persons investigations, said Thursday night that
all the materials are to be examined for DNA evidence that might
prove that Etan's body had been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge mass of material and my guess is it will take two
weeks to go through it,'' the inspector said. ``There will be no
overnight announcement. But this is a long-term investigation, and
I won't be satisfied until we've done everything possible to solve
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Ramos' parole hearing in September had given
urgency to the search for a crucial missing link. ``It's got our
clock ticking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Etan's parents, Stanley and Julie Patz, who still live in the
same loft at 113 Prince St. and who have campaigned successfully
over the years to raise the national consciousness about missing
children, were told about the search for new evidence, but were not
expecting any major breakthrough immediately. ``Don't hold your
breath about what they're going to find,'' Stanley Patz said.
``Don't forget, this is something we live with every day. It's
difficult to get excited.'' Nonetheless, he remained hopeful that a
case that has seen thousands of leads and theories come to nothing
might finally be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   While no one was ever charged in the disappearance and apparent
death of blond, blue-eyed Etan Patz, Ramos' name surfaced in the
inquiry in the late 1980s when Stuart R. GraBois, a former federal
prosecutor who had spent years working on the case, discovered
strong circumstantial evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, a drifter who had a history of trying to lure young boys
into sexual encounters in Montana, California and elsewhere, turned
out to be an acquaintance of a woman who had worked for the Patzes
as a baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, while Ramos was serving a seven-year sentence in
Pennsylvania for child molestation and was facing a new charge of
sexually molesting an 8-year-old boy, GraBois took the unusual step
of having himself named a deputy state attorney general to help
prosecute the suspect by pressuring him _ in exchange for leniency
_ to disclose his possible role in the Patz case.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense questioning by investigators, Ramos was said to
have admitted that he was with the boy the day he vanished, but he
denied abducting and killing him and did not disclose any details
that might have implicated him. He pleaded guilty in the
Pennsylvania case and was sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   There was no further development until April, when investigators
in New York reported that Ramos had told a cellmate that he had
taken Etan to his apartment on May 25, 1979, and had sexually
assaulted him. The cellmate quoted him as saying, ``Etan is dead,
there is no body, and there will never be a body.''
</P>
<P>
   The cellmate, who was not identified, also gave investigators
what he said was a map drawn by Ramos showing the Patz loft in SoHo
and, a mile to the east, his own building at 234 E. Fourth St. on
the Lower East Side. The building had been searched for evidence
years ago, but nothing had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Among other developments in the intervening years, forensic
scientists have developed techniques for extracting genetic
evidence from strands of DNA in fragments of material that might be
years old. That hope inspired investigators to look again at the
basement, where, they said, Etan's body may have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Four police vehicles _ a truck, a van, a patrol car and an
unmarked supervisor's car _ drew up about 8 a.m. outside the
six-story red-brick building between Avenues A and B, and a dozen
officers, many wearing heavy work gloves and carrying shovels,
picks, hammers and other equipment, went into the basement, a
warren of small rooms.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, the officers began rolling out barrels of ash
and dirt, and chunks of rusted iron that were pieces of the old
coal-fired boiler, unused since a new boiler was installed in 1998,
Reznick said.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the building could recall Ramos. But Victor Serrano,
36, who lives across the street at No. 241 and was a teenager in
1979, said he remembered the man. He said Ramos lived on the second
or third floor of No. 234, but seemed more like a homeless person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to come with a supermarket cart,'' Serrano said. ``He
was always friendly with all the kids,'' to whom he sometimes gave
toys. ``But I never got friendly with him. He always spooked me.''

WOODS SPARKLES IN THE FOG WITH A STROLL ON THE BEACH

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ On a foggy opening day of the U.S. Open,
Tiger Woods was crystal clear about his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   When Friday's play begins, nobody will have to look over his
shoulder to see if Woods is gaining ground. The world's No. 1
player shot a 6-under 65, seizing the clubhouse lead and setting
the pace like a runner who shoots out of the starting blocks and
forces everyone else to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   It was the best Open round of Woods' career and the lowest round
at the Open since 1980, when Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf each
shot first-round 63s at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But fog ruled the day at Pebble Beach, as play was suspended at
3:56 p.m. Pacific time and never resumed. Seventy-five of the 156
players were unable to complete their rounds. First-round play will
resume Friday at 6:45 a.m., and the second round is expected to
start at 8:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Woods seemed to execute almost any shot he needed during his
splendid round at Pebble Beach. When Woods missed greens, he got up
and down to save par. When opportunities for birdies presented
themselves, he usually capitalized. And when he faced difficult
putts, his stroke was smooth and confident.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players who finished, Woods held a one-stroke lead
over Miguel Angel Jimenez, who shot an opening-round 5-under- 66.
John Huston shot an opening-round 67, while Bobby Clampett, a
40-year-old CBS golf analyst playing his first Open since 1986,
finished with a 68.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders still on the course, Nick Faldo was 4-under
par through 13 holes; Corey Pavin and Kirk Triplett were 3-under
through 13 holes; and Loren Roberts was 3- under through seven
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Woods controlled his game and his emotions beautifully, looking
determined to win his third different major at age 24. When Vijay
Singh won the Masters this year, Woods had a difficult start,
opening with a 75 that forced him to play catch-up the rest of the
tournament. But in this major, Woods started on top of his game,
and he liked the view at the top of the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to play from a spot near the lead,'' said
Woods, who had six birdies in a bogey-free round. ``I'd much rather
have the lead than try to catch-up. If you're driving it well, and
driving in a lot of fairways, you're going to have some situations
where you can attack. Today, I was able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than a few prominent players struggled and dug
themselves a deep hole. David Duval, ranked No. 2 in the world,
opened with a 75, as did Sergio Garcia. Steve Jones and Mark
O'Meara each shot a 74, Nick Price shot 77, Jeff Sluman shot 78,
Craig Stadler shot 79 and John Daly withdrew after shooting an 83,
including a 14 at the par-5 No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods had no serious glitches. The highlights of his round
included a 20-footer for birdie at No. 7 and a 15-footer for birdie
at No. 10. But his short game was perhaps the most impressive part
of his performance. He got up and down from the rough at No. 5 to
save par, making an 8-foot putt after a nice pitch. At No. 9, he
rammed a birdie attempt eight feet past the hole, but made the
comeback putt to save par.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 11, after driving into the rough, Woods blasted out short
of the green, chipped to 12 feet, then made the putt to save par.
At No. 15, he chipped to six feet and made the putt to save par. At
No. 17, he chipped 12 feet past the hole but made another comeback
putt for par. Then at No. 18, he hit a great bunker shot to two
feet and converted the birdie putt to end his day on a high note.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Woods in first place will surely weigh on the minds
of others in the field, like Phil Mickelson and Tom Lehman, who
both shot 71s, and Jesper Parnevik, who shot 73. The chase is on.
And Woods is a formidable frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm six behind the man, and he's pretty hard to beat,'' said
Michael Campbell, who finished at even par. ``He has risen the bar,
and he's the only one who can jump over that bar right now,'' said
Tom Watson, who won the Open at Pebble Beach in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many holes left to play, several other golfers put
themselves in good position. Start with Jimenez, a 36-year-old
member of last year's European Ryder Cup team, who is playing at
Pebble Beach for the first time. Jimenez birdied Nos. 2, 3, 5, 6
and 7, shooting up the leader board like a Fourth of July
firecracker.
</P>
<P>
   One of the game's most accurate drivers and an excellent putter,
Jimenez has a game that fits the mold of someone who can contend at
Opens. And after losing to Woods in a playoff last year in Spain,
Jimenez did not sound fearful of another weekend confrontation with
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is the best player in the world,'' Jimenez said. ``But
the press thinks there's only one player here at the tournament.
There's 156 players. He can win, sure. But on this type of golf
course, you have to be very consistent, and you have to hit very
straight. There's too many things you have to hold for four
rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's scores were better than expected, as the moisture in
the air prevented the greens from becoming slicker, while the mild
winds had little impact on play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to take advantage of a really good tee time,'' said
Huston, who teed off in the second group at 6:40 a.m. ``There was
no wind and the sun was out. The greens were perfect. And every
time I was in the rough today, I had a good lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising round of the day belonged to Clampett, a
40-year-old CBS analyst who made the field as a qualifier and who
is playing only his second tournament in the last 21 months.
Clampett was raised near Pebble Beach, and he used to sneak onto
the course as a youngster. Thursday, he sneaked onto the leader
board, and he loved every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fighting back tears all through the front nine,''
Clampett said. ``It's hard to describe that kind of emotion. It's
was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods was simply himself. And after one day at the Open, he
was exactly where he wanted to be.  &QL;

BUSH RETURNS TO FUND RAISING AFTER FAMILY VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Mass.)   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After five days at his family's compound in
Kennebunkport, Maine, George W. Bush returned Thursday to the
campaign trail and embarked on a 72-hour, five-state fund-raising
drive that is expected to bring in nearly $5 million for
Republicans to wage the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his one public campaign event before a round of closed
receptions for donors in Maine and Boston, Bush, the Texas
governor, proposed an additional $880 million in federal spending
and tax incentives over five years to help disabled Americans with
work, public access and new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal now is clear _ to speed up the day when our country
has removed the last barrier to full, independent, productive lives
for every person with or without disability,'' Bush said in a
15-minute speech to a small group of people, many in wheelchairs,
at Alpha One, a nonprofit organization that provides services to
the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All citizens with disabilities ask is a chance to use their
own gifts and talent to make their own contribution,'' Bush said
after making a quick tour of the Alpha One building in South
Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, recalled
that his father, the former president, signed the Americans With
Disabilities Act 10 years ago this month. The law is intended to
provide the disabled with greater opportunities and equal access to
services, public buildings and employment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then proposed an array of new programs, spending increases
and tax incentives to help the disabled with new technology and
public access. They included $20 million a year in matching funds
to states to guarantee loans so the disabled could buy computers
and modems to work at home, a tripling to $33 million of the
federal research budget for universities to develop technology, and
$10 million in matching funds to help make places of worship more
accessible to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who brought in a record $80 million for his presidential
primary campaign, spent much of the day raising $1.1 million for
the Republicans' autumn offensive, including the kinds of
unregulated, unlimited donations that the House has voted to ban.
Senate Republicans have consistently blocked the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Eastland Park Hotel in Portland, Maine, Bush raised an
estimated $100,000 for the Maine Republican Party. Then he flew to
Boston, where he spoke briefly to reporters at Logan International
Airport before heading to two events that were to bring in $1
million for the national Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush plans to raise another $1.1 million for
Republicans in appearances in Ohio and Kentucky, and on Saturday in
Florida he is to raise $2.75 million for the state and national
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The fund raising followed Bush's five-day retreat at his
family's Maine compound, where he celebrated his parents' birthdays
and made plans, with aides and strategists, for the Republican
National Convention, at the end of July in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Bush's main rival in the Republican
primaries _ who had put the abolition of big-money fund raising at
the center of his campaign _ has agreed to speak on the second
night of the convention, said Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The night will focus on America's role in the world and is also
likely to feature former Republican presidents. ``We think it's
appropriate that a hero and former prisoner of war speak to our
convention about the need to rebuild America's military,'' Hughes
said of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Although the second night's most prominent convention slot is
usually reserved for a keynote speaker, McCain was not offered that
role. Bush's advisers said that historical spot might be done away
with. They plan to have retired Gen. Colin Powell speak on the
opening night of the convention, July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his Boston news conference, repeated his call to
preserve the current Republican platform's plank on abortion, which
calls for a ban on the practice without exception and the
appointment of judges who respect ``the sanctity of innocent human
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a pro-life party,'' Bush said. ``I recognize good
people can disagree. We are going to be a pro-life party at the
convention.''

 NO EXPENSE SPARED IN PURSUIT OF A PROM TO REMEMBER FOREVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: ``Friday'' in graf 10 is June 16) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON, N.Y. _ The sun setting over Jericho Turnpike cast a
tangerine glow over the big white cars struggling to maneuver into
the driveway. Stretch limousines, it would seem, are no longer long
enough. This crowd arrived in 40-foot sport utility vehicles,
Lincolns so large that they need six wheels, and even a new,
somewhat oxymoronic concept: the stretch sports car, in this case a
white Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   Well-dressed couples emerged from the chauffeur-opened car
doors. A Giorgio Armani followed by a Ralph Lauren followed by a
Prada. And that was just the guys.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar nominees? Debutantes? Captains of industry? Try high
school students. It was prom night, Long Island-style, a night
where there is nothing inconspicuous about the consumption and a
graduating senior is lucky to escape with a tab of less than
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big night,'' explained Eric Kuscsik, 17, as he and his
date stepped out of the stretch Ferrari, which he said has a
mirrored ceiling and vibrating seats, and headed into the
Huntington Town House for the prom of St. Anthony's High School in
South Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   The days when proms were simple affairs in high school gyms
festooned with crepe paper streamers and balloons are long gone.
Driven by boom times, youthful exuberance and the
matrimonial-industrial complex of high fashion, catering halls and
luxury car rentals, the prom is no longer just a rite of passage;
it has become a serious expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   Couturiers like Vera Wang now field requests for prom dresses.
And after Jennifer Lopez wore a Badgley Mischka gown to the Academy
Awards in 1999 (no, not the naughty one), aspiring prom queens
began seeking their own Badgley Mischkas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely will they go over $3,000 for a prom dress,'' said Mark
Badgley, who estimated that the firm sells a dozen haute prom
dresses a year.
</P>
<P>
   And the prom itself is now only a small part of the equation.
There are the catered pre-prom parties, where the parents who
subsidize much of the revelry get to ``ooh'' and ``ahh'' and
photograph their dressed-up progeny. Then there are the after-prom
festivities, which often require another new outfit for a nightclub
or a late-night cruise.
</P>
<P>
   To recover from all this, many promgoers repair to the Hamptons
for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally blown out of proportion,'' said Kim Laffer, 18,
as she prepared to go to both the Great Neck North High School prom
on June 7 and her own prom, the Syosset High School prom, at the
Waldorf-Astoria in New York on Friday. ``I hate to say it, but
there's a lot of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Some kids even compete with themselves. When Dan Aversano and
his friends rented a stretch Lexus SUV last year for the junior
prom of Chaminade High School in Mineola, they wondered how they
could possibly top themselves at their senior prom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' Aversano, 18, said, ``we were looking to do
something more.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how he came to rent the Truckousine: a stretch white
Ford 350 pickup truck with a Jacuzzi in the bed.
</P>
<P>
   After the prom, he and his friends headed out to Bridgehampton,
where they had rented a seven-bedroom, six-bathroom house with a
tennis court and a pool for $4,250.
</P>
<P>
   All told, he said, his share of the expenses came to this: $387
for the house, $262 for the Truckousine, $160 for a rented black
tuxedo with white lapels, $155 for two tickets to the prom itself,
and $30 for a corsage for his date. Just under a thousand bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it: the prom is a huge industry,'' said
Garfield Bowen, the publisher of Prom Guide and www.promguide.com,
a directory of clothing retailers, catering halls, limousine
companies, after-prom events and just about everything else the
promgoer needs to prepare for the big night. Teenage magazines,
fashion magazines and bridal magazines all publish prom issues and
supplements that are fat with advertising. At Web sites like
www.yourprom.com, teenage shoppers can click on dozens of dresses
by designers like Jessica McClintock and After Six and read makeup
tips and horoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Young men are spending more on clothes as well. ``They don't
rent a tuxedo anymore, they rent a designer label,'' said Jack M.
Springer, the executive director of the International Formalwear
Association. ``They want a Pierre Cardin, a Perry Ellis, an Oscar
de la Renta. Mandarin collars are very big. They favor vests over
cummerbunds.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey his group did last year found that proms accounted for
a fifth of all tuxedo rentals, generating about $300 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the cars. This year's hottest item is the stretch
Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the prom does not have to be ruinous. When Seventeen
magazine did an online poll asking readers how much they planned to
spend on their proms, they received 4,148 responses: 19 percent
said they would spend less than $100, 59 percent said they would
spend $100 to $300, and 22 percent said they would spend more than
$300.
</P>
<P>
   But Long Island seems to be in a league of its own. ``What are
all these kids going to do for their weddings?'' wondered Rhona
Silver, the owner of the Huntington Town House, which holds scores
of proms each year. ``They're very demanding: they want filet
mignon, they want lobster tail. The days of stuffed chicken are
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting ready for the prom is no small feat. Nicole Coelho, a
senior at Mineola High School, had an iridescent taffeta dress
custom-made for her at Bridal Reflections in Carle Place, had three
sessions at a tanning salon, had her hair done in Garden City and
had a manicure and a pedicure.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of her prom, her friends and their parents
gathered at her house in Mineola. A small tent was set up outside
the garage, over a table of crudites and soda. The couples
exchanged corsages and boutonnieres _ the words would appear to be
French for ``expensive flowers'' _ and the parents took snapshot
after snapshot.
</P>
<P>
   Then their ride came. ``Holy moly,'' said Gena Stanisic, 40, who
was seeing off her daughter Jessica as the 32-passenger, six-wheel
white Ford Explorer glided down the street. ``We had limos at my
prom, but none of these five-mile-long jobs.'' It was longer than
most of the houses on the street are wide.
</P>
<P>
   The couples piled in, and the car pulled out to the Crest Hollow
Country Club, the first stop in a night that would take them to
Caroline's Comedy Club in Manhattan, back to Long Island for an
after-prom brunch, and then to a resort upstate for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's your prom,'' Coelho said. ``It only happens once in your
life.''

FRENCHMAN MAY RUN UNIVERSAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Universal City, Calif. _ The merger of Seagram Co. with the
Vivendi SA, world's largest water company, should be completed by
month's end, thus making Universal Studios Inc. a bicontinental
company, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, Vivendi Universal, is expected to be
headquartered in Paris with the Seagram chief executive officer,
Edgar M. Bronfman Jr., becoming vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   It will be one of the world's biggest media and entertainment
companies, with projected revenues of $65 billion and a market
capitalization of $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi Chairman Jean Marie Messier told reporters in Paris on
Thursday that negotiations between its television subsidiary Canal
Plus and Seagram were at an advanced stage. He will lead the new
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The companies confirmed Wednesday that they were talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some technical issues that need to be negotiated and
finalized. But if they are not nailed down, there is no deal,'' a
source familiar with the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bronfman's title has been decided, his scope of influence
hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they have decided on the portfolio yet,'' the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   With the new company being headquartered in Paris, there is
speculation that the new Universal studio chief will be based
there.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner now is the Canal Plus chairman and chief
executive officer, Pierre Lescure, who would become the first
Frenchman to run a major Hollywood studio, industry trades Daily
Variety and the Hollywood Reporter said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman, in an interview with Business Week, said that Vivendi
will acquire Seagram in a stock swap valued at $75 to $79 a share.
Seagram will also control five of 18 board seats, and Bronfman
family members will be the largest shareholders, with an 8 percent
stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of it as a partnership, but Messier will be the
ultimate leader,'' Bronfman told the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram acquired Universal in 1997 through the purchase of its
parent, MCA Inc., for $5.7 billion. The film operations struggled
for several years before reversing 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, Universal has had a number of $100
million-grossing films, including ``The Mummy,'' ``Notting Hill,''
``American Pie'' and ``Erin Brockovich.'' The latter was this
year's first film to crest that mark and helped the studio dominate
the spring box office. Universal also co-produced the current
DreamWorks hit ``Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-production deals, with profits and costs shared, are common
in Hollywood. For example, Universal co-produced the Academy
Award-winning hit ``Shakespeare In Love'' with Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analyst Jeff Logsdon at W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co. said
Vivendi is offering pretty good terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Bronfmans are able to sell Seagram in the price range
of $75 to $80 a share, that would be a very nice ending to what has
been a tumultuous story for the last few years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there is any expectation among the Bronfmans
of running the studio. I would sense they are happy to go off into
the sunset with a big smile on their faces and their wallets fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Logsdon notes that Canal Plus has been held in high regard and
Lescure has done a good job of running the company.
</P>
<P>
   But taking over an American film company would be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``These boys are only going to be run so hard,'' he said of
American movie executives. ``Many have tried and few have
succeeded. I don't recall in my 18 years (of covering the industry)
of a foreigner who has successfully run a studio. But this is more
than a studio. This is a global (enterprise).
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Glynn Williams at Newcrest Capital Inc. agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When non-U.S. folks move in to run a Hollywood studio, they
get toasted. It's a lot harder business than most people think.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vivendi and Canal Plus boards will meet Monday to discuss
the Seagram deal.
</P>
<P>
   Messier, speaking at the Fortune Global Forum in Paris, said his
company is not interested in Seagram's beverage lines, so what
happens to those is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the deal puzzles some Seagram watchers like
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find so bizarre is it's part of the family heritage,''
he said of the company known for its line of spirits. ``Seagram's
management is very smart, and they have great advisers, so I would
have to think this is part of a bigger chess game. I can see the
board right now, but I don't see what the game is.''

ROBERT LURTSEMA, CHAMPION OF CLASSICAL MUSIC ON THE RADIO, DIES AT
68 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert J. Lurtsema, the inimitable host of ``Morning Pro
Musica,'' the classical music program on public radio, an announcer
equally revered and reviled for his resonant timbre and slow,
drawling delivery, died on Monday. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   He had been struggling with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a
lung disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   June 26 would have marked Lurtsema's 29th anniversary as host of
``Morning Pro Musica.'' In its heyday the program was broadcast
seven days a eek from 7 a.m. to noon by a large network of stations
in New England and northern New York State, and transmitted via
satellite to stations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the show's success was a triumph of substance or style
was debatable, even among its fans. Lurtsema carefully planned his
programming around themes, seasons, holidays around the world and
the anniversaries of composers and performers. In a period when
classical music radio programs became increasingly wary of
substance, he was not afraid to play long works, including
contemporary music.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the attention that ``Morning Pro Musica'' attracted
involved Lurtsema's relaxed style as host. He typically began the
program with the recorded sounds of birds, then offered five hours
of languid chitchat, weather reports, news, interviews and lots of
music. To his admirers he was a wonderfully calming morning
companion. To his detractors he was a self-absorbed bore in love
with his own voice.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s some stations stopped carrying the program. In
1993 ``Morning Pro Musica'' was switched from a daily to a
weekend-only format. For better or worse, classical radio had
changed and Lurtsema's personal style was considered anachronistic.
</P>
<P>
   He was born on Nov. 14, 1931, in Cambridge, Mass. After serving
in the Navy he attended Boston University, studying liberal arts,
drama and broadcasting. After graduating in 1957 he held an
eclectic array of jobs, including lumberjack and encyclopedia
salesman. In 1968 he returned to Boston and became a painter. But
when he stumbled into the job at WGBH two years later he knew that
classical music radio was his calling.
</P>
<P>
   Lurtsema was the author of two books: ``A Pocketful of Verse''
and the ``Robert J. Lurtsema Musical Quiz Book.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Betsy Northrup of Wellesley,
Mass.; his mother, Dorothy, of Stoughton, Mass.; two sisters; and a
brother.

MANY SCENES LEFT IN BRYANT'S HIGHLIGHT REEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS - Rewind the Kobe Bryant documentary past the
overhead putback that clinched Game 4 of the NBA Finals two days
ago.... Past The Lob to Shaquille O'Neal in Game 7 against
Portland.... Past the last-second jump shot that won Game 2 of the
Lakers' series against Phoenix.... Past all the plays that made him
an All-Star and an All-NBA selection and an All-Defensive team
member....
</P>
<P>
   Rewind the tape back to a quiet moment at the Great Western
Forum in Inglewood, in the spring of 1999, and you will see a hint
of what brought him here, to the brink of his first NBA
championship at age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Practice has just ended and Bryant is casually watching a PGA
tournament on the locker-room television when a writer asks if he
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf? No. I could never play anything that I couldn't
master,'' Bryant says flatly.
</P>
<P>
   His visitor scoffs. ``And you can (begin ital)master(end ital)
basketball?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Bryant says. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant says ``absolutely'' a lot, which is fitting. The Lakers'
flashy playmaker is all about absolutes. He is as supremely
confident as he is supremely talented. So there are no ``maybes''
in his repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   It's what makes Bryant, as young as he is, a superstar and
clutch performer in the mold of Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan
and Larry Bird. And if the Lakers win the championship tonight, on
the momentum of Bryant's amazing 28-point effort Wednesday, his
legend will begin a path right behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has as much talent or more than any player who has ever
lived,'' enthused Alex Hannum, who once coached Wilt Chamberlain
and won a pair of NBA championships with St. Louis and
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one ever questioned Bryant's talent. It's his
on-court maturity that has been an issue for his first four pro
seasons. Teammates were frustrated by his individual play, his
perceived selfishness, his impulse to try to win games by himself _
all products of the same immense confidence that makes him great.
</P>
<P>
   So rewind the documentary back another few months, to early
1999, and a practice session at L.A. Southwest College. Bryant's
coach from Lower Merion High in Pennsylvania is visiting and Bryant
introduces him to a few visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Bryant says with a smile, ``is the guy who taught me
not to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant laughs at his own joke. Yes, the kid can be as
self-deprecating as he is self-confident. And even self-aware.
</P>
<P>
   Even as teammate Shaquille O'Neal grew irritated by Bryant's
solo flights of fancy, the kid he dubbed ``Showboat'' was pushing
his way through one lesson after another. And slowly figuring out
that his spectacular one-on-one skills alone would not lead the
Lakers to a championship.
</P>
<P>
   But it took the arrival of coach Phil Jackson last summer _
armed with six Chicago Bulls championships, a legacy as Jordan's
mentor and a short leash for Bryant _ to begin the greatest stage
of Bryant's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really is way ahead of schedule for a kid who's 21 years
old,'' said Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak. ``I think having
Phil here expedited the process a little bit. But he's such a
good-natured, talented kid, that he would have gotten there anyway.
It may have been at 26 or 27, but he would have gotten there, no
doubt about it. Having Phil here expedited the process, and winning
became a factor, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Kobe wanted to succeed, but I'm not sure if he knew
what winning at this level was all about. And I think he's learning
that now, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not about footwork, or reading defenses, or finding
opponents' weaknesses, although Jackson has brought much of that
education to Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was a certain poise or composure or confidence that
Phil brings,'' which he has imparted to his players, Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bryant's case, that also meant having confidence in
teammates. Jackson made him the facilitator in the triangle
offense, not the Jordan position of scorer he coveted. And with
several trials and numerous errors and the occasional glare and a
benching, Bryant grew into the role. And his teammates grew to
appreciate him more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always on Kobe,'' O'Neal said. ``We knew eventually he
was going to come around. We didn't really want to put a cap on
what he could do. We just try to teach him to use his (skills) to
better everybody else. He can break anybody down (off the dribble).
When he gets to the lane, he has four, five guys waiting for him.
So every now and then, we want him to kick it out to Glen Rice, one
of the best shooters; every now and then, rip it out to me so I can
get it to the backboard apparatus, pass it to one of the players.
He's done an excellent job.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once Bryant tried to do it all, he has become almost a
consummate team player. But it was when Jackson took the leash off
that allowed Bryant to write his own chapter of NBA history. After
O'Neal fouled out Wednesday in overtime, Jackson gave Bryant
license to create _ and he scored six of the Lakers' last eight
points in the victory.
</P>
<P>
   In those closing minutes, his supreme confidence _ now tempered
by wisdom _ led the Lakers to victory.
</P>
<P>
   So fast-forward the tape again, to Conseco Fieldhouse on
Wednesday, Game 4 of the NBA Finals, and a timeout with 2:33 left
in overtime. The Lakers lead the Indiana Pacers by three points,
O'Neal has just fouled out, and Bryant is addressing his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'In a situation like this, Jordan wouldn't let his
team lose. I'm not going to let us lose.' He had that look in his
eye,'' Brian Shaw recalled. ``I knew, after that timeout, he was
going to take most of the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   He misses only one, blocked by Rik Smits. But Bryant, now as
great a defensive force as an offensive weapon, pays Indiana back,
blocking Austin Croshere from behind at the other end. Minutes
later, led by Bryant's 28 points, the Lakers secure a 3-1 lead in
the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is still the young phenom with the devastating one-on-one
skills. He's just a wiser one, with the good judgment to know when
to pounce and when to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just realizing the time to attack,'' Bryant said.
``(Jackson) brought it to me in a different light. It was more kind
of relaxing, going with the flow of the game, just investigating
the floor, really. You penetrate. You know that you can get to that
spot, so you say, 'OK, I know I can get there, I'll come back there
later, I might come back there in the fourth quarter.' Little mind
games that you play. That's how he approached it with me. It was
just so interesting. He taught me very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson was hired one year ago, he called his youngest
charge ``uneducated in basketball and in life.'' Now that Bryant is
also engaged to be married in a few weeks, neither description
seems to fit anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's mature beyond his years,'' Jackson said,
referring to both basketball and life. ``I think he's handling this
very well. I think that he's grown a lot in one year, and yet I see
a young man who's still got 13, 14 years of excellent basketball
ahead of him and a terrific future, hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   So reserve a few reels of film for a few hundred sequels.

RAP SINGER CONVICTED OF ASSAULT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Star rapper Stanley Howse of the Grammy
Award-winning ``Bone Thugs-N-Harmony'' was convicted Thursday of
assault with a firearm largely because of his girlfriend's
testimony, jurors said.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating just four hours, Van Nuys Superior Court
jurors said statements by Jennifer Spencer, Howse's only witness at
trial, led them to convict the 27-year-old rapper,
``Flesh-N-Bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer insisted Howse did not have a gun Dec. 26, when police
said he threatened two men with an AK-47 rifle at her Woodland
Hills apartment. But she also said the two men later attacked Howse
in a stairwell, taunting him with ``So where's your gun now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just confirmed there were guns around,'' said a juror, a
50-year-old Van Nuys insurance examiner who did not want to be
identified. ``If she hadn't said that, it might have made a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Howse was found guilty of assault with a firearm and for being
an ex-con with a gun. He could get up to 20 years in prison when
sentenced July 14 by Judge Darlene Schempp.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's verdict was the most recent conviction for Howse,
whose group's latest record is in the Billboard Top 100. He was
barred from possessing guns after pleading no contest to felony
assault and explosives possession in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant's girlfriend sealed his fate,'' said Los Angeles
County Deputy District Attorney Shellie Samuels. ``It was a
credibility case. The rest was just diversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Howse's attorney, Phillis Brown-Scarlett, said she had hoped the
jury would take more time to question the gun evidence and
conflicting accusations against Howse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised and disappointed in the verdict,'' said
Brown-Scarlett, who plans an appeal. ``I thought there was
overwhelming reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Howse is set to go on trial in Los Angeles for
unrelated firearms charges, terrorist threats and resisting an
officer. He is accused of storming a relative's South Los Angeles
home in January with a sawed-off shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man just keeps getting more violent,'' Samuels said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had to overcome several challenges to win the Van
Nuys trial. The victim, Tarrance Vickers, a friend of Howse's, told
police about the attack immediately afterward but recanted the
accusations at trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to believe him; his story changed from
when he told police to what he told the detective the next day.
When he got on the stand, it changed again,'' said a 62-year-old
female juror.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said they did not believe Vickers' testimony and instead
put their faith in the police reports and the testimony of Vickers'
brother, Fred Nelson of San Jose, who stuck by his original account
of the incident during his testimony.

BIRD'S LAST GAME IS IMMINENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS - It was unusual from the beginning, but then this
was Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   And so it's come to this - win or lose, tonight's Game 5 will be
the last for Bird at the Conseco Fieldhouse as the Pacers' head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Lose, and it's his last as the Pacers coach.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Pacers are in need of any extra motivation facing
an elimination game, but there it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely want him to go out with a bang,'' said forward
Dale Davis. ``That's what we set out to do this year. We want to
win for him, and ourselves. We've had some good times and it was a
great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird said when he took the Pacers job it would be strictly a
three-year run. Three quick years later, Bird is facing the end.
</P>
<P>
   Bird, ever the warrior, and most of the Pacers, claim to be too
focused on keeping their Finals bid alive to get sentimental over
his possible last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be our last game,'' Bird said.
``These guys are down. We have to snap back. This is the Finals.
You don't worry about what's going to happen next. You don't give
up. You just try to go out and win a ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacers forward Austin Croshere said with practices and at least
one game left, Bird is coaching and his exit seems distant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do take time to think about it, it's obviously
disappointing,'' Croshere said. ``He's been a great coach for me
this year. But he feels like he needs to move on. That's been a
disappointing thought in the back of my mind all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up the ol' gang: Bird isn't the only part of the Pacers
who won't be back next year. Six players will become free agents,
including four starters - Reggie Miller, Jalen Rose, Mark Jackson,
Rik Smits, plus Sam Perkins and Croshere.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins plans to retire and Smits has discussed joining him.
With Travis Best able to run the point, Jackson could also be let
go.
</P>
<P>
   After making it to their first Finals ever, the Pacers might be
on the verge of a complete dismantling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen,'' Jackson said. ``I do know this team has
proven it's capable of winning this thing. Whatever happens, we
have a lot to be proud of - and I'm not talking like it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Mismatch of the century: Hmmm, let's see, 5-foot-11 and
184-pound Best vs. 7-foot-1, 335-pound Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   And Goliath felled David.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the strangest sights in NBA Finals history, Best
climbed the mountain to deliver a flagrant foul on O'Neal Wednesday
night, before ricocheting hard to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   That left him with a sprained left shoulder. X-rays are
scheduled today and the Pacers are calling him probable, but Best
said if the game was Thursday he would have been out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't move it,'' Best said. ``I can't move it very fast and
my range of motion is just gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The big finish: The Pacers draw hope from knowing the Lakers
have struggled to close out each of their three previous playoff
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Croshere said. ``I think there was a little bit
of a letup on their part in Game 3. Certainly they're susceptible
to doing that again in Game 5. We can win here on Friday night in a
place we play much better and shoot much better, can get some
confidence going into L.A., then you never know what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   My name is Reggie: Did anyone expect Miller to second-guess
himself for his 3-pointer that came up short in the closing seconds
of Wednesday's 120-118 overtime loss in Game 4?
</P>
<P>
   Miller said if he had pump-faked Robert Horry and stepped up, he
would have been fouled but was uncertain if it would have been
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to lose, I want to lose with me shooting,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: When Magic Johnson hit his ``junior-junior
skyhook'' in the final two seconds of Game 4 at Boston Garden to
put the Lakers up 3-1 in the 1987 NBA Finals, Celtics forward Larry
Bird was asked how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you think I feel?'' Bird said. ``I know when I'm up
3-1, I say it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won in six games.

MAYBE ANTI-GAMBLING STAND BY COACHES DOES MAKE SENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Upfront, let me say this:
</P>
<P>
   I don't bet on college sports. Basically, I don't bet on
anything involving two-legged creatures. But horses, now that's
different. Much different. This isn't about horses, however. This
really isn't even about calling up your friendly neighborhood
bookmaker and getting down on the Ol' Alma Mammy when it's playing
the hated Other Guys U.
</P>
<P>
   And one more clarification. I own no stock in any Las Vegas
casinos, and have visited that interesting city like once in the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   That was me, however, laughing like crazy this week at _ my
opinion here _ the absurdity of Tubby Smith and Lou Holtz, two
distinguished college coaching names, being house boys for
do-gooder, crusading politicians in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There were congressional hearings being held, and there are
bills pending in both houses of Congress that would stop Vegas
casino sports books from taking bets on any college games. Such
wagering is legal in one state _ Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Smith, the University of Kentucky basketball coach, and Mr.
Holtz, the well-traveled football coach, were, of course, speaking
in support of those bills. And also, I'm sure, speaking the truth
as they see it.
</P>
<P>
   But how can street-smart, been-around-the-block-more-than-once
guys like this come across, my opinion again, as so turnip-truck
naive? Neither exactly rode into town on a load of jock straps.
Grab a clue, fellows.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, however, gambling on college sports in this
country has pushed coaches and administrators into a panic, mainly
because the credibility of NCAA games is at stake. That's what
brought Holtz and Smith to Washington this week. And the college
coaching brotherhood is with them on this.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officialdom often stands accused of foolish over reaction
on a variety of issues, but not necessarily this time. At least not
in the big picture. They've got a massive problem with gambling.
They've had recent scandals with points-shaving and such. Big-time
gamblers got to players. The fear is what might come next. What if
one of those scandals suddenly surfaces in the NCAA's mother-lode
event, the Final Four? Billions in revenue would be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the NCAA has a large worry here.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I've got no solution for them.
</P>
<P>
   But if they are small-minded enough to think the answer is a
government ban on Las Vegas college sports wagering, then the wrong
people are seeking answers to troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that,'' said Bill Saum, from NCAA headquarters
in Indianapolis. ``This legislation is not a solution, but we do
feel it's a key component in encouraging the young people of
America not to wager. What would happen is that this bill would
eliminate a very high-profile place to bet on college sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Saum is the NCAA director responsible for finding those gambling
solutions. He has several helpful contacts in Vegas who keep him
advised on how money is flowing on college games. Saum also knows
that in both the recent Arizona State and Northwestern scandals,
the money was ``laid-off'' in Nevada because it's easier to spread
around large bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ringleaders in the Northwestern case testified if
there hadn't been Nevada, he couldn't have done it,'' Saum said.
</P>
<P>
   Betting is going to happen. Action on college football and
basketball, legal and illegally, ranks up there dollar-wise with
the operational budget of General Motors. But Las Vegas is the one
place where it's closely monitored, and where large wagers on one
team immediately raises suspicion. The very last thing the Vegas
boys want is a fixed game. They lose big. They also accept big
bets.
</P>
<P>
   As Saum pointed out, your friendly neighborhood bookmaker is not
going to take big-money wagers from a stranger. Nevada is really
the one and only place for that kind of action. And while the
landscape of sports wagering has changed dramatically with the
influx of ``off-shore'' betting parlors, those are done by account
wagering, which is another way of keeping tabs on who is betting,
and how much. The ``off-shore'' shops are illegal in this country,
but are growing like crazy on the Caribbean islands, and they
service American bettors by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   For the NCAA, however, the larger issue is curbing the campus
bookmaker _ moonlighting students have been directly involved in
the latest college sports scandals. In conjunction with that, the
NCAA is beefing up its police force where gambling and the athlete
is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not naive enough to think we can stop the gambling, but
part of our problem goes back to Las Vegas accepting bets \Ron
college sports\S,'' Saum said. ``Again, it's not a solution to our
problem, but if you take it away, it helps us. And we do need much
help in this.''
</P>
<P>
   So, I guess, never mind on Tubby and Lou. Maybe, just maybe,
they were making more sense up there in Washington than originally
thought.

CANDIDATE FOR SENATE IS OFTEN STUCK IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Right about the time Rep. Rick A. Lazio's voting
record was being condemned by Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday
in her fiercest campaign attack to date, Lazio was on the floor of
the House casting a most prosaic vote, to approve the record of the
previous day's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   More significant votes would follow over the next 48 hours, and
Lazio, the Republican nominee for the U. S. Senate from New York,
was there, off the campaign trail, to keep up a sterling attendance
record out of a sense of duty and because he knew his opponent was
watching closely.
</P>
<P>
   In a week in which Clinton has intensified her criticism, Lazio
has spent much of his time attending to congressional duties in
Washington, juggling news media interviews and raising funds. He
attended two fund-raising events here.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio says he remains committed to balancing an aggressive
campaign schedule with his House obligations. He has not promised
to attend all votes _ and he has missed some since entering the
race May 20 _ but he has said he would make an effort to be present
for significant ones.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts say Lazio's predicament is a common one for
incumbents, who find their voting records under attack and
therefore must dash back to Washington from the campaign trail to
show their commitment and concern.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, who publishes a nonpartisan political
newsletter here tracking congressional races, said Lazio's
situation was a bit exacerbated by the timing of Clinton's barrage,
coming just when he needs to be in New York to make himself better
known. Several polls have shown the race at a virtual tie, with
many people supporting Lazio more out of opposition to Clinton than
because of familiarity with what he stands for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows her to determine and dictate the state agenda and
discussion,'' Rothenberg said. ``If he is in Washington, it's hard
to respond, to counterpunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the last week, in an attempt to portray Lazio as
indecisive and beholden to the House Republican leadership,
Clinton's staff has issued statements accusing Lazio of changing
his vote on some measures to go along with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The latest criticism came Thursday, when Clinton's staff said
Lazio changed a vote Tuesday evening on a measure to require drug
companies that receive federal financing to offer the resulting
products at a reasonable cost to consumers. A spokesman for Lazio
responded by saying that Lazio's final vote in favor of the measure
reflected his previously stated position on the issue and that, in
the 15 minutes generally allotted for voting, members often adjust
their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was not available for an interview, his campaign aides
said, but they brushed off Clinton's attacks and said Lazio would
keep up his congressional duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes this job very seriously and he likes to be informed
about the issues and a broad range of subjects,'' said Bryan Flood,
a campaign spokesman. He said Lazio planned to resume campaigning
on Friday and over the weekend, with events upstate and in the New
York City region. Next week, he said, Lazio will probably return to
Washington for a few days for more voting as the session winds down
to the Fourth of July recess.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance was an issue in the 1998 Senate campaign, with the
Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, accusing his Democratic
challenger, Charles E. Schumer, of missing House votes until it was
learned that D'Amato had missed votes as a member of the Nassau
County Board of Supervisors in 1980 while he ran for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was present for 99 percent of the votes in the House in
1999, according to Congressional Quarterly; the average was 96.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   House records show that since May 20, Lazio has missed a handful
of votes on incremental pieces of legislation, like amendments to
amendments on bills. He did miss a final vote on a bill dear to
Republican leaders _ to phase out the federal estate and gift tax _
on June 9, which passed 279 to 136. Flood said Lazio missed it to
attend a funeral for an uncle on Long Island. It was also the day
he named his campaign manager and, in the evening, visited a Sons
of Italy club in the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Lazio voted for a bill giving electronic signatures
on legal documents weight equal to handwritten ones, a measure that
passed 426 to 4. He did buck the House leadership in voting against
a $339.5 billion measure for education, health and labor programs,
which passed 217 to 214 in a vote largely along party lines. Lazio
joined seven other Republican moderates, primarily from the
Northeast, and 206 Democrats in opposing the measure, which
President Clinton has promised to veto on grounds that it is
insufficient and lacks provisions to hire more teachers and repair
schools.

SPORTS COLUMN: FLOATING THROUGH FOG FOR A 65 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ With every pair of eyes in the gallery
staring back at the 16th tee, a marshal who had been stationed for
hours along the fairway ropes had a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does he stand?'' the marshal asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five-under,'' somebody said. ``He birdied 14.''
</P>
<P>
   To identify the golfer on the 16th tee, ``he'' was enough. In
other years in golf, ``he'' meant Jack Nicklaus and earlier it
meant Arnold Palmer, but ``he'' now means Tiger Woods, who floated
through the fog at Pebble Beach for a 6-under 65 in the opening
round of the 100th U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Perched above the cliffs and surf of Carmel Bay, it's as if
Pebble Beach is out there on the planet golf, especially when the
fog separates it from the tall green woods of the Del Monte forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``June gloom,'' the world's best golfer was saying now. ``This
is what people from southern California call it; this is what
happens every June. The fog, the low clouds roll in. They burn off
early in the afternoon, and you have a wonderful summer but
generally that's the way it is along the coast.''
</P>
<P>
   When red numbers, denoting strokes under par, kept going up next
to his name on the Open leader boards, it indeed was June gloom for
all the other golfers who now have to try to overtake him.
</P>
<P>
   Neither fog nor four missed greens in regulation deterred golf's
he-man from his appointed round of 65 that ended with his being
unable to see the green of the 543-yard 18th hole from the tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where I need to line up on 18 off the tee, so I went
with my target out there,'' he explained. ``My hazard stake wasn't
visible, but there are three corporate tents out there in a line
that fit perfectly with the line I wanted, so I ripped it right at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After his 300-yard drive soared to a stop in the first cut of
rough to the right of the fairway, he drilled a 4-iron into a
greenside bunker, blasted to about 18 inches and holed the putt for
his sixth birdie.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his celebrated length off the tee, his accurate
approach irons and five par-saving putts created his lowest score
in his six Opens. Listen to his clinical description of his other
birdies:
</P>
<P>
   On the 331-yard fourth hole, ``a 60-degree sand wedge to about a
foot, made that.'' On the 106-yard seventh, ``a pitching wedge to
about 20 feet left, made that.'' On the 446-yard 10th, ``an 8-iron
to about 15 feet, made that.'' On the 399-yard 13th, ``a 9-iron to
about a foot, tapped that in.'' On the 573-yard 14th, ``I hit a
driver, driver, pitched up there to about a foot, tapped that in.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at his drive on that 14th fairway, he surveyed the
remaining 257 yards to the flagstick. When those in the nearby
gallery saw him pull out his driver, they whooped. They thought he
was going for the green. But he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 257 on the front, which I thought I could hit a 3-wood
to with no problem,'' he recalled. ``But I didn't feel that was the
play, because if I hit a 3-wood and it flies in the bunker, it
could bury. I went with the driver, trying not to cut it so it
doesn't run up the gap and over the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to put the ball in the rough, short of the green
or in the bunker. I felt if I could hit the ball in the bunker, it
would roll up the bank and back down and still be on the upslope of
the bunker. That didn't happen. I pulled it a little bit and got
underneath the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   From the thick rough, his pitch stayed under that overhanging
tree, floated just onto the fringe and rolled down to about a foot
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we came, to see the game,'' a voice in the gallery
said in awe of that pitch shot. ``You'll never see a shot better
than that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you will, if not Friday then maybe on the weekend because
he and Pebble Beach were made for each other. He was 12 when he and
his father, Earl, drove up from Cypress, Calif., to play it for the
first time. He doesn't remember what he shot that day but he
thought the course played ``really long.'' When he later returned
for the California State Amateur, he thought it ``played short.''
</P>
<P>
   And at age 24, how did he think it played Thursday?
</P>
<P>
   ``Difficult,'' he said. ``The fairways were fast and running.
You can run out of room on some of those doglegs if you don't shape
your shot properly.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Tiger Woods, difficult is a relative term.

EDITORIAL: MR. PUTIN AND THE PLUTOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 16:
</P>
<P>
   The shape of Vladimir Putin's presidency could well be
determined by the unfolding clash between the Russian leader and
the small group of business titans who control much of their
nation's wealth. Certainly, Putin faces no more difficult task than
determining how to curb their political and economic influence
without trampling on Russia's newly found freedoms. His government
has not made a promising start by arresting Vladimir Gusinsky, an
oligarch who owns Russia's only independent television network and
some of its most fearless newspapers and magazines. Putin seemed to
acknowledge as much Thursday when he called the arrest
``excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason to be alarmed by the raw power often
exercised by the tycoons. Like the moguls who built corporate
empires in the United States in the first decades of
industrialization, the Russian business barons have taken advantage
of an unregulated economy to gain control of banks, transportation
systems and natural resources like oil and gas. With a hand from
government officials, they bought valuable state enterprises for a
pittance when the Kremlin privatized Russia's industrial assets
after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   They have used their wealth to manipulate Russian politics to
protect their financial interests. Sometimes those interests have
dovetailed with reform, as when the oligarchs supported Boris
Yeltsin for re-election in 1996 against a Communist opponent. But
that is not always so. The tycoons, for example, have opposed
effective banking regulation and an overhaul of Russia's broken tax
system.
</P>
<P>
   Russian democracy will remain stunted as long as the oligarchs
retain a stranglehold on the economy and the Kremlin. But the
problem cannot be solved overnight, nor can it be remedied by
arresting the businessmen or misusing prosecutorial powers to
intimidate them, which seems to be the case with Gusinsky. Rather
than reverting to the practices of a police state, Putin must begin
the hard but essential work of creating a system of law and
regulation that over time diminishes the power of the magnates and
insures a more equitable distribution of economic assets as Russia
develops its free-market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gusinsky and some of the other moguls like Boris
Berezovsky, Vladimir Potanin and Mikhail Khodorkovsky own large
news organizations, any government move against the oligarchs
inevitably raises sensitive free-press issues. The arrest of
Gusinsky this week was especially unsettling because his media
companies have carried the most critical coverage of Putin and the
war in Chechnya. The growth of a robust and inquisitive free press
in Russia has been one of the most encouraging developments since
the demise of Communism, and should not become a casualty of
conflicts between the government and the oligarchs. Putin must find
a way to challenge the power of the tycoons that does not
eviscerate the liberties Russians so recently won. &QL;

SPARRING SESSIONS OF PAST MEAN LITTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They've been talking about sparring sessions in
1992 since the promotional campaign for Saturday's bout was kicked
off.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Mosley helped his Saturday opponent, Oscar De La Hoya,
prepare for the Barcelona Games that year by working with him in
the gym. Mosley said he got the better of the sessions, and De La
Hoya said most recently that he really doesn't remember them
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's virtually nothing to remember if a video
of one session is an indication.
</P>
<P>
   The two toyed with one another and seemed to pull their punches
from beginning to end. It didn't look as if a serious punch was
thrown by either fighter. The session certainly offers no
indication how Saturday's bout might go.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed. It's eight years later and pro fighters wear
gloves with less padding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare amateur to professional,'' De La Hoya said.
``When you wear eight-ounce gloves, believe me, the punches hurt
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Small talk: De La Hoya doesn't buy into the argument that he has
a significant size and strength advantage because Mosley moved from
135 pounds to 147 only two fights ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Trainer) Robert (Alcazar) and my brother (Joel) say he's not
a true welterweight,'' De La Hoya said. ``He's at my weight. That's
all that matters to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``... He's had a few fights at 147. He says he feels strong,
people rave about him. What else is there to say?''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, De La Hoya said his walk-around weight is
about 157 pounds and Mosley said he's typically around 162.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Mosley has fought in the same weight class as or higher
than De La Hoya for six of their eight years as professionals. De
La Hoya started at 130 pounds and Mosley has fought almost his
entire career at 135.
</P>
<P>
   Comparison: De La Hoya was asked to compare Mosley with Felix
Trinidad, the only fighter to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power isn't the same,'' he said. ``I think Trinidad is
stronger behind his punches. Shane is a boxer who can move on his
toes and use speed. And he's very intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trinidad is a one-dimensional fighter. He comes straight
forward and tries to utilize his punching power. Shane thinks more
about his punches and his combinations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If something doesn't work,'' he went on, ``he goes to
something else. I think that's the difference between Shane and
Trinidad.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how the weeks leading up to the fight have been: mutual
respect.
</P>
<P>
   The other card: WBC lightweight champ Stevie Johnston (30-1, 15
KOs) will defend his title against Jose Luis Castillo at 2 p.m.
Saturday at the Bicycle Casino in Bell Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Johnston's fourth title defense since he regained the
championship from Cesar Bazan in February of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo (40-4, 37 KOs) is a former Mexican champion.
</P>
<P>
   The fight be televised on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   On the same card, successful amateurs Marshall Martinez and
Steven Luevano will make their pro debuts in separate bouts.
Martinez, a lightweight from Fontana, was 143-19 as an amateur.
Luevano, a featherweight from La Puente, was 189-16.
</P>
<P>
   In Indio: Antonio Diaz of Coachella, one of the most promising
junior welterweights in the world, faces Omar Gabriel Weis tonight
on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz (33-2, 24 KOs) is coming off an impressive victory over
Ivan Robinson. Weis (33-1, 16 KOs) is the Argentine 140-pound
champion.

BUCHANAN, IN NEW YORK, LINKS GANG SEX ATTACKS TO CRITICISM OF
POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pat Buchanan suggested Thursday that ``liberal
cop-bashing'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton and others had encouraged
the sexual assault spree by a gang of men in Central Park on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is running for president, launched, unbidden, into
an attack on the first lady and Senate candidate in the midst of a
news conference he held near the United Nations to denounce the
proposed creation of an international war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a Republican who is seeking to run as the Reform Party
candidate, suggested the Central Park sexual assaults were, at
least in part, the product of declining police morale caused by
criticism of police tactics over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liberal cop-bashing by folks like Hillary Rodham Clinton
is in part responsible for the new diminishment of the morale of
the police,'' Buchanan said at a news conference that was sparsely
attended, reflecting a significantly lower profile in his latest
bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it would not surprise me in the least,'' he said, ``if a
lot of these cops were far less aggressive in defending citizens,
and far less likely to get involved in what they ought to be doing
_ which is, quite frankly, busting a few heads and taking those
folks to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for an example of ``liberal cop-bashing'' by Clinton,
Buchanan noted the time she referred to the ``murder of Amadou
Diallo,'' just before the trial of the four police officers who
shot him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an outrageous, outrageous, slanderous, vicious,
stupid statement,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   The police officers were subsequently acquitted. Clinton has
said that she misspoke in describing the shooting as a murder, and
apologized for her remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, campaigning Thursday on Long Island, near the home base
of her Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, responded by attacking
Buchanan again. ``This is another in a long line of Mr. Buchanan's
attacks on people _ anti-Semitic comments, his racist and bigoted
comments,'' she said. ``So I'm not surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Thursday that she was ``outraged'' by the incident
in the park. And Buchanan described it as ``an act of barbarism and
animalism.''

EDITORIAL: PARDON FOR THE POPE'S ATTACKER 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 16:
</P>
<P>
   The pardon of Mehmet Ali Agca, would-be assassin of Pope John
Paul II, is a reminder that cold-war mysteries may still lie buried
in the archives of the former Soviet Union and the East bloc. Agca
shot the pope at his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square
on May 13, 1981. John Paul was wounded in his hand and stomach, and
required two operations and four and a half months of
convalescence. Whether Agca acted alone or at the bidding of the
KGB and the Bulgarian secret service, or was backed by the Gray
Wolves, a right-wing Turkish terror group to which he belonged, is
still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon granted by Italy's president was long sought by the
pope, who announced from his bed after the shooting that he forgave
Agca. The pope visited Agca in prison in 1983, and later received
Agca's mother at the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Agca has been returned to prison in Turkey. He was convicted in
absentia for the murder of a moderate Turkish newspaper editor and
sentenced to death, but the sentence was later reduced to 10 years.
While it is possible that Agca will now speak about his crime, it
is unlikely he will clear up the mysteries. He has said that the
Bulgarians and Soviets backed him. But he has also said he acted
alone, and claimed in court to be Jesus. In 1986 three Bulgarians
and three Turks were acquitted of conspiracy to kill the pope for
lack of evidence, an ambiguous verdict in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   East bloc archives are inconclusive. The Russian government has
produced cables that purport to show that the KGB was surprised by
the attempt. But KGB defectors have said they saw other cables
asking how to ``get close'' to the pope _ code, they assert, for
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that after the pope saw his assailant in
prison, he said, ``I spoke to him as I would speak to a brother
whom I have forgiven and who enjoys my confidence.'' Those standing
outside the cell watched him fold his hands around Agca's several
times. The existence of such profound humanity is a mystery of
another sort, one that will remain always elusive.  &QL;

`60 MINUTES' FACES DOUBTS OVER REPORTED TERRORIST `CZAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Sunday, June 4, the CBS News program ``60
Minutes'' showed a striking report as its lead segment: a man
claiming to be Ahmad Behbahani, a ``czar of Iranian state-sponsored
terrorism,'' was being held under armed guard in Turkey, where he
was seeking to get his story out.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed off camera, he told a compelling story. Among other
things, he said he had planned the bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Scotland in 1988, as well as two other terrorist acts that have
been linked to Iran: the bombing of the Khobar Towers building in
Saudi Arabia in 1996, which killed 19 American soldiers, and the
attack on a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in
1994, which killed 86 people.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks later, ``60 Minutes'' is still not sure who the
man is, and the CIA and the FBI are saying he is an impostor. In
addition, ``60 Minutes'' has backed off somewhat on his importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our source, who is at a high level in our government and whom
we trust totally, has told us that the CIA and the FBI have
concluded he was in Iranian intelligence, but not as high up as he
claimed he was,'' said Lesley Stahl, the correspondent who reported
the story.
</P>
<P>
   But the network is defending its treatment of the interview,
saying it had taken great care to make clear that it was reporting
only the man's claims.
</P>
<P>
   The story behind the story has the murky intricacies of a John
LeCarre novel. It involves a cast of characters that includes the
exiled former Iranian president Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, armed Turkish
police officers, a former CIA terrorism specialist and unnamed
sources in the Clinton administration, as well as references to
several of the most infamous terrorism episodes of the past 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes'' said it found the man from a tip provided by
Bani-Sadr. It rushed to a refugee camp in central Turkey to secure
the information that Bani-Sadr said the man was eager to disclose.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who was being held under armed guard by the Turkish
police, never appeared on camera. Instead, an Iranian-born
associate producer from ``60 Minutes'' sneaked into the camp and
questioned the man, who identified himself as Ahmad Behbahani. The
producer then reported what she had heard to Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   The program used a former CIA terrorism specialist, Robert Baer,
as a consultant, and he managed to ask the man a question about an
assassination in Iran that, Baer said, only someone directly
involved could have known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Baer, who is a very good guy, saying frankly, `This guy
knows some things,''' said Don Hewitt, the executive producer of
``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hewitt acknowledged that ``when you're in this world, you
often have no idea what the truth is,'' and that was one reason he
had hesitated to go with the segment.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt said he decided to show the interview after Stahl
reported receiving word from the CIA that the agency's chief in
Ankara, Turkey, had interrogated the man for two days, a sign of
his importance, and finally secured a comment from an official in
Washington that the man was at least ``in Iranian intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt said, ``I said that was enough to go with the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said, ``We tried very hard to make sure this was right.''
She noted that the actions of the Turks, who followed the ``60
Minutes'' crew everywhere it went and guarded the crew's subject
much more tightly than anyone else in the camp, indicated to her
that he was somebody important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never told, by any of our sources, `Don't go on the
air with this, you're making a mistake,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Stahl said, on the Friday before the broadcast, a
CBS correspondent in Washington called to say he had been hearing
that such a story existed. ``We thought the story was leaking
out,'' Stahl said. ``That was a factor in the decision to go with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, at midday that Saturday, Hewitt made the decision to put the
report in the air. He explained: ``I said, `Let's put it on but
let's be very careful.' If you noticed, we were still very careful
in how we said this is a man who says he is Behbahani, who says he
was involved in these things.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week later, The Washington Post reported that officials in
the CIA and the FBI had concluded that the man was ``an impostor
who lacks basic knowledge of Iran's intelligence apparatus.'' The
newspaper also reported Iran's denial that the man was Ahmad
Behbahani and that the Iranian Intelligence Ministry had identified
him as Shahram Beladi Behbahani.
</P>
<P>
   One main area of dispute was the man's age. The experts cited in
the Post said the man would have been no more than 20 when the Pan
Am jet exploded, too young, they said, for such an assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said, ``To be fair, we did hear some discrepancy about his
age.'' But she added that they had information that the man is 38,
not 32. She said Bani-Sadr had seen a photograph of the man they
spoke to and had said he ``looked like'' Ahmad Behbahani.
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes'' had hoped to have additional evidence on the
story, perhaps this week. The program had been told that a section
of videotape from a Iranian newscast might show the man they
questioned in a security detail for the former Iranian leader
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
   But when ``60 Minutes'' asked for the tape to be sent from
Ankara by Federal Express, it mysteriously disappeared somewhere in
Istanbul _ twice. This led Stahl to believe that someone did not
want ``60 Minutes'' to see the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say the loss of that tape does add to my
suspicions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl also said she wondered why anyone would believe an
identification offered by the Iranian Intelligence Ministry, and
why her interview subject, if he really is no one important, had
not been released from custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why go to these lengths to keep him hidden?'' Hewitt asked.
``If he's a fake, trot him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the man is still apparently being held by the
Turks, outside the reach of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl said: ``I don't know what to think. Of course, it goes
without saying that if we were wrong, perhaps we should have
waited. But I'm suspicious of everybody in this story.''

SIX MORE ARRESTED IN SEX ATTACKS IN CENTRAL PARK
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Armed with a flood of tips that followed the release
of suspects' photographs, the police Thursday arrested six young
men, from all around the region and all walks of life, and charged
them in the rampage of sexual assaults Sunday in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   One of the suspects, a barber from Queens, described getting
into ``an innocent water fight that got out of hand.'' Another, a
minister's son, planned to go to college and hoped to become a
lawyer. A third, a high school student, told his mother that he was
actually trying to help a women being attacked. And a fourth, a
father of two boys from Jersey City, was described by friends as a
good parent.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department, buoyed by it sudden success in making
arrests, released photographs of 13 more suspects taken from
videotapes of the melee, saying that as many as 20 people were
still being sought in attacks on as many as 37 women. In addition
to Thursday's six arrests, two people were arrested immediately
after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's arrests began at 5:30 a.m. and continued throughout
the day. For the police, it was a frenetic day: the victims of the
attacks filed through the Manhattan South Homicide Squad's offices
on East 21st Street to watch videotapes of the attack, and at one
point, with more than a dozen women waiting to watch the videos,
the police ordered four more VCRs and monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The men arrested Thursday, who ranged in age from 16 to 31, were
all charged with first-degree sexual abuse, a felony, and may face
additional charges, said Deputy Chief William Taylor, who is
overseeing the investigation. Most had no arrest records or arrests
for minor crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested first Thursday was John Taylor, 24, who was picked up
at his mother's home in Queens about 5:30 a.m. Steven Burt, 31, of
Jersey City, N.J., surrendered to the authorities there. Isaias
Lozano, 20, of Queens, and Manuel Nunez, 18, were arrested in the
morning, and 16-year-old Roberto Camacho of Inwood, Long Island,
surrendered later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Vargas, 18, of the Bronx, the man the police described as
the ``main player'' or ``instigator,'' surrendered Thursday night.
``He is identified by at least five or six of the women,'' a senior
investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Nunez wept Thursday as she described how the police came
for her son, Manuel Nunez, an 18-year-old with a year left at Taft
High School. He had not mentioned the parade until a friend spotted
his photo in the paper Thursday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another parent shared her shock. ``I was surprised and it hit me
hard because I know he's innocent,'' said Isaias Lozano, Lozano's
father, a minister. ``He was at the parade in the wrong place at
the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in Jersey City recalled Steven Burt, 31, as a conscientious
father of two boys and companion to their mother, Genise Shuler,
until the couple broke up six years ago. ``He was a nice guy who
worked and took care of his family,'' Shuler said. ``He was always
by himself and not with a crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Camacho of Inwood, who climbed out a window in the back
of his house while his mother spoke to the police Wednesday,
surrendered Thursday after people in his Long Island community
identified him.
</P>
<P>
   As more than 75 detectives concentrated on identifying suspects
and making arrests in the attacks, Internal Affairs detectives
looked into complaints that police officers had failed to respond
to reports of the assaults. The detectives questioned nearly 100
police supervisors and prepared to begin questioning officers
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on the arrests, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
defended the conduct of the majority of the police who patrolled
the parade, but acknowledged that some may have failed to respond
properly to reports of the attacks. He said complaints against them
would be vigorously investigated.
</P>
<P>
   He also stressed that the situation was created by the unruly
men who had committed the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Gov. George Pataki said he would propose
legislation to designate gang sexual assault as a separate crime,
said Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for Pataki. The crime would
be a class D felony with a maximum prison sentence of seven years,
a far more serious crime than simple sexual assault, a misdemeanor
punishable by up to a year in jail, she said.

ANDERSON UNHAPPY WITH BATTING AVERAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Garret Anderson admits he is not feeling
good about himself when he looks at the stat sheet and sees that
he's hitting .245. After all, Anderson went into the season hitting
.300 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's power numbers - 16 homers and 42 RBI - have him on
course for career highs in those categories. But that is of little
consolation to a man who was a protege of former Angels hitting
coach Rod Carew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it doesn't bother me, I have pride,'' Anderson
said. ``Seeing my average that low is embarrassing. There's nothing
I can do about it but take it one at-bat at a time. I'm not going
to make it up in one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of irritating to me sometimes. I'm making outs and
I'm not facing the best pitchers in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is typically a slow starter, but the slow start has
carried over to June this season. And he said it has nothing to do
with sacrificing average for power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so, I'm not trying to hit home runs,'' he said.
``I'm trying to hit my line drives. I feel comfortable and I'm
seeing the ball fine. But when I get a pitch to hit, I foul it off.
And when I do center the ball and hit it hard, it's going right at
people.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the solution?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a checklist of things that I go through to make sure I
have the right approach,'' he said. ``I keep it simple. There are
not a lot of adjustments to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take bits and pieces of what people say, but I know what
I've done in the past and what I did to get here. I know what works
for me.... Mentally, it's not wearing on me because I know I'm a
good hitter. As long as I know I'm prepared, it's something I have
to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulking up: Catcher Matt Walbeck has added considerable muscle
to his 5-foot-11, 188-pound frame since the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Idle time,'' Walbeck explained.
</P>
<P>
   Walbeck has the extra time to spend in the weight room these
days because Bengie Molina is getting most of the starts. And with
good reason. Molina is hitting .335 and has thrown out 38 percent
(17 of 45) of would-be base stealers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Walbeck has started 16 games this season, Molina
49.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing pretty well,'' Walbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Pitcher Ken Hill made a rehab start for Triple-A
Edmonton on Thursday night but showed he isn't near ready to rejoin
the Angels' rotation. Hill threw 78 pitches in four innings,
allowing five runs and seven hits.... Jason Dickson is scheduled to
make his second rehab start for Edmonton tonight.... Shortstop
Kevin Stocker's strained left hip flexor was feeling better
Thursday, keeping him off the disabled list. Manager Mike Scioscia
said Stocker might start tonight's game in Baltimore.

EDITORIAL: ALBANY'S TASK ON GUNS AND BALLOT ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 16:
</P>
<P>
   With the current New York legislative session limping toward a
close, negotiators in Albany are focusing on key issues where
action should be possible before adjournment next week. Ballot
reform and gun control are of critical importance.
</P>
<P>
   In April, with the memory still fresh of the ballot-rigging that
nearly prevented Sen. John McCain from competing in the state's
presidential primary, the State Senate approved remedial
legislation offered by one of the chief architects of that debacle,
Gov. George Pataki. The measure would automatically place all
recognized GOP candidates on the primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The bill contains a disappointing provision that would turn the
Republican presidential primary into a winner-take-all contest, and
it fails to address Democratic Party procedures. But that is no
excuse for the lack of interest shown so far by the Assembly
speaker, Sheldon Silver. He needs to seize this rare opportunity to
ensure that New York's voters have a wider choice of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute maneuvering will also decide the fate of the
constructive gun control package that Pataki introduced in March.
The Senate, which is usually allergic to gun controls, would
probably be forced to go along if the governor and the Assembly can
agree on a bill. The governor's package includes a ban on assault
weapons, background checks for guns purchased at gun shows, raising
the age for purchasing guns from 18 to 21, ballistics
fingerprinting of all new guns to make them easier to trace, and a
requirement that gun dealers provide a trigger lock with every gun
sale. The bill should be strengthened by requiring built-in trigger
locks and including penalties for those who fail to store their
weapons safely.
