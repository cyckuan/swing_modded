<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Trilateral Talks: Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that progress was made in his
talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told a news conference that progress was made in
three areas: opening an industrial park in the Gaza Strip with
Israel's security concerns addressed, forming a committee
monitoring what he said the Palestinians' anti-Israel incitement
in education and media and activating person-to-person program
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
His remarks echoed Albright's comments on the trilateral talks
that "significant and substantial progress" has been made on
various issues about the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu denied any U.S. pressure on him to yield tangible
results in the talks with the Palestinians, saying that the
progress was made out of willingness.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress, Netanyahu said there are issues
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
"We are going up the mountain, but we still have the mountain
to face."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Secure Trade Contract With Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's army has secured a 50
million U.S. dollar contract to supply various products to the
war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the state-owned
Herald newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean newspaper said an army subsidiary, the Zimbabwe
Defense Industries, has set up a venture under which the DRC
government will pay spot prices for all the goods supplied by the
Zimbabwen army.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean companies have been initially offered 10 million
dollars of the contract to supply items such as maize meal, rice,
vegetables, pharmaceuticals and agricultural, mining and other
equipment, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government deployed about 3,000 troops and a
number of war planes and tanks in the DRC to help President
Laurent Kabila fend off rebel forces after the rebles rose up
against the Kabila regime on August 2, this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Chief Warns of U.S. Economic Growth Weakening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday the U.S. economy is in
"reasonable shape" but its outlook for the growth had weakened
significantly.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the National Association of Business Economics,
Greenspan said he had "never seen anything quite like" the rise in
yields on certain bond issues when compared with more low-risk
issues like U.S. government bonds.
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty obvious I think that the outlook for 1999 for the
U.S. economy has weakened measurably in the aftermath of the
Russian devaluation and debt moratorium," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The building sense of stability in international markets has
been undermined, as the belief that the Asian contagion had moved
into remission has been proved quite wrong. The result of this, as
I am sure all of you are acutely aware by now, has been a very
dramatic change of the risk profile of the world," Greenspan
added.
</P>
<P>
However, he also claimed:"We are still seeing fairly
significant continued momentum."
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve released a survey last week showing large
banks had tightened credit standards for large business borrowers,
as a result of a increased risk aversion. The global financial
crisis has a strong impact on the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan estimated that the stock market decline since
midsummer, partly offset by increased bond prices, had destroyed
1.5 trillion U.S. dollars in consumer and business wealth. He said
that was bound to slow spending in the future.
</P>
<P>
In view of the uncertainty, Greenspan said, the Federal Reserve
will remain "especially alert."

<HEADLINE> Contact Group Meeting not to Take Place in London, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Office said on
Wednesday that a proposed Thursday meeting of the six-nation
Contact Group to discuss the Kosovo crisis would not take place.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will not be taking place," a Foreign Office
spokesman said, but he gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
Reuters earlier quoted a Western diplomat as saying that
foreign ministers of the six-nation Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia were likely to meet in London on Thursday to discuss
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The change of plan suggested splits among the six members of
the group over whether to use military force against Yugoslav
targets in retaliation for Belgrade's bloody crackdown in Kosovo.
Russia has been strongly opposed to using air strikes to solve the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group comprises Britain, the United States, France,
Germany, Italy as well as Russia.
</P>
<P>
France and Russia announced earlier on Wednesday that they were
sending their foreign ministers to take part in the meeting.

<HEADLINE> EU Presses for Immediate Elections in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) special
envoy to the Great Lakes region Aldo Ajello Wednesday pressed for
an "immediate" general election in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The solution to the conflicts in the Great Lakes region,
especially in the DRC should be through political means, and the
"so-called military settlement won't do," Ajello told the press
here before his departure.
</P>
<P>
The EU hopes that an immediate and fair general election will
be held in the DRC, he added.
</P>
<P>
The envoy admitted that to hold elections now may encounter
many difficulties such as amending the constitution, making
election law and voter registration. But he was quick to add
that the EU is willing to "provide financial aid for the election
in the DRC."
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit in Angola, Ajello held talks with
President Eduardo dos Santos and Prime Minister Franca Van-dunem.
</P>
<P>
He described the talks as "positive", adding they reached
consensus on "political solution to regional crisis."
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy will also visit Rwanda to continue his African
tour which has already covered Ethiopia, Uganda, Zimbabwe, South
Africa, Mozambique and Zambia where he held consultations with
the leaders on the tension in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> 10 Arrested in Sierra Leone for Lottery Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean police said
Wednesday that they have arrested 10 persons, including former
top officials at the national lottery, in connection with a fire
that destroyed the lottery headquarters.
</P>
<P>
A report from capital Freetown quoted officers at the criminal
investigations department as saying that those arrested include
the former deputy manager, company secretary and chief
accountant, all sacked two weeks ago after fraud was uncovered in
the lottery.
</P>
<P>
Security guards said Sunday's fire started on the top floor of
the three-story building in central Freetown and that the
lottery's accounting records were presumed to have been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the suspected arson has caused
outrage in Freetown, with radio stations bombarded by callers
demanding that the lottery officials be charged.
</P>
<P>
The government has told police investigators to wrap up their
inquiry quickly so that charges can be pressed, added the report.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Army Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Army Chief and
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff Committee General Jahangir
Karamat resigned from his office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Pakistan Television (PTV) Wednesday
night, Karamat sent a letter to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
requesting him to accept his retirement. Karamat's tenure of
office is due in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif has accepted Karamat's resignation and
has appointed Lt. General Pervez Musharaf as the new army chief.
</P>
<P>
Karamat said in his letter that he had proposed the
establishment of the National Security Council. However,
unnecessary debate has started on the issue, so he decided to
step down so that a healthy tradition is set for future.
</P>
<P>
Karamat said at the Pakistan Navy War College in Lahore Monday
that in the present geo-strategic environment "our internal
security was the most significant facet of national security."
</P>
<P>
A national security council or committee at the apex would
institutionalize decision making if "it was backed by a team of
credible advisors and a think tank of experts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Karamat said that unlike countries with economic potential,
Pakistan could not afford the effects of polarization, vendettas
and insecurity driven expedient policies.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that as he had repeatedly stressed the need of
the hour was total focus on the economy, the external linkages
with China, Iran, Afghanistan, India, the U.S., the internal
situation, especially Sindh province, the sectarian aspect and
finally the fears of the smaller provinces.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the political mandate needed to be translated
into institutional strength, "otherwise we would have a permanent
election campaign environment in the country."
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have backed Karamat's proposal of
establishing a national security council and described his
strongly- worded statement as "the final warning" to the
government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif which came to power in
February 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for Karamat, who became army chief
nearly three years ago, to suggest direct army involvement in
policy decisions through a national security council.
</P>
<P>
However, the government, dogged by economic turmoil and bitter
opposition to a proposed constitutional amendment that would
create a new Islamic order in the country, has made no official
comment on Karamat's proposal.

<HEADLINE> Zambians Getting Poorer, Says UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has slipped from 136 in
1996 to 146 in 1998 in a descending order of development listed
by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The per capita GDP in Zambia has fallen gradually from 463
U.S. Dollars in 1974 to 257 Dollars in 1995, according to a
report obtained Wednesday from the office of UNDP's resident
representative in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The publication entitled "Human Development Report 1998" shows
the per capita income of Zambia also fell from 440 Dollars in
1970 to 257 Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the report does not include statistics in 1997 when
Zambia registered a 5.5 percent growth of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
The report also says that of the 9.6 million Zambians, 70
percent are living below the poverty line and their daily per
capita supply of calories reduced from 2,140 in 1970 to 1,915 in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The downtrend in Zambia's economic performance in recent years
was mainly attributed to the country's slow privatization
progress, heavy foreign debt which is currently estimated at 7.1
billion Dollars and reduction of cereal production.

UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council was United on the question of conducting a
comprehensive review of Iraq's progress in dismantling its weapons
of mass destruction, Council President Jeremy Greenstock said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Greenstock, Britain's Ambassador to the United Nations, said
all the members of the Security Council had agreed that the

programme) and cooperation," Greenstock said.

Greenstock was responding to the remarks of Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Aziz. Aziz said Tuesday that he had not got sufficient
guarantees from the Council that it would conduct a comprehensive
review of Iraq's compliance with the relevant resolutions of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The President said Iraq could not afford this time to miss the
opportunity and Iraq must move forward if it wished to get the

<HEADLINE> Two Regions in Somalia Face Famine Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Somali Democratic
Movement (SDM) faction of Bay and Bakol regions in southern
Somalia issued a statement Wednesday expressing concern over
serious drought that has hit the regions.
</P>
<P>
Two children under five and an elderly woman have died of
hunger in the remote village of Dhanawe, 90 km northeast of
Huddor, since the beginning of the month, according to Ali
Mohamed Ibrahim, the SDM health affairs secretary.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim said ten villages in the region of Bakol are the worst
famine-hit areas where more than 3,000 people are now at risk of
dying of hunger. Marasmus and skeleton-like children could be
seen everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have already fled their villages to the
Sheikh Aweys shrine at Biyoley village, 75 km northeast of
Huddor, to pray for rain, while many others sought sanctuary
against the hunger in the shrine. Thousands of Somalis believe
in going to the Sheikh Aweys shrine annually as part of the
religion.
</P>
<P>
People from the area said the drought was mainly caused by
last year's disastrous floods and the subsequent failed attempt
in farming in the past season.
</P>
<P>
"The land has almost become barren after the crops were washed
away last year," said Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said the situation is further aggravated by
sporadic armed clashes between Hussein Aidid's men in the region
and those of the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA).
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim said malnutrition-related diseases such as
tuberculosis, diarrhoea and malaria are also tightening their
grip on the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Skin diseases are also very common," said Ibrahim who
appealed to the international community and regional
organizations to help the people of Bakol region before the
situation deteriorated to the 1991 level.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there are no humanitarian non-governmental
organizations operating in Bakol region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite security problems, the World Food Program
(WFP) is trying hard to get food for the people in the remote
regions and provinces in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
WFP managed to get 400 tons of food to Bakol two months ago.
However, it was barely enough for one village, said Ibrahim.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Belgrade Has to Comply Fully With U.N. Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday warned Belgrade that the only way to avoid air strikes
by the West would be full compliance with U.N. demands to end the
violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a photo opportunity with Hungarian
Prime Minister Viktor Obran, Clinton also acknowledged that the
ultimate solution for the situation in Kosovo most likely would
require an allied military presence on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"The way to avoid NATO military action" is for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to honor the U.N. resolutions
demanding a halt in Serb military action in Kosovo, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is absolutely imperative that there be a
ceasefire, a withdrawal of troops, that the humanitarian groups
get access to these hundreds of thousands of people who have been
displaced, and that negotiations resume," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to efforts by Russia to find a diplomatic solution to
the situation, Clinton told reporters "the most important thing we
can do is work with the Russians to try to actually avoid military
strikes by securing compliance."
</P>
<P>
Russia has voiced its strong opposition to any military action
by NATO in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
"If he (Milosevic) does that, if he completely complies, he
doesn't have to worry about military force," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged that even in the best case scenario, it
was likely that an outside force would be required.
</P>
<P>
"If there are negotiations which result in a settlement, there
might be some request for an international presence to help the
parties to honor a peace agreement," he said.

and that any ground operation should be the responsibility of
European nations.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Rob 22 Million Shillings from Bank in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen broke into
the Victoria Commercial Bank in downtown Nairobi Wednesday,
running away with 22 million Shillings (370,000 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said there were brief exchange of gun fires but
nobody was hurt. The robbery happened at 7:30 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring South African embassy was the victim of a
false alarm caused by the robbery as three bullets hit through
its windows facing the street.
</P>
<P>
The police later confirmed the incident, claiming that five of
the nine bandits have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
However, the looted money has not been recovered yet,
according to the Kenya Television Network (KTN) broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the police gunned down three armed robbers
and seized three revolvers and 68 rounds of bullets in the
northeast of the Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi has seen an upsurge of robberies and other violent
crimes over the past months.
</P>
<P>
The bank attack also came amid a one-month banking crisis in
which four commercial banks had fallen and there are strong
rumors that another three will follow suit by run of depositors.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has 55 commercial banks and financial institutions,
about 12 of which are branches of foreign banks.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Inspectors Demand Full Disclosure by Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. arms inspectors said
on Wednesday that Iraq's disarmament is possibly near its end in
the missile and chemical weapons areas but not in the biological
weapons area.
</P>
<P>
"Full disclosure by Iraq of all necessary material and
information remains the crucial ingredient for both an end to the
disarmament process and future monitoring," said Richard Butler,
Executive Chairman of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM stands for the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, including
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them before the Security Council will
lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council on inspection
activities in the last six months, Butler said Iraq is permitting
UNSCOM's monitoring work to be exercised "only at a less than
satisfactory level".
</P>
<P>
The report said a satisfactory resolution of the question of the
chemical warfare agent VX needs to be achieved, because of its
implications for both the Chemical weapons and missile files.
</P>
<P>
Butler said there are "additional very serious impediments to
the Commission (UNSCOM)'s disarmament work caused by Iraq's
unilateral destruction and concealment actions and its
withholding of relevant documents."
</P>
<P>
"The effects of these actions by Iraq may prove to be that the
Commission is obliged to conclude that it is unable to provide 100
percent verification of the claimed fate or disposition of
prohibited weapons," the report said.
</P>
<P>
When such a conclusion comes to be accepted by the Security
Council, the effectiveness of the future monitoring system,
including UNSCOM's right of full access to any relevant sites,
"becomes even more important," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report came amid a standoff between Iraq and UNSCOM on arms
inspections. On August 5, Iraq decided to suspend cooperation with
UNSCOM, citing "the American influence" on UNSCOM's activities.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has urged Iraq to fully comply with
relevant U.N. resolutions and there have been consultations on how
to implement U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's proposal for a
comprehensive review of U.N. inspections in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Shilling Strengthens Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Shilling firmed
slightly against the U.S. Dollar Wednesday, breaking
the-60-to-the-Dollar barrier amid heavy mid-morning Dollar sales.
</P>
<P>
Dealers quoted the Shilling at around 59.85/59.95 at 09:30 GMT
Wednesday, from around 59.90/60.00 at the opening.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will hold (at less than 60 Shillings to one
Dollar) for very long," said one dealer, though others said weak
demand for the Dollar could strengthen the Shilling further.
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing heavy selling (of Dollars) from exporters," said
one dealer.
</P>
<P>
Exporter selling the Dollar has dominated the Kenyan currency
market all year, while import demand for Dollars remains low.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the Shilling was boosted by sentiment that the
national teachers' strike, which began Monday, was not having a
significant impact on Kenya's political and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya quoted a mean commercial rate of
59.9528 to the Dollar at Wednesday's opening, from Tuesday's
59.9811.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Parliament Criticizes SADC Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Southern African
Development Community (SADC) proposals on the establishment of a
transitional structure until new elections are held in Lesotho
were criticized by Lesotho parliament members Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the first sitting of the National Assembly since it was
adjourned on September 14, parliament member Pashu Mochesane said
the transitional committee suggested by the SADC to prepare for
the elections in 15 to 18 months was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
He said Lesotho could not set up a structure like South
Africa's transitional executive council set up before its first
democratic election in 1994, as the conditions in South Africa at
the time and in Lesotho at present were different, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the present Lesotho government was properly elected
and there was no need for a transitional structure.
</P>
<P>
It was inconceivable for the proposed transitional committee
to access confidential cabinet minutes, particularly in the
sensitive areas of foreign affairs, security and finance,
Mochesane said.
</P>
<P>
Another parliament member, Litsitso Sekamane, also criticized
the SADC proposal, saying there was no provision for such a
structure in the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Sekamane called for action against the perpetrators of the
violence and looting in Lesotho two weeks ago, saying many of the
culprits were well known.
</P>
<P>
After the May election, the ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy (LCD) has 79 of the 80 seats in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A SADC delegation to Monday's multi-party talks in Lesotho
presented the proposal as the LCD and opposition parties
disagreed on the formation of an interim coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties agreed to take the proposal to its
supporters, saying if their supporters agree to it, they would
also agree. Government also said it was in favor of the proposal
in principle.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hails Progress, 'New Spirit' in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EREZ BORDER CROSSING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday substantial progress had
been made in an extended trilateral meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after more than four hours of talks at
the border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip, Albright
said the extended meeting was "important and very productive."
</P>
<P>
She said that she found in the meeting a "new spirit," a
spirit of cooperation and a strong sense of urgency, on both
sides. She described the spirit as "quite helpful" and wished it
will be carried onto the Washington summit, which she announced
will be held on October 15 between Netanyahu, Arafat and
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Significant and substantial progress" has been made in the
meeting on various issues including the further Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank, the security cooperation, the opening of the
Gaza airport and industrial park.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians also agreed to form a joint
committee monitoring anti-Israel incitement in Palestinian
education system and media, and to activate a people-to-people
program.
</P>
<P>
Albright is on the second day of her shuttle diplomacy aimed at
paving the way for the scheduled Washington summit, or in her
words, to put in place the building blocks for the summit.
</P>
<P>
As far as her goal is concerned, Albright said she was "more
than satisfied" with the meeting.
</P>
<P>
She said the "new spirit" was evident in the meeting, noting
that Netanyahu crossed the border into the Palestinian-control
area for the first time for a working lunch with her and
Arafat. Albright toasted at the lunch to "a new chapter" of the
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
What also characterized the "new spirit" was the handshake
between Netanyahu and Arafat before the meeting, a significant
move since the two did not manage to do so when they met twice in
Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
Later at a news conference held in Jerusalem, Netanyahu echoed
Albright by saying that progress has been made. He denied that he
made the move under U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
If an agreement on the second Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank is signed at the Washington summit, there is a possibility
that the two sides will enter the final-status talks on the spot,
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Although Albright said the progress will enable Israel and the
Palestinians to be in "a far better position" to finalize all the
issues at the Washington summit, both she and Netanyahu stressed
that there were still a lot of problems remained to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Albright warned against overoptimism, saying she is
"realistic," while the Israeli prime minister said: "We are going
up the slope, but there is still the mountain to face."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state will leave the region for Europe
later Wednesday, but U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross and
Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk will continue the
efforts "to move the ball on."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy to Shuttle Between Cypriot Communities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. envoy said here Wednesday
that she will soon start separate talks with leaders of Cyprus'
two communities after "productive" and "useful" visits to Athens
and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Upon returning from her trips to Greece and Turkey, Dame Ann
Hercus, the United Nations chief Kofi Annan's deputy special
representative for Cyprus, said that "both visits were very
productive."
</P>
<P>
"In both capitals I had very useful discussions which provide a
positive perspective for my efforts," Hercus said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy has paid "an introductory visit" to Greece and
Turkey, where she held talks with the two countries' foreign
ministers and other officials on the protracted Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Hercus said the positive results of her visits will facilitate
her shuttle mission between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has decided that Hercus starts contacts with the two
Cypriot communities aimed at reducing tensions and promoting
progress toward a just and lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
Both Clerides and Denktash have "expressed their support for
such a process and have promised to cooperate in a constructive
and flexible manner," a U.N. statement issued last week said.
</P>
<P>
The direct talks between the two sides broke down last year
after Denktash walked out of the talks in protest against European
Union's decision to start accession negotiations with the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after an
abortive coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying ever since to help reunify the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal formula. But so far no tangible
results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Satisfied with Result of Protest Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
was satisfied that the protest actions held by a number of
political forces throughout the country proceeded calmly,
presidential press secretary Dmitri Yakushkin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said that the president closely followed the protests
and contacted security and police chiefs, who reported the
situation in various regions.
</P>
<P>
According to the presidential spokesman, Yeltsin expressed
"cautious hope" that the nation is retreating from headlong
confrontation and said "the nation has matured".
</P>
<P>
A long-designed nationwide protest action organized by the
Federation of Free Russian Trade Union and the Communist Party of
Russia was held Wednesday in Moscow, St.Petersburg and 493 other
towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 rallied in Moscow outside the Kremlin, while a
total of 615,000 people participated in the protest actions
throughout Russia, Yakushkin quoted the presidential side as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The protester mainly demanded the resignation of the president
and payment of wage arrears, as well as adoption of laws to
guarantee the social rights of the working people.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Russia's Independent Trade Unions Mikhail Shmakov
said that if the president cannot cope with the social problems,
he should leave the post of president immediately.
</P>
<P>
Shmakov also announced that the trade unions were ready to back
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's economic program, giving the top
priority to the development of the national industry.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov on the whole agreed
with the new government's initial steps and Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov's address on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He believed the government's initial steps aimed at working out
a more realistic policy have yielded positive results.
</P>
<P>
The police took some 25 young protesters from the area around
St. Basil's Cathedral near the red square to the police department
at 19:00 on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Kurdish Leader Condemns Fresh Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Iraq's Kurdistan
Democratic Party has vehemently condemned the fresh Turkish
intervention in the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq,
official Iraqi News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the agency, the party's
Secretary-General Ahmad Mohammed al-Atroushi held Turkey
responsible for the results of its "irresponsible behaviors and
its interferences" in Iraq's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday that on
October 2, over 10,000 Turkish troops launched a new invasion
against Iraq under the pretext of tracking down rebellious
elements threatening Turkish national security.
</P>
<P>
Al-Atroushi said in his statement that it is not in the
interest of Turkey to launch an aggression on Iraq but rather to
enhance cooperation and good relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey's failure to settle its internal problems and to grant
Kurdish and other nationalities their national rights will
aggravate Turkey's problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party has been fighting since
1984 for autonomy in southeast Turkey. It frequently launched
cross-border attacks on Turkish government troops from their bases
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish incursions into northern Iraq is in line with the
U.S. strategy. It is a chapter of vicious aggression on the people
of Iraq," al-Atroushi said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks echoed that of Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman who
said that the fresh Turkish invasion coincided with the feverish
activities made by the U.S. with the objective of placing the
region under its hegemony.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long been accusing Turkey of making its territory as
a spring board for the U.S. and British forces to impose the
no-fly zone in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Risks Loss of GA Vote Next Year With No Due Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- United Nations member
states owe the world body 2.507 billion U.S. dollars, and the
United States, which remains the largest contributor to the U.N.
financial crisis, will risk "automatic loss" of its vote in the
General Assembly in the coming year, a senior U.N. official said
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Connor, U.N. under-secretary-general for management,
told a press conference that the United States owed the United
Nations some 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in arrears, which accounts
for 67 percent of the total unpaid dues.
</P>
<P>
"The loss of vote in the General Assembly (GA) under Article
19 (of the U.N. Charter) is automatic unless the GA specificly
decides to grant an exception or until the minimum necessary
payment has been received," he said.
</P>
<P>
In late November and early December, the U.N. Secretariat
alerts those member states, including the United States, that they
are in danger in the following year of application of Article 19
of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat usually sends a letter to a Member Country who
does not pay its back dues, informing it of how much it owes and
the amount of the minimum payable in order to avoid the
application of Article 19.
</P>
<P>
The article says: "A Member State of the United Nations which
is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the
Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the
amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the
contributions due from it for the preceding two full years."
</P>
<P>
The two-year period ran from the beginning of December 1996
to the end of November 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the United States does not pay its back dues, it will
"surely" lose its vote in the General Assembly in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
The non-payment of dues had caused a regular budget deficit
which could grow as high as 247 million U.S. dollars by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cash in the peacekeeping budget was expected to be
around 775 million U.S. dollars at the end of this year -- the
lowest amount in five years -- and a significant portion of it
would be cross-borrowed to "bail out" the regular budget.
</P>
<P>
As a result of cross-borrowing from the peacekeeping budget,
there would be little -- if any -- funds left to pay the more
than 860 million U.S. dollars owed to Member States for troops
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2.507 billion U.S. dollars owed to the United Nations as
of the end of September, 67 percent was due from the United States,
and Washington also owed some 61 percent of the outstanding
peacekeeping dues, estimated at the end of September to be 1.701
billion U.S. dollars, Connor said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not through a new financial crisis (within the U.N.
system), but we are through the replay of the 1995 financial
crisis," he said, referring to the year with lowest amount of
the payment of regular budget assessments.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, Connor said that for the first time in
recent years, more than 100 Member States had paid their regular
budget contributions in full for 1998 and all prior years by the
end of September.
</P>
<P>
Although this was heartening, the overall picture was not:
some 81 percent of the 1998 assessments had been received, down
from 88 percent and 87 percent respectively in 1997 and 1996.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Rapped for alleged Involvement in Congo (K) Crisis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Rwandan Vice-President, Major General Paul Kagame,
war on the side of President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda and Rwanda strongly condemn the involvement of Sudan
in the conflict of the Democratic Republic of Congo and question
the wisdom of any continued support for the Kabila-Sudan
alliance," the two leaders said in a joint communique issued in
Rwakitura, Uganda Tuesday, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
But Sudan denied any involvement in the Congo Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kagame had gone to Rwakitura, Museveni's farm, on Monday to
discuss with him the on-going crisis in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The statement issued at the end of the meeting commended
efforts being made in search of a solution to the crisis in Congo
(K) where Tutsi-led rebels revolted since August 2 and now still
occupy large tracts of territory in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
Uganda also reiterated the purpose of its presence in Congo,
saying, "the military presence of Uganda in the Democratic
Republic of Congo is based on genuine and legitimate security

interests and on its determination to prevent genocide."
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda continues to face insecurity caused by former Rwanda
armed forces (ex-Far)" and "Interahamwe militia based in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and supported by the Kabila
government," RNA quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda also Charged the Kabila regime with carrying out the
state-inspired acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing of targeted
groups of people in Democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda reiterated its resolve to deal with the above concerns
using all appropriate means," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia sent troops to stop the rebels'
marching on capital Kinshasa and drive them out of the west in
late August, and Chad also sent troops to help Kabila fight the
rebels in the east.

<P>
At the end of their meeting the two leaders called for a
negotiated settlement of the conflict through talks that would
involve the government in Kinshasa, the Congolese rebels, and
opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
So far Kabila refuses to have direct talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
All the resolution of the Congo crisis must "address in an
acceptable and sustainable way, the legitimate interests of all
the neighboring states," the two leaders said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Youths Urged to Play Bigger Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- President Joaquim Chissano
called on the youths in the country here Wednesday to play a more
active role in the drive to build a prosperous Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the forth national conference of the Organization
of Mozambican Youths, Chissano said the government recognizes the
potential of the youths and gives priority to their education,
housing employment and other issues in the five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
The youths should be pioneers to meet the challenge of the new
century, and should show special attention to the development of
information and communication, he noted.
</P>
<P>
But it is pity that many of the youths become "illiterate" in
terms of computer, and many have even never touched a
type-writer, not to speak of a computer, Chissano said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting attended by about 250 delegates, Chissano said
plan should be mapped out to attract youths in future social
construction programs.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique won its independence in 1975, but 16 years of civil
war has brought great losses to the conntry's economy.

CAIRO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
is due here Wednesday night for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on the progress in the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that Arafat will brief Mubarak on the
outcome of his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
earlier Wednesday on the overdue Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>

After the lengthy talks, Albright told a news conference that
they have made "significant progress" toward a West Bank accord.
</P>
<P>
She said that Arafat and Netanyahu will participate in a summit
with U.S. President Bill Clinton next Thursday in Washinton for an
agreement on the long-delayed Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are striving to narrow their gaps
over a U.S. proposal demanding Israel to pull back from a further
13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that he is scheduled to meet with U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Martin Indyk Thursday.
</P>

LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's inter-party meeting,
which failed to materialize as planned for last December after
former president Kenneth Kaunda's arrest, will be held on October
21, a party official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
National Secretary of the ruling Movement for Multi-party
Democracy (MMD) Michael Sata said 18 political parties including
the ruling MMD and main opposition party, the United National
Independence Party (UNIP) led by Kaunda will attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion UNIP trustee Mainza Chona urged all
parties to avoid finger-pointing to make the planned meeting
successful.
</P>
<P>
Early last December, 31 political parties worked out an agenda
at preliminary meetings for the inter-party dialog.
</P>
<P>
However, as the party leaders were going to participate in the
dialog, Kaunda was arrested for alleged involvement in the
October 28 failed coup.
</P>
<P>
In protest against Kaunda's arrest, many parties announced
their withdrawal from the planned dialog.
</P>
<P>
After his release from under house arrest early last June,
Kaunda called for resumption of the inter-party dialog.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Criticizes Conspirators Misusing Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Wednesday criticized once again "certain
conspirators misusing freedom of expression."
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with officials of the Construction Jihad
Ministry, Khamenei noted that expressing different views is
different from treason and conspiracy, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in one month that Khamenei has called
for stopping misuse of freedom of expression in the country.
</P>
<P>
A group of dailies and weeklies, mainly from the leftist and
moderate factions, were closed down by the conservative judiciary
after the Iranian leader urged the relevant authorities last
month to seriously deal with freedom-abusing by the press.
</P>
<P>
Certain elements have embarked on sabotaging the government's
economic programs, launching an offensive against the security,
cultural and military structures in an attempt to undermine the
main pillars of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conspirators are trying to weaken the youth's
hope for their future and misuse every means to strike a blow at
the Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We have said time and again that expressing views on every
issue is free and those having objections to the government's
plans are entitled to publish their objections and no one will
stop them," he said, "but there exists a fundamental difference
between objection and sabotage."
</P>
<P>
He said "critique and criticism of the government's policies
are not bad, but when someone attempts to undermine the
foundations of the government, it is a treason and not freedom of
expression ... The enemy's hands are seen in such practices."

<HEADLINE> President Signs Higher Education Assistance Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Wednesday signed a higher education bill, which lowers
student-loan interest rates that would save borrowers an estimated
11 billion U.S. dollars over five years.
</P>
<P>
"Today with this lowering of the interest rates... we can
really say that every high school graduate in America, regardless
of income, can afford to go to college," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The White House said a typical student borrower at a four-year
college, graduating with 13,000 dollars in debt, would save about
700 dollars over a 10-year repayment period.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, while appreciating both Democratic and Republican
lawmakers for their support to the bill, called on Congress to
approve other education bills, including his proposals for hiring
100,000 more public school teachers to reduce class sizes and
spending more to modernize aging school buildings.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the higher education bill would enhance the
economic strength, strengthen the communities, improve the lives
of families and widen the circle of opportunity in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The bill creates a new interest-rate formula for student loans.
The rate for students would be 7.46 percent for graduates starting
to repay their loans, the lowest rate in 17 years. Rates are
capped at 8.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Students who refinance their loans could get lower interest
rates if they applied before January 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The measure also raises the maximum authorized amount for Pell
Grants from the present 3,000 dollars to 4,500 dollars a year in
1999-2000, and in steps to 5,800 dollars in 2003-2004. But
Congress would have to provide the money.
</P>
<P>
The bill also raises the ceiling on grants and work-student for
needy students and takes steps to improve teacher preparation,
monitor college costs, report campus crimes, monitor hate crimes
and discourage drug or alcohol abuse.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reiterates Position on U.N.-backed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government
reiterated Wednesday that it is ready to engage in a dialog with
the Turkish Cypriot side on the basis of a bizonal, bicommunal
federation as provided by the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus will not accept any discussion on suggestions to deal
with the Turkish Cypriot side-proposed Cyprus confederation,
government spokesman Christos Stylianides said following a cabinet
meeting, shortly before the "on-island contacts" between the two
Cypriot communities, to be conducted by Dame Ann Hercus, the
U.N. chief Kofi Annan's deputy special representative in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that "our position is clear and
specific. There is no doubt how the government and the political
leadership will react to should the Turkish Cypriot side put
forward proposals for confederation during shuttle diplomacy
talks."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, who walked out of the
peace negotiations with the Cypriot government last year, proposed
in August the establishment of a confederation of two equal states
in Cyprus as the basis for the resumption of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal was rejected by the Cypriot government and
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
After recent separate meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Denktash in New York, U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan proposed to develop a process "for on-island contacts with
both parties, with the goal of reducing tensions and promoting
progress toward a just and lasting settlement."
</P>
<P>
Hercus is expected to sponsor the shuttle talks with the two
sides soon after her consultations in Ankara and Athens. The
agenda of the talks has not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Turkish Cypriot position that U.N.-sponsored
talks should be conducted on the basis of the proposal for a Cyprus
confederation, the spokesman said "once more the Turkish Cypriot
side is trying to revoke events and facts as these have been
shaped within the framework of the Security Council, the
U.N. Secretary-General and the joint statement of the foreign
ministers of the permanent members of the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the divided
island through a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula, but so
far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Ruling Party to Amend Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan ruling party Mpla
has made known its revised draft constitution, which will among
others abolish the position of deputy ministers and allow the
president to execute the right as head of the government.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft constitution published in a fortnightly
magazine run by the ruling People's Liberation Movement of
Angola, has enlarged from 166 to 339 articles on the presidential
system, which will greatly expand the power of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Civil rights, the cardinal principles of the state are also
expanded in the revised constitution draft, with death penalty
kept in the new laws.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution plans to drop out the positions of deputy
ministers and adds articles on the rights and treatment for
retired parliament members and former presidents.
</P>
<P>
An anti-corruption institution was also proposed in the new
document.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution needs consultations with other parties.
But it will go to parliamentary session and most likely be
adopted, as the ruling party has 129 seats in the legislature
while other parties have only 24 seats, apart from the banned
National Union for Total Independence of Angolas (UNITA) which
has 70 seats.

CAIRO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak upon his arrival
here on Wednesday night on his meetings with Israeli and U.S.
leaders, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held at the Cairo International Conference
Center and attended by Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri,
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Presidential Political Advisor Osama
el-Baz, as well as Secretary General of Palestine Liberation
Organization Executive Committee Mahmoud Abbas and Arafat's
advisor Nabil Abu Redina.
</P>
<P>
Arafat explained the outcome of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's separate talks with him and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the past two days and the
tripartite meeting among them earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite encounter lasted for two hours at the Israeli
side of the Erez crossing point and continued on the Palestinian
side of Beit Hanoun checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
After her lengthy talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders,
Albright announced that an October 15 summit would be held in
Washington to try to work out agreement on a West Bank withdrawal
accord.
</P>
<P>
She said they have made "significant progress," and are in a
far better position to finalize all the issues.
</P>
<P>
Albright flew to the region to narrow differences between the
two sides on a U.S. proposal on a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian crackdown on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Israel on Monday night on her third visit
to the region since she took office in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs
Martin Indyk and U.S. Mideast peace coordinator Dennis Ross will
hold further talks in the region after Albright's departure.
</P>

LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Lusaka Mayor Fisho Mwale called
here Wednesday for an improved water supply for the people living
in squatter compounds of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 5,000 people in the squatter compounds share a

Over 70 percent of the population of the city are living in

Mwale said that water is a matter of life and death and
therefore any efforts made toward the improvement of the delivery
system to the residents is commendable.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when a managing director of a tobacco
company, Kennedy Mandevhani of the Rothmans of Pall Mall Company,
made a pledge to donate a bore-hole in any area of Lusaka facing
persistent water problems.

Mwale promised to work promptly to identify an area in Lusaka

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, Greens Agree on Alliance for Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD) and its potential
partners, the Greens, agreed Wednesday to launch an Alliance for
Jobs to tackle the country's top issue -- high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a second round of coalition negotiations between
the SPD and Greens, Schroeder said that the two parties had agreed
on the outlines of their future economic policy with the reduction
of unemployment through an Alliance for Jobs as the center piece.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance for Jobs, a key plank of SPD policy, is a forum
for trade unions, employers and the government to work together to
create jobs and training places.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that the Alliance for Jobs would specify the
duties for all parties concerned with regard to job creation.
Measures envisaged include more part-time jobs, less overtime jobs
and more training places for young people and improving employment
opportunities for the less qualified.
</P>
<P>
During their negotiations Wednesday, the two sides also worked
out a concept for rebuilding the depressed eastern German economy
and agreed in principle to start a so-call ecological tax reform
to reduce non-wage labor costs through an increase in energy
prices.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides admitted that they had still to face tough
negotiations Thursday to seek a compromise on the details of the
tax reform.
</P>
<P>
The ecology-minded Greens want to raise the price of petrol to
five German marks (about three U.S. dollars) per liter over the
next 10 years. The SPD has said that it would accept an increase
of six pfennigs per liter.
</P>
<P>
The two parties also differed on issues such as NATO expansion,
the shutdown of nuclear power plants, and whether to impose speed
limits on the German highways.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the country's
general elections on September 27, said Wednesday that he saw good
chances for the SPD and Greens to wind up their coalition talks by
October 19.
</P>
<P>
If a coalition accord could be worked out, the new German
parliament would formally elect Schroeder chancellor on October
27.

<HEADLINE> IAEA Finds No Evidence of Nuclear Weapons in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) in charge of verifying Iraq's nuclear weapons
reaffirmed Wednesday that Iraq has not achieved its program goal
of producing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna-based agency said it has found no indication of Iraq
having retained a physical capability for the production of
weapon-useable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained
such material.
</P>
<P>
IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBaradel made the remarks in the
agency's latest report to the U.N. Security Council. The report
covers IAEA's verification in the last six months. Similar
assessment was made in the previous report in April.
</P>
<P>
But the agency "points out the limitations inherent in a
countrywide verification process and consequently its inability to
guarantee that all readily concealable items have been found," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's decision on August 5 to suspend cooperation with IAEA
has prevented IAEA from exercising "full and free access" to new
verification sites, said IAEA, adding that "the level of assurance
the IAEA can give that prohibited activities are not taking place
is significantly reduced."
</P>
<P>
Nuclear weapons are included in the category of the weapons of
mass destruction which Iraq must destroy in exchange for the
Security Council to lift sanctions imposed on it after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The European Union (EU) has agreed to grant Lebanon a
loan of 45 million U.S. dollars to help upgrade its
administration, the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Beshara Merhej, Lebanese state minister for administrative
reform, said after a meeting with EU representatives on Tuesday
that the loan would cover half of the sum needed in a government
plan to develop the administration technically and train the
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Merhej said that this is the biggest loan given by the
15-nation European organization to Lebanon in a bid to develop its
administration.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's Transport Ministry is considering reducing
the transport fees on goods heading for Jordan via the port of
Beirut to compete with Israel, the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The average transport fee from Lebanon to Jordan is estimated at
85 dollars per tonne, 63 dollars more than that from Israel's
Mediterranean port of Haifa, due to much longer distance.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese ministry has tried before to cut the fees on
vehicles carrying goods to Jordan. But it still has a long way to
go, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Abu Dhabi has announced that it is trying to
attract foreign investments to the oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi and Dubai last week set up a company for producing
petrochemicals with a capital of 4 billion dirhams (1.1 billion
dollars), inviting foreign firms and the private sector of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) to join in.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and other Gulf countries need an estimated investment
of 50 billion dollars in the next 10 years for expanding the
oil and gas sector and the petrochemical industries.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Two Saudi foodstuff companies have announced a
merger plan, which will lead to the emergence of the largest
foodstuff group in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Monday by Saudi Prince Walid Bin Talal said
the merger agreement was reached last week between his Alaziziya
United Banda Company and the Safola Company.
</P>

The capital of the merged company stands at 1.3 billion Saudi
riyals (346 million dollars), the statement said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Assist Zambia With $100m in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A country director of the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID) said Wednesday that
his organization will continue ot assist Zambia with the required
aid of 100 million U.S. Dollars for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Briefing cooperating partners here in Lusaka, Walter North
said the aid to Zambia might increase, depending on the country's
economic performance and its democratic governance, according to
Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
North added that if Zambia did well in these two fields it
would be rewarded for its performance.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made after the western donors had suspended
their aid to Zambia in the past months on the excuse that the
country made little progress in privatization and good
governance.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement concluded with the Zambian government last
May, the donors would release 530 million Dollars to Zambia in
1998 on condition that the country could privatize its copper
mining conglomerate, the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
However, North was saddened to note that Zambia's legacy from
a generation of misrule was widespread poverty, an unsustainable
debt burden and crumbling infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of the Zambians are living below the poverty
line and the country's foreign debt has amounted to 7.1 billion
Dollars in the past year, said a recently released report
prepared by the U.N. Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
USAID, which is a U.S. government agency responsible for
development assistance and has about 80 missions all over the
world, supports Zambia in four key areas of increasing rural
incomes, basic education, health and democratic governance.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets End Volatile Session Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- It was a day of fluctuating
fortunes on the European stock markets, with shares eventually
ending lower.
</P>
<P>
The London Stock Exchange ended the day with modest losses,
with the FTSE 100 index of leading shares falling 25.1 to 4,828.9,
as financial stocks continued to recover ahead of Thursday's
interest rate verdict, which remains "too close to call."
</P>
<P>
The broader indices also pushed into negative territory. Market
volume stood at a healthy 995m shares.
</P>
<P>
"It's been another choppy day, but this time backed up by
decent volume," one broker from a U.K. bank said, adding that some
players had been "caught short" when the FTSE 100 bounced off its
intra-day low of 4,777.1 mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The balance of risks favors a 25 basis point cut tomorrow, but
only just," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will announce
its decision on interest rates at midday. A quarter point cut had
been widely expected until the Office for National Statistics
revised up June average earnings growth Tuesday, which sparked
fears that domestically-generated inflation is not yet under
control.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the late session turnaround was largely fueled by
a surprising rally on Wall Street, where comments by U.S. Fed
chief Alan Greenspan raised hopes of another U.S. rate cut.
</P>
<P>
However, profit-taking quickly ate into the U.S. rally, which
in turn drove London lower as well.
</P>
<P>
Fresh hopes that Japan may at last address its banking problems
and the domestic rate outlook boosted financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares resumed their downward slide on
after a one-day respite. The Xetra Dax closed down 121.2 points at
4,064.
</P>
<P>
A weak dollar against the Deutschmark, which could hit German
exports, and persistent concern over the effect the global
financial crisis will have on corporate profits lead to the
decline.
</P>
<P>
The index opened the day much higher on the back of strong
gains in Tokyo. But traders said volumes were thin. "This is the
end of the bounce," one trader said.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks also closed down, with the Cac 40 index
closing 38.8 points lower at 3,097.69.

<HEADLINE> Slightly Higher Cancer Risk for Passive Smokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A 10-year and large-scale
study across Europe indicates that adults exposed to second-hand
smoke at home and in the workplace have a slightly higher risk of
lung cancer, but it found no increased risk to children of passive
smoking.
</P>
<P>
The study, according to Wednesday's Washington Post, found
that passive smoking is a definite, although small, cause of lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Previous studies also shown that secondhand smoke can cause
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Researchers, led by Paolo Boffetta from International Agency
for Research on Cancer, said passive smokers breathed in about the
same amount of smoke as very light smokers who smoke a cigarette
every other day or so. They found that passive smokers have about
1 percent of cotinine, a breakdown product of nicotine, found in
the blood of active smokers.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Pledges to Safeguard Farmers' Inputs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian vice-president Christon
Tembo warned Wednesday the government will take stern measures to
punish anyone exporting illegally agricultural inputs intended
for local peasant farmers during this year's farming season.
</P>
<P>
He said in Eastern Province that the government has taken over
the responsibility of distributing the agricultural inputs to the
peasant farmers and will not condone the illegal export of
fertilizers and seed maize to neighboring countries by some
unscrupulous people at the expense of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
He told a public meeting that some agriculture credit
coordinators have over the past years intentionally dented the
government's image in the farmers' minds by hijacking and
illegally exporting fertilizers for their personal gains.
</P>
<P>
"I am appealing to all district agricultural officers and
village head men through whom the inputs will be disbursed to
report to the police anyone who will be seen and found to be
selling the fertilizers illegally for their selfish gains to
deprive the beneficiaries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the fertilizers have begun arriving in the country and
will sold at 30,000 (about 15 U.S. Dollars) for each 50kg bag and
peasant farmers who cannot afford to buy it will be given loans
on condition that they repay the loans with one 90kg bag of maize
for each fertilizer bag they obtained.
</P>
<P>
Tembo urged the farmers in the province and the country at
large to take advantage of the gesture because the government
will not continue to give the food relief hand-outs every year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Vote on Principle, Not Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- With a vote to start an
impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled
for Thursday, the president Wednesday urged lawmakers to vote
their consciences while working the phones to build support in the
House of Representatives, where Republicans are expected to
approve impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of 40 freshman Democrats attended a White
House meeting with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who also
urged them to vote based on "what they think is right," according
to White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first presidential impeachment proceeding since
Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal in 1974.
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone should cast a vote on principle and
conscience," Clinton told reporters during a photo session with
visiting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to others to decide what happens to me, and ultimately
it's going to be up to the American people to make a clear
statement there," he said.
</P>
<P>
The White House invited the freshman Democrats for a session
with the first lady, who urged them to vote for a Democratic
alternative that would limit the length and scope of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
She told them to base their vote on "what they think is right,
what their conscience tells them to vote," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said, "She made the explicit point that this White
House stands ready to work with Democrats, support Democrats, help
them get elected, work into the future, no matter how they vote."
</P>
<P>
Democratic House members, uncertain how the vote might affect
the November 3 mid-term elections, met in closed caucus Wednesday
morning to discuss the upcoming vote.
</P>
<P>
Participants said the meeting was tense at times as a divided
caucus tried to plot a course through an impeachment process that
could spell trouble for Democrats in close races, news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton played down the perception that he was engaged in an
aggressive lobbying campaign trying to talk Democrats into not
joining with Republicans to approve the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
"There have been conversations with members," he said. "A large
number called me, and I am attempting to call them all back."
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich also called Thursday's decision
"vote of conscience."
</P>
<P>
"There will be no whipping of our members, there will be no
arm-twisting. Members need to take this vote as a matter of
conscience and we'll let the chips fall where they may tomorrow,"
he said after a Republican caucus Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On a party-line 21-16 vote, the House Judiciary Committee late
Monday approved launching the inquiry and rejected two Democratic
alternatives that would have limited the length and scope of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Democrats struggled to hash out another alternative plan, which
would be offered as part of a procedural vote Thursday to send the
resolution back to committee, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Seek Parliamentary Consent for War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said here Wednesday that his government might request
parliamentary consent for a war with Syria, although war is still
not desired.
</P>
<P>
Addressing deputies in the parliament following a cabinet
meeting to determine Turkey's policy towards Syria, Yilmaz said
that "we are not trying to create a war with Syria. The real
objective is to safeguard Turkey's vital interests."
</P>
<P>
"We don't really wish to do so, but if necessary, we are ready
to get the consent of the parliament," he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pointed out that Syria has been supporting
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) for 14 years, but has
denied it.
</P>
<P>
He said that "I would like to reiterate that Turkey has been
given the right for self-defense according to Article 51 of the
United Nations Charter."
</P>
<P>
Ankara has given Damascus a viable opportunity through
diplomatic channels with good intentions, but the Syrian
administration had not responded to these calls, said Yilmaz,
adding that "Syria believes that it can get away by denying the
realities."
</P>
<P>
He added that Syria has been irresponsibly denying that it is
sheltering PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who controls his illegal
organization and contacts foreign government officials.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has demanded that Syria extradite Ocalan, stop PKK
attacks on Turkey from the Syrian territory, punish the attackers
and give up supporting the PKK with weapons, money and logistics,
said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkey will not allow Syria to use its
support for international terrorism as a bargaining
chip.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Opens 3rd Int'l Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Wednesday officially opened the western Eldoret International
Airport, the third in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important milestone in my government's efforts to
develop an effective air transportation," a report quoted Moi as
saying at a ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The airport is strategically located in the western part of
Kenya in order to facilitate increased exploitation of the large
potential for agricultural and industrial growth in east African
region, he said. Eldoret is the fifth biggest city of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The airport is widely expected to promote the western and
northwestern tourist circuits and promote trade links among the
East African Cooperation and the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
So far over 6,000 tons of flowers have been exported through
this airport directly to international markets.
</P>
<P>
Moi said the airport will take favorable measures including
scheduled services, grant unrestricted access to non-scheduled
flights, lower landing fee, free parking of aircraft and reduced
charges for air navigation services so as to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
Moi also said there is an urgent need to formulate policies to
further strengthen Kenya's central location in east African
region and enhance its growth and development into a commercial
and air transport hub for the region and beyond.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Announces Readiness to Mediate between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Wednesday announced his readiness to mediate between
Turkey and Syria to defuse the spiraling tensions between them.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the announcement in his separate telephone
conversations with his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad and
Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was ready to go personally or to send Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi to Turkey and Syria to help the two
neighbors settle their differences.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president also announced readiness to host al-Assad
and Demirel in Tehran to reach a reconciliation between Damascus
and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
With a war of words escalating recently, relations between
Turkey and Syria have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of harboring and supporting the
Kurdish Workers' Party rebels fighting for autonomy in southeast
Turkey. Syria has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the ongoing tensions between Turkey and
Syria, Khatami underlined the need for the two Muslim neighbors
to solve their problems through political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The tensions between two Muslim neighbors will not benefit any
country in the region but the enemies of Muslims and those who do
not want tranquility in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami called on Turkey and Syria to stop any action and
propaganda against each other, adding that resorting to force and
threat would only intensify the problems between Muslim brothers.
</P>
<P>
Both al-Assad and Demirel expressed welcome to any initiatives
by Iran to defuse the tensions, IRNA said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Stock Market in Record Low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nairobi stock market, which
saw a sustained downturn lately, has hit a record low in 10
years, caused by recent economic and political chaos, trend
analysts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned that if the government carries out the
controversial teachers' 150-200 percent pay rise promised last
year, its domestic debt may rise through Treasury bills,
diverting investors from the equity market to the money market.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide teachers' strike demanding the government's
implementation of the pay rise has entered the third day
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A stock-broker said the strike had made investors fear that
implementing the new salary structure may plunge the country into
serious depression as the economic growth is already slowing
down.
</P>
<P>
"If the government has to pay teachers, the 1.2 billion
Shillings (20 million U.S. Dollars) may have to be raised through
domestic debt, forcing interest rates up," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This will in turn attract more investors to the Treasury
bills and bonds markets, instead of the equity market," said the
stock-broker.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the stock market had already suffered a blow,
following the recent collapse of several small banks in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Anxiety on the planned Vote of no-confidence by some
opposition lawmakers against the government had also put on hold
some prospective investors.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, there was improved trading at the stock market,
as turnover went up to 7.1 million Shillings, from Tuesday's 3.93
million Shillings.
</P>
<P>
A Nairobi Stock Exchange official said later that plans were
underway to start recruiting new companies, to increase liquidity
in the market.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the market trend is not good, with many trading
companies, at least we will be assured of more liquidity than it
is at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 146,000 shares changed hands in 240 deals
Wednesday, compared to 104,000 shares in 163 deals previously.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jewish Settlement Conferred City Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite United States call to
halt settlement construction, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu conferred city status Wednesday to the Ariel Jewish
settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony, Netanyahu told settlers that Ariel
would remain under the sovereignty of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"This place will be part of Israel in any final status
agreement in the future," he said
</P>
<P>
He said the local authority would build a new cultural center
in Ariel and the community college would be expanded into a
university.
</P>
<P>
The settlement, established in 1977, is located in the middle
of the West Bank, about 30 kilometers east of the Israeli coastal
city of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held hours after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright wrapped up a mediation mission between Israel
and the Palestinians over the overdue Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Both the Palestinians and the U.S. oppose Israel's settlement
activities in the occupied territories, calling on the Jewish
state to halt unilateral actions.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Rapped for alleged Involvement in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Rwandan Vice-President, Major General Paul Kagame,
have condemned the alleged involvement of Sudan in the Congo (k)
war on the side of President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda and Rwanda strongly condemn the involvement of Sudan
in the conflict of the Democratic Republic of Congo and question
the wisdom of any continued support for the Kabila-Sudan
alliance," the two leaders said in a joint communique issued in
Rwakitura, Uganda Tuesday, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
But Sudan denied any involvement in the Congo Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kagame had gone to Rwakitura, Museveni's farm, on Monday to
discuss with him the on-going crisis in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The statement issued at the end of the meeting commended
efforts being made in search of a solution to the crisis in Congo
(K) where Tutsi-led rebels revolted since August 2 and now still
occupy large tracts of territory in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
Uganda also reiterated the purpose of its presence in Congo,
saying, "the military presence of Uganda in the Democratic
Republic of Congo is based on genuine and legitimate security
interests and on its determination to prevent genocide."
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda continues to face insecurity caused by former Rwanda
armed forces (ex-Far)" and "Interahamwe militia based in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and supported by the Kabila
government," RNA quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda also Charged the Kabila regime with carrying out the
state-inspired acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing of targeted
groups of people in Democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda reiterated its resolve to deal with the above concerns
using all appropriate means," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia sent troops to stop the rebels'
marching on capital Kinshasa and drive them out of the west in
late August, and Chad also sent troops to help Kabila fight the
rebels in the east.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their meeting the two leaders called for a
negotiated settlement of the conflict through talks that would
involve the government in Kinshasa, the Congolese rebels, and
opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
So far Kabila refuses to have direct talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
All the resolution of the Congo crisis must "address in an
acceptable and sustainable way, the legitimate interests of all
the neighboring states," the two leaders said.

EREZ BORDER CROSSING -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Wednesday substantial progress had been made in an
extended trilateral meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after more than four hours of talks at
the border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip, Albright

</P>
<P>
She said that she found in the meeting a "new spirit," a
spirit of cooperation and a strong sense of urgency, on both
sides. She described the spirit as "quite helpful" and wished it
will be carried onto the Washington summit, which she announced
will be held on October 15 between Netanyahu, Arafat and
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Significant and substantial progress" has been made in the
meeting on various issues including the further Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank, the security cooperation, the opening of the
Gaza airport and industrial park.
</P>

Israel and the Palestinians also agreed to form a joint
committee monitoring anti-Israel incitement in Palestinian
education system and media, and to activate a people-to-people

<HEADLINE> Daughter of Indonesia's Soekarno Opens PDI Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A congress of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) led by Megawati Soekarnoputri, the daughter
of founding president Soekarno, opened in Denpasar, Bali, with a
commitment to establish a just government.
</P>
<P>
Opening the congress, Megawati said her party would establish a
just government which would not hesitate to uphold justice, after
the next general elections scheduled for May next year.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara news agency, Megawati, 51, proposed a
five-point political package for discussion at the congress which
will last until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The five points are loyalty to the 1945 constitution and the
Pancasila state ideology, priority to the people's sovereignty,
promotion of human rights, maintaining national unity and
integrity, and the implementation of independent and active
political systems.
</P>
<P>
Pancasila is the five basic principles of the Republic of
Indonesia -- the belief in the one and only god, just and
civilized humanity, the unity of Indonesia, democracy guided by
the inner wisdom in the unanimity arising out of deliberations
amongst representatives, social justice for the whole of the
people of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Among those who attended the opening ceremony of the congress
were Bali governor Dewa Made Bratha, retired generals grouped in
the National Front Kemal Idris, Edy Sudradjat and Ali Sadikin.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors of South Africa and Brazil and 13 other
representatives of foreign missions in Indonesia also attended the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bali police chief Brig. Gen. Gunawan said the
opening ceremony of the three-day congress went smoothly and
orderly.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 police officers plus 1,400 military personnel have
been deployed to tighten security for the event. The local chapter
of Megawati's camp has recruited 1,000 supporters as security
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The conflict-ridden PDI is the second largest opposition party
in Indonesia. Megawati was ousted two years ago as leader of the
PDI in a move backed by the Soeharto government.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who replaced the late Soekarno in 1965, was himself
forced out of office on May 21 this year in a wave of public anger
and bloody riots amid the Asian economic crisis which plunged
Indonesia into its worst recession in decades.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in August, a congress was held by the government-backed
PDI in Palu, Central Sulawesi, and elected Budi Hardjono as new
chairman of the party.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the congress' agenda of Megawati's faction
included a change in its name from PDI, a prerequisite before it
can register with the Ministry of Home Affairs, formally separate
itself from Budi's camp and become a party eligible for the
general election.
</P>
<P>
However, a member of the congress' steering committee, Sabam
Sirait, said the change in the party's name would not be formally
included in the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the government whether they will recognize
Megawati's PDI or not. But I'm confident that the government will
positively respond to the aspiration of the people who support
Megawati," Sirait said.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Palestine Discuss Ways Out of Middle East Stalemate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Thursday kicked off his official visit to Russia and talked with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat proposed to Yeltsin that Russia, as a co-sponsor of the
Middle East peace process, take part in a U.S.-Palestinian-Israeli
meeting in Washington scheduled for October 15.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian leadership was interested in a more
active Russian involvement in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Arafat also discussed relations between their
countries and recent tension between Syria and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Arafat he would appoint an official -- most
likely a deputy foreign minister -- to deal with Middle East
issues and make regular visits to the region's capitals.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Arafat held behind-closed-door talks with
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko. There was no
public statement of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, Interfax quoted well-informed sources as reporting
that the two leaders discussed ways out of the stalemate in the
peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The sides also focused on matters related to the expansion of
ties between Russia and Palestine based on lasting traditions of
friendship and many-sided cooperation," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Palestine also signed an agreement on trade and
economic cooperation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Russian Trade Minister Georgy
Gabunia and Palestinian Culture and Education Minister Yasser Abd
Rabbu, according to the Interfax news agency.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Regrets Seleznyov's Call for Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
expressed "regret" in connection with the statement by State Duma
Chairman Gennady Seleznyov calling for a referendum on confidence
in the president, presidential press secretary Dmitry Yakushkin
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov called for a referendum on the removal of the
Russian president at a press conference on Thursday, a day after
the nationwide protest actions, during which the main political
demand was for the president's early resignation.
</P>
<P>
According to Seleznyov, "after this large-scale action of
protest which took place on Wednesday it would be more legitimate
to call a referendum in Russia on whether society trusts or does
not trust the president, on whether the president should or should
not resign."
</P>
<P>
However, on ORT television program, Yakushkin stressed that
most demands made in the course of the protest actions on
Wednesday were the payment of wages and pensions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a call for referenda amounts to "shifting the
question into a wrong sphere". This could "result in the
unnecessary intensification of politicization in society and
departure from the resolution of specific issues", Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Selezynov also declared that he may
run for president and was ready to head the center-left bloc.
</P>
<P>
To Seleznyov's statement, Yeltsin "reacted calmly", saying that
it was not "either the first or the last statement", and the
president thinks there will be many statements of this sort in the
month to come, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Yukushkin also noted that during Thursday's meeting with
security ministers and the newly appointed generals in the
Kremlin, Yeltsin once again stressed that he would remain in
office until the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Claims Climb Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. first-time claims
for unemployment increased slightly last week amid a gloomy global
economic outlook, the Labor Department said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number of first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose
by 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 300,000, the first increase in
four weeks, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
However, a more closely watched four-week average of
unemployment claims dropped slightly by 3,500 to 295,750 for the
period ended one week earlier, the lowest point since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Through most of this year, a spending spree by American
consumers has helped insulate U.S. companies from economic
problems spreading from Asia to other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan this week noted he
expects the economic prospect not optimistic in the country as a
result of the wide-spread crisis abroad.
</P>
<P>
That means from farms to factories, workers will be more
vulnerable to job losses caused by dampening U.S. export sales and
a flood of cheap foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment so far remains near a generational low, but rose a
bit, to 4.6 percent, in September.

<HEADLINE> Syrian, Iranian FMs Discuss Syrian-Turkish Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa held talks Thursday with visiting Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharazzi on the ongoing Syrian-Turkish tensions.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the talks between the
two ministers centered on Turkey's "provocative and aggressive
stances" against Syria.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the role of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) in helping defuse the Damascus-Ankara tensions,
said the spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Kharazzi arrived here earlier Thursday. He came here with the
aim of mediating between Syria and Turkey, the two OIC member
states. Iran is holding the OIC presidency.
</P>
<P>
Damascus and Ankara have long been at odds over issues
including the alleged Syrian support for Turkey's Kurdish rebels,
Turkey's close military cooperation with Israel and water sharing.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of sheltering its outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party, which has been fighting since 1984 for an
independent state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It has reportedly massed troops backed by tanks and heavy
artillery along the border with Syria, sparking fears for a
regional military conflict.
</P>
<P>
Syria has denied Turkey's charge and called for a diplomatic
solution to the disputes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Syria has criticized Turkey, a predominantly Muslim
country, for forging a military alliance with Israel, which it
said would endanger the Middle East peace and stability, and its
bargaining position in negotiations with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Iran also opposes the Turkish-Israeli military ties. Kharazzi
told a news conference in Tehran Wednesday that Iran "condemns
such an alliance on the grounds that it constitutes a threat to
the security of the region."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the existing differences between Syria and
Turkey do not justify Turkey's military buildup along the Syrian
border.

"What's most important right now is for me to see where the
league is going, then look deep inside myslef to make a clear-cut
decision. So for now, I'm keeping my options open," Jordan was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, 35, said his final decision must await the conclusion
of the NBA lockout. He also said he isn't opposed to playing for
Tim Floyd or for an organization still run by general manager
Jerry Krause.

<P>
"I played with Jerry the last five or six season, and we've

going to be my final deciding factor."

<HEADLINE> Baseball Antitrust Laws Set by U.S. Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress voted
Wednesday to overturn part of a 76-year-old Supreme Court ruling
that exempted baseball from antitrust laws on the grounds it is a
game and not a business.
</P>
<P>
The House passed the legislation by voice, sending it to
President Clinton for his expected signature. The Senate passed
the bill last July.
</P>
<P>
That exemption deprived players of some of the protections
enjoyed by other professional athletes and has been blamed for
baseball's many work stoppages, including the disastrous strike
in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
The bill makes clear the exemption is revoked only for labor
relations, not for relocation, league expansion and the minor
leagues. Both the players union and the owners support the
legislation.

<HEADLINE> 20 French Pensioners Killed as Boat Sinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, October 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 French pensioners
died and 44 were injured when their excursion boat sank in a lake
in northeastern Spain Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Another 78 passenger aboard the boat Anna escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
The boat, whose passengers are believed to be French pensioners
from La Rochelle area of western France, sank as it began a
sightseeing tour of Lake Banyoles, the largest lake in Catalonia.
</P>
<P>
The national news agency Efe quoted witnesses as saying the
boat split in two about a dozen meters from the bank and
panic-stricken passengers jumped into the water.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that the passengers were old folk and that made
it difficult for them to swim ashore," a spokesman for La Carpa,
the company that owns Anna, said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of ambulances and helicopters rushed to the
scene of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Rescue crews worked for hours, searching for survivors and
transporting the injured to the Salus hospital in Banyoles and a
hospital in nearby Gerone.
</P>
<P>
Sources also said French officials were heading for the site,
arranging to sent the dead and the injured back to France.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident still unknown.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Beefs Up to 8,900 Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah, after
breaking through the 10,000 psychological mark against the U.S.
dollar on Wednesday, closed at 8,900/9,000 rupiah to the dollar on
Thursday, the highest level since former president Soeharto
resigned in May.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian currency is now trading below the government and
International Monetary Fund's year-end target of 10,000 rupiah per
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Local currency dealers said fresh market talk of a possible
imposition of capital controls, hopes of a slowdown in inflation
rises and regional market strength helped boost the rupiah
standing.
</P>
<P>
A local bank's chief dealer said: "Among those factors, I think
the bullish trend in the regional markets is the dominant factor
behind the rupiah's strong gain."
</P>
<P>
The rupiah continued to gather steam after breaking the
resistance level of 10,600 to the U.S. dollar on Tuesday and
hitting the 10,000 mark on Wednesday, closing at 9,400 rupiah per
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"It is just a psychological game. The rupiah could easily gain
ground after it has broken several psychological barriers," the
chief dealer was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government was considering tightening
the monitoring of capital flows into and out of the country. The
news had encouraged some offshore players, especially those with
short rupiah positions, to unload their U.S. dollar holdings to
cover their future rupiah obligations.
</P>
<P>
Achjar, Ilyas, a senior official of the central bank, Bank
Indonesia, said a draft on foreign exchange control had already
been prepared and its implementation is only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was also boosted by continued U.S. dollar selling on
the part of state banks, the currency dealers said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the country's
inflation stood at 3.75 percent in September, much lower than
August's 6.30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of trade ministers from
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Manila, Indonesian
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar
Kartasasmita Wednesday said confidence was returning to the
rupiah.
</P>
<P>
But he warned against an overly sharp appreciation in the
currency and said the government wants to see a gradual
appreciation in the currency. "For instance, we don't want to see
the rupiah jump to 8,000," he added.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was traded at 8,000 to the U.S. dollar in early May
but plummeted to 12,000 just days before the downfall of Soeharto
on May 21. Since then, the rupiah continued to weakened to 16,000.
</P>
<P>
The currency started to stage a recovery in July, when
multilateral financial institutions and donor countries pledged to
pump in billions of U.S. dollars in loans.
</P>
<P>
As the government, through state banks, converts U.S. dollars
to rupiah, the local currency has steadily risen.
</P>
<P>
According to Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin, the
government converted up to 15 million U.S. dollars daily in its
effort to stabilize the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The currency is also benefiting from the signs of waning social
unrest and anti-government demonstrations, the Jakarta Post said.

ROME, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Olympic Committee's
medical federation said its drug-testing laboratory will be shut
down for allegedly cover-up of doping tests in soccer.
</P>
<P>
Acqua Acetosa will close Friday and tests that would have been
conducted at the lab will be sent to labs in Barcelona, Spain,
Cologne, Germany, or Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) made the decision
after investigators from the Rome prosecutor's office searched
the homes of five current or former employees of the lab, who
were alleged to conceal evidence and abuse the office.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the doping tests of Italian League soccer had not
been fully carried out and the results may have been hidden.
Documentation of anti-doping tests, which was required to keep at
least two years, was being discarded after two months, with five
in the case of positive tests.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Writer Wins 1998 Nobel Literature Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese writer Jose
Saramago, the 76-year-old novelist and poet, won the 1998 Nobel
Literature Prize, the Swedish Academy announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Saramago, who's works have been translated into 25 languages,
is the first writer in Portuguese to receive the world's most
prized literary award.
</P>
<P>
Saramago, "who with parables sustained by imagination,
compassion and irony, continually enables us once again to
apprehend an elusory reality", said the Academy.
</P>
<P>
Saramago was born in a family of farmers in Northern Lisbon.
Too poor to pay for high school, he had to abandon his studies and
train as a mechanic. After trying different jobs in the civil
service, he worked for a publishing company for 12 years and then
for newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Saramago wrote his first novel in 1947 and became famous in
1982 with the blasphemous and humorous story "Memorial do
Convento".
</P>
<P>
The book was described by the late Italian film-maker Federico
Fellini, a lover of exuberant images, as one of the most
interesting he had ever read.
</P>
<P>
The story, a fantasy about two lovers trying to escape the
Inquisition in a flying machine, was turned into an opera and
performed at Milan's La Scala in 1990 with the title of "Baltasar
and Blimunda".
</P>
<P>
Another of his books, "The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis",
which was published in 1984, is a surreal story of a doctor-poet
and fascism's rise in 1936.
</P>
<P>
After his literary successes in the 1980s, he devoted himself
to writing.
</P>
<P>
Saramago is married to a Spanish journalist and lives in
Lanzarote in the Canary Islands.
</P>
<P>
The literature prize was the first Nobel Prize announced for
1998. The cash award for each prize category this year is about
7.6 million Swedish krona (almost one million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The prize was established in the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swede
who invented dynamite and died in 1896. The prizes, along with
diplomas and gold medals, are presented to the winners every year
on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.

They sent some 300,000 soldiers to reinforce dykes and rescue
people stranded by the worst flooding on the Yangtze River and the

Jiang said that the military showed its coordination and unity
between officers and men in the flood fighting and that they
went through thick and thin together.
</P>
<P>
He said that political work has always been the lifeline of the
army and should be in the top position in military ideological and
political education during the reforms and opening up and in the
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The military should learn Deng Xiaoping Theory and be
acquainted with the principle of the Party's absolute leadership
over the military and serving the people heart and soul, he said.
</P>
<P>
The military has been streamlining and trying to improve its
quality over the past two decades, he said, adding that it has
learned more about science, technology, and military science and
is now equipped with more advanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
The successful mobilization of troops and the technical and
logistic support in the flood fighting were the result of this
modernization drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
In praising model units and individuals, Jiang said that the
commendation is not merely for those outstanding units and
individuals, but what is more important, is that it is an honor
for all officers and men participating in the flood fighting, and
for the military.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that these units and individuals will continue
with their hard work and make a greater contribution to the Party
and the people.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder to Meet Clinton on Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- German chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder will go to Washington to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Friday, Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder will be accompanied by Joschka Fischer, a leader of the
Greens party who is tipped as the prospective foreign minister in a
possible SPD-Greens coalition government. Also on the trip is SPD's
expert on foreign affairs, Guenther Verheugen, who could become
defence minister in Schroeder's government.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the talks in the White House, Schroeder is also due
to meet World Bank President James Wolfensohn Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The one-day Washington visit is Schroeder's second foreign trip
since he won the German general election on September 27 which ended
the 16 years of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's leadership.
</P>
<P>
To dispel fears about any major change in Germany's European
policy, Schroeder already paid a visit to Paris a week ago during
which he reassured French leaders that his government would maintain
the traditional partnership with France.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, during his Washington visit Schroeder is expected to
reaffirm Bonn's commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
German press reports said that Schroeder is set to face an early
test of his foreign policy leadership in Washington when he holds
talks with Clinton on such key issues as possible military action in
the Serbian province of Kosovo and the crisis in global financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stance on possible air strikes in Kosovo could face strong
opposition from Germany's pacifist Greens, which is currently the only
candidate with which Schroeder is negotiating to form a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
The Greens opposes German participation in any NATO military action
in Kosovo without a U.N. resolution approving the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Germany's independent central bank, the Bundesbank, also
differs with Washington on how wealthy industrial nations should move
to avert a global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to call on Schroeder to show leadership on all
these issues, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
However, technically, Schroeder is not yet German chancellor at the
moment. He is due to be elected by Germany's new parliament on October
27 provided that his SPD and the Greens wind up their coalition talks
in time.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- In the past decade, China had
rapid growth in the telecommunications industry and China has the
second largest number of phones after the United States, with 100
million phones.
</P>
<P>
Earnings of China's telecommunications sector have increased
sharply from 1.25 billion yuan (151 million U.S. dollars) in 1978
to 182.8 billion yuan in 1997 and the communication network is one
of the largest in the world. There are fewer than 20 cities in the
world using 8-digit phone numbers, and seven are in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, it took one or two days to make a long distance call
in China, but today, there is an analogue mobile
telecommunications network covering most of China and a modern
digital network for more than 250 cities and 1,170 counties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has encouraged investment in
telecommunications infrastructure since 1978, and 6.56 billion
U.S. dollars worth of foreign loans have been used for advanced
technology and microwave satellite communication.
</P>
<P>
Income of China's post and telecommunications sector in 1997
was 177.3 billion yuan, a 150-fold increase from 1978, with
profits of 40 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Blood Pressure Study To Prevent Hypertension in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Doctors say that there should be
a nationwide survey of blood pressure in China to make the public
more aware of disease prevention.
</P>
<P>
"At least 70 percent of adults should have their blood pressure
checked to reveal hypertension patients as soon as possible," says
Wu Yingkai, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the fact that there are 100 million people with
hypertension in China, more than 70 percent of them do not know
they have the disease, according to a survey of 940,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Another study found that, for hypertension patients who failed
to have the disease treated, 70 to 80 percent ultimately died of a
stroke, and about 15 percent died of coronary heart disease or
kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
In fact, 75 percent of these problems can be brought under
control if people adopt a healthy lifestyle and take preventive
measures, says Prof. Liu Lisheng, the chairwoman of the Chinese
Hypertension League.
</P>
<P>
One plan calls for people above the age of 35 who visit the
doctor for any reason to be given a blood pressure
check. Hypertension control work will win more policy and
financial support from the government so the public can be more
aware of the disease, says Yin Dakui, vice-minister of health.

ULAN BATOR, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy on Thursday presented six candidates for prime minister
to the ruling coalition, the Mongolian National Democratic Party
(MNDP) and Social Democratic Party (SDP).
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy said that in view of the coalition's repeated failure
to nominate a qualified candidate, the nomination of any one of
the six could be directly submitted to the Great Hural
(parliament) for approval.
</P>
<P>
The six candidates are Dogsm Ganbold, Tsevelma Bayarsaikhan,
Janlav Naranchachralt, Luvsanbaldan Nyamsambuu and Jugnee
Amarsanaa from the MNDP and Sharavjamts Batbayar from the SDP.
</P>
<P>
Under Mongolian law, the ruling party must discuss its
nomination for prime minister with the president, who in turn
submits it to the Great Hural for approval.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president rejected several nominations made by the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy said that in a bid to end the two-month government
crisis earlier, he presented the six candidates by himself this
time.
</P>
<P>
A decision in May to merge the state-owned Renovation Bank with
the private Golomt Bank resulted in the dismissal of Prime
Minister Tsakhya Elbegdorj's government in July. Under the
Mongolian, a new prime minister should be appointed within 30 days
of the dismissal.

JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The occupancy rate in
Indonesia's hotels is expected to improve to 42 percent next year,
the head of Indonesia's hoteliers organization said.

percent but 15 percent lower than last year's 57 percent," said

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Several people were injured in
clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers
Thursday in the West Bank city of Hebron, a Palestinian press
service reported.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Palestinians threw stones at Israeli soldiers
guarding Jewish enclaves in the Israeli-controlled downtown sector
and the soldiers responded with rubber bullets, the Jerusalem
Media and Communication Center (JMCC) said.
</P>
<P>
Several Palestinians were injured, including a AFP cameraman
Hussam Abu Alan who was seriously wounded by a bullet hit in the
head and underwent emergency surgery in a Hebron hospital.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians in Hebron launched a general strike Thursday to
protest against an eight-day blockade and a curfew in downtown
area.
</P>
<P>
Israel lifted the closure Thursday morning, but the curfew
remained in effect, confining some 30,000 Palestinians to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
The closure and curfew were imposed by Israeli army last
Wednesday after some 20 Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
civilians were wounded in a hand grenade attack in the downtown
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The general strike echoed calls by the Palestinian National
Liberation Movement (Fatah) Tuesday, which appealed for strike and
demonstrations in Hebron unless the blockade and curfew were both
lifted.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, a flash point of clashes between Palestinians and
Israelis, is home to 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers
who live in different enclaves in the city with heavy protection
of Israeli soliders.

SHANGHAI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair
attended the opening ceremony of Britain's first insurance company
in China, in Shanghai, today.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the Royal &AMP; SunAlliance Insurance Company in
Shanghai shows Britain's confidence in the economic prospects of

</P>
<P>
Royal &AMP; Sun, whose headquarters are in London, has three
centuries of experience in the international insurance business
and is one of the world's top ten insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Its contacts with China go back a century. As early as 1853, it
set up business in Shanghai, then set up its first representative
office in Beijing, and another two in Dalian and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Blair also attended an international symposium
on the development of the capital market sponsored jointly by the
Shanghai Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange this
afternoon. He expressed his conviction that Britain's co-operation
with shanghai in this regard will further expand as this
symbolizes the bilateral friendship and cooperation between the
two countries.

<P>
Moreover, Blair attended the signing ceremony of the renewal of
a 1994 memorandum of understanding between the two stock
exchanges, and visited the Shanghai Stock Exchange today.

ANKARA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi is due in Ankara Thursday evening to try to defuse the
escalating Turkish-Syrian tension.
</P>
<P>
An government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that Kharrazi, who first visited Syria Thursday morning, aims
to make contacts with Ankara and Damascus with the initiatives of
"good intentions," the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The official said that talks between Kharrazi and Turkish
officials will begin Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Turkey and Syria have built up recently
following Turkey's intensified accusations against Syria over its
support for Turkish Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting since
1984 for autonomy for the Kurdish minority in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It also massed heavy troops along its borders with Syria, for
the first time, late last week to conduct military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has shuttled between the two
neighbors over the past few days to try to ease the tension.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami phoned his
Turkish and Syrian counterparts Wednesday evening, saying Iran is
"ready for mediation."
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim and politically secular state,
enjoys a close military relationship with Israel, which incurred
criticism from the Arab world, especially Syria.

stop their drift to major cities, official media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of street children are arriving in urban
centers causing social problems which call for an urgent solution,
and immediate action should also be taken to stop them from
begging at garbage dumps and making nuisances at tourist sites,
Khai told a two-day national conference on street children held
this week in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that there are about 16,000 homeless
children in Vietnam, over 6,000 of them living in Ho Chi Minh City
and nearly 3,000 in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that despite some measures to solve the
problem, the number of street children moving from rural areas to
cities remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The sexual abuse of children, the exploitation of their labor
and their violation of laws were painful for the whole society, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the conference discussed ways to stop homeless
children from moving to urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Official reports said Khai proposed short- and long-term
solutions to the problem and asked the sponsors of the conference
to make policy research on the issue.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Banks' Bad Loans Estimated at 115 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The bad loans held by South Korean banks
are estimated at 160 trillion won (some 115.9 billion U.S. dollars) as
of June this year, the Korea Institute of Finance said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The loans, calculated in accordance with international guidelines
for bad loan classification, exceed the 120 trillion won (about 86.9
billion ) previously calculated by South Korean standards.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the South Korean classifications of bad loans, international
standards takes into account the ability of borrowers to repay loans.
</P>
<P>
The international guideline, which South Korea agreed with the
International Monetary Fund to adopt by January next year, focuses on
the overall financial health of corporate borrowers.
</P>
<P>
A loan is considered a default in South Korea when it is at
least three months overdue. The three-month classification took
effect July 1 this year, updating the previous standard of a six
month default period.
</P>
<P>
Bad loans are a major reason triggering the ongoing financial
crisis in South Korea, threatening the viability of banks and other
financial institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The much-larger-than-expected bad loans calls for an
enlargement of public fund injections needed to bail out faltering
banks, the institute said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The government will likely have to increase the 64 trillion won
(some 46.4 billion U.S. dollars) rescue fund earmarked for bank
recapitalization and bad loan purchases.
</P>
<P>
The institute proposed the ideal rescue fund level at about 87
trillion won (roughly 63 billion U.S. dollars), 36 percent more
than the currently established fund.
</P>
<P>
The latest estimate highlights the seriousness of bad loan
problems in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Seoul borrowed a bailout loan of 58 billion U.S. dollars from
the International Monetary Fund last December after it was plagued
by a financial crisis due to corporate bankruptcies and bad loans
of financial institutions late last year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Business Confidence Continues to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's business
confidence index dropped 1.8 points last month, the fifth
consecutive month of recorded decline, local newspaper Business
Day reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The business index dived 5.7, two and 4.1 points respectively
in the previous three months, according to figures from the South
African Chamber of Business (Sacob).
</P>
<P>
Sacob said Wednesday the further slippage in the business mood
last month was mainly the result of the renewed instability in
global financial markets and the negative implications this had
on emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Complicating the matter were domestic weaknesses, such as
strikes and the balance of payments, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa remained resilient compared with other
emerging markets and the country soon could see a return in
investor confidence, Sacob said.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was based on solid ratings of South Africa by
international rating agencies and the positive influence this had
on financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Moody's Investor Service, a leading international rating
agency, recently gave a better investment grade rating to South
Africa which put the country before most other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Despite recent volatilities in the world markets which hit
South Africa, Sacob said there was a possibility of an interest
rate cut before the end of this year, especially in the light of
a more stable currency.
</P>
<P>
The South African Rand strengthened to 5.73 to the U.S. Dollar
Wednesday, its highest level since July, largely owing to the
Dollar's sharp falls on international currency markets.
</P>
<P>
South African Reserve Bank Deputy Governor James Cross said
Wednesday that hedge funds were starting to leave the country and
this would help the Rand to strengthen and facilitate an
environment in which interest rates could ease.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mediation Continues, Netanyahu Seeking Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross continued his mediation in the region Thursday as
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking support from
his coalition partners on the eve of a U.S. summit.
</P>
<P>
Ross met with Israeli cabinet secretary Danny Naveh and
senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat to discuss interim
issues, especially the opening of the Palestinian airport in
Gaza, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The airport has been a contentious point between the two
sides for the past 18 months, mainly due to Israeli security
concerns. U.S. officials have said that Ross will try to wrap
up an understanding on the opening of the airport before he
leaves the region Friday.
</P>
<P>
Washington would like to see as many preliminary
understandings as possible reached before the summit between
Netanyahu, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
Following four hours of talks with Netanyahu and Arafat,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced Wednesday
that the summit will start next Thursday. White House said that
the summit will be held at the Wye Plantation in Maryland, where
Israeli and Syrian negotiators met for the first face-to-face
talks three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Albright also said that substantial progress has been made
on various issues during the trilateral talks held on the Erez
border crossing between Israel and Gaza. She hailed a "new
spirit" on both leaders which she said would be helpful for
the summit.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and
senior security officials met in Tel Aviv with George Tenet,
head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), to discuss
Israeli demands that the PNA take measures to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The CIA is trying to bring the two sides closer for an
understanding on security cooperation, which some said is one
of the main problems remaining unresolved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu convened his "kitchen cabinet" Thursday to
brief the other three members -- Mordechai, National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon, and Industry and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky -- on his talks with Arafat Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Netanyahu has invited the three ministers
to the U.S. summit. It has been reported that Netanyahu
intends to appoint Sharon, the leading hardline minister in his
cabinet, as foreign minister in exchange for his support if an
agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also met with leaders of the National
Religious Party (NRP), a far-right coalition partner, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NRP has threatened to topple the government if
Netanyahu makes wide range of concessions to the Palestinians.
Its leaders also demanded that Education Minister Yitzhak Levy,
a NRP member, to be invited to go to the U.S. with
Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> China Still Has Hope For 8 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- China's GDP this year is
expected to grow by about 8 percent, with negative inflation,
according to an autumn report of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The report says that agriculture added value will grow by 3.2
percent, manufacturing by 9.2 percent, and service by 8.3 percent
and faster economic development is expected in 1999, with 8.6
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
China has actually attained this year's macroeconomic goals, it
says, with a reverse in the downward trend in economic growth, the
stable exchange rate, and a stable unemployment situation.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, the national economy is expected to have
higher growth. Fixed assets this year will grow by 16.3 percent
over 1997 to 2.88 trillion yuan (about 346.9 billion US dollars)
and in 1999 it will be 3.33 trillion yuan (about 401.2 billion US
dollars), up 14.5 percent.

<P>
There will be negative growth in retail prices this year, but
it will return to 1.7 percent next year, with the implementation
of a more active financial policy and growing domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales in 1998 and 1999 will grow by 8.7 and 8.6 percent,
respectively, according to the report.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Alleged Higher Cancer Rate in Xinjiang Sheer Fabrication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese radiation and medical
experts reassured the world today that past nuclear tests in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region did not cause radiation pollution
leading to a rising cancer rate among local residents, as
reported by some members of the British media.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the newspaper Independent and the British Channel
Four have presented stories claiming that Xinjiang in western
China has a higher incidence of cancer, a higher mortality rate,
and more cases of congenital malformation than other parts of
China, due to radiation exposure from nuclear testing carried out
there between 1964 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Radiation Medical Institute in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region suggests that the additional
amount of radiation received by local people is only 2.9 percent
of the annual dose caused by natural radiation.
</P>
<P>
The institute also carried out an investigation of
radiation-related epidemics during the 1974-1984 period among
people living within a 120- kilometer range of the nuclear testing
ground. Of the 542,784 investigated cases, deaths caused by cancer
were 55.51:100,000 a year; while the rate in the comparison group
was 59.09:100,000.
</P>
<P>
The two figures are approximately the same in terms of
statistics, according to experts. Therefore the British news
reports hardly hold water when they say the cancer incidence in
Xinjiang is 39 percent higher than in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
According to three comprehensive surveys carried out between
the late 1960s and 1990 by the Industrial Hygiene Research
Institute under the Ministry of Health, in leeward regions of the
nuclear testing ground the nuclear tests did not produce any
negative effects on the health of residents.
</P>
<P>
Since it is positioned windward, Xinjiang could not have a
higher incidence rate of radiation-related illness, said the
experts, most of whom were involved in the surveys and
investigations.
</P>
<P>
The alleged higher cancer rate in Xinjiang is a sheer
fabrication and it is an act of irresponsibility for the British
media to do such reporting, the experts said.

FRANKFURT, Germany, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar
Thursday slumped below the psychologically important 1.60 German

</P>
<P>
The dollar dropped to 1.5985 marks at the Frankfurt fixing
Thursday, down from Wednesday's 1.6128 marks.
</P>

Financial experts attributed the weaker dollar mainly to

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Invited to Commonwealth Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian delegation headed
by Foreign Minister Ignatius Olisemeka will attend a two-day
meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) in
London Thursday, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG meeting is expected to assess the efforts by the
Nigerian government in democratization and protecting human
rights.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since 1995 that Nigeria was invited to
the Commonwealth meeting, though visits by CMAG members and
bilateral dialog have been going on in the past.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted sources from the Nigerian Foreign Ministry in
Abuja as saying that Olisemeka will during the meeting "address
efforts made by the Federal Government since June 9 to put
together and implement a credible transition program."
</P>
<P>
Olisemeka will also let CMAG know about the various efforts
made so far to redress the poor human rights records of the
previous administration which brought about the sanctions imposed
on Nigeria by the Commonwealth, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"He will definitely aim at arguing for a lift of the sanctions
placed on the country in 1995," they added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in late 1995 after
the government of late General Sani Abacha hanged author Ken
Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority activists on charges of
murder.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth then established the CMAG to monitor the
situation in Nigeria to decide whether and when to resume
Nigeria's membership.
</P>
<P>
Bold efforts by Nigeria's new leader General Abdulsalam
Abubakar to democratize Nigeria and improve its human right
records, including a new transition to civil rule program and the
release of all politicE,$detainees, have won him the backing of
the west world, including the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
But it is believed that sanctions against Nigeria will last
until the new transition program ushers in an elected civilian
president in May next year as it was promised by the Abubakar
government.

<HEADLINE> Tung Urges Private Sector to Help Ease Pressure of Economic Downturn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, expressed
the hope Thursday that the private sector in Hong Kong do what it
can to help ease the pressure brought about by the economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
"While the government has a clear responsibility to help Hong
Kong people face up to the current difficulties, I look also to
the private sector to do what it can to help ease the pressure on
the community," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not government's place to interfere in setting wage
levels and employment policies. But in these difficult times I
hope that employers will handle these issues with sensitivity," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks Thursday when he spoke at a luncheon of
the Joint Chambers of Commerce to explain his Policy Address for
1998 delivered on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his Policy Address, Tung recounted the events of the past
year and outlined plans to respond to the challenges caused by the
financial turmoil and the bursting of Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
He also described how Hong Kong could turn its present
difficulties into opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the immediate job in hand is "to steer Hong Kong
towards economic recovery."
</P>
<P>
Tung said he believes that Hong Kong also needs to take account
of four main factors which will be crucial to its recovery, which
are: an improvement in the external, financial and economic
environment; a steadying of our interest rates here; stability in
the property market; and above all, a return of public confidence.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the year 1998 has been "a year of painful adjustment"
for Hong Kong, as property prices have fallen substantially and
lay-offs and wage adjustments are continuing as the city respond
to the effects of high interest rates and a slowdown in business
activity.
</P>
<P>
"This adjustment, although painful, is necessary as we fight to
regain our competitiveness," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"The signs are that 1999 will continue to be a difficult year,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said Hong Kong needs to devise short-term measures which
will cushion the impact of the downturn in this difficult economic
climate but in the same time has to draw up longer-term plans for
a sustained economic growth in the future.
</P>
<P>
"It is my belief that Hong Kong has the potential to be more
than simply one of the leading cities in our country. My vision is
for Hong Kong to have the same status in Asia as do New York and
London in North America and Europe respectively, and beyond that
to be truly one of the world's premier cities," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, Tung said, the regional financial crisis
and the bursting of Hong Kong's "bubble" economy have presented
"unprecedented challenges."
</P>
<P>
In face of these challenges "we have responded deliberately and
thoughtfully by introducing immediate measures to relieve pain and
stimulate growth, as well as developing longer-term strategies to
ensure solid expansion in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been criticism of the way in which we have responded
to certain crises that have occurred in the past year, such as the
avian influenza outbreak, the red tides and mishaps in the medical
sector as well as the opening of the airport. We accept that the
government itself could perform better in some areas, and we are
determined that we will improve our performance," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"The big issue now is our own confidence. We do face continued
problems in the near term. But we must not sell ourselves short,"
Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure, that as long as we maintain our self-confidence and
remain resilient, we will be able to turn these crises into
opportunity and together overcome the adversity that we now face."

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Copper Giant Loses $63.3M During April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's mining conglomerate,
the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), has announced a net
loss of 126.6 billion Kwacha or 63.3 million U.S. Dollars in the
second quarter ending on June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM's company secretary Michael Mukwakwa announced the
mid-year financial results here Wednesday, saying that in
the same period last year, ZCCM registered a profit of 17.4
billion Kwacha or 8.7 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
From April to June, the conglomerate's copper production
dropped by 11,201 tons at 67,207 tons compared to 78,408 tons in
the corresponding period of the previous year, Zambia Daily Mail
Thursday quoted Mukwakwa as saying.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall in production was largely attributed to the
exclusion of production from two privatized mines which produced
13,049 tons of copper in the same period last year, said
Mukwakwa.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM's cobalt production, however rose to 1,037 tons in the
second quarter from 996 tons in the same period last year due to
the combination of the continuous depreciation of the Kwacha and
the improved cobalt prices on the international market.

<HEADLINE> Chief Executive's Policy Address Welcomed in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa's second Policy Address, which he presented before the
Legislative Council Wednesday afternoon, was welcomed by local
media, communities and business sectors.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po published an editorial Thursday saying that Tung has
laid out long term as well as short term measures to deal with the
economic difficulties Hong Kong is facing and this will help
stimulate the domestic demand and raise citizens' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao said in a commentary that the chief executive has
worked out ways of tackling the difficulties by means of facing
them squarely and analyzing the current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The ways Tung put forward for overcoming the current
difficulties are not unrealistic optimism or empty pledges but
based on the ground of objective analysis.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily described the Policy Address as
"calm, pragmatic, positive and confident."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Economic Times said in a commentary that Tung can
adjust his policies according to the changed situation and in this
way the confidence of the citizens can be re-established.
</P>
<P>
In addition to local media, various communities and business
sectors also expressed their welcomes to Tung's Policy Address.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said in a statement
that the Policy Address has laid a solid foundation for the
development of the current policies.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Trade Development Council welcomed Tung's remarks to
build Hong Kong into a major international cosmopolitan city in
Asia while the Hong Kong productivity Council hailed Tung's
proposals to promote the innovation and technology in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
HongKong Telecom, the largest telecommunications corporation in
Hong Kong, expressed its support for the government's
determination and speed in implementing its policies related to
Information Technology.
</P>
<P>
Teachers and people in the profession of education said they
were encouraged by the government's large amount of resources on
education despite the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Futures Commission welcomed the measures
laid out by the chief executive in his Policy Address about
maintaining and strengthening Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center and said the commission will give
full support to these measures.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong expressed its
support for the establishment of the second market.
</P>
<P>
Other proposals in the Policy Address on boosting tourism,
stabilizing the property prices, improving quality of life were
also welcomed.
</P>
<P>
Some people said they were disappointed that the chief
executive has few "immediate" measures to turn around the current
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
However, many citizens said it's not realistic for Hong Kong to
recover immediately while the economy in the whole Asia is in
recession and they hope the government will take concrete steps to
implement these policies laid out by Tung.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Current Account Surplus Rises in 2nd Quarter 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's current account
surplus increased by 28.8 percent in the second quarter of 1998,
according to the Statistics Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in the April-June quarter 1998 reached 8.5 billion
ringgit (2.236 billion U.S. dollars) from a surplus of 6.6 billion
ringgit (about 1.736 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter
this year, a statement from the Statistics Department said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the current account surplus during the first half of
1998 was 15.1 billion ringgit (about 3.973 billion U.S. dollars),
compared with a deficit of 10.1 billion ringgit (about 2.657
billion U.S. dollars) during the corresponding period 1997.
</P>
<P>
The department said merchandise exports remained strong in the
second quarter of 1998. However, after four successive quarters of
increase, merchandise exports edged down marginally by 2.9 percent
to 67.1 billion ringgit (about 17.657 billion U.S. dollars)
against 69.1 billion ringgit (about 18.184 billion U.S. dollars)
in the previous quarter, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, merchandise imports continued to contract by 8.5
percent for the second straight quarter to reach 52.7 billion
ringgit (about 13.868 billion U.S. dollars) from 57.6 billion
ringgit (about 15.157 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Given the slower rate of decline in merchandise exports against
merchandise imports, the merchandise surplus was driven to a new
high of 14.4 billion ringgit (about 3.789 billion U.S. dollars),
it said.
</P>
<P>
Due to investment income and other services, the department
said the improvement in the services account deficit during the
first quarter of 1998 was not sustained with the deficit worsening
by 14.6 percent to 4.7 billion ringgit (about 1.236 billion U.S.
dollars) in the April-June 1998 quarter as opposed to a deficit of
4.1 billion ringgit (about 1.078 billion U.S. dollars) in the
first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1998, the net services account deficit
amounted to 8.8 billion ringgit (about 2.315 billion U.S. dollars)
compared to 10.3 billion ringgit (about 2.71 billion U.S. dollars)
in the same period 1997, it said.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Security Adviser Visits Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. National
Security Adviser, Anthony Lake, arrived here Thursday to try to
facilitate a peaceful solution to the on-going Ethio-Eritrean
conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia, David Shinn,
Lake has finished a similar mission in the Eritrean capital Asmara.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been mediating in the conflict between Ethiopia
and Eritrea soon after the border conflict between the two
countries erupted in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., together with Rwanda, formulated a proposal which
requires the withdrawal of Eritrean troops from Badme/Shiraro
border areas which were administered by Ethiopia before May 12,
1998.
</P>
<P>
But Eritrea refused to withdraw its forces from the disputed
border areas, saying that its troops " merely retook" areas which
had been illegally occupied by the Ethiopian forces.
</P>
<P>
Lake's visit to Eritrea and Ethiopia came one week before the
October 15 meeting in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, of the Heads of
State Committee set up by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
to mediate in the Ethio-Eritrean conflict.
</P>
<P>
The committee, composed of the presidents of Burkina Faso,
Zimbabwe, Djibouti and Rwanda, will examine the findings of their
ambassadors who visited Asmara and Addis Ababa in July to
ascertain the status of the Badme/Shiraro areas before the border
dispute.

<HEADLINE> UK Interest Rates Cut by 0.25 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England provided a
degree of relief for Britain's industry by announcing a cut in
interest rates by 0.25 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The nine members of the bank's Monetary Policy Committee
decided to reduce the base rate from 7.5 percent to 7.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the past months both employers and trade unions had
repeatedly called on the Bank of England to urgently lower its rates
to avoid a recession.
</P>
<P>
However, economic analysts warn that the cut may be too small to
stimulate a flagging U.K. and world economy.
</P>
<P>
It was a difficult decision for Britain's central bank to make,
though, because the country's economy is not moving in lockstep.
While manufacturing is already in recession, the service sector is
still booming.
</P>
<P>
But high interest rates translate into a strong pound, and that
is making British products expensive. Many exporters have already
warned that the strong pound has forced them to close production
lines as demand from abroad has slackened.
</P>
<P>
The pound had already weakened against the German currency, the
Deutschmark, in anticipation of a rate cut. One pound bought around
2.75 DM on Thursday, as opposed to over 3DM earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
Millions of home owners will rejoice as well as mortgage lenders
are expected to pass the rate cut on to their customers, resulting
in lower mortgage payments.
</P>
<P>
But there are worries that the bank, the industry and trade
unions may have miscalculated. Both earnings growth and domestic
demand are still strong enough to drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
"If Thursday's decision fuels inflation, then interest rates
will have to go up again. This would be a body blow to business
confidence," a BBC analyst said.
</P>
<P>
The UK Government has charged the Bank of England to hit an
inflation target of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate cut may not be large enough to calm the
financial markets. Because of the turmoil on the world's stock
markets the small reduction of interest rates may not be enough to
make shares an attractive investment again.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating a small rate cut London shares had lost heavily in
the morning. Shortly before the bank announced its decision the FTSE
100 index was down more than 100 points to 4,724.
</P>
<P>
Last week, when the U.S. Federal Reserve cut one of its interest
rates by a quarter per cent, stock markets worldwide went into a
tailspin.

<HEADLINE> More Acid Rains for India: Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- India is expected to receive
more and more showers of acidic rain in future if the present
trend of industrial and traffic emissions continue, scientists
warned.
</P>
<P>
In the latest issue of the journal Current Science, Indian
scientists said that the major contributors to acid rain are
oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, while organic acids and to some
extent hydrochloric acid also make rain acidic.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the acid rain are industrial emissions, coal-based
thermal power plants and petrol and diesel burning vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Acid rain may destabilize the entire ecosystem by completely
wiping out several forests and aquatic species and distorting the
food chain, they said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have found an increasing trend towards acidification
almost all over the country.

<HEADLINE> China Expected to Be World's Largest Tourist Destination by 2020 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to be the
world's largest tourist destination and the fourth largest
tour-abroad market by 2020, the World Tourism Organization (WTO)
has predicted.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of tourists will choose China as their
destination, with the development of the country's rich tourism
resources and the upgrading of tourist facilities, according to a
WTO annual report issued recently.
</P>
<P>
And by 2020, about 100 million Chinese will tour abroad, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
China will make efforts to protect historical relics and the
natural environment, combine the development of land, sea, and air
transport, and accelerate the construction of tourist resorts,
said He Guangwei, chairman of the China National Tourism
Administration, adding that a dozen State-level holiday resorts
are now being built.
</P>
<P>
China expects some Asian countries to recover from the
financial crisis soon, at which time more of their people will
once again be touring abroad. Chinese tourism departments are
promoting sales in the United States and Europe, and China also
wants to develop tourism with neighboring countries including Viet
Nam and India, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of Russian tourists is expected to grow
50 percent this year on the basis of 813,700 visitors in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government will develop tourism abroad
for the Chinese with planning and within limits.
</P>
<P>
At present, Chinese tourists can only go to seven countries
including Singapore, Thailand, and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China played host to 57.59 million
overseas tourists last year, ranking 8th in the world,
and bringing in earnings of 12.07 billion U.S. dollars. Overseas
tourism income is expected to hit 38 billion U.S. dollars in 2010.

<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- "I now feel like it's a dream
when I look back at a piece of tape I've made and hear my
commentary criticizing a local government, or a public security
bureau, a procuratorate. I never dreamed of commenting on
government only a few years back," said Fang Hongjin, the host of
Focus Report on China Central TV Station.
</P>
<P>
As a popular program attracting 300 million viewers every
night, Focus Report was applauded by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji,
speaking as an ordinary viewer and supporter. "I'm also qualified
to be the target of your supervision, right? " said Zhu with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
Fang said that compared with the past, the most remarkable
progress is that we can speak out frankly on screen from the point
of view of the grass-roots people instead of preaching with a
stiff face.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that China's transition to a socialist market
economy is pushing official media organizations to promote reforms
in content, style and management.
</P>
<P>
Advertisements began to appear in the mass media after China
began focusing on economic development in 1978, and now there is
wider coverage of the economy, social reality and entertainment
which appeals to a broad audience.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese media today presents its readers and viewers with
dynamic choices, from matchmaking to the stock exchange, and from
street gossip to academic opinion.

</P>
<P>
Currently, China has 2,160 newspapers, compared with some 100
in 1978, and there are more than 2,000 TV and radio stations.
Heated competition has resulted in the emergence of media
conglomerates with economic clout and a wide range of business
interests.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China, Southern Weekend is now the weekly
newspaper with the largest circulation in China.
</P>
<P>
The editor-in-chief of the weekly, Jiang Yiping, explained that
this success lies in their endeavor to expose social corruption,
protect the unfairly treated, and also focus on life and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily, the organ of the Chinese Communist Party,
is also being improved and now carries more and more information
and on-the-spot reporting and scoop news stories to meet the
demand of the readers, according to its president Shao Huaze.
</P>
<P>
Many local TV stations also present news analysis programs
similar to Focus Report, and have received the audience's
immediate applause.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji pointed out that media's watchdog role is crucial to
the building of China's democratic and legal system. The media can
help us correct our mistakes, listen to the public opinion, and
encourage the people to keep our mission on track, Zhu said, and
called on Chinese journalists be the "voice of the people, mirror
of the government and pioneer of the reform."
</P>
<P>
Changes in the Chinese media today indicate that China is
stepping into a more open and confident age, stressed Yu Guomin,
deputy director of the Public Opinion Research Institute of
People's University of China.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plunge in Tokyo Following Previous Big Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo
Thursday with the Nikkei index losing 5.78 percent following
Wednesday's 803-point rise as the yen's sharp rise against the
U.S. dollar encouraged foreign investors to dump stocks across the
board.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 799.55 points, the
biggest single-day point decline this year, to end at 13,026.06.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, fell 45.48 points or 4.34 percent to
1,001.50 after gaining 5 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section was brisk at an estimated 527
million shares, but down from Wednesday's 631.46 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic fall did not surprise traders. Many apparently
were not expecting the market to keep Wednesday's big gains for
long.
</P>
<P>
People who wanted to sell saw this as a good opportunity, a
dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Many export-reliant firms suffered due to continued volatility
in overseas stock markets and fears of a global economic
slowdown. The strong yen is also seen as a minus for exporters
because it reduces the value of their overseas earnings.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar recovered
slightly against the yen after plunging to the 120 level for the
first time in nearly one year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 122.35-38 yen at 5 p.m. (local
time), up from 121.80-85 yen at 9 a.m. in Tokyo, and up from
120.75-85 yen late Wednesday in New York.

LAGOS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) have called for the immediate withdrawal
of foreign troops from the DRC to pave the way for early
settlement of the crisis in the Great Lakes region.

In a joint communique issued Wednesday in Nigerian capital
Abuja, the two countries also called on Congo's neighboring

The joint communique was issued after talks between Nigerian
Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar and his Congolese

</P>
<P>
The two leaders said that the withdrawal of foreign troops
would be a first step toward creating a conducive atmosphere for
the resolution to the crisis in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the Joint Commission between the two governments
would be held as early as possible to strengthen their cooperation,
said the joint communique.
</P>

The two leaders agreed that effective bilateral and
regional economic cooperation among African countries was
necessary prerequisites for the continental economic integration.

prayer that Congo should be left alone on its way forward."

HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks gained 194.79
points, or 2.52 percent, to close at 7,939.51 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sharp growth of the share prices was mainly attributed to
the active buying on property stocks as a response to Chief

prices in his second Policy Address on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The property shares leapt 710.04 points, or 8.32 percent, to
9,248.86 on Thursday. The market was also boosted by the stronger
Japanese yen and lower local interbank rates.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's turnover amounted to 5.835 billion HK dollars (748
million U.S. dollars), 2.026 billion HK dollars (260 million U.S.
dollars) more than that in the previous trading day.

<HEADLINE> Blair Warns of Kosovo Air Strikes "in Days" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Thursday warned that NATO air strikes designed to end the Kosovo
crisis could begin "in days rather than weeks".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on his way to Shanghai for the second leg
of his first visit to China, Blair was quoted by BBC television as
saying the international community had failed to send a strong
enough message to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over the
crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the international community faces up to its responsibility
to send President Milosevic a united and strong message that we won't
tolerate the atrocities carrying on," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose government is in favor of using force, made it
clear only a strong message "backed up by the will to use force if
necessary" that would urge Yugoslav leadership to comply with
U.N. Security Council resolutions on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British ambassador to Belgrade reportedly said
Thursday he had ordered all but essential embassy staff to leave
Yugoslavia as the possible NATO military intervention was looming
closer.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters report said the six-nation Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia is expected to hold an emergency meeting on the
worsening situation in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> No Peace in Afghanistan without Broad-based </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Secretary General's
special envoy on Afghan affairs Lakhdar Brahimi stated here on
Thursday that no peace would exist in Afghanistan without
establishment of a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi made the remark at a press conference while answering
Xinhua correspondent's question about the possibility to establish
a broad-based government in Afghanistan after the Afghan Taliban
militia occupied more than 90 percent the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
He said that a broad-based government should be established
in Afghanistan with the participation of all groups and factions.
</P>
<P>
"Without such a government, it is impossible for Afghanistan
to have a lasting peace," Brahimi said, adding that the Taliban
might occupy the whole Afghanistan, but that does not mean the
country would have peace.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the international community would work for the
benefit of the Afghan people, "so, the first thing is to stop the
human rights abuses in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said that the second would be to reduce the
tension between Iran and the Taliban caused by the killing of a
group of Iranian diplomats and reporter in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The tension also imposed a threat to the whole region, he said,
adding that Iran's military buildup on its border with Afghanistan
proved the seriousness of the situation.
</P>
<P>
What is important for the international community is to defuse
the tension in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi said that the situation has not changed so far despite
of the efforts by the international community, particularly the
U.N., the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
He said that Iranian officials mentioned possible military
operations against the Taliban in the talks with him, but they
announced Iran prefers to settle the problem through political
means.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the possibility for the U.N. to recognize the
Taliban, Brahimi said that it was not the U.N. Secretary General
but the U.N. members that would decide whether to recognize the
Taliban or not.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy arrived here on Sunday, he would leave here for
Islamabad Thursday afternoon to meet Pakistani and Taliban
officials.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Auto Export Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's car export hit 116,950
units in September this year, a 71-percent surge from August due to
rising overseas demand, the Korea Automobile Manufacturers
Association said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It also showed a 33.6 percent rise over the export figure
registered in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The rise has narrowed the year-on-year rate of car export from
minus 12.4 percent in the first eight months of 1998 to minus 2.6
percent in the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's auto export suffered serious setbacks in May-August
this year with the export down on a monthly average of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Daewoo Motor Co. has exported 264,400 units to
nine countries, exceeding its export target of 219,700 units.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Motor Co. shipped out 54,916 units in September alone, up
30.6 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The association attributed increasing car export to the success of
South Korean automakers' overseas sales promotion activities.

<HEADLINE> Iran FM Off To Mediate Turkish-Syrian Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi left for Damascus Thursday morning to join in efforts to
mediate the mounting dispute between Syria and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Kharrazi told the official news agency
IRNA that Iran is ready to help bring about a diplomatic solution
to the ongoing tensions between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Ankara and Damascus have built up recently
after Turkey intensifies its accusation of Syria over its
supporting the Turkish Kurdish rebels who have been fighting
since 1984 for autonomy for the Kurdish minority in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has massed heavy troops along the borders with Syria,
for the first time, late last week to conduct military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has shuttled between Turkey
and Syria over the past few days to try to ease the tensions.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly said that enemies of Islam, especially the
Israelis, would benefit from any differences among Muslim states.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but politically secular state,
has close military ties with Israel, which incurred criticism from
the Arab world, especially Syria.
</P>
<P>
But many of the Arab states favored to unite with Turkey
instead of estranging it.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami also voiced Tehran's
readiness to mediate between Syria and Turkey Wednesday when
phoning his Syrian and Turkish counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi will hold talks with Syrian officials and then fly to
Ankara later Thursday to encourage the two countries to settle the
their differences peacefully.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon's President Selection Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The news that Army Commander
Emile Lahoud would become Lebanon's next president was quickly
welcomed and supported by the country's politicians and religious
figures alike.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul welcomed the choice, saying
that for the first time, a president who enjoys the support of a
popular consensus, will arrive at Baabda, the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud's selection was in fact finalized on Monday by Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and his outgoing Lebanese counterpart
Elias Hrawi in a marathon summit in Damascus. With 35,000 troops
as peacekeepers in Lebanon, Syria is the main power broker and
undisputed king-maker in the country.
</P>
<P>
Assad and Hrawi agreed at the meeting to amend the third clause
of Article 49 of Lebanon's Constitution, to clear the way for
Lahoud's ascendance to presidency. The clause stipulates that
first-rank civil servants wishing to join the presidential race
should quit their posts two years in advance of the vote.
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, Lahoud will be the 11th president of
Lebanon since its independence in 1943.
</P>
<P>
When the agreement on the army commander's choice was disclosed
after Hrawi's late night return from Damascus, Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri was the first to congratulate Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
From Riyadh where he was on a visit, Hariri telephoned the
general to say "Mabrouk (Congratulations), Mr President."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Lahoud had all the qualifications needed
to become the president, and was "the best choice."
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Nabih Berri, Hariri's on-and-off foe, was also
quick to declare unreserved support to Lahoud's selection, saying
the general would definitely be an honest arbiter who neutrally
oversees the power balance between state institutions.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, 62, a close ally of Syria, was appointed army commander
in November, 1989 on the eve of the end of Lebanon's 15-year-old
sectarian civil war.
</P>
<P>
He has gained popular support from many Lebanese, including
most politicians, due to his landmark achievements in rebuilding
the country's army into a cohesive fighting machine after its
tragic disintegration during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Many hope that the reform-minded leader will introduce drastic
changes into political life which is described by opposition
parties as full of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Maronite Catholic patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, the spiritual
head of Lebanon's largest Christian sect, said "the general is a
clean, disciplined leader with a sharp patriotic sentiment. I
bless the choice."
</P>
<P>
But he criticized the way the selection was made at the summit
talks which he said is "undemocratic." The predominantly rightist
Maronite community has long been resentful of Syria's grip on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a public opinion poll conducted by a governmental agency,
Lahoud received a 53.4 percent support from all 2,500 Lebanese
from various regions and religions questioned at random.
</P>
<P>
Even for Lahoud's main challenger in the presidential race,
opposition parliament member Butros Harb also spoke highly of
Lahoud, saying he was qualified enough to lead the nation into the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the process of electing Lahoud as the new
president will start from Thursday cabinet session during which
the 68-year-old incumbent president, Hrawi, will propose a bill to
amend the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the bill, the parliament will convene Thursday
next week to vote on the amendment and reconvene on October 15 to
elect Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes as planned, analysts here said, the general
will take the oath of presidency on November 24.

<HEADLINE> Kim Calls for Future-Oriented Ties With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae
Jung said here Thursday that Japan and South Korea must establish
"future-oriented ties" while trying to resolve differences over
their interpretation of Japan's colonial rule of the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Japan's Diet (parliament), the visiting president
said: "The time has come for the two countries to face up to our
past and establish future-oriented relations."
</P>
<P>
"Japan needs true courage to squarely face the past...and the
Republic of Korea needs to correctly evaluate Japan's changing
attitude and find hope in future possibilities," the South Korean
leader said.
</P>
<P>
Kim described a joint declaration signed earlier in the day by
him and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi as a milestone in
the two countries' efforts to overcome the differences.
</P>
<P>
The declaration put an end to a chapter of differences between
the two countries over their past, and would serve as the basis for
exploring a joint future of peace and prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, Obuchi expressed "deep remorse and heartfelt
apology" over the "pains and damage" Japan inflicted on the South
Korean people during its colonial rule from 1910 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he planned to allow the introduction of Japanese
popular culture into his country in stages so as to boost the
friendly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has banned popular Japanese culture from being
imported into the country since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following the signing of the
declaration, Kim and Obuchi called for reconciliation between
the two countries and a departure from their strained relations
caused by Japan's colonization of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Kim arrived Wednesday on his first state visit to Japan since
his assumption of presidency in February.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Ruling Party Leader Calls for Further Efforts to Form  New government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chea Sim, president of the
ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and former president of the
National Assembly, urged the three parties Thursday to make
further efforts for the formation of a new government as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim made the remarks during his interview with the media
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim expressed his dissatisfaction with the discussions the
working groups carried out, saying they were deadlocked on some
unimportant issues such as asking for recounting the ballots,
changing the seat calculation formula and granting amnesty to five
opposition figures.
</P>
<P>
"It was widely believed that the working groups of three
parties have made no significant progress on the formation of the
government and other important issues, although they have been
working hard," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So, I hope the three major political parties speed up the
process and working even harder for the sake of the interests of
the nation and the country. To Cambodia, time is money," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim said he wishes the three parties could make the
National Assembly function and a new government formed at the
second or third week of October.
</P>
<P>
"Hun Sen and I are prepared to hold talks with the Funcinpec
party President Prince Ranariddh at any time. We hope the Prince
come back from Bangkok as soon as possible," Chea Sim stated.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh and opposition party leader Sam Rainsy left Siem Reap
for Bangkok on September 25, the day after the opening of the
National Assembly and the lifting of a travel ban on opposition
members, allegedly for personal, not political reasons. Sam Rainsy
is now in the United States to lobby the U.S. government not to
accept the Cambodian government formed by Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Now only 25 of the 43 Funcinpec Parliamentarians are in
Cambodia and the 15 of Sam Rainsy Party's Assembly members are all
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chem Sim called on all the parliamentarians to do their duty
and come back soon. He pledged there was no threats against their
parliamentary immunity and the King's stay in Phnom Penh has
provided the safeguard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chea Sim said the better way is through the three
party working group session and the two party meeting between the
CPP and Funcinpec being held simultaneously, because some
important issues were only directly related to the CPP and
Funcinpec.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Sam Rainsy, Chem Sim said Sam Rainsy has only
two choices, one is to participate in the coalition government and
other is to continue to act as an opposition party.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Signs 15 New Laws on Invesmtent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 8 (Xinhua) --Since Nigerian leader Abdulsalami
Abubakar took power in June this year, he has signed 15 new decrees
to encourage private and foreign investment in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
According to details released by the Justice Ministry Tuesday,
the new laws repealed and amended legislations inhibiting
investments in petroleum, mining, steel, electrical power,
telecommunications and other sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
They also provide tax and tariff incentives to encourage
investment in certain sectors, including gas utilization.
</P>
<P>
The new laws are a fuifillment of the government's promise to
amend or repeal laws inhibiting investment, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In its bid to attract investment, the Nigerian government has
started steps to privatize key public enterprises, including the
National Telecommunications, fertilizer and electrical power
companies, as well as major steel, paper and vehicle assembly
plants.

<HEADLINE> US Justice Department Sues Visa, MasterCard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Justice Department
Wednesday sued Visa and MasterCard, the nation's biggest credit
card networks, accusing them of stifling competition.
</P>
<P>
Visa and MasterCard, with 50 percent and 25 percent of the
market respectively, "really don't compete with each other,
because they are both controlled by the same banks," said
Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, who heads the Justice
Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
In its lawsuit filed in the federal court in New York City, the
department also charged that Visa and MasterCard had adopted rules
that prohibited their member banks from offering the credit cards
of their rivals, such as American Express and Discover which have
a market share of only 18.4 percent and 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
A Visa bylaw adopted in the United States in 1991 banned Visa
members from offering the cards of American Express, Dean Witter,
Discover or other brands deemed competitive. MasterCard adopted
similar rules in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department asked the court to remove the
exclusionary rules from the networks' bylaws and to require that
banks governing an association be dedicated to one particular
network.
</P>
<P>
Both Visa and MasterCard denied the allegations, insisting that
their industry is among the nation's most competitive.
</P>
<P>
The case could have major consequences on the industry and the
antitrust law, experts say, noting that it could ease Visa and
MasterCard's powerful grip on the market and lead to greater
competition in the business as well as more cards and lower fees
for consumers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. College Education Costs More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A survey released Wednesday
showed a four-percent rise in U.S. college expenses, one percent
lower than that for last year, but a ticket to a higher education
still cost 50 percent more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the College Board which represents
colleges, universities and educational associations, said the four
percent average growth rate was equivalent to a 132-U.S.-dollar
increase in tuition and fees at public four-year institutions
which average 3,243 U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
For private four-year colleges, average tuition and fees rose
723 U.S. dollars, up 5 percent to 14,508 U.S. dollars, according to
the survey of 3,000 U.S. public and private institutions.
</P>
<P>
"The share of family income required to pay college expenses has
increased for all families in the 1980s and 1990s, but it has gone up
the most for those at the low end of the economic scale," said
Lawrence Gladieus, an analyst with the College Board.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that attending a public four-year college or
university cost 62 percent of a low-income family's earnings and
17 percent of a middle-income family's earnings last year, the
latest year for which data were available.
</P>
<P>
Sending a child to a private institution would have consumed
162 percent of the earnings of a low-income family, compared with
44 percent of those of a middle-income family and 4 percent of
those of a high-income family, the survey added.
</P>
<P>
College Board President Donald Stewart urged families to begin
saving early for college.
</P>
<P>
Tuition and fees grew by an average of five percent last year
and six percent each of the three years before that. As a result
of an earlier round of double-digit growth, tuition at public
four-year institutions over the last decade has risen 50 percent,
adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
Family income during the same period rose only 1.5 percent, also
adjusted for inflation.

MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Duma (lower house
of parliament) Chairman Gennady Seleznyov Thursday announced the
scheduled Thursday's meeting in Duma with representatives of the
embassies of the NATO member-states in Moscow is called off.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, the planned meeting at
the lower house on Wednesday was to focus on the developments
of Kosovo and possible NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, who is expected to attend the meeting, did not
explain the reason for the cancellation. However, according to
chairman of the State Duma International Affairs Committee
Vladimir Lukin, the embassies would most likely send "second
person" to such meetings.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and his Italian counterpart Romano Prodi held a second
telephone conversation on Kosovo Wednesday evening in two
days. They exchanged opinions on the prerequisites for the
settlement of the situation in Kosovo by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Prodi praised the efforts made by Russia,
adding that the world community expects Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic "to take additional steps to fully normalize
the situation."
</P>
<P>
Primakov stressed that as NATO continues threatening to take
military action in the Balkans, a meeting of the contact group

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urged to Ratify U.N. Biodiversity Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations official has
urged Thailand to ratify the Convention on Biodiversity so as to
share benefits of biological resources with technically-advanced
countries.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would also become a "financial magnet" and enjoy
technology transfer once it ratifies the convention, Daniel Navid,
a senior fellow of the U.N. Institute for Training and Research,
said in a statement available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged environmentalists' fear about foreign
exploitation of the country's resources due to the absence of laws
governing the use of bio-resources, but said Thailand could set up
its own rules to control foreign companies utilizing its
resources.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Thailand has more than sophisticated laws
controlling usage of its resources. You shouldn't wait any longer
because you will miss an opportunity to receive financial aid. No
country has waited until they get their laws perfected," Navid
said.
</P>
<P>
"The convention is just a framework that can be very helpful to
Thailand ... to get support and technology," said Navid, who had
worked with the Thai government on conservation and biodiversity
in 1978 and 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the U.S. Information Service, Navid came here to
explain the impacts of the convention on Thailand.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 countries have already ratified the convention.
Among those which have yet to ratify it are Thailand and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists in Thailand oppose its ratification on
grounds that the country did not yet have necessary laws or
mechanisms to protect its biological resources against
exploitation by multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
They cautioned the Thai government not to be lured by promises
of influxes of financial aid and technology to support
ratification, but to consider its impacts on the country's
biological resources.
</P>
<P>
Navid said the challenge for Thailand in conservation is not
the lack of laws but law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington would ratify the convention in the future.
But he stressed that the U.S. move should not be used as a
yardstick to push Thailand to follow suit.

<HEADLINE> Syria Lauds Egypt's Mediation in Ankara-Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Minister of Manpower Ali Al
Khalil Thursday praised Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
endeavors to put an end to the Syrian-Turkish crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made a several-hour visit to Turkey and Syria Tuesday
in his bid to contain the escalating tensions between the Mideast
neighbors from developing into armed conflicts. He has offered the
two countries a set of proposals to start a direct dialog for an
immediate solution.
</P>
<P>
"Mubarak presented Syria's viewpoint to the Turkish government,
not only as the president of Egypt, the largest Arab country, but
as the representative of the Arab nation," Khalil told the
Egyptian Voice of Arabs radio broadcast.
</P>
<P>
"He is there to tell the Turks: `we are keen on a good
relationship and good neighborliness with you,'" Khalil said in an
interview over telephone.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister said Damascus has not set any terms to
resolve this crisis, but at the same time it will not accept any
warnings or threats.
</P>
<P>
He was possibly referring to the Turkish government's decision
to give the Syrian government 45 days to "halt its support of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party," according to the Middle East
News Agency, quoting well-informed sources saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish cabinet, at a meeting Wednesday, agreed that if
Syria continues to maintain its position, Turkey will suspend
diplomatic action and adopt the measures it sees necessary.
</P>
<P>
During the 45-day leeway, Turkey will intensify diplomatic
action on the global arena, including visits by Turkish ministers
abroad to muster the largest possible support for its position.
</P>
<P>
He said Syria's strategy has always been dialog and he saw no
justification for the escalation of differences.
</P>
<P>
"Dialog has always been the tool of communication between
Turkey and Syria," he said, expressing belief that an Israeli
scheme was behind the current Ankara-Damascus crisis to drive a
wedge among Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Strained ties between Mideast neighbors Syria and Turkey have
deteriorated in recent weeks with Syria bridling at Turkey's
growing military links with Israel and Turkey threatening Damascus
for allegedly aiding Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in
southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing Egyptian efforts reportedly aim at arranging a
meeting between the foreign ministers of Turkey and Syria and
opening the road for the resumption of their joint committee
meetings in a bid to contain the mounting tension between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Both sides appear to have pulled back from the brink in recent
days with separate announcements they sought diplomatic means to
resolve the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Continues to Rise on Stronger Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar rocketed
one and a half U.S. cents higher Thursday and traded above 62 U.S.
cents for the first time since July, buoyed by a rising Japanese
yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed Thursday at 61.53 U.S. cents, up
from Wednesday's close of 60.58 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
It reached a high of 62.20 U.S. cents during Thursday's trade,
and dipped to a low of 61.25 U.S. cents while the consolidation
continued.
</P>
<P>
Scott Young, senior foreign exchange dealer at Arab Bank, said
that some profit taking took place Thursday afternoon, although
the local currency remained well bid.
</P>
<P>
He said the Australian dollar would continue to follow the
movements of the Japanese yen, and did not think it would fall
below 61.00 U.S. cents in overnight trade.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how far the yen goes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Suggestions that Japan was on the verge of passing its bank
reforms had swayed in the yen's favor, despite the Japanese
government cutting its forecast for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Comments Wednesday night by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan also led investors to turn away from the Greenback and
buy yen. His comments were interpreted as offering the possibility
of further interest rate cuts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 75.31 Japanese yen from 77.97
yen, and 0.9890 German marks from 0.9865 marks.

CAIRO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
left here Thursday morning for Moscow to seek a role by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in pushing forward the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador to Egypt, who saw Arafat off at the
airport, said the Palestinian leader will meet in Moscow with the
Russian president, premier and foreign minister to exchange views
on the developments of the peace march.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss coordinating stances regarding steps to
be taken in the coming phase to propel the peace march in the
Middle East, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew to Cairo Wednesday night for talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak right after his meetings with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy meeting with Netanyahu and Arafat, Albright
Wednesday announced that "significant and substantial progress has
been made" in the talks, and an October 15 summit would be held in
Washington to nail down an agreement on Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Albright flew to the region to narrow differences between the
two sides on a U.S. proposal on a 13 percent Israeli pullback in
exchange for Palestinian crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russia are the co-sponsors of the 1991 Madrid
Conference which laid down the cornerstone of the Mideast
peace-making process, but Russia has lowered its profile since.

<HEADLINE> China Science News Set to Become Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The China Science News, one of
China's major science newspapers established in 1959, will become
the Science Daily on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) will establish the daily
along with the academies of Engineering (CAE) and Social Sciences
(CASS), according Editor in Chief Luo Rongxing.
</P>
<P>
"The new newspaper will become part of the mainstream science
media serving 20 million intellectuals across the country," said
Luo.
</P>
<P>
The existing newspaper has a small circulation approaching
50,000, said Luo, adding that the Science Daily will attempt to
increase its circulation by 10-fold over the three years. The
effort will focus on expanding content and covering major
scientific issues both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said the restructuring will be carried out in tandem with
the Knowledge Innovation Project introduced by the CAS earlier
this year. The new daily will employ a staff of young reporters
and editors, and will assume full responsibility for profits and
losses.
</P>
<P>
The State Press and Publications Administration has approved
the restructuring project.

<HEADLINE> 100 Million Chinese Suffer Hypertension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 million Chinese
citizens suffer from hypertension and the figure is expected to
climb due to a number of factors, including the rapidly aging
population, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH).
</P>
<P>
A recent national survey revealed the number of Chinese
hypertension patients swells by three million annually, with the
disorder causing 1.5 million strokes and 750,000 cases of coronary
heart disease each year, according to MOH Vice Minister Yin Dakui.
</P>
<P>
"The aforementioned diseases have emerged as the No.1 cause of
death in China and are responsible for 40 percent of
illness-related fatalities," said Yin. He made the comments
earlier today in a meeting marking the first "National
Hypertension Day".
</P>
<P>
Health departments nationwide have organized various activities
to disseminate information on hypertension. "We must enhance
public awareness in order to achieve effective prevention and
controls," according to the MOH official.
</P>
<P>
Yin pointed that high blood pressure is not only health
threatening, but also overburdens sufferers with substantial
medical costs.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the rising susceptibility of Chinese to the
disease to improper lifestyles and dramatic social changes. They
point to specific causes such as obesity, high levels of
cholesterol in blood, an excessive intake of salt, smoking, mental
fatigue and the lack of physical exercises.
</P>
<P>
"An urgent nationwide prevention campaign must be launched to
introduce measures needed to effectively control 75 percent of
hypertension cases and related complications," according to
Professor Liu Lisheng, chairwoman of the Chinese Hypertension
League.
</P>
<P>
Some 21 Beijing hospitals joined today's activities by offering
free blood pressure checks.
</P>
<P>
The MOH recently received a grant of five million yuan from
Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Ltd, a joint venture between Pfizer
Inc. and the Dalian Pharmaceutical Plant, to fund hypertension
research and health education programs.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Pledges to Accelerate Reform Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
pledged to accelerate its on-going reform process at an
appropriate pace with structural economic adjustments, media
reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and governor of the state bank Nguyen Tan
Dung made the pledge when addressing the opening session of the
53rd World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual
meeting in Washington Tuesday, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Dung said Vietnam has been suffering from the heavy impact of
the regional crisis and is also subject to serious consequences of
natural calamities.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnam's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate is
estimated at 6 percent in 1998, the lowest level in the last seven
years.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports failed to increase substantially while
foreign direct investments were only 60 percent of the 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam was also facing growing unemployment and difficulties
in balancing payment.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Vietnam is watching closely the evolution of
the crisis and is drawing valuable lessons from the crisis
countries," Dung said.
</P>
<P>
Being a poor and least developed country, Vietnam's recent
achievements gained by mobilizing domestic resources and limited
assistance from donors and foreign investors have not been
sufficient to prevent the decline in economic growth and reduce
the adverse impact of the regional crisis, said Dung.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnam's government is committed to accelerating the
reform process at an appropriate pace with structural economic
adjustment so that all domestic resources can be maximized, the
impact of the crisis be minimized and socio-economic stability and
development be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Dung requested the IMF and the World Bank to increase
concessional funding and to provide technical assistance to
Vietnam "in a more timely and more practical fashion in
implementing economic reform and structural adjustment."
</P>
<P>
He added that Vietnam wishes to reach an agreement on
structural adjustment credit and an enhanced structural adjustment
facility program as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Online Survey Shows Y2K Generating Worries Among Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Year 2000 computer problem
is generating serious worries even among well-educated Americans,
according to an online survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the 6,300 respondents are worried that the
millennium bug will negatively affect the U.S. stock market and
plan to prepare themselves and their families in some way.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Ziff-Davis (ZD), an integrated
media and marketing company focusing on computing and Internet, in
partnership with the professional Harris Poll. Based on the
survey's demographics, ZD's online service ZDNet said, the
respondents are a well-educated, well-to-do group, many of whom
work in the information technology field.
</P>
<P>
84 percent of the respondents claim at least a "good" or
"complete" understanding of Y2K. While few foresee a doomsday
scenario, 61 percent anticipate at least "somewhat serious"
effects on them or their families. But only 25 percent anticipate
a Y2K-related domestic recession.
</P>
<P>
Presumably out of the concerns, nearly four-fifth of the
respondents plan to do some preparations, such as stocking up on
extra food, fuel, batteries and candles. More than 60 percent have
considered avoiding air travel and withdrawing money from a
bank. A quarter of them have thought about taking nearly all of
their money out from the banks.
</P>
<P>
ZDNet said as the respondents were not randomly selected, the
poll was not a scientific one and therefore the results cannot be
projected to a larger population of the general public or Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
There are also "good news", the amused ZDNet editors said many
of the respondents expressed confidence that they and their
employers will have the bug licked by the day of reckoning. In
fact, three-quarters report that their employer has taken steps to
prepare for Y2K, while 85 percent believe their firms will achieve
their compliance goals in time for 2000.
</P>
<P>
As for the responsibility, only a slight majority of the
respondents think the government ought to take a stronger role to
addressing the issue. But if something goes wrong, Uncle Sam
wouldn't bear the brunt of the blame. Nearly three-fifths said
they would mostly hold business leaders and information technology
professionals responsible.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Asian Financial Crisis And Traditional Asian Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- One lesson of the Asian
financial crisis is that the affected nations have copied too
much from the West while ignoring their own valuable traditional
thought, according to scholars attending an ongoing seminar
here.
</P>
<P>
The 2nd International Symposium on Oriental Thought, which
began on Tuesday and will end on Friday, attracted more than
100 scholars and specialists from China, the Republic of Korea,
Japan, Singapore, and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Huang Fanzhang, a researcher with the Macro-Economics Research
Institute under the State Development Planning Commission, said in
a paper presented to the seminar that the problems of East Asian
economies, which resulted in the current crisis, were caused by
the region's deviation from traditional thought.
</P>
<P>
This traditional thought, according to some participants,
embraces Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and Islam, as well as
Shintoism in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The 'magic' economic boom of the last 30 years in East Asia
was a result of Oriental traditional thought," said Huang, also a
professor at Beijing's People's University. "The so-called 'East
Asia Economic Model,' characterized by government dominance, a
high savings rate and an export-oriented economy, was nurtured by
traditional thought."
</P>
<P>
He defended the Asian model as not the major cause of the turmoil,
saying that what is responsible is the abuse of the model.
</P>
<P>
"The Asia financial turmoil cannot overshadow the brightness of
Oriental culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Huang's ideas were echoed by another Chinese scholar, Wang Zhan,
director of the Development Research Center of the Shanghai
Municipal Government. He said Oriental nations should mainly
look to traditional thought as they try to find their way in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
"Western civilization does not deserve to be the universal
growth model," said the well-known economist. "Instead, the
essence of Oriental culture, which played a pivotal role in the
fast-growing Asian nations, should be explored."
</P>
<P>
Wang listed frugality, family ethics, individual relationships,
education and harmonious co-existence with nature as the key
points to be explored.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that Asian nations discard the negative
elements of the Oriental culture, and learn from the West in a
dynamic and reasonable way.
</P>
<P>
Mitsuhashi Tadahiro, a commentator with the Hihon Keizai Shimbun
(Japan Economic Journal), warned that Asian nations which want to
catch up with the West should not copy the "dangerous" American
growth model.
</P>
<P>
"Characterized by high consumption of natural resources and
high consumption, the American style has caused evident damage to
the global environment," he said. "(They) should look to their
good traditional habits such as frugality, and achieve a growth
style where man and nature develop in a harmonious relationship."

<HEADLINE> Members of Banned Political Party Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's State Security Court has
convicted five members of a banned political party for membership
in illegal group, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The five were given sentences ranging from six to 18 months,
the paper quoted an unnamed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
They were among the 20 members of the Al Tahrir (liberation)
Party arrested last month when they distributed leaflets in some
cities, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Other detainees will stand trial later this month, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Al Tahrir Party, established in Palestine, has been banned
for years and it is known as the only officially-announced
underground opposition party by Jordanian government.
</P>
<P>
The party insists on Islamic ideology and wants Jordan to
have Islamic law that is based on the Koran.
</P>
<P>
Jordan allows the existence of opposition parties, but they
must officially register and are not allowed to conduct
underground activities.
</P>
<P>
Registered opposition parties have been active in the kingdom
and usually hold seats in the Lower House of Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Confident of Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada expressed here Thursday his confidence of the recovery of
the country's economy from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on government programs during the first 100 days of
his administration, Estrada said that recent economic and
financial developments have given "us confidence that we can
overcome this crisis."
</P>
<P>
During the first eight months of this year, the Philippines'
inflation averaged at 8.4 percent. Estrada said the rate is one of
the lowest in the region and remains within the government's
single-digit inflation target of 9.25-9.75 percent for the whole
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports grew by 18.8 percent for the first half of
this year, higher than most countries in the region, and the
government's fiscal deficit dropped from 93 billion pesos (about
2.1 billion U.S. dollars) to 40 billion pesos (909 million
dollars) due to various fiscal disciplines taken by the
government.
</P>
<P>
During the first 100 days of Estrada's governance, the
government also gave top priority to the modernization of
agriculture, the revival of industry, poverty reduction, the
delivery of housing, employment, education, health and social
services and the peace talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the government's efforts, the Philippines is the
only one among its Asian neighbors that is projected to show
positive economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
"The country remains one of the few promising economies in a
region where many others are expected to go into recession,"
Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He added that this confidence was affirmed by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
IMF managing director Michel Camdessus said earlier that the
Philippines is "the least affected" by the Asian financial crisis
and might be the first nation to get out of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> TV Makes World "Global Village" for Tibetans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that 94
percent of Tibetan households now have TV sets, and TV relay
stations cover all the villages and towns in the Tibet Autonomous
Region, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
In major cities and towns such as Lhasa, Nagqu, Xigaze and
Shiquanhe, more than 20 local and satellite channels are
available, including broadcasts in Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
A soccer fan named Dogyal said he was able to enjoy all the
matches during the '98 World Cup via live telecasts from China
Central Television (CCTV).
</P>
<P>
Pubu Drolmar, a resident of Bargor Street, put the TV set in
front of her niche and said her favorite program is a TV series
called "East Journey of Panchen," but she felt a little sad that
there was no version in Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of Bargor Street, 80 percent of the
residents there watch the Tibetan-language programs on the CCTV
News and local news everyday.
</P>
<P>
Drashi Drolmar, a local official, said that she was moved to
tears and donated 300 yuan to the flood-hit areas after watching
news of the flood-fighting campaigns on TV.
</P>
<P>
Even in the pastoral areas, which now have electricity and
satellite relay facilities, watching TV has become the most
popular entertainment for Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Dolungdeqen County at first disliked advertisements
on TV, but later changed their attitude. Thanks to ads, they have
cooperated with companies in other provinces to set up many
township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans say airplanes and telephones have shortened the
distance between Tibet and the rest of the world, but it is TV
that really has made the world a "global village" for
them.

<HEADLINE> Guest Workers Given a Month to Legalize Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian government has decided
to give illegal foreign workers a month to legalize their status,
the Jordan Times newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an official the paper said a total of 17 offices across
the country will keep open for the guest workers to apply for work
permits until the beginning of next month.
</P>
<P>
By then, those who can not legalize their status will be
deported according to relevant laws and regulations, said Bahjat
Quteishat, head of the Labor and Employment Department of the
Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
The number of applicants has increased sharply since the
government declared at the end of last month to strictly regulate
the foreign labor market.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a campaign launched by the government on
September 30 to curb employment of non-Jordanians and return job
chances to unemployed Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
In the past days, police have rounded up hundreds of Asian
workers. Those with valid work permits will be allowed to stay,
while those without will be fined some 140 U.S. dollars and be
deported at employers' expense.
</P>
<P>
Official figures put foreign workers living in Jordan between
300,000 to 500,000, most of whom are are Egyptians, Syrians and
Iraqis. Only 40 percent of them hold valid work permits.
</P>
<P>
They are widely believed to have grabbed job opportunities from
Jordanians. Employers like to hire these people because they can
pay less and do not have to undertake their insurance.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Relics Discovered in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Construction workers in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province discovered sariras--a combination of bone
ashes of eminent Buddhist monks-- in a 1,400-year-old tower as
they were attempting to move the tower to a location 3 kilometers
away.
</P>
<P>
The 30-meter-high tower, located in southern Zhouzhi County and
on the State's protected list, was built in 601 by Yang Jian, an
emperor of the Sui Dynasty (581-618).
</P>
<P>
In order to make way for a water project, the local government
decided to move the tower, and with the approval of the State
Council the task began in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
On September 17, while working on the second floor of the
tower, construction workers dug a small bronze coffin out of a pit
which was covered by two large bricks.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists in the province hurried to the site and opened
the coffin which was wrapped with paper and silk. The coffin is
11.9 cm long, 7.6 cm wide and 10.5 cm high, and contained a glazed
white bottle in which were found bean-sized sariras, one white and
two yellow.
</P>
<P>
Archeologiests said there might be another chamber under the
tower as they heard a hollow sound below as they rapped on the
tower's base, and further discoveries are possible.

<HEADLINE> 7 Dead in PNG Highland Landslide: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Seven people died Tuesday when
a landslide swept away two homes in a remote village in the
highlands of Papua New Guinea (PNG), the Australian Associated
Press (AAP) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A girl aged eight or nine escaped Tuesday's landslide
uninjured, said Wakaf Macksaen, deputy provincial administrator of
Enga province.
</P>
<P>
He said the landslide occurred around 4:00 a.m. Tuesday,
instead of last Friday as reported earlier, in an isolated area
southeast of the Maramuni Station in the north of Enga province,
following heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
Macksaen, who visited the site of the landslide at Pafalangus
village earlier Thursday, said media reports that up to 140 people
in a church congregation may have perished in a landslide last
Friday were "all wrong."
</P>
<P>
PNG's national newspaper National Thursday reported that over
100 people were feared to have been buried alive in a landslide
that struck a church congregation in the nation's remote Maramuni
area of Enga province last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Macksaen said the landslide carried away two houses made of
flimsy bush materials nestled in a valley surrounded by steep
mountains.
</P>
<P>
"There were a total of eight people in the houses. One escaped,
the others were carried away," Macksaen told AAP.
</P>
<P>
Macksaen said the seven dead included five men and two women,
and three or four of the bodies had been recovered from the mud
and debris.
</P>
<P>
The eight people in the two destroyed houses had probably been
asleep at the time the landslide occurred.
</P>
<P>
The young girl who survived was believed to be staying with her
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Macksaen said the area around Maramuni was very unstable and
landslides occurred regularly.
</P>
<P>
A landslide in the area in 1960 killed 60 people.

<HEADLINE> NZ Finds Way for One-Dose Cure of Genetic Disorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand scientists have
found a way to treat genetic disorders that promises a one-dose
cure for diseases such as stomach cancer and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
According to a report recently published in the New Zealand
Herald, an Auckland-based newspaper, a group of scientists at the
Auckland School of Medicine have used a gene-therapy treatment
taken orally to cure the world's commonest genetic disorder,
lactose intolerance, in rats.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that within a decade a "dose" of the same gene
therapy will be used to combat inherited conditions in humans,
such as hemophilia, intestinal cancer, cystic fibrosis and
obesity, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It reported that molecular biologist Matthew During, head of
the group, cured lactose-intolerant rats by delivering a
lactose-digesting gene into the tissue that needed it.
</P>
<P>
He found that the rats could digest lactose after only one oral
dose of the missing genetic material.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Professor During as saying the breakthrough
cleared the way for a whole generation of new gene-therapy drugs.
</P>
<P>
Gene therapy is a method of treating diseases caused by genetic
 abnormalities by replacing the defective gene with a corrected
one.
</P>
<P>
Problems have always existed with targeting the specific tissue
 containing the faulty gene and keeping the corrected gene
functioning long term.
</P>
<P>
The group of scientists inserted the missing gene
b-galactosidase, which produces the lactose-digesting enzyme,
into rats' intestines.
</P>
<P>
The gene was incorporated into cells lining the rats'
gastrointestinal tract, allowing them to metabolize lactose.
</P>
<P>
Six months later the rats remain tolerant to lactose,
suggesting that a one-dose pill could be used to treat human
genetic diseases.
</P>
<P>
"This research brings gene therapy one step closer to the
clinic," Professor During said.
</P>
<P>
"Delivery of the missing gene has always been the problem, but
this research makes it feasible to give gene-therapy orally in
the form of a pill," he added.

<HEADLINE> Rural Chinese Women Accept Contraception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- It has become common in rural
Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province to find women who
choose suitable methods of contraception for the purpose of birth
control.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhijuan of Luhai Village in the city's Jinzhou District has
been using condoms since she gave birth to two girls, while Zhang
Guixiang of the same village decided to use an intrauterine device
after she had a boy.
</P>
<P>
In the fishing village, all the 33 women of childbearing age
have chosen one method of contraception or another.
</P>
<P>
There are several ways to control birth such as ligature,
hypodermic implantation, condoms and oral contraceptives. However,
rural women used to have only two choices, ligature or an
intrauterine device, because of the limited medical facilities in
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
As one of ten pilot cities in China promoting contraception in
rural areas, Dalian launched five years ago a program to encourage
rural women to choose suitable methods for themselves.
</P>
<P>
The local government has also helped set up 98 family planning
clinics in 130 towns offering women services such as physical
examinations and contraception consultations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the old idea among rural people that "more children
means greater fortune" is rapidly disappearing.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year-old Hong Xiumei chose to use condoms after she had
a girl, though she can have another child according to State
policy.
</P>
<P>
Hong said she now can provide more love and care for her only
daughter and hopes the child will eventually attend college, a
dream of her own which did not come true because her parents had
too many children to take care of with low income.

JINAN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Three of 12 village leaders
recently arrested for illegal logging in east China's Shandong
Province have been sentenced to prison, and the remaining
officials were subject to disciplinary sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The arrests saved state assets of well over 900,000 yuan
(108,433 US dollars), according to the Shandong Forestry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show an increase in cases of illegal logging in the
province in the first half of the year, with the 900 related cases
doubling the number for the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that forest rangers throughout the
province will use the local 110 police hot line as a means of

<HEADLINE> US Study: High Tech Moves Beyond Silicon Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A study released Wednesday
said that high technology was increasingly creating jobs in
major Californian metropolitan areas other than San Jose in the
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the American Electronics Association,
said that the San Jose metropolitan area employed 221,000 high
technology workers, representing nearly a third of all the 724,000
technology jobs in the state of California in 1996, with an
average annual wage of 72,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The second largest metropolitan area in terms of employment was
Los Angeles, with 147,000 jobs and an annual wage of 51,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sacramento, Fresno, Vallejo-Napa and San Francisco were also
emerging as high-tech metropolitan zones, where high tech
employment grew by 56 percent, 54 percent, 46 percent and 37
percent respectively in the 1990-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly, high tech is a statewide phenomenon as other
California cities become more attractive because of their
competitive cost of living, skilled labor force and quality of
life," said Joseph Dooling, a senior vice president of the
American Electronics Association, an industrial trade group, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The above employment and salary data, which combined statistics
from the U.S. census bureau, were only available through 1996. The
wage data, said the study, has likely increased over the past two
years, especially in Silicon Valley.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Big Trade Surplus in 1st 8 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a
significant trade surplus in the first eight months this year as a
result of increase in exports and decline in imports.
</P>
<P>
The surplus during the period under review amounted to 32.4
billion ringgit (about 8.526 billion U.S. dollars) in contrast to
a deficit of 2.5 billion ringgit (about 657.894 million U.S.
dollars) in the corresponding period last year, according to
figures released by the Statistics Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
For the January-August 1998 period, exports rose strongly by
38.6 percent to 187.1 billion ringgit (about 49.236 billion U.S.
dollars), while imports increased by 12.5 percent to 154.6 billion
ringgit (about 40.684 billion U.S. dollars), in comparison with
those for the corresponding period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The department said that electrical and electronic products,
Malaysia's largest export earner, netted receipts amounting to
51.8 percent of the total export earnings in January-August 1998
period, recording a 42.9 percent increase over the corresponding
period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Palm oil and palm-based products, the second largest export
earner of the country, accounted for 7.8 percent of total exports
during the first eight months of 1998, recording a 71.7 percent
growth over that recorded in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Other major export earners include liquefied natural gas (LNG),
which accounted for 2.9 percent of total exports and increased by
26.1 percent, and crude petroleum which accounted for 2.7 percent
of total exports and increased by 20.6 percent in the period under
review compared with the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On imports, the department said the major categories of imports
by end-use for the period under review were intermediate goods
amounting to 69.9 percent of total imports, capital goods 16.8
percent and consumption goods 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the January-August 1998 period, Malaysia's top three
trading partners continued to be Japan, the United States and
Singapore, which collectively accounted for 51.5 percent of the
country's total trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide server revenues
approached 9.9 billion U.S. dollars in the second quarter, down
11.2 percent from the same period a year ago, according to a
report released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
California-based market analysis firm Dataquest reported that
in the second quarter, server revenue in the Asia-Pacific region
(excluding Japan with a 31.6 percent drop) declined 34 percent,
compared with the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Revenue declines were also reported in other two major markets
-- the United States, 6 percent, and Canada, 27.8 percent. With
3.6 billion dollars in server revenue and a moderate increase of
7.7 percent, western Europe was the only market experiencing a
positive growth.
</P>
<P>
Last week another U.S. market analysis firm, International Data
Corporation (IDC), reported that worldwide PC server shipments in
the second quarter dropped to just over 487,800 units,
representing a negative 1 percent sequential growth.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC analysis, turmoil in Japan played a major role
in the worldwide PC server shipment decline. The overall downturn
was also due to increased inventory in the United States, modest
growth in Europe and a slowdown in high-end PC server sales.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-two people were killed
and over 70 others are feared to have been buried alive in a huge
landslide that took place last Friday in Papua New Guinea (PNG),
the nation's national newspaper National reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper's electronic edition available on
the Internet, a landslide struck a church congregation in Papua
New Guinea's (PNG)'s remote Maramuni area of Enga province last
Friday during the current rainy season.
</P>
<P>
There is no road and telephone links in the remote area of
Maramuni.
</P>
<P>
The paper said a nine-year-old girl, Yutia Lusate, was the sole
survivor of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight bodies had been found under muddy soil and
were buried in a mass grave, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Senior Maramuni Councillor Reuben Kini said the victims were
sleeping after attending a big prayer session called "Holy Spirit
Movement" when the disaster happened.
</P>
<P>
He said the nine-year-old girl managed to escape and reported
the landslide disaster to nearby people.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo, Seoul Agree to Establish New Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and visiting South Korean President Kim Dae Jung agreed
Thursday to establish a new Japan-South Korea partnership toward
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was contained in a joint declaration and a
supplementary action plan the two leaders signed after their
two-hour meeting at the Akasaka State Guest House on the second
day of Kim's four-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
"The two leaders agreed on the importance of developing ties
based on trust and mutual understanding while facing outright the
history between the two nations in order to build a firm friendly
relationship in the 21st century," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi expressed "deep remorse and heartfelt apology" over the
"pains and damages" Japan inflicted on the South Korean people
during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula,
said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
It said Kim appreciated Obuchi's remarks, and called for
"mutual efforts to develop future-oriented relations while
overcoming the tragic history between the two nations."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to step up bilateral dialogue,
including holding a summit at least once a year, to build
"balanced high-level cooperative" ties in a wide range of areas
from cultural exchanges to economic and security matters.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi pledged to continue supporting South Korea's efforts to
overcome its financial crisis, and the two leaders agreed to
promote "policy coordination" further in bilateral and
multilateral economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Kim reiterated his policy of opening access to Japanese culture
in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Kim arrived here Wednesday on his first state visit to Japan
since taking office in February.

<HEADLINE> India Likely to Ease Tech Import Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
likely to ease technology import regime and treat technology
acquired by Indian companies as capital, a government official
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Committee of Secretaries cleared an Industry
Ministry proposal to shift technology imports for projects
assessed and funded by financial institutions (FIs) to the
automatic approval list of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The
proposal seeks to remove restrictions on the quantum of lumpsum
payment, royalty and the phasing of installments for technology
imports.
</P>
<P>
The move will remove bottlenecks in technology imports allowing
companies to include them in project cost and raise loans from
banks and FIs.
</P>
<P>
At present, know-how and licence fees cannot be funded as part
of capital expenditure.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the Department of Science and Technology has
proposed an insurance cover against technology failure to
facilitate finances. According to the department, insurance cover
would go a long way in encouraging the industry to enhance
technology.
</P>
<P>
The move follows the realization of importance of allowing
Indian companies to bring in the latest technology and also be
able to finance its purchase to make them internationally
competitive, the official said.
</P>
<P>
India is poor in capital goods technology and has to depend on
the developed countries. Large projects like petro-chemical
plants, power units have a significant part of their project cost
as technology fee and related expenditure, he added.

<HEADLINE> Grain Prices Rise Sharply on U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Prices of grain, soybean,
pork and beef rose sharply Wednesday on market rumors that Russia
needs donations of corn and wheat from the United States to make
up its crop production shortages, according to reports from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, wheat for December delivery
rose by 11.75 cents to 2.95 U.S. dollars per bushel; December corn
rose by 7.75 cents to 2.18 dollars per bushel; and November
soybeans rose by 10.75 cents to 5.33 dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Wednesday that Russia
had made no formal requests for food aid donations, but it had
made preliminary inquiries.
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors in the U.S. market that Russia was
seeking from the U.S. three million tons of wheat, 1.5 million
tons of corn, 500,000 tons of soybean meal and 100,000 tons of
pork.
</P>
<P>
A sharp drop in the U.S. dollar, particularly against the yen,
also supported grain prices. Market analysts say a weaker dollar
makes U.S. goods cheaper to purchase and could cause a flurry of
export demand if it remains low.
</P>
<P>
Pork futures also benefited from Russian talk on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, as some investors speculated that the
U.S. government could snap up as much as 100 million dollars worth
of pork to donate overseas.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Seek Ways to Prevent Escalation of Kosovo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Poland is determined to find a
way to prevent the Kosovo conflict from escalating into an even
greater tragedy, Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Polish News Agency (PAP) said the Polish president met with
the prime minister to discuss the Balkan political and military
situation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek,
also rotating president of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), discussed the organization's
political options to help resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Buzek told local reporters that Poland is ready
to take part in NATO's military action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Polish Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz said the air forces
from NATO member countries would spearhead the military
action. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization did not expect
Poland to send troops, though his country did participate in
NATO's decision, Onyszkiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if a new "cold war" would break out after Russia voiced
opposition against NATO's proposed air strikes against Yugoslavia,
the defense minister said the western countries would not allow
Russia to succeed.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Geremek said that the Yugoslav foreign
minister requested on Tuesday that OSCE send a mission to Kosovo
to talk with the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
He said he would not go to Belgrade, because he believes that
Belgrade lacks sincerity. Geremek said the world is not only
facing a potential military conflict, but a humanitarian
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE head said there is still a chance to avoid a military
conflict, which may be resolved during U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke's talks.

<HEADLINE> Flood Loss in Bangladesh Estimated at 4.3 Bln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Planning Ministry's
preliminary estimate puts the total loss caused by the
two-month-long devastating flood at around 4.3 billion U.S.
dollars, The Financial Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total loss would be around 10 percent of the GDP (gross
domestic product), the paper quoted State Minister for Planning
Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP size is around 43 billion dollars, according
to the revised national accounts.
</P>
<P>
The government has worked out short-term and long-term
rehabilitation programs of around 900 million dollars for the
current fiscal year starting from July 1998.
</P>
<P>
An aid of around 230 million dollars would be required to
implement the rehabilitation programs, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The local resource requirement for the rehabilitation programs
would be around 600 million dollars, of which about 304 million
dollars would be available from this year's annual development
program, while the mobilization of 289 million dollars would be
required, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far commitment from the development partners is around 200
million dollars both in cash and kind, which is much less than
what was expected, the report quoted sources in the Planning
Commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alamgir hoped that the response of the foreign development
partners would be better. Both the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank had fielded assessment teams to Bangladesh, and
after completion of their assessments, response from foreign
sources would be better, he added.
</P>
<P>
The immediate priority of the government is the agriculture
rehabilitation programs, he said, adding that the government has
decided to disburse loan amounting to 32.5 billion taka (about
691.5 million dollars), almost double the disbursement in the last
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The government has also allocated 500 million taka (about 10.6
million dollars) to support the marginal farmers, he stated.
</P>
<P>
On private sector industrial rehabilitation programs, the state
minister said the banks have been asked to meet the working
capital demand.
</P>
<P>
Under the rehabilitation programs, road communication received
the highest allocation of 13.75 billion taka (about 292.6 million
dollars), which is 32.22 percent of the total allocation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The local governments received the second highest allocation of
9.65 billion taka (about 205.3 million dollars) and the Water
Resources Ministry got the third highest allocation of 6.34
billion taka (about 134.9 million dollars), he added.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Bans Certain Brands of Foreign Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar health authorities
have prohibited the application and sale of 13 brands of
unregistered eye drops imported from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Of the 13 brands of eye drops, eight are from India, two from
China and one each from Germany, Belgium and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Official paper The New Light of Myanmar Thursday quoted the
Ministry of Health as saying that the unregistered eye drops have
not been examined for their potency and quality and safety.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid danger, the sellers and users have been asked
to use the registered ones.
</P>
<P>
Recently, many people suffered from seasonal soar eye disease
in the country, widely using imported eye drops without knowing
whether they are registered or not.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, since August last year, the Myanmar authorities have
also banned 22 brands of Myanmar traditional drugs and 26 local
and foreign brands of purified bottled water for public
consumption in a crackdown on expired food and medicines as well
as unhygienic locally-produced preserves.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar enacted the National Food Law in March 1997 and formed
the special Food and Drug Authority in its bid to enable the
public to consume food of genuine quality, free from danger and
hygienic problems, and to control and regulate the production,
import, export, storage, distribution and sale of food.

NEW DELHI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Indian research organizations
have developed a green technology for the country's textile
industry and the new system is under trial.
</P>
<P>
The Mumbai-based Textile Research Association and the Petroleum
Conservation Research Association have worked out a new system to
check air pollution caused by the textile industry and a plant has
been set up to demonstrate the effectiveness of the device, the
Business Standard said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that such a system has been developed in
India. During printing of cotton fabrics, called pigment printing,
the kerosene used is retained in the cloth after the process is
over. The cloth is then dried on machine dryers which result in
vaporization of kerosene.
</P>
<P>
The new system can recapture and recycle the kerosene vapors
which can then be reused as fresh input. The new system can
recover about 80 percent of the vapors, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Device May Help Impaired Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. Scientists
have developed an electronic device that when implanted in the
brain allows severely impaired patients to "will" a computer to
speak for them, Seattle Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Called a neurotrophic electrode, the device harnesses brain
cells' electric impulses to move a computer cursor, which in turn
activates spoken words or phrases.
</P>
<P>
The technology, called cognitive engineering, was developed by
scientists at Atlanta-based Emory University neurosurgery
department, who presented their research to the Congress of
Neurological Surgeons in Seattle this week.
</P>
<P>
According to Emory scientists, the technology could some day be
used to help paralyzed patients move limbs or prosthetic devices.
For now it is being tested in patients with the most severe
impairments, including the inability to speak and move their eyes.
</P>
<P>
The key device in the system -- the neurotrophic electrode
which is a glass cone about the size of a ballpoint-pen tip -- is
implanted through the skull and into the cortex just above the
ear. Two such electrodes are implanted to facilitate vertical and
horizontal movements of the cursor.
</P>
<P>
The cone contains a gold wire and nerve tissue from the leg.
Nerve cells inside the cone stimulate cells of the cortex to grow
into the device and form contacts. The wire records the impulses
between the cells.
</P>
<P>
A receiver and amplifier for each implant sit in the top of the
skull. A signal processor filters the correct signals for the
patient to move the cursor. The system is powered by a removable
induction coil that sits on top of the head.
</P>
<P>
When the system is turned on, the patient listens to the firing
of the brain cells, called neurons. The patient has to learn to
control the level of the neuron firing with his thoughts about
different movements.
</P>
<P>
More than 700,000 Americans a year suffer strokes and thousands
more are impaired from spinal-cord injuries and illnesses. Many
of them are severely hampered by their inability to communicate
adequately.
</P>
<P>
The Emory researchers said that cognitive engineering has
potential for helping many different kinds of patients.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Petition Supreme Court to Keep Records Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson petitioned the
Nevada Supreme Court on Wednesday with an effort to keep
psychological test results known from the public.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's petition came after a lower court's refusal ruling on
Monday. He hope the Supreme Court can reconsider an order
allowing the records to be made public upon their release to the
Nevada Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
A team of psychiatrists examined Tyson for five days last
week, and worked out the documents.
</P>
<P>
Commission members decided on the September 19 hearing that
Tyson's fate would be determined by the results. If he passed the
tests, the former heavyweight champion would perhaps regain his
license.
</P>
<P>
Tyson lawyer Jim Jimmerson said it was clear the records
should be kept under wraps "when considering the harm likely to
be suffered by (Tyson). Clearly when balancing the public
curiosity in these records to Tyson's interest in maintaining
their confidentiality, the court could have reasonably found that
these sensitive records should be withheld from public
inspection," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jimmerson said that Dr. Ronald Schouten, who directed the
tests, agreed that the information should only go to the Athletic
Commission for its internal use.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer also pointed out that Tyson is in poor financial
shape and needs to box again to support himself and his family.
Tyson desperately needs money to pay off a 13 million lien to the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
Tyson faces an October 19 trial in Montgomery County despite
efforts by his attorneys to settle with the two men who were
beaten by Tyson in a traffic accident in August.

<P>
CARACAS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela and Suriname signed an
agreement on Wednesday to conserve and exploit marine life in the
sea, and to enhance water rights and fishing agreements between
their two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by the foreign ministers of Venezuela
and Suriname, Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas and Errol Snijders, at

</P>
<P>
"With the subscription of this juridical instrument, a
negotiation which started in 1993 came to an end," the Venezuelan
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

participation of the fishing sectors, the statement added. The
new agreement will replace the one signed in 1990, which expired
on December 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The new document will define the juridical framework that will
guarantee the access of some 100 Venezuelan fishing ships to
exploit marine life resources in oceanic territories under
Suriname's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
It also re-activates the institutional mechanism set by the

</P>
<P>
"A satisfactory balance between the interests of both countries
is desirable, so that both countries will receive optimal social
and economic benefits from the sustainable exploitation and use of
resources from the sea," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the fishing operations of the Venezuelan ships, the
agreement also provides for greater cooperation in terms of marine

<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian government
will pay 1.67 million U.S. dollars in compensation to families
affected by the U.S. invasion in 1989, according to a government
source.
</P>
<P>
The source said on Wednesday that 3,341 families that lost
family members and suffered material damages during the U.S.
bombing on the El Chorrillo neighborhood on the western outskirts
of the capital, will get compensated.
</P>
<P>
At midnight on December 20, 1989 U.S. troops mounted large-
scale attacks on Panamanian military targets aimed at toppling
General Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is now in jail in the U.S. on
drug-dealing charges.
</P>
<P>
During the combats, the El Chorrillo neighborhood, near
Noriega's former headquarters, was totally destroyed with hundreds
of people killed.
</P>
<P>
A human rights organization said the death toll well exceeded
1,000, but U.S. military authorities recognized only 300 victims,
military or civilian.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth compensation payment given by the Ernesto
Perez Balladares government.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the legislative commission on budget approved an
extraordinary credit in the order of 1.8 million dollars for the
government to pay for the compensation.
</P>
<P>
Before the end of his tenure, the Perez Balladares government
will pay last two other compensation quotas pledged to residents
of El Chorrillo, amounting to 3,500 dollars per affected
individual.

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier Urges Leftists to Back Him in Budget Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
urged leftist allies to stop confronting the government over the
1999 draft budget, which he firmly defended before parliament on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a Lower House debate set to end on Friday with a
confidence vote in the government, Prodi made an appeal to
hardline Secretary General of the Communist Refoundation party
Fausto Bertinotti to drop his rejection of the budget bill.
</P>
<P>
"This government was and is the one wanted by Communist
Refoundation voters," he said, "and I ask you, Bertinotti, in the
name of all those who voted for us, to turn back and reconsider."
</P>
<P>
The Communists, at their weekend meetings, voted to withhold
its vital support for the budget package, sparking concerns for
the survival of Prodi's 28-month administration, the only
left-leaning coalition in post-war Italy.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said Bertinotti's choice was "incomprehensible" since he
was opposing a budget containing many measures to help the poor
and unemployed.

<P>
Communist deputies in the Lower House are sharply divided on
the issue. Party Chairman Armando Cossutta announced his
resignation on Monday in protest against Bertinotti's hardline
stance.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Communist Refoundation party, up
to 21 of the 34 Communist deputies are likely to join Cossutta in
support of Prodi in the confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
Prodi relies on the backing of the Communists to keep his
premiership. If he fails to win enough votes in parliament on
Friday, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could call new elections or
ask another leading figure to form a new majority and government.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Forced Landing to Be Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Last month's successful
emergency landing of a Chinese passenger plane at the Shanghai
Hongqiao Airport will be adapted into a movie.
</P>
<P>
"The production will be the first disaster movie made by
Chinese filmmakers," according to Director Zhang Jianya.
</P>
<P>
Today's Wenhui Daily reported that the Shanghai Film Studio
will produce the film which will be written by a scriptwriter from
the Beijing Film Academy.
</P>
<P>
The September 10 forced landing involved the No.1273 MD-11
aircraft operated by China Eastern Airlines. The plane departed
Hongqiao bound for Beijing at 19:38 in the evening, with pilots
discovering a landing gear problem shortly after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
The Hongqiao control tower granted approval for an emergency
landing. Two attempted touchdowns failed and the plane circled the
airport for three hours before running out of fuel and forcing the
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
The plane was carrying 120 passengers and 17
crew. Miraculously, only 9 passengers suffered superficial
injuries.
</P>
<P>
The forced landing has been cited as one of the miracles in
aviation history worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who is currently gathering background information at
Hongqiao, said the production will involve the extensive use of
visual effects and computer technology.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Drops From Top Causes of Deaths in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Death rate from AIDS dropped
by 47 percent in a year in the United States, indicating that
multidrug cocktails are effective in keeping the virus suppressed,
the U.S. government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Center for Health Statistics reported that AIDS
dropped from the eighth most common cause of death in 1996 to the
14th in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Among people 25 to 44 years old, the group hardest hit by HIV
infection, AIDS dropped to the fifth-leading cause of death in
1997 from the leading cause in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Today's report is very good news for the nation, and the
tremendous decline in AIDS deaths is particularly striking," Donna
Shalala, secretary of health and human services, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"These figures mean that new treatments have been very
effective in extending the lives of people who already have HIV
infection, Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
However, "they do not mean we have significantly reduced HIV
transmission," she said. "Our ultimate goal is to prevent the
estimated 40,000 new HIV infections that occur each year."
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the infant mortality rate fell to 7.1
deaths per 1,000 live births from 7.2 deaths per 1,000 live births
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that last year, 864.9 people died for every
100,000 in the nation, down from 872.5 per 100,000 in 1996. Heart
disease and cancer are the top causes for deaths.
</P>
<P>
The statistics indicate that children born in 1997 can expect
to live 76.5 years, compared with 76.1 for children born in 1996,
according to the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Military personnel and a
government official may have been involved in a mysterious murder
spree of more than 100 people in Indonesia's East Java province,
the Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the leader of the provincial chapter of the
Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) Muslim organization Hasyim Muzadi as saying
that two members of the armed forces and a village chief were
suspects in the killings.
</P>
<P>
The alleged involvement of a village official was reported by
NU's investigation team, while the alleged involvement of the two
military personnel was explained by Regional Military Chief Maj.
Gen. Djoko Subroto on Saturday. Hasyim told about 100 NU
executives in the provincial capital of Surabaya on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-three victims have been confirmed in Bangyuwangi regency
since August. It was reported that in September, similar killings
took place on Madura, an island off East Java, where a number of
people had been killed. Eight people have been found dead in
similar circumstances in Jember regency recently.
</P>
<P>
Banyuwangi is a regency 280 kilometers east of Surabaya with a
population of 1.5 million people. The regency capital, Banyuwangi,
is a coastal town. Jember is about 105 kilometers west of
Bangyuwangi.
</P>
<P>
Banyuwangi and Jember are predominantly Muslim areas rooted in
the Nadhlatul Ulama (NU) tradition. NU is the country's largest
Muslim organization.
</P>
<P>
East Java Police chief Maj. Gen. M. Dayat has said he suspected
a mysterious murder spree in several towns was the result of an
"organized crime."
</P>
<P>
The police and the military are currently sheltering 277 people
who fear they may be targets.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Citizens Say Farewell To Popular Stove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The "Tiger stove", which has
provided boiled water for the people of Shanghai's neighborhoods
for some 200 years, is gradually fading away.
</P>
<P>
The stove gets its name because of its bulky shape and a
chimney like a tiger's tail.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1900s, there were no thermoses available in
Shanghai, and people went to neighborhood shops to get boiled
water. But, even after thermoses began to appear, the shops were
still popular because most households used briquet stoves.
</P>
<P>
One used to be able to see a great number of these shops
scattered along the streets of the city, but most of them have
been demolished as households move into highrise apartment
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Hu Hongmei, who still runs one of these "tiger stove" shops,
says that people now use gas stoves and fewer of them come to her
shop for boiled water. The lack of customers is a major cause of
the disappearance of "tiger stoves". Hu says she makes about 20
yuan a day now and plans to close the business after some regular
customers living nearby move to a new apartment building next year.
</P>
<P>
A negative effect of the popular old stoves, according to a
Shanghai environmental protection department official, was that
they polluted the environment. The coal and wood that fueled them
used to pile up on the streets and produced an enormous amount of
dust, he explains.
</P>
<P>
The stoves also produce a large number of sulphur dioxide, the
official said, and said that removing them was one of the major
steps of the Municipal People's Government to reduce waste gas.

<P>
HOHHOT, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Twenty years of afforestation in
northern China have begun to pay off as about five million
hectares of desert and wasteland become green again with
windbreaks and forest belts and four million hectares are covered
with forests that hold the water and soil.
</P>
<P>
One million hectares of farmland have begun to produce good
yields and another two million are pastureland.
</P>
<P>
The 'Northern, Northwestern, and Northeastern China Shelter
Forest Project' began in 1978 as the world's largest ecological
program, on a more than 10-million hectare area.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has benefited most because
about a third of the project involves the region, where drought
and strong winds keep trees from growing, forcing scientists to
apply more advanced afforestation technology.
</P>
<P>
The project has brought over 3.56 billion yuan worth of
forestry products and has helped to establish 60 factories for
processing these products.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to cover another one million hectares
of land by 2000.

<P>
GENEVA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Top seeds Pete Sampras of the
United States and Patrick Rafter of Australia both crashed out in
the first round of the Swiss Indoors tennis tournament in Basel
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, Wimbledon Open champion, was edged out by South

Rafter was eliminated in straight sets by Czech Daniel Vacek.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed," said Sampras, who received a wildcard
in Basel in an effort to finish as world No. 1 in the rankings
this year. "It can't get much worse than this."

<P>
In the day other upset, two-time U.S. Open champion Rafter
lost 7-6 (9-7), 7-5 to the 44th-ranked Vacek.
</P>
<P>
Sampras' and Rafter's elimination marks the exit of the

<HEADLINE> Vieira Facing FA Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal midfielder Patrick
Vieira was charged with misconduct on Wednesday by the English
Football Association following their recent controversial game
with Sheffield Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The French international is alleged to have made gestures
towards the crowd following Wednesday's victory and been involved
in a separate incident in the players' tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Teammate Martin Keown has, however, escaped punishment after
being sent off in the same game in later September.
</P>
<P>
Keown and Wednesday's Paolo Di Canio were both given their
marching orders by referee Paul Alcock at Hillsborough after a
brawl broke out on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old England defender appealed against his sending
off, saying that he had only been acting as a "peacemaker" and
had tried to prevent Di Canio from getting to Vieira.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally I am delighted with the outcome of the hearing. I
was greatly helped by the presence of David Dein, Arsene Wenger
and Gordon Taylor," said Keown.
</P>
<P>
"The FA investigated the matter very thoroughly and I would
like to thank them for the fairness they have displayed. I
believe they took my view that my intentions were that of a
peacemaker. Now I feel as if a weight has been lifted off my
shoulders."
</P>
<P>
Di Canio has been suspended by Wednesday for pushing Alcock to
the ground and will also face an FA misconduct charge but
Keown,backed by the Professional Footballers' Association and his
manager Arsene Wenger, has been told that "no further punishment"
would be imposed against him.
</P>
<P>
A FA statement said: "The commission accepted the view of
referee Paul Alcock that he had seen the arm of Martin Keown make
contact with Paolo Di Canio's face prior to both players being
sent off.
</P>
<P>
"The commission studied various video recordings of the
incident. They were not convinced Martin Keown had acted
deliberately. The sending off will stand, but the commission has
decided that no further punishment will be appropriate, " it
said.

<HEADLINE> Net TVs to Edge Out PCs in American Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 7 (Xinhua) -- It has been the dream of
Bill Gates to have the PC on every desk in the United States, but
that's not going to happen, according to a new study released this
week.
</P>
<P>
Inteco, a U.S. market researcher focusing on consumers'
prosperity to adopt new technologies, said that the future of home
computing does not lie in expensive multimedia computers, but more
likely in some type of Internet TV.
</P>
<P>
Inteco's study shows that by 2003, set-top boxes will be able
to provide limited Internet access for a fraction of the cost of a
PC, leaving American consumers with less of a reason to invest in
a pricey desktop or notebook system.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of American households with PCs will grow
from 45.1 million in 1998 to 54.7 million in 2003, most of that
growth is derived from households with more than one computer, not
new users, according to Inteco.
</P>
<P>
The actual number of American households with PCs will only
grow from 44.8 million in 1998 to 52.7 million in 2003. This
presents a problem for the PC industry, Inteco said, because
dwindling prices and profit margins need to be offset by high
volumes.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of American households do not own a PC and
have no interest in purchasing a computer, the study found,
because they still see no crucial use for a home computer.
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that the PC industry has not yet
provided a compelling application for high-end PCs, said Inteco,
adding that "the PC industry can try and bring back the high-end
PC, but there isn't any new application that is driving the specs
higher."
</P>
<P>
Instead, limited local news, sports and weather information via
cable television or set-top box will likely captivate both PC and
non-PC households alike, Inteco said.
</P>
<P>
As many American households own more than one PC, home
computing could be stimulative for new chip making. Recent surveys
have shown that sharing Internet communications and printers are
two critical needs for home computer users in the United States.
To meet the needs, the Silicon Valley-based Lucent Technologies
has released a new chip family that will allowing home users to
share printers, files and Internet access.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Says Its Economy Immune to Russia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's Prime Minister
Viktor Orban said Wednesday that Central Europe is no longer
economically tied to Moscow and is avoiding fallout from Russia's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are very calm, relaxed and waiting for NATO memberships,"
Orban, 35, who took office in July said after meeting U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, meeting with Orban in the White House, said he does
not expect Hungary to be involved in military action in Kosovo
because "what is contemplated" is air strikes, not ground action.
</P>
<P>
Hungary hosts a major supply base for U.S.-led NATO military
peacekeeping operations in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Orban said Hungary, which is due to become a NATO member next
year, seeks a non-military end to violence in the Serb state, "but
if a decision is taken by NATO, we are ready to contribute as an
ally. We are ready to take part."
</P>
<P>
After meeting World Bank President James Wolfensohn, Orban said
the Russian crisis may provide a boon for Central Europe as a
secure haven for investments that might have gone to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia are
likely to grow at a faster rate than either Russia or the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
He said Hungary will pursue policies of predictability,
economic growth, balance and transparency.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing Russia, Orban said its real crisis is systemic rather
than either economic or social. He predicted a country without
effective government for years to come.
</P>
<P>
"That will be a major obstacle to aid," he said. "Without
government, it's unreasonable to give support."
</P>
<P>
He projected 5 percent growth for Hungary's economy this year,
adding that while this is a percentage point lower than expected,
it still is strong enough to demonstrate immunity to Russia's
problems.
</P>
<P>
Orban also projected reductions in the country's deficit, from
4.7 percent this year to 4 percent next year, and in inflation,
from 12 percent to less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orban appealed to American and other potential investors in
Central Europe to separate Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and
Slovenia from other former Soviet satellites.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to restore favorable circumstances for
competition," he said. Hungary's success would become more obvious
in a year, Orban predicted.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economic Crisis Cuts Immigration to Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of immigrants to
Canada is expected to drop by about 20,000 this year due to Asia's
severe economic crisis, the Canadian government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Canada is expected to receive between 180,000 and 200,000
immigrants this year, less than the planned number of 200,000 to
225,000.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason the desired levels for 1998 were not reached
was the severe economic crisis in Asia," Minister of Citizenship
and Immigration Lucienne Robillard told the parliament while
tabling the country's 1999 immigration plan.
</P>
<P>
Most of Canada's immigrants in recent years have come from
Asia, she said. "But the current fiscal uncertainty and roller
coaster stock markets have caused many people to think twice about
plans to emigrate."
</P>
<P>
"This is well demonstrated in the fact that we had
approximately 15,000 visas wasted this year. That is 15,000 people
who were approved to come to Canada but decided at the last minute
not to," Robillard noted.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government is keeping the same forecast for 1999.
The desired levels of immigrants remain the same: between 200,000
and 225,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"Canada wants to make it very clear to the international
community that its doors are still just as wide open, despite a
difficult economic situation," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we will see the Asian financial markets
stabilize and the immigration numbers rise again in the coming
year," she added.

<HEADLINE> UK Central Bank Warns of Possible Euro Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England (BoE) has
warned the European Union against possible financial market
turmoil when the euro is launched next year, issuing a call on
central bankers across the 15-nation bloc to make contingency
plans.
</P>
<P>
In a report sent to the European Commission, the BoE noted that
the weekend of the euro's introduction, covering December 31 to
January 4, would be one of "greater than normal operational risk
for Europe's firms and financial infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented nature of forging a single currency among 11
European nations on January 1, 1999 meant the possibility of
insufficient preparations in the financial community to prevent
large-scale payment problems or speculation over the stability of
certain firms.
</P>
<P>
"If the final preparations for the introduction of the euro go
awry, central banks and regulators might have to manage a
potentially difficult situation," Reuters quoted the report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
As concern has intensified over the stability of leading
international banks, the report entitled "The Conversion Weekend:
What Could Go Wrong" cited risks for Europe's financial
institutions, highlighting four main areas of concern:
</P>
<P>
-- "Firms could experience shortages of liquidity because they
do not receive payments they expect, or cannot execute financing
transactions in securities, such as repos.
</P>
<P>
-- Payments and securities transactions fail to settle, which
could in turn cause further settlement failures as firms are left
short of cash or securities. This could lead to increasing or
unexpectedly prolonged exposure to settlement risk.
</P>
<P>
-- Firms are unable to trade, causing or prolonging exposure to
market movements. This would be significant in view of the
following point.
</P>
<P>
-- If the above problems become widespread, there could be
speculation, whether rational or not, for example over the future
of individual firms, or over the start of the EMU. This could
cause volatile and disorderly markets, including in the new euro
currency and FX markets."
</P>
<P>
The Bank's detailed warnings to the EU are similar to the
concerns expressed by major international banks in London, many of
whom believe that the euro's birth will be more difficult than is
generally perceived.
</P>
<P>
A group of 31 leading banks, called the Heathgrow Group, was
formed during the summer to tackle unresolved issues relating to
the euro's creation. The focus has been on payment and settlement
issues, with many warning there was insufficient coordination and
leadership in these critical areas.
</P>
<P>
For individual firms, the BoE said the potential risk of not
being able to trade because of systems failures could lead to
liquidity shortages, and if such a situation became severe, a loss
of confidence could arise among investors.
</P>
<P>
"Settlement risks could build up uncontrollably between
counterparties as chains of settlement failures developed...This
kind of situation could begin to threaten systemic stability if it
occurred at a number of firms at once," the Bank said.
</P>
<P>
For central bankers, the task was to ensure that they were well
prepared to manage such a crisis should it arise.
</P>
<P>
"The concentration of risk over this period means that each
individual central bank and regulator may wish to ensure they
would have the ability to cope with a serious problem at that
time," the Bank said. "The scope of the risk, covering as it does
the whole of Europe (and indeed elsewhere), means that regulators
and central banks may wish to plan how they would provide a swift,
decisive and co-ordinated response."

<HEADLINE> Romania, True Factor of Peace, Stability: Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Romania is a true factor of
peace and stability in the region, Leni Fischer, the visiting
president of the Council of Europe' Parliamentary Assembly, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Leni Fischer, who arrived in Bucharest Tuesday for a three-day
visit, made the remark in her speech at the festivity of the
Romanian Parliament, marking five years since the Balkan country
has been integrated with the Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly appreciates
appropriately Romania's efforts for keeping relations of good
neighborliness and cooperation with all the neighbors on the basis
of bilateral treaties and confidence measures," she said, adding
that she was attending the meeting "in order to encourage" Romania
to overcome the difficulties it was facing.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of
Europe said the monitoring procedure ceased last year as a result
of Romania's will and capability for striving for democracy, human
rights and pre-eminence in law.
</P>
<P>
Leni Fischer said that after a "full right integration" with
the Council of Europe five years ago, Romania got over the
necessary stages to win the confidence and respect of the members
of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Romania's democratic evolution in the last years, carefully
watched by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe,
confirmed Romania's wish to strengthen the values promoted by the
Council of Europe and essential to the construction of today's
Europe, Leni Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the signing and ratification by Romania of the
most important legal instruments that had been worked out by the
Council of Europe, among which were the framework-Convention on
the protection of national minorities and the European Charter on
local autonomy, showed once again Romania's intention and
capability for actively participating in the construction of
tomorrow's Europe.
