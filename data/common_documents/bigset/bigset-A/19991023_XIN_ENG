ANKARA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is expected to pay a one-day working visit to Turkey next

</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said Barak
will first travel to quake-stricken Adapazar, 150 kilometers east
of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, for a ceremony opening
Israeli-donated prefabricated homes that will provide shelter to
nearly 2,500 quake victims.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Farm Emergency Assistance Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed Friday into a law a record 8.7-billion-U.S.-dollar package
of emergency assistance to compensate farmers for depressed
commodity prices and weather-related crop losses.
</P>
<P>
The money is contained in a bill of 69 billion dollars that
will fund operations of the Agriculture Department and related
agencies for the 2000 budget year started on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The first assistance checks will be going to farmers in two to
three weeks, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton agreed to sign the legislation despite his
administration's reservations that some of the aid will be going
to large farms and landowners who don't need the money, Glickman
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wants to develop an alternative way to distribute
future aid that would target the money to "family-size"
operations, Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money in the measure, about 6 billion dollars, is
intended to help grain, cotton and soybean farmers cope with a
second year of low commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The measure also provides 1.4 billion dollars for
weather-related crop and livestock losses, including 200 million
dollars earmarked for Eastern livestock producers who were hurt by
this summer's drought; 400 million dollars in crop-insurance
discounts; 328 million dollars to compensate tobacco producers for
falling cigarette sales; and 125 million dollars in subsidies for
dairy producers.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Lawyers Lodge Fresh Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers for General Augusto
Pinochet Friday appealed against a British magistrate's ruling
that the former Chilean leader should be extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
The appeal for a writ of habeas corpus, to investigate the
lawfulness of the ruling, is being lodged at the High Court in
London.
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm that we are making an application for permission
to seek a writ of habeas corpus," Pinochet's lawyer Michael Caplan
was quoted by a BBC report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Bow Street Magistrates' Court in central London
committed Pinochet on 35 torture charges to allow his extradition
to Spain.
</P>
<P>
General Pinochet, 83, who was arrested a year ago, immediately
declared he was innocent of the crimes and challenged Spain's
right to put him on trial.
</P>
<P>
Friday's appeal, lodged on the very last day of the 15-day
deadline for making such applications under British law, is
setting off a new round of legal battle in the year-old case.
</P>
<P>
If the High Court rejects the appeal, a further appeal could
then be made to the House of Lords, Britain's top court, before
the case goes before British Home Secretary Jack Straw for a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
These further proceedings might last months more.

<HEADLINE> EU Starts Inquiry Into Leased Line Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Friday it has started a broad investigation regarding the
conditions of provision and pricing of leased lines.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) said questionnaires have been sent to
EU member states' competition authorities, telecommunications
regulators, incumbent operators, new entrants who provide or use
leased lines and big business users. Recipients have a six-week
deadline to reply, it added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first of three areas of telecommunications to be
examined following the Commission's decision to open a sector
inquiry in the communications sector across the European Union,
the EU executive said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission on July 27 decided to open inquiries into the
telecommunications sector relating to the provision and pricing of
leased lines, mobile roaming services and the provision of access
to and use of the residential local loop.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the inquiries will involve
requesting information from incumbent fixed network operators,
mobile network operators, a number of newly authorized fixed
telecommunications network operators, as well as large business
users and concerned EU members states' authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said it is aware that leased line tariffs remain
high despite the creation of competing infrastructure by new
entrants.
</P>
<P>
The International Telecommunications Users Association recently
compared leased lines tariffs applied by incumbent operators
across the EU, the Commision said. The survey indicates that
cross-border tariffs are at more than 120 percent of national
tariffs in all EU countries, and in some cases are as much as 500
percent of the national tariff.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said it also received informal complaints of
alleged discriminatory pricing and treatment, delays of delivery
or quality of service.

<P>
ATHENS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece Friday asked the Doctors
Without Borders to reconsider its decision on the expulsion of its
Greek branch for sending doctors to Serbia during NATO's bombing
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Describing this as "unpleasant," Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the international organization would be
asked to reconsider its decision.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government had worked effectively with the Greek
branch, which must be allowed to continue offering its valuable
services, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Doctors Without Borders, the medical relief group which won the
1999 Nobel Peace prize, has expelled its Greek branch for
unsanctioned mission to help Serbs During the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Greek branch said the Greek team did
nothing more than follow the organization's charter to help
warring sides regardless of their ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Greek group, Odysseus Voudouris, said
Thursday that they would continue with their own title because
they had an obligation to continue and to expand their relief
missions.

<P>
NEW YORK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. stock holders
increased to 78.7 million early this year from 42.5 million in
1983 when investors enjoyed the long bull market, says a survey
carried in the New York Times Friday.
</P>
<P>
The survey by the Investment Company Institute and the
Securities Industry Association, says among households, 48.2
percent now own stock directly or through mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows much americans are relying on stocks to
reach retirement and other financial goals. The typical
stockholder is 47 years old and lives in a household with annual
income of 60,000 U.S. dollars and total assets of 85,000
dollars, says the survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey says among the stock holders, most are married
college graduates. 53 percent have individual retirement
accounts and 80 percent have employer-sponsored pension plans,
it adds.
</P>
<P>
The survey says, 22 percent of people with stock mutual
funds own shares in seven or more stock funds and 26 percent own
four to six funds, suggesting they may have taken
diversification a little too far.
</P>
<P>
Somewhat surprisingly, the survey says, the South, not the
Northeast, has the biggest concentration of stock investors.
Thirty-three percent of stockholders live in the South, 26
percent in the Midwest, 25 percent in the West and 16 percent in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
The survey says the stock-owning population is 90 percent
white, 5 percent black, 2 percent Asia, 5 percent Hispanic and 2
percent "other." Forty eight percent of stockholders are baby
boomer, it says.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland expelled Maurice
Papon out of the country by flight to France at about 15:30 GMT
Friday, announced Swiss federal councillor and justice minister
Ruth Metzler.
</P>
<P>
The 89-year-old Papon, the former pro- Nazi Vichy official who
fled France to escape court trial for his role in sending Jews to
Nazi death camps, was arrested early on Friday in the Swiss
Bernese Oberland by Swiss policy on an international arrest
warrant issued the previous day in Bordeaux, France, after Papon
failed to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of France in Paris ruled that Papon lost his
right of appeal by failing to report to prison as required before
Thursday's hearing. Under French law, the court ruling
automatically confirms the conviction and it can no longer be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
Papon was convicted in April 1998 for complicity in crimes
against humanity for his role in the deportation of 1,590 Jews
from the city of Bordeaux. Most of the deportees later perished at
Auschwitz.

<HEADLINE> UK Enjoys Strongest Economy Growth For Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's economic recovery
continues to pick up pace with the latest official output figures
released Friday showing stronger than expected growth.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) provisionally
estimated gross domestic product in the three months to the end of
September was up 0.9 percent on the previous quarter- the biggest
increase for two years.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate was estimated by the ONS at 1.8 percent.
The figures mean the UK economy is now growing at its fastest rate
for two years.
</P>
<P>
The British economy has expanded for 29 quarters in a row,
since the second quarter of 1992. Since then, GDP has risen 22.3
percent with services up 28.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed here that the data could sway the Bank
of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) towards another
interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
If growth is felt to be too fast, the MPC will be quick to act
to cool any build up of inflationary pressures, recommending
another increase in the Bank's base rate.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, the main motor of economic growth in
Britain in recent years, was particularly buoyant, rising by 1.0
percent on the quarter and 2.6 percent on the year.
</P>
<P>
Within the sector, retail and catering activities were up,
while communications and computing performed particularly
strongly.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the production and construction industries was
estimated to have been similar to that in the previous three
months. Both were up 0.6 percent quarter on quarter.
</P>
<P>
A Treasury spokesman said: "These highly preliminary growth
figures show the economy has continued to grow throughout the year
as we create a platform for stability."

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Chinese President Arrives in Lyon for State Visit to France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
arrived here Friday afternoon for a state visit to France at the
invitation of French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
This is Jiang's second visit to France over the past five years
and also the second leg of his six-nation tour of Europe, Africa
and Asia. He has just paid a five-day state visit to Britain, the
first time for a head of state of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said in a written statement delivered at
the airport that compared with his first visit to France five
years ago, the international situation has undertaken new changes
and the Sino-French relationship has also obtained new development.
</P>
<P>
The mankind is approaching the 21st century. The world's multi-
polarization and economic globlization are continuing to develop,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"At this important moment of history, China and France, both
as countries that have made important contributions to the
progress of civilization of the mankind, and big countries that
have shouldered important responsibilities for current
international affairs, should continue to make joint efforts to
undertake the sacred cause of pushing forward the peace and
development of the mankind," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said he is looking forward to, together
with French leaders, summarizing up the fruits of cooperation the
two countries have achieved in political, economic, cultural and
technological sectors in recent years, and also to having overall
and in-depth exchange of ideas on the current international
situation and major international issues.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he hopes his visit will push further forward the
bilateral cooperation and cooperation over international affairs
and achieve the goal of deepening understanding, enhancing mutual
trust and promoting cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and his wife, Wang Yeping, were greeted at the airport by
senior French officials. Chinese Ambassador Wu Jianmin and his
wife, as well as representatives from the local Chinese
institutions, overseas Chinese and Chinese students studying here,

<TEXT>
<P>
CAMBRIDGE, Britain, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The following is the
full text of a speech delivered by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
at the University of Cambridge on Friday.
</P>
<P>
 Speech by President Jiang Zemin of the People's
Republic
</P>
<P>
 of China at University of Cambridge
</P>
<P>
22 October 1999
Sir Alec Broers, Students and Faculty, Ladies and Gentlemen:
</P>
<P>
I would like to thank you, Sir Alec Broers, Vice-Chancellor,
for the invitation, which brings me to the famous Cambridge
University. It gives me great pleasure to be together with young
friends in a discussion on how mankind should rise up to the
challenge in the new century and build a better future.
</P>
<P>
Cambridge University is a world-renowned university with a
history of more than 700 years. It has nurtured great scientists,
thinkers and poets such as Newton, Bacon, Milton, Byron and Darwin,
who made outstanding contribution to the progress of mankind.
Today, Cambridge University, which has produced more Nobel Prize
winners than any other university, still takes a significant place
among all the institutions of higher learning in the world.
</P>
<P>
Over fifty years ago when I was a university student, many
young Chinese students were longing for an opportunity to come and
study in Cambridge. This university began its contacts with China
as early as the beginning of the last century. A hundred years ago,
Cambridge started the Chinese language course. The late Dr. Joseph
Needham of Cambridge University enjoyed a high prestige in the
Chinese academic circles. He devoted his entire life to the
writing of Science and Civilization in China, a monumental work
for study on ancient Chinese science and technology and cultural
achievements. For 100 years, many Chinese scholars, best
represented by Mr. Hua Luogeng, an outstanding Chinese
mathematician, have traveled long distances to study in Cambridge.
Today, the Chinese academic community still maintains good
exchanges and cooperation with Cambridge. This has played a
positive role in and exerted a sound influence on enhanced
cultural exchanges and friendship between the Chinese and British
people and progress in science and technology as well as in
thinking.
</P>
<P>
In the 20th century, mankind has created material and spiritual
wealth unmatched by any other time in history. Regrettably, it is
also in these 100 years that humanity has experienced
unprecedented hardships, particularly the havoc of the two world
wars. However, it is always the people of the world that make and
write world history. In this sense, justice will inevitably
prevail over evil, light over darkness and progress over
backwardness. Mankind will undoubtedly keep on overcoming
difficulties and obstacles, blaze new trails and steadily move
forward to a better future. The 21st century is approaching. The
people of the world still face many tough challenges, but
definitely they also see enormous opportunities for development.
So long as the people of the world work in unison and form a
strong force to tackle all challenges, mankind with its
civilization will continue to march forward against all odds. like
a ship braving the wind and the waves.
</P>
<P>
The world is colorful and diversified. People of different
countries have traversed different roads of historical development.
Each nation with its own cultural background, social system and
value, will continue to lead a life in its own way. This diversity
is the very reason why the world is full of competition, vigor and
innovation. Countries should enhance exchanges and understanding,
and move ahead together on the basis of mutual respect and
equality. They should not allow the diversity to be a barrier to
their forward march, still less should they deliberately provoke
confrontation and conflict. To respect and develop the diversity
of world civilization and identify therefrom common interests are
a great driving force propelling human society forward.
</P>
<P>
Here, I want to share with you some of my thoughts on China's
development, in the hope that it will give you a better
understanding of my country.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China has just celebrated its 50th
anniversary. Fifty years are but a brief moment for Chinese
civilization that has been going on for more than 5,000 years.
However, in the past 50 years, earth-shaking changes have taken
place on this ancient Chinese land. It has taken on a completely
new look. China in modern history was a semi-colonial and semi-
feudal society. It was weak, feeble and fell a prey to foreign
invasion, with lots of land annexed and its people plunged into an
abyss of misery. The Chinese people fought tenaciously to change
their miserable destiny. From the middle of the last century to
that of this century, the Chinese people went through setbacks and
defeat in their struggles, but they never yielded. Finally, under
the leadership of the Communist Party of China, they won national
independence and liberation and founded New China. From then on
China entered a completely new era of development in its history.
The Chinese people of all ethnic groups, who have taken their
destiny in their own hands and enjoy independence, unity, peace
and stability, are now able to devote all their energy to the
cause of building up their country and realize the lofty ideal of
national rejuvenation. They deeply cherish their hard-won right to
be masters of the country and the right past to development, that
is ,building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is a
road they have found after years of difficult exploration. Both
history and realities tell us that only by adhering to all this
can China obtain a sustainable development and the Chinese people
lead a happy life.
</P>
<P>
Our strenuous efforts in the past 50 years have brought about a
substantial boost in the overall national strength and social
productivity and a marked improvement of people's livelihood. From
1952 to 1998, China's GDP grew at an average annual rate of 7.7%,
much higher than the world average of 3% in the same period. Its
economic aggregates are the 7th largest in the world, its foreign
exchange reserves the second largest, and its total foreign trade
volume the 11th largest. In the past two decades, the poverty-
stricken population in its rural areas has been reduced by more
than 200 million, and more than 95% of farmers have got enough and
to spare. Life expectancy has increased from 35 years prior to the
founding of New China to the current 71. The illiteracy rate among
adults has dropped from 80% to 16.5%. Remarkable achievements have
been scored in both the material and spiritual civilization. Gone
forever are the days in which China was poor and weak. There are
comments from world opinion: "It has taken China only on
generation to achieve what would have taken other countries
several centuries to accomplish". What China has accomplished has
not only laid a solid foundation for its future development, but
also constituted enormous contribution to peace and stability of
Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
The reason why China can achieve so much in the short space of
several decades lies with the unprecedented unity that the people
of all ethnic groups have attained under the leadership of the CPC.
It can also be attributed to the road of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics that the Chinese people have found and to
the inspiration that the Chinese nation has drawn from its fine
tradition and culture as well as the spirit of the new era. A
nation without a spirit to support it has no future. To have a
good understanding of what has happened and what will happen in
China, it is absolutely necessary to know the basic Chinese values.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese nation has always valued human dignity and value.
Even in the ancient days, our ancestors came up with the idea of
people being most important, believing that "man is the most
valuable among all the things that heaven fosters". Progress and
development of a society hinge on human progress and development
and depend on how well human dignity is maintained and how much
human value is realized. The Communist Party of China has lead the
Chinese people in carrying out revolution, development and reform
precisely for the purpose of ensuring the entire Chinese people
broad freedoms, democracy and human rights. The immense vitality
displayed by China today is a vivid reflection of the broad
freedoms and democratic rights enjoyed by the Chinese people.
China's population reached around 60 million as early as in the
1st century. For several thousand years, to provide for the people
's need for food, clothing, housing and transport has all along
been the primary human rights challenge for successive governments
in Chinese history. In today's China, which is a large developing
country with a population of over 1.2 billion, top priority should
still be given to ensuring the greatest possible majority of its
people the rights to subsistence and development. Otherwise, there
would be no other rights to speak of. To ensure our people these
rights is in itself a major contribution to the progress of the
world human rights cause. Collective and individual human rights
have to go hand in hand and their coordinated development should
be pursued, so do economic, social and cultural rights on the one
hand and civil and political rights on the other. This is in
keeping with China's specific national conditions and is therefore
the only way to progress in the human rights cause in China. China
has been concentrating its resources on economic development,
promoting all-round social progress and persistently developing
socialist democracy and building a socialist country under the
rule of law. All this is aimed at promoting the cause of human
rights of the Chinese people. China has played an active part in
international activities in the human rights field, carried out
highly effective dialogues and cooperation with the rest of
international community on the question of human rights on the
basis of equality and mutual respect and hence made positive
contributions to progress in the global human rights cause.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation has persistently pursued an independent
national spirit and road to development. We, the Chinese people,
regard independence as the foundation on which to build the
country. We have created a splendid Chinese civilization by making
unremitting endeavor over five thousand years. We grew stronger by
relying on our own efforts in the struggle to resist foreign
aggression and gain national liberation in modern times and
finally became masters of our own destiny. Independence and self-
reliance should not rule out learning from other countries and
drawing upon the fruits of world civilization. The two are
complementary to each other. Our ancestors came to know this a
long time ago. In this respect, we have valuable historical
experience from the Han and Tang Dynasties. Those were periods of
prosperity when China strove to develop itself on its own, and
also periods when it learned extensively from foreign advanced
cultures in the process of actively conducting external exchanges.
Since the founding of New China, we Chinese people have persevered
in taking our own road and engaging in the economic, political and
cultural undertakings and turning our motherland into a socialist
country with initial prosperity. Meanwhile, we have earnestly
absorbed and drawn upon fruits of advanced world civilization,
which in turn have greatly promoted the development of China.
However, it must be pointed out that the absorption and learning
process is by no means one of simple imitation. China can not copy
the development model of Western capitalist countries, nor can it
mechanically follow other countries' models of building socialism.
On the contrary, it must take a road to development that is suited
to its national conditions. That is, the road to building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, which we have found
through long-term practice. The Chinese people will move forward
unswervingly along this road.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation has always valued the great unity of all the
ethnic groups and the reunification of the country. Since ancient
times, people of the 56 ethnic groups have toiled and multiplied
on the vast land of China. They have helped each other and learned
from each other over long years and thus formed a unitary multi-
ethnic country. The preservation of solidarity and unity of the
Chinese nation is the very foundation for the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation and is where the fundamental interests of
the people of all ethnic groups lie. Since the founding of New
China, regional autonomy has been practiced in places where ethnic
minorities live in compact communities. The rights and interests
of all the ethnic groups are protected by the Constitution.
Continued social and economic progress has been made in the
regions inhabited by ethnic minorities. The relations between
different ethnic groups based on equality, solidarity and mutual
help have grown stronger and stronger. The Chinese people of all
ethnic groups are firmly opposed to any attempt to split the
Chinese territory and sovereignty. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the great
forerunner of the Chinese democratic revolution and the founder of
the Kuomintang (the Nationalist Party), pointed out: "China is a
unitary country. This has already been deeply etched in its
historical identity. It is this identity that has kept us together
as one nation." The Chinese government has already resumed the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. Macau will return to the
embrace of the motherland on 20 December this year. It is the
unshakable will of all the Chinese people to ultimately resolve
the Taiwan question under the principle of "peaceful reunification,
one country two systems" and accomplish the great cause of
national reunification. On the settlement of the Taiwan question,
we do not undertake to renounce the use of force precisely for the
purpose of facilitating a peaceful settlement. The Chinese people
will certainly accomplish the complete reunification of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation always loves freedom and peace. The Chinese
people have always longed for peace prevailing across the world
and wish to live in harmony with the people of all the other
countries. "Benevolence and good-neighbourliness" were all along
regarded as a treasured maxim by our ancestors. In modern times,
the Chinese people suffered immensely from the scourge of war and
aggression, so now they feel all the more strongly the value of
freedom and peace. The nation-building and development of each and
every country requires a peaceful and stable international and
domestic environment. Freedom of a country and nation serves as a
precondition and basis for the freedom of all its individuals. It
is our hope that the people of all countries can live in a world
free from war and violence and free from suppression,
discrimination and bullying. China pursues a peace-oriented
foreign policy and adheres to the basic principles of mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-
aggression and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
China is of the view that countries with different social systems
should treat one another as equals and co-exist peacefully, and is
opposed to any attempt to impose in any form one's own political
system and ideology on other countries. A developed, strong and
prosperous China will pose no threat to anyone. It will only
promote world peace, stability and development. China will never
seek hegemony. This is a solemn commitment of the Chinese people
to the world.

The stability and development of China will provide good

<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
Mankind is again at an important historical juncture when it is
about to enter a new century and a new millennium. Since the end
of the Cold War, the world situation has, generally speaking,
moved towards relaxation. There has been an increasingly louder
call for peace, stability and development from people of the world.
Science and technology, which advance by leads and bounds, have
not only provided an unprecedented capacity for mankind to explore
and harness nature, but also opened up broad prospects for the
development of man's own ability. But the world is far from
tranquil, and world peace and development are still under threat
in one way or another. Power politics and hegemony still exist in
international political, economic and security realms and have
further asserted themselves. Regional conflicts have erupted one
after another. The gap in development between North and South
continues to widen. Mankind is plagued by trans-national problems
such as environmental degradation, arms proliferation,
international crimes and terrorism. If we fail to address these
major problems promptly, it will be difficult for the world to
develop further. With regard to what course to follow and how to
resolve these problems, the initiative is in the hands of the
people of the world. To help establish a just and rational new
international political and economic order is a task of vital
importance, a task that people of all countries and farsighted
statesmen have to ponder over in seriousness and with prudence.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard world peace and promote common development, all
countries must comply with the universally recognized basic norms
governing international relations, including the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-existence and the purposes and principles of the UN
Charter. The affairs of a country should be dealt with by the
people of that country, and international affairs should be
settled through consultation by all countries and regions
concerned. People of each country are entitled to choose
independently the social system and road to development suited to
their national conditions and to build their own lives. It is the
sacred right and glorious duty of the government and people of
each country to safeguard their state sovereignty and security.
All other countries and international organizations should respect
them and have no right to interfere. It is essential to transcend
the differences in social system and ideology in handling state-to-
state relations, work to seek convergence of common interests,
expand mutually-beneficial cooperation and strive for common
development. It is not right to model the world after one
political system or development mode. All countries should honor
the principle that the world is colorful and diversified, and
adopt a positive attitude of learning from each other to make up
for their respective deficiencies in the interest of common
development.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to adhere to the principle of equality and
mutual benefit in conducting international economic exchanges. In
formulating new rules guiding international economic activities
and trade, the reasonable demands of the vast number of developing
countries should be fully reflected, as they are under-developed
in terms of the economy and technology and at a disadvantage, and
attention should be paid to the protection of their legitimate
rights and interests. Following World War II, the people of many
countries under colonial rule were emancipated and won
independence. That was the greatest progress made by human society
in the 20th century. These countries still have a weak economic
foundation and are in the process of development. Should their
interests be ignored or even harmed, the world would not enjoy
stability, not to say universal prosperity. And there would emerge
a multitude of problems, risks, inequalities and irrationalities,
which would ultimately jeopardize the interest of developed
countries. It is our hope that the statesmen of all countries will
pay attention to the very urgent issue of gradually narrowing the
widening gap between North and South economically. This problem,
if not solved, is bound to inflict a big negative impact on the
steady growth of the global economy, and make it impossible for
mankind to achieve common development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
To maintain international security, it is essential to discard
the Cold-War mentality and work to build a lasting peace for the
international community on the basis of a new security concept
featuring promotion of mutual trust and common interests of all
countries. A security mechanism conducive to world peace and
stability and to peaceful development of all countries should
first be established through the concerted efforts of the
international community. Under it, no country should be allowed to
build its own so-called security at the expense of the security
interests of other countries. It is essential to build confidence
through dialogue, seek security through cooperation, respect each
other's sovereignty and settle disputes through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Confucius, an outstanding educator and thinker of China who was
born about 2,550 years ago, once said: "The passage of time is
just like the flow of water, which goes on day and night." The
lapse of time is irreversible. The 21st century is just around the
corner. The beautiful future of mankind will depend on the efforts
of young people generation after generation. It is my hope that
the youth of China and the UK will meet the needs of the times and
follow the tide of world development, study hard, move ahead in
defiance of difficulties and make their due contribution to the
development of their own countries, maintenance of world peace and
advancement of the cause of human progress. Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Missile Attack on Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday denied having
launched any rocket or artillery attack on downtown Grozny on
Thursday, but admitted that there had been "a special operation"
against arms dealing, with no civilian casualties, Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who was in the Finnish
capital of Helsinki to meet European Union leaders, said that
Thursday's explosions in a marketplace in the Chechen capital were
probably a showdown between rivaling rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
"That is a weapon base and an arms warehouse of terrorists
where bandit groups concentrate," he said, adding that Moscow
carried out a special operation to ward off terrorist acts there
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some Russian military officials clearly denied any rocket
attacks on Grozny.
</P>
<P>
"The claims of the Chechen side about the federal missile
attacks are complete invention. Formations of federal units did
not deliver a rocket strike at the center of Grozny during the
past 24 hours," said a duty officer at the headquarters of the
federal forces in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The reports "are another provocation designed by its
organizers to discredit Russian troops," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Drobyshevsky, chief of the Russian Air Force press
service, said that the federal combat aviation did not make
flights, and did not fly any mission over Grozny during the past
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The accusation of air raids on Grozny is yet another attempt
of the Chechen terrorists to mislead the Russian and world public,
so as to divert the public attention from their real plans, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alexander Veklich, chief of the joint press center
of the federal forces in the North Caucasus, said that a special
operation against arms dealers was conducted  Thursday in the
area of the Grozny marketplace.
</P>
<P>
"I want to stress that the operation was not conducted by
regular troops and did not involve artillery or aviation," he told
the ORT television channel.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether civilians were injured in the special operation,
Veklich said, "You know, at night civilians do not go to a market
where arms are sold to gangsters and terrorists, but stay at home.
So if there were victims, they were those who sell arms and
ammunition to rebels and those who support them."
</P>
<P>
He also denied rumors that the government building where
Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov has his office was damaged in the
operation.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Zdanovich, head of the public relations center of
the Federal Security Service, claimed that the federal troops had
nothing to do with the explosions in Grozny, stressing a
possibility of a spontaneous explosion of the ammunition, which
the terrorists piled and traded in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The operational command of Chechen armed forces claimed that a
surface-to-surface missile attack by Russian federal troops on a
marketplace in the center of Grozny on Thursday killed more than
100 people and wounded over 400, the Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted eye witnesses as saying that several seconds before
the explosions bright flares were seen in the sky north of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
"If the marketplace had indeed been shelled with surface-to-
surface missiles, the consequences would have been much more
serious than what the Chechens reported," said Colonel General
Vladislav Putilin, chief of the Organizing and Mobilization Board
in the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
"Because they do not control the city, federal units cannot
investigate what happened in the Grozny marketplace," he added.

TIRANA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Albania's foreign loans
increased by a big margin during the first nine months of this
year, bringing the country's total net foreign loans to 529.8
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of all the foreign loans, 324 million dollars is from
multilateral organizations, such as the World Bank and the
European Investment Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italy is Albania's largest creditor, which Albania
owes 183.5 million dollars in bilateral loan arrangements.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that Albania's foreign loans will further
increase because of stagnant production and economy.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Primakov Shuns Meeting for Lower Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reacted sharply to former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's
refusal to meet him, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin believes that Primakov, now leader of the powerful
Fatherland-All Russian election bloc, avoided the meeting because
of "some uncertainty, probably, a drop in the rating," Yakushkin
said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that the person who had expressed a wish to meet
with the head of state refused to attend the meeting," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening, Primakov told the independent NTV station
that he rejected the meeting as "inexpedient" because "the
president's entourage is pursuing a policy with which I do not
want to associate myself and cannot share."
</P>
<P>
In initial response, Yakushkin said Thursday that Primakov "
probably misunderstood" the source of the invitation.
</P>
<P>
It was Yeltsin who had invited him for the meeting rather than
"an inner circle," as Primakov might have thought, Yakushkin said.

<HEADLINE> EU, Russia to Intensify Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Top European Union leaders and
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin met here Friday for the
fourth EU-Russian summit and said they were ready to seek ways to
strengthen cooperation on the basis of bilateral agreements.
</P>
<P>
Both parties said in a joint statement issued after talks that
they welcomed the Common Strategy of the European Union on Russia
adopted in June 1999 by the European Council in Cologne and Russia
's Medium-term Strategy for developing relations with the EU for
2000-2010 which was officially presented by Putin at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The statement, inked by European Council President Paavo
Lipponen, European Commission President Romano Prodi, EU High
Representative Javier Solana and Putin, said both sides attach
importance to building a close political and economic partnership
and were ready to explore ways for further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the EU also reaffirmed its readiness to support
Russia's efforts to revive the economy by taking such steps as
improving investment climate, restructuring enterprises and
particularly the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed the willingness to promote continued
expansion of two-way trade and investment and stressed the
importance of Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to exchange views on the EU's accelerating
expansion process and seek cooperation in fighting criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after the talks, Lipponen
appreciated Russia's quick drafting of its strategy towards the EU
while Prodi called for closer political and economic ties between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The EU was also upset about the recent developments in the
region and urged Russia to seek political solutions through
dialogues.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister said that the situation in Chechnya
was a centerpiece in the talks. Russia will continue to make
effective efforts to fight terrorist activities in Chechnya and at
the same time to seek political solutions to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Putin arrived Thursday in Helsinki, capital of Finland, which
is the current EU president, in his first trip to Western Europe
after taking office in August.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Plant Project Boosts Russia-China Ties: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tianwan Nuclear Power
Station under construction in east China's coastal area is a very
good start for the Russia-China trade and economic cooperation, as
the future of the relationship depends on such super-sized
projects.
</P>
<P>
Igor Rogachev, Russian ambassador to Beijing, made the remark
here recently while attending a ceremony to mark the start of the
work in Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Construction began Wednesday on the Tianwan Nuclear Power
Station, the largest and most important cooperation project
between Russia and China, he said, adding that the Russian people
have been well informed about the project.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin exchanged letters of congratulation on the start of the
project, according to the ambassador. The two sides have expressed
the hope that the station will help strengthen the cooperation
regarding the peaceful use of nuclear energy, in order to further
support the smooth development of bilateral relations and the
partnership of equality and trust between the two nations,
Rogachev noted.
</P>
<P>
The Tianwan Nuclear Power Station, the largest of its kind in
China so far, is contracted by the Jiangsu Nuclear Power Co., Ltd.,
and eventually will have four pressurized water reactor generating
units, each with a capacity of one million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The project will be built in two phases. The first phase will
cost 3.2 billion U.S. dollars, including 2.5 billion U.S. dollars
in government loans from Russia. The first two units will be put
into operation in 2004 and 2005, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese are worried about the possible delay in
the shipment of Russian equipment, as 70 percent of the materials
for the plant will be supplied by Russia, a country that is
plagued with domestic economic problems. The internal problems of
Russian manufacturers may also affect the shipment, according to
some Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
But Russia's Vice-Minister of Nuclear Energy E.A. Reshetnikov
has ensured the Chinese that his country will do its best to
guarantee the shipment. His ministry is experienced and capable of
building modern nuclear power facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister hoped Russia could also help build the second
phase of the project. This project has resulted in the re-opening
of 700 Russian factories and created 220,000 job opportunities for
the country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ministry has signed a package cooperation deal with
its Chinese counterpart in the field of nuclear power generation,
the vice minister said. Currently, the two sides are negotiating
on the joint research of nuclear power generating units each with
a capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts, he disclosed.

<HEADLINE> S. African Currency Gains Ground on Dollar Selling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The South African rand
ended the session stronger against the U.S. dollar on Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said there was no particular reason for the currency
ending positive, but mentioned that there was interest to sell
dollars by offshore players.
</P>
<P>
The rand's strength also left some local dealers surprised
because the gold price continued its downward trend this
afternoon, testing levels below 302 dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
The local currency gained almost 1.25 cents Friday to last
trade at 6. 1200 per dollar from a previous close of 6.1325.
</P>
<P>
The rand started the day slightly negative this morning
following a weak gold price close in New York on Thursday. But
that was short-lived when offshore players sold dollars pushing
the local currency firmer in midmorning. It traded between 6.1250
and 6.1400 for most of Friday.

<HEADLINE> Four Billion Tons of Salt Reserve Found in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will conclude the
era that it depends on import of salt, the Ministry of Mines and
Energy said.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency Friday quoted official sources of the
ministry as saying that some 4.29 billion tons of salt reserve
have been verified in Afar State and other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Such a big amount of salt reserve could serve the country for
16,000 years, said Rukia Ahmed, chairperson of the Ethiopian Salt
Manufacturing Enterprises Association.
</P>
<P>
Rukia said that her association, which was established
Thursday, would try to increase the salt output in the country
thereby reducing import.
</P>
<P>
The association will also strive to sell the salt products not
only at home but also in the international market, she said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, with a population of 60 million, reportedly has to
import annually tens of thousands of tons of salt to meet the
domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Jitters to Hit Emerging Financial Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- South African financial
markets as well as most emerging markets worldwide would be
affected by jitters surrounding the Y2K issue rather than actual
technological problems stemming from the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
"A decreasing number of market commentators now believe that
Y2K-related problems could cause a full-blown economic recession
in 2000. However, investors are becoming more risk averse as 2000
approaches," Neil Margolis, an analyst of the South African Gensec
Asset Management which monitors market developments, told a press
briefing in Cape Town on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is causing a temporary drying up of capital flows to
emerging markets. The effect is a Y2K-induced flight to quality,
with capital likely to be attracted to "safe havens" as the
year-end draws near, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the South African bond markets had already experienced
a slowdown in offshore investment over the past few weeks as a
result of Y2K. This was expected to continue until the beginning
of 2000, with relative market weakness also putting some downward
pressure on the rand versus the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Margolis also revealed that a global poll of fund managers had
forecast increased consumer spending relating to Y2K readiness as
they stockpiled goods in the last weeks of 1999, boosting economic
activity. However, the first few weeks of 2000 would likely see a
sharp fall in demand as people drew down these stocks, dampening
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Even though South Africa was well positioned going into 2000,
the country was unlikely to escape unscathed, as it tended to get
bundled together with other emerging markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official on
Friday urged the United States to revise its policies and not to
interfere in the internal affairs of independent nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Friday prayer at Tehran University campus, a
Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani, a member of the country's
powerful Experts Assembly, said the U.S. Administration should
dismount from the "wild bronco riding arrogance."
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. should try to emend its threats of
bastinadoes and bayonet to create fear, dread, intimidation and
terror among others, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He was in response to a recent call by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to Iran not to put on trial the 13 Iranian Jews
arrested on charges of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Albright also warned that Washington would take certain
decisions to prevent the trial of the accused.
</P>
<P>
"It is astonishing to see how a diplomatic top brass would
allow herself to express opinion regarding judicial affairs of an
independent country and those accused," Kashani said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Islamic Republic termed such statements as a
kind of blatant interference and irresponsible blurt.
</P>
<P>
The relations between countries are based on international
norms and laws, he said, adding that "if you want the world to
recognize you as a power, you should not engage yourself in
supporting disorders and anarchism."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday
also refuted Albright's remarks as "baseless" and a "blatant
U.S. intervention in the internal affairs of the Islamic Republic
of Iran."
</P>
<P>
The investigation of the case lies within the jurisdiction of
the country's judiciary which would review the case with full
independence, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Jews were arrested in April for allegedly working
for Israeli and U.S. intelligence services, but both Israel and
the U.S. denied the accusation.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Send New Envoy to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is considering a
proposal by the U.N. to name a new envoy for Cyprus, local reports
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here confirmed that the Cyprus government
has been informed in the past few days of U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan's intention to appoint Peruvian diplomat Alvaro de Soto
as his special representative for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Cyprus government is looking into the
matter and wishes to facilitate Annan's task in this respect.
</P>
<P>
De Soto, 56, joined the U.N. in 1982 as special assistant to
then Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. He was a senior
political adviser to former U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali from 1992 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1995, de Soto has been working as U.N. Assistant
Secretary General for political affairs and in that capacity has
been involved in the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Annan recently named Chilean diplomat James Holger as his
acting special representative for Cyprus for an initial
three-month period, with the possibility of an extension.
</P>
<P>
Holger's appointment followed the resignation of Dame Ann
Hercus of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Annan had originally chosen former Norwegian Deputy Foreign
Minister Jan Egeland to replace Hercus, who helped broker the
1993 Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish Cypriots rejected his nomination.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has made it clear that he
did not want any representative from an European Union (EU)
country because of the 1994 ban it imposed on imports from the
northern Cyprus and the bloc's decision to forge ahead with
Cyprus's accession course.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- South African members of
parliament on Friday demanded bigger say in making the budget.
</P>
<P>
MPs should further participate in the budgetary process, Deputy
Finance Minister Sipho Mphahlwa said at a workshop on the
medium-term expenditure framework held here.
</P>
<P>
Parliament had to find a way to involve more committees than
just the one on finance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel explained the
three-year budgetary framework to delegates.
</P>
<P>
Mphahlwa said all relevant documents were available on the
Internet, and were used all over the world to determine, among
others, South Africa's credit worthiness and investment potential.
</P>
<P>
"It is a shame that we as parliamentarians are not able to use
these documents in a much more meaningful way," he said.
</P>
<P>
His comments followed complaints from some MPs that they only
got to see the Budget once it was tabled in Parliament, and did
not really have an opportunity to influence it.
</P>
<P>
Rob Davies, MP from the ruling African National Congress, said
Parliament should discuss ways of becoming involved in the
budgetary process.

NICOSIA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Finance Minister Takis
Clerides Friday expressed optimism over the prospects of the
country's economy next year, saying they are "encouraging."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Parliament Finance Committee on next year's
budget, he said the growth rate of Cyprus' economy in the year
2000 will be around 4 percent, unemployment around 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said inflation will show a marginal increase which will

Fiscal deficit, he said, will reach 6.9 percent of the gross

measures.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of 1999 will be around 4.5 percent in real
terms and total foreign investment will increase slightly by about
0.4 percent and outside demand for goods and services will rise by
5.3 percent in comparison with a 1.8 percent decrease last year.
</P>
<P>
"In 1999 the services sector recorded the most economic
growth, with a 74.3 percent contribution to the GDP," the
minister said.

<P>
Inflation is expected to be restricted to 1.5 percent, he

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The South African rand
ended the session stronger against the U.S. dollar on Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said there was no particular reason for the currency
ending positive, but mentioned that there was interest to sell
dollars by offshore players.
</P>
<P>
The rand's strength also left some local dealers surprised
because the gold price continued its downward trend this
afternoon, testing levels below 302 dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
The local currency gained almost 1.25 cents Friday to last
trade at 6. 1200 per dollar from a previous close of 6.1325.
</P>
<P>
The rand started the day slightly negative this morning
following a weak gold price close in New York on Thursday. But
that was short-lived when offshore players sold dollars pushing
the local currency firmer in midmorning. It traded between 6.1250
and 6.1400 for most of Friday.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Veto Turkey's EU Candidacy If Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece will exercise its right
to veto Turkey's candidacy for the European Union (EU) at the
forthcoming Helsinki summit if it fails to meet certain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou Friday said at an
inner cabinet meeting that a positive position from Athens on the
future of Turkey's ties with the EU could be based on making it
conditional on Cyprus' accession process being unimpeded and its
accession independent of developments on the settlement of the
Cyprus problem, as well as the neighboring country recognizing the
international jurisdiction of the international court of justice
at the Hague, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Greece will try to have these conditions included in the text
of the Helsinki summit conclusions and if this is rejected, Athens
will use its veto to stop Ankara being placed on the list of
candidate countries, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas also reiterated
Friday that Greece favors Turkey's European vocation and an
upgrading of relations with the EU on the condition that this will
be accompanied by positive developments on the Cyprus issue and on
a bilateral basis.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have nearly gone to war
three times in the past 25 years because of their disputes in the
eastern Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that Turkey can not join the EU unless it
improves its human rights record and relations with Athens as well
as not blocking Nicosia's entry into the EU, but the devastating
earthquakes in the two countries in recent months have provided an
opportunity for both to improve their strained relations, and
Athens has since softened its opposition to Ankara's eventual
membership in the EU.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Growth Null in 1999: SELA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Latin America as a whole will
close 1999 with no economic growth because of the international
economic crisis, said Argentine Carlos Moneta, Latin American
Economic System (SELA) permanent secretary.
</P>
<P>
This will be the biggest Latin American economic contraction
after the start of the 1997 world crisis, when the region
registered a 5.3 percent growth that dropped to 2.3 percent in
1998, according to Moneta, quoted Friday by the "El Universal"
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Latin American economies as a whole will improve in the
year 2000, according to Moneta, when they will resume their
growth, despite "the blows of the world crisis."
</P>
<P>
Moneta, who considers possible a new crisis, said that Latin
America is very sensitive to the changes in the world financial
markets, so the SELA promotes a reform of the international
financial system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the strongest resistance to a new world financial
order is raised by the Group of the Seven most industrialized
countries, specifically the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that the creation of a financial circuit of regional
assitance to face external crises will be proposed during the
next SELA council ordinary meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The line of defense is in the regional field," so the creation
of Latin American organizations that will provide opportune
resources without bigger conditions to the countries of the zone
to solve financial problems is necessary, said Moneta.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine, who has occupied his post for four years,
proposed the expansion of the markets for the Latin American
insertion.
</P>
<P>
He said that Africa, as well as Asia, have sufficient
commercial and cooperation potentiality for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"The region continues strongly linked to Europe and North
America, and must diversify its international insertion," said
Moneta.

<HEADLINE> EU Sets New Labeling Rules for GMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Friday that it has proposed completing the present EU labeling
rules with laying down a limit for the accidental content of
genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
</P>
<P>
The European Union's executive branch said these measures would
enhance legal certainty for both operators and consumers, firstly
by introducing a labeling limit of 1 percent of ingredients
individually considered, and secondly by making foods containing
GMO addictives and flavorings produced from GMOs subject to the
same labeling rules as those relevant EU regulations.
</P>
<P>
Foods and food ingredients produced from GMOs have to be
labeled according to two regulations which entered into force in
1997 and 1998 respectively. This means that they have to be
labeled when they contain protein or DNA resulting from genetic
modification, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
"The threshold aims at solving the problem faced by operators
who have tried to avoid GMOs but who due to accidental
contamination still find themselves with a low percentage of GM
material in their products. It will thus offer legal certainty to
those operators," the EU executive said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The proposed limit applies only to material already for human
consumption in the EU member states, and "may be applied" subject
to two conditions: the origin of the GM material has to be
accidental, which means that operators have to provide evidence
that they have avoided the use of GMOs as a source; the proportion
of GM material accidentally present cannot be higher than "1
percent of each ingredient individually considered," the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
According to the European Commission, the EU law proposing and
enforcing arm, the draft measures do not intend to lay down rules
for the use of labeling claims of the "GMO-free" type.

AMMAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein said Friday he might intervene in the month-long Hamas
issue for which 21 members of the Palestinian movement are kept in
detention.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official news agency Petra upon
his arrival in Amman from a three-nation tour, Abdullah said that
Hamas issue "has gone too far...and derailed from its framework."
</P>
<P>
The monarch said the roundup of Hamas members did not target at
the movement itself, but was related to Jordanian citizens who are
leading a non-Jordanian organization, which was not in the best
interests of the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The best framework must be found to end the Hamas issue
through objective and disciplined dialog, Abdullah said, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Hamas politburo chief Khalid Mishaal and spokesman Ibrahim
Ghosheh were among the 21 Hamas members who were arrested in
September in a government crackdown. All of the detainees were
Jordanian citizens.
</P>
<P>
They were charged with joining an illegal foreign organization
and engaging in illegal political activities, illegal possession
of arms and conducting military exercises as part of the campaigns
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah defended the government's measures which were
apparently aimed at containing Hamas activities at a time when
the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians was making
progress.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, the militant Palestinian resistance organization,
remains opposed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's move against Hamas lies within the legal
responsibilities of the government to safeguard national security
and stability, Abdullah said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah arrived in Amman Friday after a two-week trip which
had taken him to the United States, Britain and Spain.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Five Parties to Form New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Five parties from the Italian
ruling center-left alliance Olive Tree which won the 1996 general
elections agreed Friday evening to forging a new coalition as the
foundation for a new government.
</P>
<P>
The summit of party secretaries said the aim was to open up a
new political phase which would not represent a "mechanical
reproduction" of the political experience of 1996, when Romano
Prodi, now president of the European Commission, led the original
Olive Tree, became Italian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The five parties are the Left Democrats, the People's Party,
the Greens, the Italian Renovation and the Democrats which Prodi
created early this year before being named as the European Union
commission's president.
</P>
<P>
The summit also urged the opening of the Olive Tree to "new
forces, those that today support the government," but are not an
integral part of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats were present at the summit by virtue of their
founder's role in 1996 and the 7.7 percent they won in the
mid-June European elections.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 10 parties forming the government's majority agree
that the condition for continuing together must be a solid
agreement to relaunch the government and the political pact
knitting together its majority.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the leader of Olive Tree, Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema, to push for a new government based upon
a new-forming ruling coalition was a response to recent demands
from the Democrats which have a more political weight after the
mid-June European elections.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, although they are in the ruling coalition,
called for holding more portfolios in the government which now has
no minister from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema hopes to form a new majority to work out the new pact,
which should run through the regional elections in spring of next
year to the dissolution of parliament and general elections in
2001.
</P>
<P>
Once the pact has been reached, D'Alema will be in a position to
assess the situation and possibly decide, no later than the end of
next week, on resignation followed by the very rapid formation of
a new government which would then pass through confidence votes in
the two Houses.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Expects to Resume Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana said Friday in northen Spain's city of Oviedo, that he
expects to resume soon the contacts with the National Liberation
Army (ELN) guerrilla started in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana confirmed that he will attend the upcoming
Iberoamerican Summit in Havana, adding that these meetings have
had good results.
</P>
<P>
He said that Colombia obtained the support of all the European
Community for the peace process during the previous one, held in
Oporto, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said the talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) will start next Sunday, and that he hopes that the
negotiations will be held with all the Colombians and foreigners
who want to participate.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government is working for the release of all
those who are in the hands of the guerrillas, and underscored the
work performed in this field by the Spanish ambassador in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
ELN is the second largest rebel group after the FARC. The
decades-long civil war has caused the Latin American country huge
material losses and thousands of people dead in just the recent 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the ELN and the government are holding talks
in Cuba, while a peace talk between the FARC and the authorities
will start on Oct.24 inside Colombia.
</P>
<P>
President Pastrana started on October 18 an eight-day tour of
the United States and Europe to request support and to present his
"Plan Colombia" that foresees the investment of 7.5 billion
dollars in three years, of which 3.5 million dollars must be
contributed by the international community.

UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday voted 15-0 to authorize the establishment of a
6,000-strong force to help restore peace to the war-torn Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The new peace operation, known as the U.N. Mission in Sierra
Leone (UNAMSIL), will help implement a July peace accord between
Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and Foday Sakoh,
leader of the Revolutionary United Front, aimed at ending a
conflict that lasted more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMSIL, given an initial six-month mandate, will help
disarm and demobilize some 45,000 ex-combatants, many of them
children. It will also ensure the security of a U.N. civilian
personnel, assist the delivery of humanitarian aid, and provide
support for eventual elections.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force is the largest approved by the 15-member
council and the United States in several years, with the U.N.
peacekeepers having fallen from a high of some 79,000 in 1993 to
some 14,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
At least 50,000 people have been killed over the past eight
years in the western African country. Almost all of the country's
some 4.4 million people have been displaced, turned into refugees
or otherwise made homeless by the conflict.

COLOMBO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Saturday afternoon kicked off her campaign for the
presidential election in the northern holy Buddhist city of
Anuradhapura.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the procession of floats depicting the work carried
out during the last five years by the ruling People's Alliance
(PA) government on Saturday reached Anuradhapura, about 200
kilometers northeast of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The government's fifth anniversary celebration rally in
Anuradhapura was also the inaugural campaign rally with the
participation of all ministers and PA's members of Parliament, a
senior leader of the PA said.
</P>
<P>
A people's march was also held to express support to President
Kumaratunga in the contest for presidency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anuradhapura was chosen for the inaugural campaign rally due to
its religious significance and importance to the majority
Sinhalese Buddhist community who make up more than 70 percent of
Sri Lanka's 18.5 million population.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga, voted into power for a six-year term
with a 62 percent majority in November 1994, announced Wednesday
through a proclamation the conduct of early presidential polls in
two to three months.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition United National Party has chosen its leader
Ranil Wickremesinghe to challenge President Kumaratunga in the
upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
Although the JVP or People's Liberation Front, Sri Lanka's
third largest party, has also announced its plan to field a
candidate, analysts here said the main battle will be fought
between Kumaratunga and Wickremesinghe.
</P>
<P>
They said the result of the presidential polls could have a
major impact on general elections that are likely to be also
called ahead of schedule in August 2000.

TEHRAN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi Saturday deplored Russia's strike
Thursday on the Chechen capital Grozny that reportedly killed
about 137 civilians.
</P>
<P>
The incident is giving cause for concern, Asefi said,
expressing hope that ranking Russian authorities would try to
explore peaceful means for solving the problem in Chechnya
consistent with a recent agreement between the Iranian Foreign

there had been "a special operation" against arms dealing, with no
civilian casualties.

<HEADLINE> Speaker: West Has No Right to Teach Russia on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Duma Speaker
Gennady Seleznyov said Saturday that neither the United States nor
any other NATO country has the right to teach Russia how to act in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya and the North Caucasus region
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The speaker of the lower house of parliament was responding to
comments by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott that
Moscow should take necessary steps to find a political solution to
the Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said Russia stands ready to hold talks with the
Chechens, but they have to abide by Russian laws, accept that
Chechnya is a part of Russia and refrain from using terrorism as a
means to realize their political aims, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Chechen President Aslav Maskhadov has in effect become
a hostage to Chechen terrorists Shamil Basayev and Khattab.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched a massive campaign against Islamic militants
following armed incursions into Daghestan led by Basayev and
Khattab and a spate of terrorist bombings that killed some 300
people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Both Basayev and Khattab have been accused of masterminding
the blasts, accusations the two denied.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said the terrorists must be eradicated and that the
actions by federal troops in Chechnya have not violated any
international humanitarian norms.
</P>
<P>
The speaker's view was echoed by Vladimir Lukin, chairman of
the Foreign Affairs Committee of the State Duma, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"Why did the Americans resort to the use of force in resolving
the acute conflict in Kosovo, despite Russia's proposal for a
political solution?" Lukin asked.
</P>
<P>
However, Lukin said he shares Talbott's preference for
political solution. But this requires a negotiating partner who
wants to settle this extremely difficult situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talbott's ideas were put into practice before and yielded no
result, he said. "We got only aggression in Daghestan, apartment
bombings and terrorist attacks throughout the country," he added.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Center Dele Officially Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- It appears NBA Detroit
Pistons center Bison Dele, whose career has been overshadowed by a
number of off-the-court distractions, has retired.
</P>
<P>
Pistons vice president of basketball operations Rick Sund
confirmed to the Detroit News that Dele has officially filed his
retirement papers with the league office in New York.
</P>
<P>
Dele, 30, informed Pistons on October 1 that he would miss the
start of training camp and was contemplating retirement. In a
release issued by the team, Dele said he was not 100 percent
committed to playing at the level necessary for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
Dele would forfeit the $5.67 million he was to make this season.
He had five years left on his contract worth $36.45 million.
</P>
<P>
The Pistons can place the center on the retirement list, which
would result in a season-long absence, or the suspended list. If
the Pistons place Dele on the suspended list, they would retain
his rights and could reinstate him or trade him, but would also
have to keep his salary on the books.
</P>
<P>
Without Dele, the Pistons likely will use Eric Montross and Don
Reid at center.
</P>
<P>
Dele, an eight-year veteran, averaged 10.5 points and 5.6
rebounds in 49 games last season. He signed with the Pistons as a
free agent in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Dele changed his name from Brian Williams prior to last season
after researching his family history. His intensity on the court
often has been questioned by teammates and coaches and Dele
himself has admitted to a lack of passion for basketball.
</P>
<P>
Dele was a member of the NBA All-Interview second team and the
subject of lengthy Sports Illustrated articles.
</P>
<P>
He has averaged 11.0 points and 6.2 rebounds in 413 games. He
was the 10th overall selection of the Orlando Magic in the 1991
draft and has spent time with Denver, the Los Angeles Clippers,
Chicago Bulls and Pistons.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Ferrari Wins Appeal Against Disqualification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Formula One Racing team
Ferrari Saturday morning won its appeal against last Sunday's
disqualification from the Malaysian Grand Prix, where its one-two
victory appeared to put it back on track for winning the Formula
One drivers' and constructors' title.
</P>
<P>
Max Mosely, president of the International motor racing
association FIA, said in Paris that the disqualification due to
over-long deflector panels had been quashed.
</P>
<P>
The decision gives Ferrari's Eddie Irvine a four-point
advantage over McLaren's Finnish world champion Mikka Hakkinen
with one race to go in Japan, at 70 points to 66.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari also has a 4-point edge over McLaren in the
constructors' championship.

<HEADLINE> Blue Sky Returns to "Invisible" Lanzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 23 (Xinhua) -- "There isn't a blue sky in
Lanzhou? Then what on earth is this on the horizon?" asked Mr. Bai
after returning to the city for the first time in years, as he
admired the clear skies.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most seriously polluted cities in China and in
the world, Lanzhou, capital city of northwest China's Gansu
Province, had earned itself the nickname "invisible city."
</P>
<P>
But now, blue sky, snowy clouds and bright sunshine have all
returned to the city, especially in summer and autumn, after the
city's pollution control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the content of carbon dioxide and
suspended particles in the air this year has decreased 12 and 14
percent respectively, compared with that of the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a special project launched last summer, the air
pollution has been alleviated. Some 100 polluting enterprises were
forced to close down, along with more than 600 street barbecue
stands. The use of bituminite coal has also been banned in Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
On the pollution list for Chinese cities, released by the State
Environmental Protection Administration in June this year, Lanzhou
was one of three capital cities named as having achieved
outstanding progress in pollution control.
</P>
<P>
"The air quality is much better now," confirmed Wang Yongguo, a
Lanzhou resident, "although it is still not quite satisfying in
winter."
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts say that coal burning and some polluting
enterprises are the main source of air pollution here.
</P>
<P>
The city's special topography causes noxious gases to hover
over the city, according to Yu Xionghou, director general of the
Lanzhou Bureau of Environment Protection.
</P>
<P>
To completely change traditional coal-burning methods, a "blue
sky program" was launched in 1990, and now nearly half the people
in the city are using gas for their heating.
</P>
<P>
Yu added that 70 percent of them will be using gas instead of
coal by the end of next year, and the air is expected to become
even cleaner with the development of gas plants, thermo-electric
plants and solar energy resources.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the 1.5-billion-yuan (more than 170 million U.S.
dollars) "blue sky program" has covered the city with a great
green carpet.
</P>
<P>
Local residents say that 50 years ago there were only eight
trees on the mountains, but now over 7,000 hectares of trees and
plants here are helping to reduce floating dust.
</P>
<P>
The local media make public an air-quality index every week,
and many people are volunteering to supervise polluters in
residential areas to contribute to a better environment as they
have been aware that tackling pollution should not only be the
task of government.
</P>
<P>
Wang said, "We are longing for the day when we can see a
completely clear blue sky."

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Regrets Take-Over in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina on Saturday said that she regretted the recent developments
in Pakistan as "it (the military take-over) is very unfortunate
for the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation)
as well as democracy in the region."
</P>
<P>
"An elected government can be replaced by another elected one,
this is expected in a democracy," the prime minister told a press
conference Saturday morning on her return after a five-day
official visit to Australia, the first by a Bangladeshi head of
state or government since the country's independence.
</P>
<P>
Describing her visit as "very fruitful" to promote export of
the country's goods to Australia and Australian investment in
Bangladesh, she said: "My visit has opened up a new market for
Bangladeshi products."
</P>
<P>
She said that the Australian side assured her of considering
Bangladesh's proposal for zero tariff facilities for entry of
Bangladeshi products into that country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the opposition alliance's anti-government movement,
she said the government could be changed "through ballot not
through bullet" and the Bangladeshi people would never accept
"change of government in an undemocratic way."
</P>
<P>
She noted that she would quit power in due time paving way for
holding free and fair elections under a neutral caretaker
government. "If the government is involved in any wrongdoing, the
people will give reply by their ballots."
</P>
<P>
On bureaucratic red tape and corruption, Hasina said: "we are
trying hard to wipe out these problems and have ensured to a large
extent accountability and transparency in the administration."
</P>
<P>
On the existing "limitations and loopholes" in bringing
offenders to book, she said the government could not ensure
fairness alone. "The judiciary too should have accountability
along with the executive and the legislature for justice and fair
play at all levels of the national life," she said.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about the upazilla (sub-district)
elections scheduled for December this year which the opposition
has threatened to boycott, the prime minister said: "We want
participation of all political parties in the election to realize
our goal for decentralization of the administration to reap the
benefits of our economic programs."
</P>
<P>
With regard to the government's proposal to extend the time
frame of reserved seats in parliament which requires two-third
votes, she said, "the cooperation of the opposition is needed to
materialize the proposal."
</P>
<P>
In case the opposition would not cooperate, "I would pledge
that if we are elected in the next general elections with
two-third majority, we will amend the constitution in the first
session of the House to retain the reserved quota for women," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Delegation Ends Visit to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The delegation of the
Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) concluded its 12-day
visit to the United States here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During their short stay in San Francisco, the NPC delegation,
led by Chairman of its Foreign Affairs Committee Zeng Jianhui, met
Mayor Willy Brown and held a discussion with scholars of the
Stanford University on Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The NPC delegation, the first one to visit the country at the
formal invitation of the U.S. Congress in a decade, also visited
Washington D.C., New York and Houston and was warmly welcomed by
the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
The delegation held four rounds of talks on issues of common
interests including Sino-U.S. relations, economic and trade
cooperation and regional security with the U.S.-China Inter-
parliamentary Exchange Group consisting of 15 Republican and
Democratic legislators of the U.S. House of Representatives on the
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
"The talks have enhanced our mutual understanding, expanded our
common ground and established a channel of regular communications
between the parliaments of the two countries," a spokesman of the
delegation said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation members also met with senators and senior
officials from the White House, the State Department and the
Pentagon, and all the officials stressed the importance of
developing friendly and cooperative relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, while meeting
with the delegation in his office in New York, pointed out that a
sound U.S.-China relationship is important not only to China, but
also to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said it is important for the U.S. government to abide
by the three communiques governing Sino-U.S. relations in dealing
with bilateral relations with China.
</P>
<P>
In Houston, Zeng Jianhui, who is also a member of the NPC
Standing Committee, delivered a speech on the prospects of
economic and trade relations between the two countries to leaders
of famous enterprises from South America at a luncheon hosted by
the U.S.-China Business Association of the Texas State.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneurs appreciated the achievements China has made
in its economic construction and opening to the outside world and
expressed full confidence in increasing investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Houston Brown Li, who visited China in February this
year, told the Chinese delegation that the city, as a high-tech
center in the United States, is ready to expand cooperation with
China in various fields.

<HEADLINE> France Happy With EU Decision on Common Stand at WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- France expressed its satisfaction
on Saturday over the decision of the European Union (EU) to take a
common stand in perspective of the forthcoming round of
negotiations of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle at
the end of November.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Culture and Communication Catherine
Trautmann and State Secretary of Exterior Trade Francois Huwart
said in a communique that the policy adopted by the EU on WTO
talks will help its member countries preserve and develop their
cultural and audio-visual policies and their cultural identities
and diversities.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors of 15 member countries of the EU struck a
compromise deal on Friday on a common stand to be taken in the WTO
talks over two pending issues -- audio-visual market and social
norms.
</P>
<P>
At the initiative of France, the EU will seek to guarantee the
possibility for the union and its member countries to keep and
develop their rights to define and implement freely their cultural
and audio-visual policies, in order to protect their cultural
diversities.
</P>
<P>
The EU will also call for the establishment of a permanent
working forum within the WTO on the protection of social and labor
rights.

<HEADLINE> China Should Step up Township Construction: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIANGYIN, October 23 (Xinhua)-- Just before and after the
annual Spring Festival holidays, tens of thousands of rural people
crowd at railway stations and docks, shuttling between their
country homes and big cities.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the flow of migrant labor and alleviate the mounting
pressure on major cities, a senior professor said here recently
China should step up its efforts to build townships.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar to over 200 heads of small towns each
with a population of below 200,000, Zhu Tiezhen, president of the
National Small City Development Committee under the China City
Development Research Society, said that township development
points the way to overcoming the malaise associated with large
cities and the adverse effects of setting up factories all over
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that to prevent farmers from entering the cities for
jobs, some urban areas have enforced prohibitive measures against
migrant rural labor, resulting in the unrestrained and irregular
creation of factories in the rural areas, causing severe pollution
to water and soil.
</P>
<P>
He said that townships have mushroomed since the late 1970s,
when China adopted reform and opening-up policies. Zhejiang
Province, for instance, had 176 towns in 1978. Last year, the
province had 965 towns, which have a combined population of 14
million, or one third of the provincial total.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the government should develop an overall
strategy for the development of townships and impose sound control
over the layout of towns.
</P>
<P>
"The towns in China are generally too small," he said, "and
many have a population of only 6,000 to 7,000 each. In one place,
there are a cluster of 14 such towns along a 30-km highway."
</P>
<P>
To quicken township development, Zhu also urged relaxing the
control of the resident registration system, which tends to bind
rural people to the places they live.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's view has the support of the State Development Planning
Commission. An official from the commission said that China is
resorting to urbanization to ignite domestic consumption, and is
planning to transform 85 million rural people into township
residents.
</P>
<P>
China's urbanization rate was 32 percent in 1997, as compared
with the world average of 50 percent. The official said that China
plans to push its urbanization rate to this level by 2015.

<P>
CAIRO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Banque du Liban et D' Outre Mer, Lebanon's biggest
bank, has announced a 19.6 percent increase in its net profits of
the third quarter, the Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which has a total assets of 4.74 billion U.S.
dollars, said profits had risen at the end of September to 52.58
million dollars compared with 43.95 million dollars in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Customer deposits rose by 12 percent to 4.1 billion dollars by
the end of September, the bank added in its quarterly report.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Travelers leaving Lebanon by air or sea will have to
pay 3.3 dollars departure tax as from October 21, the Finance
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The tax, in the form of a 5,000-Lebanese-pound (about 3.3
dollars) stamp affixed to the ticket, must be paid before
departure.
</P>
<P>
The new levy comes after an airport tax of 33 dollars on an
economy class ticket, 50 dollars on a business class one and 67
dollars on the first class service.
</P>
<P>
The seaport tax is about half the airport's levies.
</P>
<P>
The measures do not apply to travel by land to Syria, the
dominant political and military power in Lebanon, and the source
of hundreds of thousands of laborers working here.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese cabinet has decided to impose a ban on
imported cement in order to protect local cement industry from
foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
The new decision also stipulates that local manufacturers fix
cement prices for five years.
</P>
<P>
Prices are now at 68 dollars a ton in bags at the factory or
73-76 dollars a ton delivered to the site, plus a nine-dollar
consumption tax.
</P>
<P>
The ban is meant to give a boost to the local industry,
hard-hit by the downturn in the real-estate market.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- A liquefied petroleum gas installation of 3.4
billion dollars started operation in Qatar on Saturday.

export, said Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry Abdullah
Hamad Al-Attiyah.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in Qatar's production capacity, estimated at about
1.5 million tons annually, would enable Ras Gas to supply its
clients with any quantity they demand at any time, Al-Attiyah was
quoted by Kuwait News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Ras Gas Board Chairman and Qatar's Minister of
Finance, Economy and Commerce, Yousuf Hussein Kamal, the project
was financed by a consortium of international banks and
monetary institutions, which provided 2.44 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rest was from the international financial bonds market,
Kamal said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prodigy Becomes Youngest Grandmaster in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, eastern Shandong Province, October 23 (Xinhua) --
Thirteen-year-old Chinese prodigy Pu Xiangzhi on Saturday became
the world's youngest Grandmaster ever, the Chinese Chess
Association said.
</P>
<P>
Pu, who is 13 years ten months, registered six points from a
possible nine in an international tournament here to achieve the
last of the three Grandmaster results, which is required by the
international chess body FIDE for a Grandmaster rank.
</P>
<P>
The previous world age record was held by Ukraine's Ruslan
Ponomariov, who became Grandmaster when he was a little over 14
years.
</P>
<P>
Pu scored two Grandmaster results at a couple of international
competitions in Europe in September.
</P>
<P>
Ten chess players from China, Vietnam, Uzbekistan and Tajikstan,
four of them Grandmasters and three Masters, took part in the six-
day Qingdao international tournament.
</P>
<P>
Pu, with five wins, two draws and two losses, finished second
after the tournament winner Dao Tan Hai of Vietnam, who also
scored six points with three wins and six draws.

<HEADLINE> Investment Wooed in Ethiopia's Vine Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian agricultural
experts have recommended domestic and foreign investors to invest
in the profit-making vine growing venture in the Horn of Africa
country.
</P>
<P>
Investors might reap vine harvests two times a year in Ethiopia
while it is harvested only once in Europe, Seifu Gebre-Mariam, a
grape planting specialist, said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
A mass production of grape and its increasing supply to foreign
markets would fetch Ethiopia considerable foreign exchange whereas
domestic demand for grape is also high, Seifu said.
</P>
<P>
Rezene Hailu, general manager of the Awash Winery, one of major
wineries in Ethiopia, said that his company has to import second-
and third-grade grape due to lack of domestic suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The winery, situated at about 220 km east of capital Addis
Ababa, is importing eight million birr (one million U.S. dollars)
worth of wine annually as the 80-hectare vine farms in Gudar,
Upper Asash and Zeway cannot fully meet the demand of his factory,
Rezene said.
</P>
<P>
Awash wine is so popular in Asia, Europe and east Africa that
Ethiopia annually exports 2.1 million liters of the wine to these
regions, he added.

LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Prospective foreign firms
interested in the implementation of government projects, may be
made to take qualifying examinations soon, a senior Nigerian
presidential aide has said.

The measure would enable government to determine their

</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this is to ensure that those that will handle
public projects and programs are qualified," the Guardian

</P>
<P>
"As part of the on-going effort of involving professionals in
all areas of development, we are working on how expatriates coming
to the country for public projects and other programs will be made
to sit for qualifying examinations like Nigerians are made to do
in other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, we want to use that initiative to encourage Nigerian
 professionals to participate in these projects," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the light of this, the government has created a special
department in the presidency to handle issues concerning the
development of professional practices in the most populous African
country, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen in Kuwait for Talks on Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen arrived here on Saturday for talks with Kuwaiti
leaders on regional security and military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who is currently on a nine-nation tour in the Middle
East region, is scheduled to meet with Kuwaiti Emir Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah as well as his Kuwaiti
counterpart Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
According to official Kuwait News Agency, the talks are
expected to deal with the security in the Gulf region, the Iraqi
problem and bilateral defense cooperation between the United
States and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Washington signed a defense cooperation agreement
in September 1991, after the Iraqi troops were driven out of
Kuwait by a multi-nation coalition force.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is also likely to discuss with the Kuwaitis the Middle
East peace process, the developments in Pakistan in addition to
others issues of mutual interest, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
During his visits to Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates last week, Cohen denied rumors that the
U.S. was considering to reduce its military presence in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out any changes to the U.S. "double-containment"
policy towards Iraq and Iran, both of which Washington claims are
still posing missile threats to the states in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy sources in Saudi Arabia said the U.S. defense
chief has brought with him defense and security concepts for the
region to face any missile threats that might occur, although they
did not go into details.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's tour also includes Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Oman.

<P>
NANCHANG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Workshop on
Technology and Policy Issues of Watershed Management closed today
in this capital of east China's Jiangxi Province.

management that is drawing increased attention around the world.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium brought together some 100 ecologists,
economists and officials from home and abroad to exchange their
views on effective watershed management, including Richard
Grimshaw from the International Khuskhus Network and David Bleyle,
the science counselor at the American Embassy to China.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which presented an opportunity for China to learn
about advanced watershed management from other countries, was
jointly sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese
University of Hong Kong, and the Mountain, River and Lake Office
of Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference and director of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, sent a letter of congratulations to the symposium.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign experts who attended the meeting will make
an on-the-spot investigation of the Mountain, River and Lake
Project at Jiangxi's Boyang Lake, which introduced watershed
management 15 years ago, and has been widely acclaimed as China's
most successful experiment in this field.

PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The National Secretary of the
French Communist Party (PCF) Robert Hue denied on Saturday that
his party was involved in a clandestine donating affair, in which
the PCF allegedly received illegal donations from the public
company Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE).
</P>
<P>
"Not one centime has entered the chest of the PCF from the
company," said Hue at a meeting of the Communist deputies in Lille,
northern France.
</P>
<P>
Hue, who was summoned on Thursday by the Correctional Tribunal
of Paris over the matter, said there were people who want "to do
harm to the French Communist Party."
</P>
<P>
"The success of our demonstration on October 16 for the 35-hour
work week and employment embarrassed a certain number of people
who don't want to see the Communist Party again play its role in
this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PCF organized a mass demonstration in Paris on October 16
in protest against the layoff of workers by enterprises and the
dominance of stock market in the economy.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Strives to Curb Rape, Domestic Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A special desk will be added to
Kenya's police stations for victims of rape and domestic violence,
a senior police officer said.
</P>
<P>
The desk will be run by women officers, Assistant Police
Commissioner Mary Mwangangi said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Many rape cases were unresolved because of reluctance by
victims to report the assault and to testify, the East African
Standard newspaper Saturday quoted the police officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mwangangi said that victims often opt to resolve the problems
in private while some unknowingly destroy evidence by washing the
clothes or their bodies.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that rape cases had jumped by 186 percent over the
past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has ratified the 1984 U.N. convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Orders Crackdown on Lewd Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday that he has ordered the confiscation of all
pornographic films being shown in Metro Manila and all provinces.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio-TV program here, Estrada said he has
relayed this order to Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora.
</P>
<P>
"I'd ordered Zamora as of yesterday to pull out all
pornographic films, including those being shown in the provinces,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he would also meet soon with the Movie and
Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) to determine
what should be done to stop pornography.
</P>
<P>
He added he had already given MTRCB members ample warning that
they might lose their jobs, if they would fail to get their acts
together.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the MTRCB has been the target of
criticism from concerned citizens for its laxity in allowing the
showing of what some sectors classify as pornographic movies.
</P>
<P>
It also came under fire last week for allowing the showing on
television of an awards night program that featured, among others,
actress Rosanna Roces in a revealing outfit.

<HEADLINE> India to Go Full Speed on Reform: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Yashwant
Sinha said here Saturday that the Indian government would go "full
speed and full throttle" in implementing hard and difficult
decisions to effect fiscal consolidation and reforms, a
pre-requisite for accelerating economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We do not plan to loose any time, not even a moment" to
implement the reform process, the minister told a seminar
organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (FICCI).
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to move forward full speed, full throttle in
not only in the next 100 days but the whole of the next five years
as we determined to change the face of the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Obviously referring to the on-going strike by transporters all
over the country in protest against the over 35 percent increase
in diesel prices, Sinha asked Indians to prepare for hard and
difficult decisions by the government.
</P>
<P>
"Populism has not paid and will not pay in the long-term and it
is only through hard, difficult decisions which might hit the
vested interests, will the country move forward," said the
financial manager of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ruling out any roll-back of diesel prices, Sinha said: "we
shall not shrink from taking hard and difficult decisions and in
the next five years we will have to change the face of this
country to carry forward the reform to benefit people at the
grass-root level."
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the burgeoning fiscal deficit, the
minister said out of over 1,500 billion rupees (approximately
34.88 billion U.S. dollars) of revenue collected, as much as 900
billion rupees (some 20.9 billion dollars) go towards interest
payment on debts.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that fiscal consolidation was not a mere condition of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Sinha said it was a real
issue for all concerned as "we can't afford to keep on borrowing
year after year at the cost of future generations."
</P>
<P>
However, he warned against any artificial or rigid cap on
borrowing hitting plan and social investments as it would have
deleterious effect on the economy.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to cut non-plan expenditure, saying the
government was committed to implementing zero-based budgeting by
retiring several earlier plan projects for which allocations were
still made despite the fact they had outlived their utility.
</P>
<P>
The central government would soon convene a meeting of state
chief ministers and finance ministers for a phased introduction of
a unified single rate value added tax system which is part of the
reform process, said Sinha.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has already indicated that
deepening of tax reforms was the top most priority of his
government.

BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China's power industry is
currently undergoing nationwide technological renovations designed
to control pollution, increase financial returns and guarantee
safe operation.

<HEADLINE> Italian Former PM Acquitted of Mafia Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Veteran Italian Christian Democrat
statesman and seven-time premier Giulio Andreotti was acquitted in
Italian south city of Palermo Saturday morning on charges of Mafia
association.
</P>
<P>
The acquittal, however, was based on lack of evidence not
because he was found to be not guilty of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
Andreotti, who remained in Rome, told the press after the
sentence that "it is obvious that I am content. For me the game is
over."
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from the Palermo prosecutors,
but Palermo Attorney General Vicenzo Rovello said that "we will
wait to see what the motivation of the sentence was."
</P>
<P>
In the trial of Andreotti on charges of association with the
Mafia, 250 hearings were held within four years, and 800,000
documents were filed away by the court clerk.
</P>
<P>
It was dubbed "the trial of the century", and it had taken the
judges more than eleven days to deliberate the sentence.
</P>
<P>
The Palermo prosecutors claimed that the 80-year-old Andreotti
made a deal with the Mafia mob to increase his clout in the
Christian Democrat party, which ruled Italy after the Second World
War.
</P>
<P>
In return for votes, prosecutors said Andreotti made every
effort to protect mob bosses from prison.

<HEADLINE> Indian Truckers' Strike Enters 3rd Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The strike by Indian truckers
all over the country has entered the third day Saturday with both
the truck owners and the government ruled out any compromise over
the decision on diesel price hike.
</P>
<P>
The government has hardened its stand and threatened to invoke
Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA), if supplies of
essential commodities were affected by the strike.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said Friday it was
impossible for his government to rescind the decision on diesel
price increase.
</P>
<P>
"We have not taken any decision at the moment to roll back
diesel prices and there is no proposal to do so," Vajpayee said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha Saturday appealed to the
agitating truckers to end their strike immediately, terming it as
"totally unjustified."
</P>
<P>
"The diesel price hike was inevitable and we are not directly
responsible as domestic prices have been linked to international
prices," Sinha told the press here on the sidelines of a seminar
sponsored by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Truckers began "indefinitely suspended operations" from
Thursday morning protesting against the over 35 percent increase
of diesel prices, effective on October 6, partially neutralizing
the 60 percent increase of diesel prices in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Truck operators, led by All India Motor Transport Congress
(AIMTC), said the hike in diesel price would increase their
operational cost, thus crippling the sector already hit by
recession.
</P>
<P>
AIMTC, apex body of transporters which represents 32
federations operating over 2.2 million trucks in the country,
called on the Truckers to reach an agreement or understanding with
the government in its efforts to press for a roll-back of diesel
prices.
</P>
<P>
The government, which maintained that there were economic
reasons for the hike of the diesel prices, has not held any talks
with the transporters since the strike began.
</P>
<P>
S. Narayan, Petroleum Secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum
and Nature Gas, said Thursday the oil pool deficit would shoot up
to a staggering 100 billion rupees (approximately 2.33 billion
U.S. dollars) by the end of the fiscal year next March "if the
diesel prices are not brought in line with the international
prices import parity."
</P>
<P>
Due to the increase of the diesel prices, commuters in the
Indian capital have had to pay double bus fares effective last
Saturday following the decision of the Delhi government to revise
the bus charges.
</P>
<P>
Prices of essential commodities, particularly fruit and
vegetables have soared in New Delhi as over 150,000 truckers have
kept off roads.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Delhi government asserted that the effect of
the strike was partial as commodities like vegetables were being
supplied to markets on tempos and tractor trawlers.
</P>
<P>
While AIMTC claimed the strike was "100 percent successful,"
the press here said that only 50 percent of truckers joined the
strike and the impact was "partial" with supply of essential goods
maintained.
</P>
<P>
Road Transport and Highways secretary Ashoke Joshi declared
that government was ready for a dialogue with the transporters at
any time but ruled out roll-back of the price increase, saying the
government was committed to maintaining supply of essential
commodities at all costs.

" to be held at the Hong Kong Museum of History, will highlight

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The 5th International
Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) opened here
Saturday with a call for the heads of government in the
Asia-Pacific region to hold a summit on the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
Making the call while officiating the congress, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said such a summit would ensure better
coordination of efforts in recognition of the transborder nature
of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"This will show leadership in the region and within our own
countries and underline the seriousness of the AIDS pandemic and
the need for urgent action to combat it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said governments played a leading role because they set
policy and facilitate the implementation of policy.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also stressed that political will would ensure that
adequate budgets are directed at effective prevention programs and
that all sectors of society including the non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), businesses, religious bodies, schools and
government departments, would play their part in fighting the
HIV/AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
He said, "an effective government is one that understands that
the virus recognizes no borders and therefore it's imperative that
governments cooperate with each other to fight the virus."
</P>
<P>
What could stop HIV is cooperation between NGOs, governments
and other health organizations to address the issues of
cross-border movement of people, migrant workers and the
trafficking of women and children, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the speakers at the opening were Jack, a HIV carrier, and
his mother, as well as Hugin who has suffered from HIV infection
for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,900 delegates including researchers, physicians,
academicians, policymakers and community workers from 65 countries
and regions are attending the five-day congress which will address
the latest medical advances, economic, social and community
issues.
</P>
<P>
Themed "The Next Millennium: Taking Stock and Moving Forward,"
the 5th ICAAP is to create a higher degree of awareness about
HIV/AIDS and a catalytic effect for better management of HIV/AIDS
in the Asia-Pacific region, and to provide the best and the latest
information on HIV/AIDS research to assist the region in
developing more effective intervention programs, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The congress program includes a series of plenary sessions,
skill-building workshops, satellite symposia, poster
presentations, community forum and cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
The congress is organized by the Malaysian AIDS Council with
the support of the Health Ministry, and sponsored by the Joint
U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS, the AIDS Society of Asia and the
Pacific, the Asia/Pacific Council of AIDS Service Organizations
and the Asia-Pacific Network of People Living With HIV/AIDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that its effort to find alternative sources of energy has
received another boost with the signing of an agreement with
Venezuela on the use of a new energy source.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the Presidential Palace said that
the agreement was signed here Friday between Venezuela's Bitor and
the Philippines' RI Chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Philippines will buy Venezuela's
orimulsion, a potential substitute for crude oil as a major energy
source, it said.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada said in the statement that the energy
agreement would enhance the cooperation in power generation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"With this, I am confident that cooperation in power generation
 between our two countries will be further enhanced and
intensified," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has been trying to find alternative sources of
energy to reduce its dependence on oil, which it imports mainly
from Mideast countries.
</P>
<P>
A recent decision by oil-producing countries to cut production
has sent world prices of crude oil skyrocketing, prompting oil
firms in the Philippines to raise the prices of their products.
</P>
<P>
Estrada is expected to meet with executives of the country's
major oil firms next week to ask them to hold any price hike at
least until the end of this year.

KAMPALA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan state minister
tendered his resignation to President Yoweri Museveni Friday for
allegedly assaulting a policeman who denied his entrance to a
ballroom in a hotel in the eastern district of Tororo.
</P>
<P>
Othieno Akiika, State Minister for Water, bowed to pressure
from the government circles after being charged in the same day
with assaulting the policeman and causing him bodily harm on
August 7.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe is among those who pressured
the minister to step down in connection with the assault, the New

In his letter of resignation, Akiika said that his resignation
was a personal decision to enable the normal course of justice to
proceed. The 40- year-old minister denied the charges in court
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Zambia-based U.N. Agencies Undergo Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- All the United Nations agencies
operating in Zambia are currently undergoing reforms to improve as
part of the process operations of the world body, a World Health
Organization (WHO) official has said.
</P>
<P>
WHO resident representative in Zambia, Edward Maganu, disclosed
this at celebrations to mark this year's U.N. Day in Zambian
capital Lusaka Friday.
</P>
<P>
All the 14 U.N. agencies in the country are reforming their
functions to enable U.N. to perform in the manner with which it
was established, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Saturday quoted
Maganu as saying.
</P>
<P>
The WHO official said the reforms are in line with the global
U.N. changes under the leadership of Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, World Bank representative Lawrence Clarke said that
his organization saluted Zambia for the role the country played in
ensuring liberation of African countries especially those in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has also performed well in the economic
dimension of governance, Clarke said, adding that this has enabled
people who have assets to improve their lives and consequently
improve the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official said there is, however, still room for
improvement especially in the rural areas where poverty levels are
as high as 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the debt of seven billion U.S. dollars, or 700 dollars
for every Zambian, has remained one major hindrance for the
country's development.
</P>
<P>
And the Zambian government has advised that the U.N. should
take stock of what it has achieved and the goals has set ahead.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Deputy Minister Edwin Hatembo, who was guest of
honour at the function, said the U.N. should reflect on the future
of mankind because the challenges for human beings have now become
more complex than ever before.
</P>
<P>
He said this was characterized by the widening gap between the
rich and the poor, the world conflicts which he said were getting
more complicated and the continuing trampling of human rights.

<HEADLINE> Chimps in Beijing Zoo Learn To Be Mothers By Watching Videos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) --Staff members at the Beijing Zoo
have found that playing videos of life in the wild to chimpanzees
at the zoo have helped them induce motherly instincts in the
chimps.
</P>
<P>
Three chimpanzees, Jasmine, Anita and Anaker mated and became
pregnant at the end of last year, but they refused to feed their
young and would even attack zookeepers. Staff members at the zoo
began to use a video of a group of chimpanzees living together in
the forest.
</P>
<P>
The chimps could be seen at feeding time in the morning
watching "Toshiba Animal Paradise" since April. Jasmine is
fascinated by their lifestyle and by mother chimps holding their
babies and feeding them.
</P>
<P>
The chimps are under close observation. Anaker had attacked her
baby and was sent to stay with Anita who had a baby on May 26.
Anaker closely watched the birth and the feeding. She would gaze
at the mother and baby and couldn't help touching the baby.
</P>
<P>
Anaker slowly seem to be thinking that she might as well have
her own baby. Now a pregnant chimpanzee can be seen in the zoo.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Protects Women, Children from Sexual Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government has
introduced three new bills in the past year to protect women and
children from sexual violence, said Elsie Leung, secretary for
justice, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Annual Gender Role Workshop on the topic of "
Protect Myself and My Children: Say No to Sexual Violence," Leung
said the newly introduced Prevention of Child Pornography Bill and
the Crimes (Amendment) Bill 1999 are aimed at prohibiting child
pornography and advertising of child sex tours.
</P>
<P>
"The government considers that unlawful sexual acts with
children should not be encouraged or facilitated, whether in Hong
Kong or overseas, and that offenders should be heavily punished,"
said Leung.
</P>
<P>
She noted that there are rules called the corroboration rules
in the existing law which, upon application, may be deemed to be
unfair towards women, who are mostly victims of sexual offenses.
</P>
<P>
"The government is of the view that the yardstick or rules for
admissibility of witness evidence should not differ on account of
the nature of the crimes," she said, adding "The Evidence (
Amendment) Bill has therefore been introduced to remove this
different treatment."
</P>
<P>
She said the Hong Kong Law Reform Commission published a
consultation paper in May 1998 on stalking in order to consult the
community on whether it is necessary to legislate against stalking.
</P>
<P>
Although stalking is not limited to family or sexual violence,
women and their children may frequently be stalked by ex-spouses
or separated spouses, she added.
</P>
<P>
In the end, Leung said the causes of crimes of sexual violence
are numerous and the problem cannot be eradicated with one stroke.
</P>
<P>
"The government will deal with the problem step by step. Our
chances of success will be increased by the support and
cooperation of social organizations and institutions," she said.

JOHANNESBURG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa might have to
expand its 130,000-strong police service to fight crimes
effectively, according to a Pretoria-based U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) officer.
</P>
<P>
It was a moot point whether South Africa's police were enough
to fight crimes, Robert Wright, head of the FBI office in
Pretoria, told a police meeting in Johannesburg this week.
</P>
<P>
The United States had hundreds of thousands of police officers
in 15,000 police agencies, the Citizen newspaper Saturday quoted
Wright as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wright also said the South African police should seek public
cooperation by winning the trust of the population.
</P>
<P>
Political will was needed to achieve a good criminal justice
system and good policing, because the government's will and
policies filtered down to grass roots level where the public
reacted positively to aid the police. This was where cooperation
again entered the picture, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pump Prices of Motor Fuels Rise in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The pump prices of motor fuels
went up by between 10.9 and 17.4 percent in Zimbabwe Friday,
following the change in the method of duty collection, the Herald
daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new fuel prices, confirmed by an official of the Finance
Ministry, cleared the confusion that rocked the country following
the inaccurate interpretation of the percentage increases in some
media.
</P>
<P>
There was confusion between the duties and the resultant
percentage increases, with some people assuming the new percentage
duties were the percentage increases.
</P>
<P>
According to the Herald, the price of diesel rose by 10.9
percent while that of leaded petrol went up by 15 percent. The
price of unleaded petrols went up by 17.4 percent and illuminating
paraffin price rose by 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increases have been necessitated by the change in duty
collection from the old system, where a set sum was charged on
each liter, to a system in which duty is a percentage of the
product's landed price.
</P>
<P>
The increases were part of the 2000 budget announced Thursday
by Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa.
</P>
<P>
Duties on fuels are now 25 percent on diesel, 40 percent on
leaded petrol, 45 percent on unleaded petrol, 40 percent on Jet AI
and 20 percent on illuminating paraffin.
</P>
<P>
Despite the latest increases, Zimbabwe's fuel remains the
cheapest in the southern African region.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Create AIDS Fund to Receive Proceeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government would
create an AIDS fund into which proceeds from the three percent
AIDS levy will go, Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We will create an AIDS fund, and it will finance AIDS-related
issues and it will be handled only by the Ministry of Health and
Child Welfare," said the minister. But he did not say when the
fund will be established.
</P>
<P>
"We have created the AIDS Council and now the AIDS levy, which
will have the effect of leveraging additional resources to the
ministry and it will be a stand-alone fund," the Herald newspaper
Saturday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The fund will have a clear constitution directed at attending
to the AIDS problem in Zimbabwe, which is claiming about 1,200
lives per week, Murerwa said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the high incidence of diseases, particularly the
AIDS pandemic, the health sector had become seriously under-funded
and the situation was worsened by the escalating cost of drugs in
the face of a depreciated currency and strong cost-push
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is reportedly ranked as the second most seriously
affected country in the world, with 500,000 children having been
orphaned by AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia's Marginalized Agriculture Regains Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 23 (Xinhua) -- When Malaysia is
endeavoring for an economic recovery, its agricultural sector that
had been  marginalized during the industrialization process in
the past decades has regained the government's attention.
</P>
<P>
It is the two-year old economic turmoil which saw the outflow
of fund, the drying up of investment and the depreciating ringgit
(local currency) that has prompted the government's attention to
the importance of the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
As Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi put it recently
"When food imports become expensive, it is very important to
ensure that we can be close to self-sufficiency in food production
to keep our import bills low."
</P>
<P>
During the period from 1980 to 1990, when the industrialization
process in the country moved forward fast with manufacturing
growing rapidly at an annual average growth rate of 9.5 percent,
the country's agricultural sector was sidelined with the slowest
growth rate of only 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing's share in the country's gross domestic product
amounted to about 36 percent, but agriculture lagged far behind
with only about 12 percent in the GDP last year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia could only meet 70 percent of its food requirements,
as a result, the country in recent years had to spend more than
10 billion ringgit (about 2.6 billion U.S. dollars) every year to
import food to fill up the gap.
</P>
<P>
To reactivate the sector, on which more than 3 million
Malaysians remain dependent, the government announced the Third
National Agricultural Policy earlier this year, which stresses
food security and fighting against inflation in its implementation
until 2010.
</P>
<P>
It also emphasizes increasing agricultural productivity,
private sector's investment, increasing exports and reducing
imports, and conservation of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
To step up food productivity, the policy encourages the
cultivation of new and more profitable crops besides using
mechanized and automated systems for intensive production.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the action plan of the policy was
estimated to need an investment of 32.4 billion ringgit (about 8.5
billion dollars), of which the government will allocate 11
billion ringgit (about 2.9 billion dollars) while the rest will be
invested by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has set up a Fund for Food with an
allocation of 400 million ringgit (over 100 million dollars) along
with an agricultural mechanization and automation loan scheme of
18 million ringgit (about 4.73 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The agriculture development came to the spotlight this week in
particular as the government pledged to strengthen the sector to
avoid it from becoming a sunset industry.
</P>
<P>
At the Third National Agriculture Policy Coordinating and
Implementing Committee meeting here Friday, the federal and state
governments agreed to implement several measures to develop the
agriculture sector, including the possible setting up of a special
fund to boost food production.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Sulaiman Daud said after the meeting that
this was in line with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's new vision
of making Malaysia a major food producer. The meeting gave the nod
for the creation of permanent zones for long-term food production.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a meeting with farmers from all over the country,
Mahathir said that the government was prepared to provide training
and subsidies to farmers who wanted to change to modern
agricultural methods, believing Malaysia could emerge as a food
exporter if the farmers did this.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will concentrate on the
agricultural sector because it has realized that a lot of money
was flowing out of the country due to food imports.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister pledged at a function on Tuesday that
the country was determined to make the agricultural sector remain
relevant despite decades of rapid industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's agriculture must strive to attain a competitive
advantage globally which will ensure that it remains a productive
sector of the economy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Urged to Preserve Environment for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The present generation of
Zimbabwe should preserve the environment for the future
generations not to inherit a degraded environment, a senior
government official has said.
</P>
<P>
"We are obligated to manage the environment carefully so that
the future generations would not inherit a degraded planet,"
Director of Mining Promotion and Development Titus Nyatsanga said
when launching the Global Environment Outlook 2000 Report in
Harare Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report published by the United Nations
Environment Program, degradation in Africa has been accelerated by
poverty as forests are decreasing because of deforestation, arable
lands are being reduced into useless lands and air pollution is
worsening.
</P>
<P>
The report emphasizes the need to put in place regulatory
measures and environmental standards to manage the environment
properly.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Ministry of Mines, Environment and Tourism is in
the process of formulating a policy document on environment,
Nyatsanga noted.
</P>
<P>
"If the document is passed into law it will act as a mechanism
to combat environment degradation in the hope that we leave a well
managed environment for the future generations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This will actively monitor the amount of damage on the
environment caused by mining, industrial and agricultural
activities," Nyatsanga said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Records 41,000 Tons Food Surplus in 1998/99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has recorded a net food
surplus of 41,506 tons in the 1998/1999 farming season, according
to Agriculture Minister Suresh Desai.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has recorded 2,491,728 tons of food crop production, the
Zambia Daily Mail Saturday quoted Desai as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the national food balance sheet, the total food
consumption is estimated to be 2,450,222 tons in the country.
This gives the country a surplus of 41,506 tons.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the high output to increased acreage
and improved availability of inputs.
</P>
<P>
He also said the country had good stocks of fertilizer and that
the rains were favorable for crop production.
</P>
<P>
Maize production had increased by 32 percent compared with the
1997/1998 farming season. Rice increased by 130 percent while
sorghum recorded an increase of 11.8 percent. Other crops that
recorded increases in output are cassava with 19 percent and wheat
with 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Desai said the country would be food-secure during this
consumption year because of the increase in output.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said despite having enough food to supply
the commercial markets, there were localized areas in most of the
provinces that were already experiencing food deficits due to poor
harvest as a result of excessive rains and drought during the
1998/1999 season.

<HEADLINE> Technological Gap Separates Arabs With World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior scholar of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) has warned the technological gap is
separating Arabs and the rest of the world as a result of poor
financial support for scientific research.
</P>
<P>
With scientific research being so poorly funded, 69 million
Arabs are in danger of being looked upon as "illiterate" in
terms of keeping abreast with the Internet and other modern
communication technology, according to Dr. Saeed Abdullah Hareb,
deputy chairman for social affairs at the UAE University.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab countries have to show more interest in
scientific research," the Gulf News daily quoted Dr. Hareb as
saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hareb pointed out that there are over 600 centers of
scientific research in the Arab world, but most of them do
not benefit Arabic society as they are expected.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is considered one of the most advanced among Arab
countries, especially in the field of education and scientific
research, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 35,000 students studying in several
higher education institutes in the UAE. In addition, there are
some 1,000 PhD holders.
</P>
<P>
However, the need for more scientific research centers in
the UAE is very essential as the country is witnessing
development in all fields of life and the citizens need to
be able to cope with the world's scientific and technological
progress, Dr. Hareb added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Form "Bomb Squad" in Police Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
planning to form a "bomb squad" in the police force to handle the
increasing number of incidents involving the use of bombs and
explosives in the country, The Daily Star newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting highly placed sources, the report said a proposal in
this regard is being processed and will be placed before the
authorities concerned "shortly."
</P>
<P>
Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner A.K.M. Shamsuddin said a
separate bomb squad was being felt needed as police were facing
such incidents almost every day in different parts of the country.
"Training on handling bombs and explosives is now essential for
the force," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recovery of several abandoned bombs from a
road island in the city during Thursday's strike staged by the
opposition and some other bombs from two mosques and a newspaper
office recently, he said the police were always called first to
handle such incidents.
</P>
<P>
"Unless they are properly trained, they will not only risk
their own lives but also endanger others," he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Salt to Turn Water in Australia's Rivers Undrinkable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The water in many of
Australia's inland rivers will be unfit to drink and too salty for
irrigating key cash crops such as citrus by the middle of the next
century, experts have warned.
</P>
<P>
A report on the national salinity crisis found that the amount
of salt accumulating in the rivers and soils of the Murray Darling
Basin in southeast Australia, which covers one-seventh of the
country, was dangerously high.
</P>
<P>
The salinity audit report of the Murray-Darling Basin
Ministerial Council (MDBMC), released on Friday, estimated that
the volume of salt moving through the landscape would double to 10
million tons a year by 2100, costing an estimated 1 billion
Australian dollars (660 million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
The basin accounts for 40 percent of the agricultural output of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report predicted that water in the feeder rivers,
including Macquarie, Bogan and Namoi, in the country's New South
Wales state and Queensland state, would be undrinkable by 2020.
</P>
<P>
The Lachlan, Castlereagh, Gwydir and Macintyre rivers were also
in deep trouble, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the costs will be felt in declining agricultural
productivity, social and economic dislocation in rural areas, and
accelerated damage to roads, buildings and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Even the best environmental farming practices will not
stabilize the situation and some areas will prove beyond repair,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Australian federal Environment Minister Robert Hill said the
audit was an "alarm bell" ringing after 100 years of agricultural
practices in the country.
</P>
<P>
Warren Truss, federal agricultural minister and chairman of the
Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, said the report revealed
a "disaster area" and illustrated the need for Australia to become
a "clever farming nation."
</P>
<P>
"It's quite clear from the audit that there are many warning
signals," Truss said.
</P>
<P>
"If nothing is done within a few decades large areas which are
currently highly productive will cease to be able to contribute to
the communities that are so dependent upon them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Farming, deforestation and irrigation could be the factors
contributing to the salinity, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Rising salinity levels first resulted from the landscape's
inability to cope with increasing water loads in ground water,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The native landscape could absorb about five millimeters of
water a year but farming has poured 100 millimeters of water and
nutrients annually into the earth over the last century.
</P>
<P>
The resultant rising water table has leached salt stored for
aeons into rivers, billabongs and swamps.
</P>
<P>
Salinity is also caused when trees are removed, allowing more
water to reach the water table, which then rises through salty
rock layers.
</P>
<P>
The water then either seeps into water-courses, making them
saltier than normal, or the salt concentrates in the soil after
the water evaporates or is taken up by plants.

<HEADLINE> Runaway Inflation Not to Repeat in Yugoslavia: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The type of runaway inflation
that plagued Yugoslavia in 1993 will not repeat itself in the
country, Yugoslav Premier Minister Momir Bulatovic told Serbia
National Television on Friday.
</P>
<P>
National rebuilding is under way and the latest economic
indicators suggest that Yugoslavia's agricultural and industrial
production is increasing as well as the volume of foreign trade,
Bulatovic added.
</P>
<P>
In light of current economic situation, the Premier stressed,
there are presently no economic reasons for price increases,
noting that his government has instructed the anti-monopoly
commission to take legal actions against unlawful price increases.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news confrence on the same day, Yugoslav National
Bank President Dussan Vlatkovich blamed the price hiking and
depreciation of the dinar in September on a long term shortfall of
foreign currency in the country and speculative operations by some
import-export traders.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia will not increase the volume of currency issuance by
the end of this year for financial stability, the chief of the
central bank promised.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between the Germany mark and the Yugoslav
dinar has now dropped to 1:18 from 1:14, reminding local residents
of the runaway inflation in 1993.

up over the same period of last year which was 52,385 tons,
according to the latest figures of the Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that in 1998, the country produced
112,086 tons of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has only three fertilizer plants, which produce
annually a total of 120,000 tons of urea.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar needs a total of 800,000 tons of chemical fertilizer
annually and its domestic production is far from meeting the
demand. The country has to import 680,000 tons of fertilizer
annually.
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, Myanmar has reclaimed over 400,000
hectares of vacant, virgin, fallow and wet lands in the country.
With the continuous increase of cultivated area, the demand for
chemical fertilizer also grows, hence the increased need for
imports.
</P>

To develop agriculture, the Myanmar government has exempted
import duties on agricultural materials including chemical
fertilizer.

</P>
<P>
According to the latest data published by the Central

</P>
<P>
In 1998, Myanmar produced 3,913 tons of cotton yarn and

</P>
<P>
Myanmar's annual cultivated area of cotton is 283,500 hectares,
while the annual production of cotton stands at 160,000 tons, of
which long staple cotton accounts for 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the enthusiasm of cotton growers and relieve the
shortage in investment capital, the government not only provides
annually more than 1 billion kyats (over 3 million U.S. dollars)
of loans to the growers, but also grants advance payment for the
purchase of cotton.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's locally-produced cotton fabrics are not yet enough to
meet the demand. It has to import from China, India, Thailand and

HELSINKI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin said here Friday that Russia will resolve the
Chechen issue through political negotiations instead of military
means.
</P>
<P>
However, Putin, who was here for a Russian-European Union
summit, stressed Russia will firmly crack down on any kinds of
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The summit was dominated by the Chechen issue because a Russian
missile hit Grozny on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with top EU leaders after the
summit, Putin confirmed the missile strike of a market in the city
center, but said it was a market of arms.

QUITO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian government
announced on Friday it will postpone payment of interests on the
Eurobonds in part of the country's foreign debt due next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Alfredo Arezaga told reporters that his
country "has decided to deal with the foreign debt issue within a
global strategy" that includes the rescheduling of the "Eurobonds"
for 500 million U.S dollars.
</P>
<P>
One month ago, Ecuador made decisions on partial moratorium on
the payment of the "Brady bonds," indicating the country lost the
capability of payment to adequately fulfill its international
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, in its worst economic crisis in decades, says it
cannot repay its 13 billion U.S dollar in debts, which take up
more than half of its annual budget.

<HEADLINE> New Coach Brings Higher Expectations to Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Like most NBA tams that did
not reach their ultimate goal in the 1998-99 season, the Los
Angeles Lakers have entered this season with a different look.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Lakers began the season with aspirations of
winning the NBA Championship, but fell short when they were swept
in the Western Conference semi-finals by the eventual champion San
Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
In the offseason, Lakers owner Jerry Buss brought in Phil
Jackson as the 19th coach in franchise history. Jackson, of course,
is best known for his work with the six-time NBA champion Chicago
Bulls and he will be called upon to get the Lakers back to the NBA
Finals for the first time since 1991. Jackson sports a .733
playoff winning percentage, the best in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
Among Jackson's biggest challenges is getting the talented
Lakers to buy into his triple-post offense. And although the
offense worked wonders in Chicago, that was a guard-oriented team
with a different makeup, and no legitimate low-post scoring threat
who possessed the talent of Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
Still, Jackson insists that Shaq will fit into the offense
perfectly and points to a former Lakers center as prof of this.
</P>
<P>
"People who say that Shaq won't fit into the offense are
mistaken," Jackson said. "Wilt Chamberlain thrived in this offense
back in his time because it takes full advantage of a big man's
skills."
</P>
<P>
Given the complexity of the offense, Jackson has brought a few
familiar faces to Los Angeles with him to ease the transition.
Among them are triangle guru and assistant coach Tex Winter,
former Bulls point guard Ron Harper and former Bulls center John
Salley.
</P>
<P>
"It's a complex system to learn," Lakers forward Robert Horry
said, "But I love it. It really gets the ball moving around and
creates a lot of options. You have to think the game through a lot
more to execute it, but it will certainly make us very difficult
to defend."
</P>
<P>
The team also looked to recapture some of its past glory while
addressing its biggest need, some toughness under the boards, by
bringing forward A.C. Green back to the place where began his
career.
</P>
<P>
Green was a part of the "Showtime" Lakers with Magic Johnson in
the 1980s. Green is known for his toughness and hustle and will
add depth to the Lakers frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
The new veterans will be a complement to the Lakers core group
of Shaq, Kobe Bryant, Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, Horry and
sharshooter Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
"What I like about this team is not just the star power, but
the depth," Jackson said. "You go beyond our first couple of
players and we have a lot of guys who can do a lot of things well.
This is obviously a big advantage for us, and gives us a lot of
flexibility in what we can do."

imports of the SEZ stood at 1.8379 billion US dollars, up 17.8

<HEADLINE> Turf Sector to Go Prosperous in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua)-- According to today's China Daily,
the turf sector has been ready to grow into a prosperous industry
in China, some experts attending the China International Turf,
Landscape and Equipment Exposition said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the turf seeds and higher-grade garden
equipment used in China are imported. Statistics indicate that
China's turf-seed imports have grown over 70 percent on annual
basis since the early 1990s while the export to some Southeast
Asian countries declined significantly due to the financial
turmoil there.
</P>
<P>
China's imports of landscape machinery used in the turf
industry equalled exports.
</P>
<P>
The constant improvement of living standard for the Chinese
people has prompted the rapid expansion of landscaping. "An
increasing number of foreign turf seed companies and machinery
suppliers are keen to enter the Chinese market, while many
domestic enterprises and users are avid to buy quality turf and
seeds and high-class gardening machinery," said Lei Yuxin,
director of the National Agriculture Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Experts have foreseen a bright future of the turf seed industry
expansion, given China's low lawn annual production capacity of 1,
500 hectares, only seven percent of that in Florida in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, China's per capita green area stands at 5.54
square meters which leaves a wide range for the expansion of turf
lands and provides a tremendous market for entrepreneurs worldwide,
according to some experts.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombian police
seized Friday half a ton of cocaine hidden in a bus and detained
two suspects in the drug-smuggling case.
</P>
<P>
The drug was discovered early Friday during an inspection made
by agents, police said.
</P>
<P>
The drug had been loaded in the bus in the Putumayo jungle
region in the border with Ecuador, and its destination was the
Colombian capital before it would be shipped to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Over the first eight months of this year, Colombian police have
seized 20 tons of assorted drugs and detained some 1,000 suspects
involved in the smuggling of the drugs.

<HEADLINE> Bad Bank Loans Increase Slightly in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The non-performing loans (NPLs)
of the Philippine banking system moved up slightly to 14.36
percent of its total loan portfolio in August from 14.3 percent
recorded a month earlier, according to a Philippine newspaper
report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post quoted Central Bank Governor Rafael
Buenaventura as saying that the "very negligible uptick" in the
NPL ratio was due to adjustments in statistical figures due to
"movements in the peso-dollar exchange rate."
</P>
<P>
"It shows that it (banking system) is very stable as there was
hardly any movement," he said, noting the NPLs should go down in
September with the entry of the central bank's 250 million U.S.
dollars of syndicated loans, or external borrowing from foreign
banks.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said that the 250 million dollars could be added
into the loan base of local banks.
</P>
<P>
The external borrowing, the paper said, would allow local banks
to increase lending and the expected higher lending activity could
lower the NPL figure.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says China Poses No Threat to Panama Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. military and State
Department officials said on Friday that China posed no threat to
the security of the Panama Canal or the U.S. after the U.S.
withdraws from the canal by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before a Senate panel, Marine General Charles
Wilhelm, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said that there is no
evidence China has designs on the canal through Hutchison-Whampoa
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba and China have strong economic interests in Panama, but
do not pose a threat to the security of the canal at this time,"
Wilhelm told a Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
Also testifying at the hearing, Lino Gutierrez, deputy
assistant secretary of state, said the U.S. intelligence community
has explored alleged links between Hutchinson-Whampoa and China
and possible Chinese influence over the canal.
</P>
<P>
"After reviewing the results of this study and others, we have
concluded in the Department of State that the presence of
Hutchinson-Whampoa in Panama in the ports of Balboa and Cristobal
does not represent a threat to canal operations or other U.S.
interests in Panama," Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, Hutchison's operations are limited to
loading and unloading and storing cargo containers. They are also
developing port facilities with a view toward making Cristobal the
hub of their operations in the Pacific Ocean, in much the same
manner, I understand, that the Bahamas are their hub in the
Atlantic," the official added.
</P>
<P>
The administration officials testifying before the hearing said
they believe that the Hong Kong-based company has no authority
over the operation of the canal or the transit and piloting of
ships.
</P>
<P>
On December 31, the U.S. government is expected to hand over
control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanian government.
</P>
<P>
A few U.S. lawmakers with strong anti-China sentiment speculate
that operations of the Hutchinson-Whampoa in the region will "
endanger the security of the United States" after a subsidiary of
Hutchison-Whampoa won in 1997 a 25-year lease to operate ports at
the Canal.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison-Whampoa is a Hong Kong-based shipping company which
controls 10 percent of global maritime container traffic.

The summit of party secretaries said the aim was to open up a

reproduction" of the political experience of 1996, when Romano
Prodi, now president of the European Commission, led the original
Olive Tree, became Italian prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Ferrari Begins Fight Against Disqualification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Ferrari Friday began to state its
case in the appeals hearing on its controversial disqualification
from the Malaysian Grand Prix when it was poised to win the
Formula One world title.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, Eddie Irvine, the
Irishman whose victory in Sunday's race put him in the lead with
one race to go, was present as proceedings began Friday at the
headquarters of the motor-racing governing body FIA in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The panel is to announce its verdict at 11 a.m. local Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"My defense will have historical and moral character," said
Rosario Alessi, chairman of the Italian Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
"I will try to explain that Ferrari cannot be accused of
cheating," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's appeal against its disqualification, which
effectively hands the Formula One title to McLaren's Mika Hakkinen,
has the support of many big names in the sport, including Formula
One boss Bernie Ecclestone.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's two cars were disqualified from the race after a one-
two victory that seemed to put the team within grasp of victory in
the Formula One drivers' and constructors' championships.
</P>
<P>
The disqualification was ordered by the race stewards because
of the upper part of the two cars' deflector panels were 10mm
outside the limits set for the bodywork by the sport's technical
regulations.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed here tomorrow the disqualification would give the
McLaren-Mercedes team's defending champion, Mika Hakkinen, his
second title in a row with one race left to go.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's Eddie Irvine, whose win at Malaysia had put him in
the lead in the drivers' championship, would be left with 60
points to Hakkinen's 72.
</P>
<P>
Even the ten points from a win in Japan on October 31 would not
allow him to catch the Finn.
</P>
<P>
A negative FIA ruling on the appeal will also give the British-
German McLaren- Mercedes team victory in the constructors'
championship with 120 points.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's main defense is that the extra centimeter on the
deflector was a bona fide mistake which did not affect the cars
speed.
</P>
<P>
It has also asked why the same deflectors were not objected to
in the Nuerburgring race in Germany last month.

<HEADLINE> Former French Resistance Fighter Helps Papon Flee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Robert de la Rochefoucaud, a
former Resistance fighter against Nazi occupation, aided Maurice
Papon to flee France by letting the latter use his own passport,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with radio Europe 1, Rochefoucaud, 74, said
that he regarded it "an honor" to have let Papon use his name when
he was on the run in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his concern that Papon, 89, would commit
suicide in jail.
</P>
<P>
Rochefoucaud said that he held a great admiration for Papon and
was always ready to help him.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the French judicial authorities for neglecting
what Papon had done in helping the Resistance during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Papon was extradited by the Swiss authorities to France Friday
afternoon and was jailed in a prison near Paris in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Convicted of deporting 1,560 Jews to Nazi death camps when he
was an official of the French Vichy regime, Papon was condemned to
10 years in prison for complicity in crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The French government has launched an investigation into who
have helped Papon flee the country earlier this month, because he
had three passports on him.

<HEADLINE> Straw Promises Safety of World Cup to FIFA Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack
Straw told FIFA officials here on Friday that England would be
host for a secure World Cup in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Straw, a Blackburn Rovers fan, said: "English football has been
transformed and is booming once more.
</P>
<P>
"Mass hooliganism no longer blights our national game. I
believe that England is better prepared than any of its rivals to
host a safe and secure World Cup," he told six-member FIFA
inspection team, who is on a fact-finding trip to England.
</P>
<P>
The Football (Offences and Disorder) Act 1999 became law
earlier this year to strengthen the powers against football
hooligans at matches in England and Wales and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Straw said: "Thanks to the commitment of the football
authorities, football clubs, the police and the National Criminal
Intelligence Service our security systems are cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
"Our stewarding and policing are widely considered to be the
most effective in the world and we must not overlook the
commitment to change the culture of the game from the supporters
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"New, excellent football stadia have been developed and there
have been dramatic improvements in terms of crowd safety and
management."
</P>
<P>
He said the new football act had given the police and courts
tough powers to prevent convicted trouble-makers attending matches.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I am convinced that England has an extremely strong
bid and that all our security agencies, arguably the best in the
world, will be on top of their game to ensure the World Cup is a
safe and secure festival of football."
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the FIFA team was flown by helicopter to
Wembley Stadium.
</P>
<P>
At the London stadium, England's 1966 World Cup hero Sir Geoff
Hurst, who is now an England 2006 ambassador, was outlining its
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In their tour of possible hosts, the FIFA inspectors have
already visited Germany and are due to fly to South Africa,
Morocco and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
FIFA will decide host of the 2006 World Cup next July.

<HEADLINE> Papon in Jail After Extradition by Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Nazi collaborator Maurice
Papon was jailed in the Fresnes prison in Val-de-Marne near Paris
after being extradited by the Swiss authorities late Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Papon was flown to the
prison on a helicopter at 21:30 local time.
</P>
<P>
Papon, 89, was arrested at dawn Friday in a hotel near Berne by
Swiss federal police, one day after France issued an international
arrest warrant against him.
</P>
<P>
He fled France on October 11 to escape justice in his home
country before the French supreme court was due to make a final
decision on his case.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court rejected his appeal Thursday, making his
condemnation to 10 years in prison definite.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that a heavy police deployment was made around the
Fresnes prison before Papon arrived and all public accesses to the
prison compound were blocked.
</P>
<P>
Papon was condemned in April 1998 by an Assize Court in
Bordeaux for complicity in crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
He was convicted of deporting 1,560 Jews from the Gironde
region in southwest France to Nazi death camps, when he was a
senior official of the Vichy collaboration regime during World War
II.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Shows Off Strong Profit in Merger Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- One of Canada's two national
flag carriers, Air Canada, announced a huge profit Friday to
strengthen its own bid to merge with the other carrier Canadian
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The profit reached 124 million Canadian dollars (about 84
million U.S. dollars) in the third quarter, bringing its total of
the first nine months to 200 million dollars (about 135 million
U.S. dollars), the airline said.
</P>
<P>
"For the first nine months of 1999, Air Canada has recorded its
best ever operating income and highest operating margin" for the
past decade, according to chief executive of the airline Robert
Milton.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada reported a loss of 61 million dollars (about 41
million U.S. dollars) for the same quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The airline showed off its muscles two days after it offered a
counterbid to foil the proposed merger by American Airlines and
its partner Onex Corp.
</P>
<P>
Onex said in late August it would merge the two airlines into
one national carrier at the cost of 5,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada is trying to soften job cuts to 2,500 by gaining 35
percent of its own shares and taking over the losing Canadian
Airlines under its own plan.
</P>
<P>
The bid, backed by Lufthans, United Airlines and the Canadian
Imperial Bank Commerce, is blocking the way for Onex to acquire
two thirds of the shares needed for the merger.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Okays Phase-Out of Central African Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday voted unanimously to decide to phase out the
1,350-member U.N. Mission in the Central African Republic
(MINURCA) by February 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The MINURCA has been helping maintain security under peace
accords aimed at ending a series of army mutinies over pay and
other issues against the government of President Ange-Felix
Patasse.
</P>
<P>
The council resolution endorsed a proposal by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the staged withdrawal of MINURCA
units by mid-December, in January 2000, and by February 15.
</P>
<P>
The move would leave 185 military personnel to provide security
for U.N. personnel and property during liquidation of the mission.
</P>
<P>
A small U.N. mission is to be sent to Bangui to examine what
U.N. presence should remain after the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The resolution noted "with satisfaction the successful
conclusion of the presidential elections held on September 19,"
though opposition candidates complained the vote had been rigged
in favor of Patasse's election.
</P>
<P>
The MINURCA comprises troops, support units and staff observers
from Canada and seven African countries, including Burkina Faso,
Chad, Egypt, Gabon and Togo.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Condemns Taliban for New Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
U.N. Security Council Friday once again condemned the Taliban
Islamic movement in Afghanistan for the July offensive which has
resulted in enormous suffering to the civilians.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the council's October president, Russia's
Sergey Lavrov, said the council reiterated its stand that there is
no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Only a negotiated political settlement aimed at the
establishment of a broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully
representative government acceptable to all Afghans can lead to
peace and reconciliation, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The council recalls its demand that the parties to the
conflict, especially the Taliban, resume negotiations under the
U.N. auspices without delay and preconditions in full compliance
with U.N. terms.
</P>
<P>
The council noted that Taliban's opposition, the United Front,
have repeatedly made clear that they are willing to talk with the
Taliban to reach a solution to the country's problem.
</P>
<P>
The council demands the turnover by the Taliban of the indicted
Usama bin Laden of Saudi Arabia to appropriate authorities as
required by the council.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden was linked to the twin-bombing of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in August last year which killed over 220
people.
</P>
<P>
The council on October 15 urged the Taliban to turn over the
person by November 14, otherwise the international community would
impose sanctions by freezing its overseas funds and denying the
provision of air traffic facilities to it.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firm to Build Plant in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Green Chinese firm that
produces electric home appliances will build a plant of air
conditioners in Manaus, capital of the Brazilian state of
Amazonas.
</P>
<P>
Li Changchun, head of a Chinese Communist Party delegation that
is visiting Amazonas, and Samuel Assaya Hanan, acting governor of
that state, attended the ceremony of signing the agreement for the
plant installation, held Friday in Manaus.
</P>
<P>
Hanan explained to the delegation the policies and investment
guidelines for the Manaus Free Zone, saying that the state
welcomes Chinese investment, especially in the textile and
footwear sectors, where it will be given preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
Political Bureau and also secretary of the party's Provincial
Committee in Guangdong, said that the creation of the plant in
Brazil will actively promote economic and commercial cooperation
between Brazil and China.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China encourages its firms to invest in Brazil,
and also expects Brazilian businessmen to go to China to seek
development opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The Green Company entered last year the South American market
with sales for more than 8 million dollars a year, which could
rise to 24 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The Manaus plant in which 20 million dollars were invested will
produce three years from now 250,000 air conditioners with a
production value of 100 million dollars.
