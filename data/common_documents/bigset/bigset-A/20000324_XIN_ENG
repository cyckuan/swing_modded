<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Guinean Guests (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met here today with a delegation from the
Economic and Social Council of the Republic of Guinea, headed by
its chairman Michel Kamano.
</P>
<P>
Despite the geographical distance and the historical and
cultural differences between the two nations, China and Guinea
have maintained sound relations which have stood the tests of time
and changes in the world since they forged diplomatic ties, said
Li.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government highly appreciates the Guinean
government's long-term position of one China and of having no
official relations with Taiwan, and thanks the Guinean government
for its valuable support for China on issues such as human rights,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government and people will maintain
and develop, together with their Guinean counterparts, the
friendship nurtured by the older generation of leaders of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of President Lansana Conte, Li said, the
Guinean government has been actively exploring a development
pattern suited to its situations and have made remarkable progress
in safeguarding its independence, sovereignty, national solidarity
and social stability, as well as in economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people feel genuinely happy about
such achievements, and wish the Guinean people greater success, Li
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Briefing the guests on China's domestic construction, Li said
that China has made progress that was recognized by the whole
world, and has kept up a positive momentum of development.
</P>
<P>
However, owing to its vast population and a poor foundation to
start with, China has encountered many difficulties, especially in
developing a socialist market economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The recently-concluded Third Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) and the Third Session of the Ninth CPPCC
National Committee summarized the country's previous work and drew
up a plan for future work, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will rely firmly on the Chinese people's innovative spirit,
overcome all difficulties, and continue to push forward the
construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kamano said that all the members of the Guinea delegation are
delighted to visit friendly China, and the mission of the visit is
to establish friendly relations of cooperation between the Guinean
Economic and Social Council and the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
Amidst an ever-changing international situation, he said, China
always sides with Guinea and gives Guinea selfless assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Guinean government and people thank the Chinese government
and people for their consistent support, Kamano said.
</P>
<P>
He praised China's achievements in economic construction,
saying China's experience could be valuable to other developing
countries, including Guinea.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Kamano reiterated that Guinea believes
that there is but one China, and China cannot be split up.
</P>
<P>
The Guinean delegation arrived here yesterday for a good-will
visit at the invitation of the CPPCC National Committee.

<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing Visits Anti-Superstition Photo Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese leader Li Lanqing
today hailed the ongoing photo exhibition here on superstition and
civilization as conducive to the healthy development of young
people and society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and vice-premier, paid a visit
this evening to the exhibition at the Military Museum of the
Chinese People's Revolution, which exposes the Falong Gong cult
and other kinds of superstition, and highlights the huge
contribution science has made to human progress.
</P>
<P>
Li said the exhibition is very educational as it puts science
and superstition, civilization and fallacy in sharp contrast with
one another.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition sends a message to viewers of respect for
science and opposition to superstition, Li said.
</P>
<P>
It also helps viewers to better understand the evil nature of
cults like Falun Gong and improves the knowledge of the general
public.
</P>
<P>
He called on all departments concerned to hold more such
activities to help young people cultivate a correct philosophy and
belief in science and civilization.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he hoped that the exhibition would be shown
in other cities, so that more people would have a chance to view
it.
</P>
<P>
 A total of the 50,000 tickets for the exhibition have been
sold during the past two days. The exhibition opened Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Minister Leaves for OPEC Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad
Rashid left here on Friday for Vienna to attend the ministerial
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), a reliable official source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting due March 27, Amir will put forward a proposal on
increasing Iraq's oil production, said the source.
</P>
<P>
"But what is the use of it?" the source complained. "We are
still under U.N. sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The source told Xinhua that Rashid left here in advance. Because
of the U.N. air ban, he has to take a ride of more than ten hours
to go to Jordan first and then flies to Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oil minister made remarks about oil output increase
after a meeting with the visiting Venezuelan Minister of Energy and
Mines Ali Rodriguez Araque last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will consider increasing oil production in line with "the
present demand and our capabilities," said Rashid.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq has warned that the crippling U.N. sanctions have
put Iraq's oil industry in a "critical" situation as the country is
suffering acute dearth of oil equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil output, now standing at 1.9 million barrels a day,
are monitored by the U.N., not by the OPEC.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Iran, two heavy-weight oil producers of OPEC,
have agreed that the world oil producing countries should guarantee
adequate and timely supplies for the good of the world's economy.
</P>
<P>
Such a move was seen as a signal that major oil producers will
ease their present production curb agreed upon by OPEC and non-OPEC
countries last March to uplift oil prices which dropped to an all-
time low in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement due to expire by the end of this month, OPEC
members slashed their output by 1.7 million barrels per day from
April 1, 1999, while non-OPEC producers cut their daily production
by 400,000 barrels. The move has drastically boosted oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials, including President Bill Clinton, have
been lobbying for a rise in oil output to lower the surging oil
prices, which have jumped over 34 U.S. dollars per barrel, the
highest since November 1990.
</P>
<P>
Following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq has been under
crippling U.N. sanctions and is allowed to use part of its oil
export revenues to buy humanitarian supplies for its people
suffering from the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Accession Process Irreversible: EU Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Commissioner
for Enlargement Gunter Verheugen said here Friday that Cyprus' EU
accession process is "irreversible" and the country is "very well
on track, with no particular problems."
</P>
<P>
Verheugen, a German politician, arrived here Thursday for a
three-day visit to Cyprus, the first since his appointment to the
post.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Cyprus' chief negotiator with the EU Geoge
Vassiliou, Verheugen said the two sides focused on the
institutional reforms of the EU, EU membership talks in general and
the accession negotiations with Cyprus in particular.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus' EU accession process is very well on track,
adding that the EU Commission, the standing executive body of the
EU, is strongly committed to continuing the process of accession
based on the principles of speed and quality.
</P>
<P>
Verheugen stressed that the process is irreversible "but we have
to do it right for the interests of both sides."
</P>
<P>
"Good preparation on the side of the candidate countries and on
the EU side is needed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in July 1990 and opened
accession talks in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the EU official said that the Republic of Cyprus
represents the island as a whole in the accession talks with the
EU.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of separate negotiations with the
Turkish Cypriot community.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Pays Full OAU Dues on Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has not fallen behind on
its payments to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) despite
the critical shortage of foreign exchange, a high-ranking foreign
ministry official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Secretary Tobias Mapuranga said Zimbabwe always
paid its contributions to the OAU in full and on time.
</P>
<P>
He said a payment of assessed contribution of 743,418 U.S.
dollars for the year 1999/2000 dues from Zimbabwe was being
effected through the country's embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is not among the countries in arrears," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said
the continental body's work was being threatened because member
states were increasingly falling behind on their payments.
</P>
<P>
Only nine of the organization's 53 member states were up to
date with payments, with total arrears now standing at more than
58 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The OAU proposed to cut its expenditure by 12.4 percent in the
2000/01 period.
</P>
<P>
Salim said Burkina Faso, Egypt, Lesotho, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, Senegal, South Africa and Swaziland had paid their
contributions in full.

<HEADLINE> 153 More Bodies of Cult Members Exhumed in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 153 bodies of cult
members have been exhumed Friday afternoon from three mass graves
in Rukungiri District of Uganda, 320 km southwest of the capital
city Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The three graves were discovered in the former residential
places of the cult members in Kashenyi Village, some 60 km from
the Kanungu church where more than 530 members of the cult
Movement for the Restoration of Ten Commandments of God were burnt
to death last Friday.
</P>
<P>
District Information Officer Bakandema William told Xinhua at
the site that the newly exhumed bodies were mainly women and
children who were mostly strangled or hanged to death although
there are some wounds in the bodies. Xinhua reporters saw 94
adult bodies and 59 children's bodies at the site.
</P>
<P>
"The bodies have been in the graves from about several months
and it is obvious that it is more like murder than suicide," the
officer said.
</P>
<P>
Lugudo Abm, a forensic expert from Kampala, said that he was
really shocked at the brutality of the cult leaders who were most
probably the murderers.
</P>
<P>
Local residents said the cult members who used to live in the
houses were from neighboring districts and they seldom
communicated with local people.
</P>
<P>
This is the second case of mass murder by cult leaders recently
found in Uganda. Last Friday, hundreds of cult members were burnt
to death in a crowded church, among them there were 78 children.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has decided to disband the cult and will
set up a commission of inquiry to look into the cult activities.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Vows to Fight Against TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Health Minister David
Mpamba promised here Friday to do everything possible to reduce
tuberculosis (TB) cases in the African country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the commemoration of the World TB Day under the
theme "forging new partnerships to stop TB", he said the TB
infection was posing a real threat to individuals, communities and
the nation as whole, with the most productive and economically
active segment of the population being hit most.
</P>
<P>
He said the TB case rate increased to over 400 per 100,000
population and the number of reported TB cases rose from 7,000 in
1984 to over 40,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function World Health Organization (WHO)
country representative, Edward Maganu, said TB, like HIV/AIDS, is
a regional emergency requiring extraordinary action on the part of
governments, private sector and the community at large.
</P>
<P>
He said it is estimated that between 35 and 45 percent of all
new TB cases in the region are infected with HIV and TB alone
accounts for about 40 percent of AIDS deaths in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said African governments should translate the political will
and commitment into concrete actions to implement effective TB
control program by allocating adequate resources and ensuring
strong leadership and accountability.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Treats Death of Cult Members as Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have said that
they now treat the death of cult members in Rukungiri District as
murder, ruling out any possibility of mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
Radio Uganda quoted Police Spokesman Asuman Mugenyi as saying
Friday that the nature of the case can be nothing but murder.
</P>
<P>
A total of 153 bodies of cult members were exhumed Friday
afternoon from three mass graves in Rukungiri District of Uganda,
320 km southwest of the capital city Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The three graves were discovered in the former residential
places of the cult members in Kashenyi Village, some 60 km from
the Kanungu church where more than 530 members of the cult
Movement for the Restoration of Ten Commandments of God were burnt
to death a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Although the police have not yet established whether some of
the cult leaders have been on the run or killed themselves, it
can be sure that it is them who murdered the cult members for the
money and properties, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Cult leaders asked their followers to sell all their properties
and give them the money so that they can go to heaven after
death. The cult is reportedly having thousands of believers and
it has branches in several districts of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in State House Thursday, Minister of
Internal Affairs Edward Rugumayo said that chances of treating
the cases as murder were increasing.
</P>
<P>
With exhuming of more bodies of the cult members who were
strangled to death or cut to death, the nature of the cases
changed. Previously, police sources said that the 530 believers of
the cult burned themselves in a Kanungu church.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has not yet said what actions to be
taken now that the nature of the case has changed.

<HEADLINE> S. African Arms Sale Up in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 53 countries bought various categories of
conventional arms from South Africa in 1999, the National
Conventional Arms Control Committee said in a statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, buying arms worth more than 300 million rand (46.87
million dollars), topped the list, followed by India (205 million
rand or 32 million dollars) and the United Arab Emirates (101
million rand or 15.78 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The National Conventional Arms Control Committee has been
consistent in the decision taken in August 1998 that no lethal
equipment will be exported to any of the countries involved in the
conflict of the Democratic Republic of the Congo," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"An exception was made in the case of Angola where, with the
approval of the Angolan government, ... mine protected vehicles
were supplied to a private mining company for the protection of
personnel," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It stated that South Africa sold no conventional arms to the
DRC, Namibia, Rwanda or Uganda -- all countries participating in
the DRC war -- last year.
</P>
<P>
Some 9.673 million rand (150,000 dollars) in Category D
(non-lethal) equipment was sold to Zimbabwe, another party in the
DRC conflict. This category comprised purposely designed demining,
mine-clearing and mine- detecting equipment, and non-lethal
pyrotechnical and riot control products, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, Nine Injured in Somali Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- At least one man was killed and
nine others wounded when police fired at demonstrators in northern
Somali port town of Bossaso on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of protestors took to the street after the president
of the regional government of Puntland, Colonel Abdullahi Yussuf
Ahmed, declared on Thursday that he will boycott the Djibouti
proposed reconciliation conference aimed at searching for a
central government for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to the short-wave radio reports, the demonstrations
first started peacefully in the center of the town.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators had been shouting slogans such as fully
support the Djibouti conference and Somalia unity as they
proceeded to Hurus Hotel in which Colonel Yussuf lives.
</P>
<P>
The policemen who were guarding the hotel first fired warning
shots to the air, but the angry demonstrators could not stop.
</P>
<P>
The policemen then fired live bullets at the people, killing a
middle- aged man on the spot and wounded nine others and forcing
the protestors to flee for their lives.
</P>
<P>
The protestors have then started burning tires and stoning the
policemen.
</P>
<P>
The police commander of Puntland, Abdullahi Saeed, strongly
denied his policemen had used excessive firepower against the
unarmed civilians.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful demonstrations have likewise been reported in Galkaio
and Garoweh, main towns of Puntland.
</P>
<P>
All of the Somali faction leaders except Ali Mahdi Mohamed have
declared their opposition to the Djibouti proposed peace plan,
while various communities across the country have welcomed it as
the final resort for peace, reconciliation and a government for
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The government of Djibouti, responding to Yussuf's statement,
has repeated its position that it is only facilitating the
conference, but the decisions will be left for the Somalis to
make.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 teenagers were
killed and 45 injured in a stampede on Friday when someone threw a
tear gas canister into a crowded disco hall in Durban, 300
kilometers southeast of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
A brick wall collapsed during the stampede, falling on the
children, according to South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Police suspected one of the children released the tear gas. The
motive was still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Hamilton Ndidi, deputy provincial
commissioner in KwaZulu-Natal province as saying that those killed
at the scene included five boys and six girls. The youngest was 11
years old. Another child was dead on arrival at hospital.
</P>
<P>
The injured suffered mainly abrasions, respiratory problems and
head injuries. Of the 45 injured, 12 were seriously hurt and five
critically.
</P>
<P>
There were some 600 children in the nightclub when the tragedy
occurred around 2:44 p.m. They were celebrating the end of the
school term.
</P>
<P>
There were two exits in the disco but the children only had
access to one of them, and all 600 tried to push their way to
safety, causing the wall to collapse, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Stresses Conflict Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- There is an urgent need to pay
more attention to conflict prevention and peace-building which
have been neglected for too long by the international community,
an official with the United Nations Institute for Training and
Research (UNITAR) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Senior Co-ordinator of the program on peace-making and
preventive diplomacy Connie Peck told the Zimbabwe News Agency at
the on-going workshop on conflict prevention and peace-building in
southern Africa that it was through raising awareness that
conflicts could be tackled at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
According to the Journal of Peace Research, there were 108
armed conflicts in 73 locations around the world during the period
1989-1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone Africa had 14 armed conflicts, Europe two, Asia
15, the Americas two and the Middle East three.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28 participants from the 14-member Southern African
Development Community (SADC), as well as Uganda and Sudan are
attending a two-week training program at the SADC Regional
Peacekeeping Training Center in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Peck said the program would offer advanced training in conflict
analysis, negotiation and mediation and would focus on the
pressing need to resolve issues of peace-making in the southern
African region.
</P>
<P>
UNITAR, based in Geneva, is an autonomous organ of the United
Nations and has had extensive experience in the training of
diplomats in multilateral diplomacy, negotiation, human rights as
well as economic and social development.

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese ambassador to Britain
Hassan Abdin will return to London early April and offer his
credentials to the British authorities.
</P>
<P>
The move will complete the normalization of relations between
Sudan and Britain, the Sudanese News Agency (SUNA) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I hope for accelerating the economic, trade and cultural ties
between the two countries," SUNA quoted Abdin as saying. He noted
that Britain still holds a distinguished position among the trade
partners of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The recent oil discoveries in Sudan offered new business
opportunities for British investors in the areas of oil production,
services and technologies in Sudan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Britain is adopting a more moderate and positive attitude toward
the Sudanese issues, such as the reconciliation in south Sudan,
which represents a new era in the bilateral ties, Abdin pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that such new spirit will give momentum to the process
of full normalization of bilateral relations and maintain a steady
growth of the relations. The common interests and the historical
background will constitute firm foundations of the prosperity of
relations," the Sudanese ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese-British relations have deteriorated since Britain
backed the United States air strike against a pharmaceutical plant
near Khartoum in August, 1998. Washington had claimed the plant to
be "a terrorist target," however, the claim was later proved false.

<HEADLINE> 13,000 Chechen Rebels Killed by Russian Forces: Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Up to 13,000 rebels have been
annihilated by Russian federal forces since the beginning of the
military campaign in Chechnya in August last year, a top Russian
official was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
First deputy chief of the Russian armed forces' general staff,
Colonel General Valery Manilov, said 3,000 militants still
confront the federal forces.
</P>
<P>
"There are up to 2,000 militants in Chechen mountain areas. Yet
another 1,000 are in hiding in the republic's flatlands," said the
general.
</P>
<P>
As regards the formation of the groups, he said about 900 are
mercenaries from outside the Commonwealth of Independent States,
500 are criminal representatives, 200 repeat offenders, who are in
hiding in Chechnya, escaping judicial punishment, 400 Chechens,
mainly youths, lured into bands by cheating and for money.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said the number of militants in the capital Grozny has
somewhat increased lately. They have infiltrated into the city in
order to hinder the engineers in defusing mines, prevent peaceful
residents from returning to the Chechen capital, and disrupt the
upcoming elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the military situation, Manilov said that in the
south militants have been blocked at Sharo-Argun, Vedeno, Vyshne-
Vedeno, Dargo and on the southern outskirts of Urus-Martan and
Alleroy.
</P>
<P>
He also said that to the south of Itum-Kale, rebel caches of
arms, ammunition and food are being destroyed. "Artillery and
aviation are delivering restrictive strikes on targets," he added.
</P>
<P>
Manilov described as unlikely attempts "by more or less big
bands" to break through Urus-Martan into Ingushetia and through
Dargo into Dagestan. However, he did not rule out the possibility
that small rebel groups could flee Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The general admitted with regret that bandits continued to get
aid from abroad. Over the last week alone, he said, about 3
million U.S. dollars were delivered to bandits "to back them up."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Russian army and Interior Ministry servicemen
were involved in events in Aldy and Alkhan-Yurt where some local
dwellers died, Manilov said, "Physically, the army and interior
troops were not involved in the events."
</P>
<P>
He said investigating actions are under way on the site, and
the exhumation of the bodies of those killed is under way. Only
after the completion of the investigation a conclusion on who
really took part in these events can be made, Manilov said, adding
that these conclusions have no less and maybe even more
significance for the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Moscow launched a massive military campaign in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya after Chechen separatists invaded the
neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan and allegedly
masterminded a series of apartment blasts in Moscow and two other
Russian cities, which claimed over 300 lives.

LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- BP Amoco has unveiled recently the
first stage of its plans to become a major player in the Chinese
market with a 1 billion U.S. dollar equity investment and joint
venture deal.
</P>
<P>
The oil giant plans to take a 20 percent stake in PetroChina,
China's biggest oil and gas company, being floated next month to
consolidate a joint venture gas deal, according to a media report
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The company is believed to be attempting to move quickly to
exploit the significant rise in its Asian gas reserves resulting
from the takeover of Atlantic Richfield.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco also plans to work with PetroChina developing a liquid
gas terminal and supply imported and domestic gas to markets in
the Shanghai and Yangtze river delta.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two companies plan to develop up to 150 service
outlets as part of a five-year program to establish a bigger
presence in the retail market.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe BP Amoco will have a role in the west-east
China gas pipeline with the prospect of importing gas from eastern
Siberia where BP has interests.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Review of Holds of Iraq's Contract Applications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday urged the Security Council to review the holds
of Iraq's contract applications by members of the sanctions
committee.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of the Security Council on the
humanitarian situation in Iraq, Annan said the holds of the
contract applications do have a direct negative impact on the
humanitarian program and on the efforts to rehabilitate Iraq's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"The oil-for-food program has now been in existence for a
little over three years. Its purpose is to alleviate the impact of
sanctions on the Iraqi population, since they are not the targets,
" Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"It has undoubtedly brought some relief, but many of the
essential needs of the population remain unsatisfied," said the U.
N. chief.
</P>
<P>
"The recent rise in the price of oil has greatly increased the
value of the exports, with the result that a much larger income is
now available for the program," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"However, Iraq's oil industry is seriously hampered by lack of
parts and equipment, and this threatens to undermine the program's
income in the longer term," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief once again recommended increase of the
allocation of resources that Iraq can use under the program to
purchase spare parts for the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Annan submitted a report to the Security Council a week ago,
proposing the oil revenues that Iraq can use to import spare parts
and equipment to update its oil industry from 300 million U.S.
dollars to 600 million dollars in every six months.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. statistics, as of January 31, 2000, Iraq's
contracts worth 1.5 billion dollars have been put on hold, and the
United States, one of the 15 members of the sanctions committee on
Iraq, has put on hold contracts worth more than 1 billion dollars.

PARIS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman
will make a week-long visit to France from Saturday to seek
reduction of debts and French investment, the French Foreign
Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
France is expected to sign a new agreement with Nicaragua
Wednesday to cut the debt of the central American state, which was
severely hit by the "Mitch" cyclone at the end of 1998.

When French President Jacques Chirac visited Nicaragua one year

449 million francs (about 68 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
During his stay in France until next Friday, President Aleman
will hold talks with Chirac and will meet with chiefs of several
French enterprises in the energy, transport, electronics and
infrastructure fields, said officials.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Iraq's Humanitarian Situation Poses Moral Dilemma for U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian situation
in Iraq poses a serious moral dilemma for the United Nations, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of the Security Council on the
humanitarian situation in Iraq, Annan said the United Nations has
always been on the side of the vulnerable and the weak, and has
always sought to relieve suffering.
</P>
<P>
"Yet here we are accused of causing suffering to an entire
population," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"We are in danger of losing the argument, or the propaganda
war -- if we haven't already lost it -- about who is responsible
for this situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said he is particularly concerned about the
situation of Iraqi children whose suffering and, in all too many
years, untimely death has been documented in the report prepared
by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Iraqi
Health Ministry last year.
</P>
<P>
"That report, which has been echoed by many other observers,
showed that, in the center and south of Iraq, infant mortality and
morbidity have increased dramatically and reached unacceptable
levels," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Security Council should seek every opportunity
to alleviate the suffering of the population, who after all are
not the intended targets of sanctions.

<HEADLINE> China Says Holds of Iraq's Contracts Exacerbates Humanitarian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Coupled with the
underlying weakness of the oil-for-food program, the increasingly
serious problem of holds of Iraq's contract applications has
exacerbated the miserable humanitarian situation in the country,
China stressed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting of the United Nations Security Council
on the humanitarian situation in Iraq, Chinese Permanent
Representative to the U.N. Wang Yingfan said that according to a
weekly report of the United Nations Office of Iraq Program (OIP),
as of March 6, 2000, the number of contracts put on hold from
Phase IV to Phase VII had already exceeded 1,150, with a total
value of more than 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In less than half a year, the number of contracts on hold
doubled while the total value more than doubled, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
These figures by themselves reveal the very seriousness of the
problem and present the Council with a very alarming picture, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, this problem is not a complicated one at
all, and nevertheless, despite repeated debates by the Security
Council, it remains unresolved and is even worsening, the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that all contracts scrutinized by OIP and submitted
for approval by the sanctions committee should be considered as
conforming to all the relevant stipulations of the Security
Council resolutions," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"But some members of the sanctions committee still ask for
extra technical specifications and other information from the
exporting companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said many contracts in the petroleum, power-generating,
water sanitation and other sectors are interrelated, and under
such circumstances, one contract on hold with the others approved
amount to nothing but the disapproval of all the contracts.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the total amount of funds made available for the
implementation of the oil-for-food program has reached 13.2
billion dollars but the total value of the supplies delivered to
Iraq is only 6.7 billion dollars, and in other words, almost half
of the available funds has not been really utilized for the
program, he added.

<HEADLINE> World Ocean Has Warmed Significantly Over Past 40 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The finding, by scientists at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Climate Laboratory in Silver
Spring, Maryland, is based on an analysis of 5.1 million
measurements, by instruments around the world, of the top 3,000
meters of ocean waters from the mid-1950s to the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
The analysis, the first on a global scale, was published in
Friday's journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The largest warming has occurred in the upper 300 meters of the
world ocean on average by 0.56 degrees Fahrenheit, the analysis
shows.
</P>
<P>
And the water in the upper 3,000 meters of the world ocean
warmed on average by 0.11 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
As the earth warms, from either natural or human causes, or
both, not all the extra heat goes immediately into the atmosphere,
where its effect on climate is most direct. Much of it is absorbed
by the oceans, which store it for years or decades before
releasing it.
</P>
<P>
This means that to whatever extent the planet is being warmed
by emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which are
produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, only part of
that heating has materialized so far at and above the earth's
surface.
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe that about half the greenhouse warming is
still in the oceanic pipeline and will inevitably percolate to the
air in the decades just ahead.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that the ocean may now be giving up to the
atmosphere some of the heat it stored in the early part of the
study period, but this has not been established, said Sydney
Levtius, the chief of the Ocean Climate Laboratory.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Improvement of Oil-For-Food Program in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China Friday urged the
United Nations Security Council to improve the implementation of
the oil-for-food program so that the Iraqi people will be able to
enjoy more benefits from it.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting of the United Nations Security Council
on the humanitarian situation in Iraq, Chinese Permanent
Representative to U.N. Want Yingfan said that the Security Council
should address the Iraqi humanitarian issue, especially impacts of
the sanctions, with a comprehensive and integrated approach and
from a long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
Efficiency of the sanctions committee on Iraq is pivotal to
the better performance of the oil-for-food program, and the
related committee members should expedite the release of holds of
the contract applications, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have always maintained that sanctions against Iraq will
not help solve the problem. On the contrary, it will lead to
tremendous humanitarian consequences," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, the 10-year sanctions have caused
uncountable suffering to innocent Iraqi civilians. This is by no
means the original intention and purpose of the Security Council
in imposing sanctions," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, a fundamental solution lies in the timely lift
of the sanctions. Differences among the Council members regarding
the policy towards the Iraqi issue are difficult to avoid, but
never should innocent civilians, especially women and children, be
made victims because of the political differences," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addressing humanitarian issues, the Security Council should
proceed with the same standard and apply the same criteria to all
regions and countries, avoiding both politicization and
differentiation, he added.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Donate $8 Million for Angolan Food Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Angolan and Japanese governments
signed here on Friday an agreement worth eight million U.S.
dollars, to promote food production in the southwest African
country, according to official news agency Angop.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement called "Kriii Project", the Japanese
 government will provide the Angolan peasants with fertilizer,
hoes, cutlasses and water pumps through the Angolan Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development.
</P>
<P>
After over 25 years of civil conflicts, the Angolan people are
now facing grave humanitarian and economic crisis, with a large
mount of arable lands deserted and most aliments imported, said
local analysts.
</P>
<P>
Under the help of the international community, farmers in some
north and central areas have started their self-sufficient
production as the civil conflict entered into a relatively stable
stage. But those farmers are in dire need for agricultural
utensils including hoes, cutlasses, seeds and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the civil conflict in favour of the
government, the Japanese government has increased its investment
in the oil-abundant African country which produces some 750,000
barrels of crude oil everyday, ranking the second in all African
countries.

DHAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has tremendous potential
in the tourism sector, Secretary General of the World Tourism
Organization (WTO)Francesco Frangialli said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the end of his three-day
official visit to the country, Frangialli said the current better
economy in Asia will be immensely helpful for Bangladesh to
benefit from the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
"WTO would provide all possible help to develop exclusive
tourist zones along the sea coasts in Bangladesh. Tourists these
days are more interested to see the picturesque beauty of nature
along the coastal belts," Frangialli said, referring to the
various tourist spots he visited during his stay here.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for promoting Bangladesh's image abroad to
attract more and more tourists to this country.
</P>
<P>
He said he had wide-ranging discussions with the government,
including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, on the development of the
country's tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general said the master plan worked out in 1991
for tourism in this country could be revived, keeping in view the
prospects of this sector for Bangladesh's own economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Since South Asia stands as a tourism-important area in the
world,Bangladesh can easily derive benefit by developing its
tourism sector,he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable Goods Orders Drop 2.3 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods fell 2.3 percent in February, the largest decline in
10 months as demand fell sharply for transportation equipment and
industrial machinery, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Total orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least
three years, fell to seasonally adjusted 208.4 billion U.S.
dollars last month. That followed a revised 2.2 percent decline in
January, larger than the government's previous estimate.
</P>
<P>
February's decline was much larger than the 0.2 percent drop
many analysts were predicting and marked the biggest decline in
overall durable goods orders since a 2.4 percent drop in April.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment fell by a sharp 8.7 percent
in February, the biggest decrease since April. In January,
transportation orders fell by 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation category, overall durable-
goods orders fell by 0.2 percent in February, the second straight
monthly decline. Transportation is often volatile from month to
month because it includes such big purchases as airplanes.
</P>
<P>
Orders for industrial machinery, including computers and
machine tools, fell 4.6 percent in February, following a 10
percent rise the month before. And, primary metals, the category
that includes steel, saw orders fall by 2.4 percent last month,
following a 4.6 percent increase in January.
</P>
<P>
But orders for electronics and electrical equipment, including
semiconductors, circuit boards and home appliances, rose by 6.4
percent in February after a 10.1 percent drop in the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big ticket goods, a good sign of current demand,
fell 1.8 percent in February, following a 1.5 percent rise the
month before.

<HEADLINE> Russian Security Service Reveals Details of British Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- An exposed British intelligence
agent was a senior officer of the Russian secret services in the
recent past and was recruited by a British agent in Tallinn,
Estonia, in 1999, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agent used his numerous links with officers of power-
wielding structures, members of Russian political and business
quarters in order to fulfill his assignments, an FSB statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"He received lavish cash remunerations in foreign currency for
supplied information, including state secrets."
</P>
<P>
During 1999, the agent, a Moscow resident, repeatedly took
business trips to Estonia, where he was recruited by Pablo Miller,
the British intelligence resident in Tallinn, who worked under the
cover of a first secretary of the British Embassy in Estonia.
</P>
<P>
The agent was exposed by the FSB on March 15.
</P>
<P>
According to the FSB, he was given assignments to get the
following information:
</P>
<P>
-- the pre-election situation in Russia, information on
prominent politicians and possible approaches to them;
</P>
<P>
-- presence of Russian intelligence sources in British secret
services, political structures, intelligence and
counterintelligence bodies in the U.S. and other NATO countries;
</P>
<P>
-- personnel of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR),
SVR operations abroad, data on officers working abroad and
possibility of their recruitment;
</P>
<P>
-- structure, governing and operative composition, spheres and
efficiency of operations by Russian counterintelligence bodies;
</P>
<P>
-- methods and priorities in the work of the Federal Agency of
Government Communications and Information at Russian President;
</P>
<P>
-- the economic and ecological situation in Russian regions.
</P>
<P>
The FSB said the recruitment of the agent was made with direct
participation of the police department of the Estonian Interior
Ministry, better known as KAPO.

<HEADLINE> Most Russians Support War in Chechnya, Oppose Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Russians continue to support the
military campaign in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and oppose
negotiations, a public opinion poll shows.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide poll of 1,500 Russian adults conducted on
March 15 by Public Opinion Foundation, 66 percent of the
respondents approved the military operation and only 24 percent
disapproved.
</P>
<P>
The results of the poll was released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a similar poll in mid-November, the figures for and against
the campaign were 64 percent and 23 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Foundation experts say broad public support for the operation
in Chechnya is not slacking despite increasing casualties and the
grave situation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to the same poll, 58 percent of the respondents do
not support the idea of conducting peace talks in Chechnya and
only 29 percent favor such negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November of 1999 the majority of Russians were also
against the idea of negotiations with Chechnya. Over the past four
months, public opinion on this issue has remained nearly unchanged.
The ratio of supporters of negotiations to opponents is, as before,
approximately 1 to 2, as at that time 32 percent spoke in favor of
negotiations and 55 percent against them.
</P>
<P>
If acting President Vladimir Putin initiated peace talks with
Chechen representatives in the near future, 30 percent of Russians
would think less favorably of him than today, while 22 percent
would have a better opinion of him and 37 percent would not change
their attitude, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
Putin launched a massive military campaign in Chechnya last
August after Chechen separatists invaded the neighboring Republic
of Dagestan and allegedly masterminded a series of apartment
blasts in Moscow and two other Russian cities, which claimed over
300 lives.

<HEADLINE> EU Sets Employment Targets -- Update With More Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders on Friday
worked out a somewhat detailed road chart after they decided on
their Lisbon summit to plug the 15-nation bloc into e-commerce so
as to boost employment as well as development.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres described the road
map for the next decade as a "true revolution" that affects the
lives of EU citizens, women and men alike, by ensuring life-long
learning and training and quality employment.
</P>
<P>
The EU has planned to raise its average employment rate from
the current 61 percent to as close as possible to 70 percent by
2010.
</P>
<P>
The union's heads of state and government agreed that if the
measures set out in their Lisbon conclusions are implemented
against a sound macro-economic background, an average economic
growth rate of around 3 percent should be a realistic prospect for
the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"We are not here to write conclusions or empty declarations,"
said the Portuguese prime minister, "we are here to work out
concrete and detailed measures that will affect the daily lives of
the people throughout the union."
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit worked out what Portugal described as "a
clear strategic goal" for the European Union to become the most
competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy capable of
sustainable growth with more and better jobs and greater social
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, which is now holding the six-month rotating EU
presidency, proposed a 3-percent annual growth as a tangible mark
for the EU member states to achieve to boost employment. But some
member states and the European Central Bank were opposed to the
idea while Italy suggested a compromise that the 3 percent be made
a reference instead of a yardstick.
</P>
<P>
The final conclusion of the Lisbon summit included the 3-
percent reference only as a realistic prospect though Portugal
argued that the EU goal to increase employment by 30 million
should be matched with "the creation of a dynamic growth ensuring
a sustained average annual growth of at least 3 percent".
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the union,
projected an annual growth rate of 3 percent for this year and
next.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders managed to itemize into a timetable other tasks
needed to complete to boost union-wide employment. These included
setting up the legal framework for e-commerce, liberalizing and
integrating the EU telecommunications and financial services
markets, reducing the costs of electronic access to online
multimedia resources and popularizing the use of online services
in schools.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which ended Friday, also touched upon such issues
as the Balkans and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders decided to continue pressurizing Serbia on
Friday, a day that coincides with the first anniversary of NATO
air strikes against the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
The EU prime ministers and foreign ministers appealed to the
Serbian people to take their future into their own hands and to
reclaim their place in the family of democratic nations.
</P>
<P>
Though they endorsed earlier this week plans to lift a ban on
air links with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, EU foreign
ministers decided to tighten financial sanctions to increase
pressure on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
A visa ban on pro-Milosevic government officials will also be
extended and their financial assets abroad will be frozen.
</P>
<P>
The EU troika, the foreign ministers of past, current and
future union presidency nations, will travel to Moscow soon after
the Russian presidential elections to reaffirm that sound EU-
Russia relations are important to both sides.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders demanded Russia "put an end to the
indiscriminate use of military force in Chechnya and to allow
independent investigations of human rights violations in the
region."

<HEADLINE> Greece Formally Applies to Join Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Constantine Simitis formalized his country
's request for the single currency membership during the two-day
European Union summit that ended here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the EU's 15 member states joined the single currency
when the euro was inaugurated on January 1 last year while Britain
and Denmark opted to remain outside the euro zone. Greece and
Sweden were deemed financially unfit for the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Greece reportedly plans to join the single currency group
before the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the union, has
set a whole set of criteria for the union's economic and monetary
union.
</P>
<P>
The two most telltale yardsticks are the inflation rate and
public debt as compared with the country's gross domestic product.
The EU standard for inflation is below 3 percent while that for
public debt-GDP ratio is 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the time when Italy and Belgium joined the euro group, both
were having public debt-GDP ratio almost double the EU preferred
standard.
</P>
<P>
Greece had an inflation rate at 2.7 percent in February and a
projected public debt-GDP ratio at 103 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The euro, however, has suffered a decline against the United
States dollar of more than 18 percent since its inauguration when
a euro traded for 1.18 dollars. Now it trades around 96 cents.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank (ECB) has had to raise its benchmark
lending rates four times since January last year to rein in
inflation pressures. The ECB lending rate now stands at 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The EU finance ministers believe that the single currency has
the potential to appreciate against the dollar thanks to a robust
economy in both the euro zone and the European Union as well.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the union,
predicted a 3-percent growth for this year and next.

<HEADLINE> French Judge Orders Investigation into Kosovo Leakage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A French judge in charge of anti-
terrorist files has ordered the counter-intelligence service DST
to launch an inquiry into the leakage of secret information of the
French troops serving in the multinational force in Kosovo (KFOR).
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse Friday quoted judicial sources as saying
that Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere made the decision after the public
prosecutor's office of Paris asked for an opening of investigation.
</P>
<P>
The DST, or Direction of Territorial Surveillance, is in charge
of launching judicial inquiry into events which can harm the
national interests of France.
</P>
<P>
A clash took place earlier this week between a military officer
who was recalled home from Kosovo by the Defense Ministry, and
some secret agents of the ministry who suspected the former to be
the man who had leaked secret information of the French army in
Kosovo to the press.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Jean-Michel Mechain was injured by the agents during a
fight on a street in Paris Tuesday night after he discovered that
a group of people, including seven men and one woman, were
following him.
</P>
<P>
Some French press reports quoted last month a secret document
of the French troops in Kosovo as saying that the French military
authorities were angry with the U.N. Civil Administrator in Kosovo,
Bernard Kouchner, for his pro-Albanian attitude.
</P>
<P>
A series of clashes took place between KFOR and Serb and
Albanian militants in Kosovo last month.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary on Lee Teng-hui's Resignation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee's stepdown put an end to his career of conspiracy for "two
Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan" well ahead of his term as KMT
chairman by taking advantage of his position to plot "independence
" surreptitously and destroy relations across the Taiwan Strait,
the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
During his 12 years in power, Lee tampered with the KMT's
policy of "one China" and advocated "Taiwan's independence", thus
pushing the KMT step by step toward the dangerous road of
splitting the motherland, it says.
</P>
<P>
He also connived at and supported the forces for "Taiwan's
independence", allowing the return of Taiwanese splittists living
abroad to Taiwan, who have finally become rampant destructive
forces in the Taiwan society, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary accuses Lee of changing Taiwan's political
system step by step in line with the blueprint for an independent
state drawn up by Taiwan splittists, which set up the mechanism
and paved the way for the Taiwan splittists to take over the
ruling power of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
His rumor-mongering and deluding of the general public in
Taiwan in an attempt to sever the cultural and legal links of
Taiwan with the mainland has sown confusion in the Taiwan society,
it says.

<P>
All this made him nothing more than a "trouble-maker" in the
international community, the biggest source of support for "Taiwan
independence", the criminal who wrecked cross-straits ties and the
scum of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the past 12 years has been a history
of Lee's autarchy in the name of democracy, as he suppressed the
advocates of reunification and purged the people supporting
reunification within the KMT through taking advantage of the
conflicts he provoked between the ethnic groups in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
That led to the growing weakness of the voice of reunification
within the party while the voice of "Taiwan independence" in
Taiwan grew louder and louder.
</P>
<P>
Lee's disgraceful resignation amid strong pressure from his
own party should serve as a lesson for others soon to be in power
in Taiwan, it warns.
</P>
<P>
The "One China" principle is the touchstone identifying those
for "Taiwan independence" and those for peace across the straits
and eventual reunification of the motherland, it adds.
</P>
<P>
"Those who are still trying to conceal their stance of 'Taiwan
independence' with sweet words to deceive the general public in
Taiwan, and who are determined not to accept the 'One China'
principle in an attempt to split Taiwan from China, should draw a
lesson from the disgraceful downfall of Lee Teng-hui", it adds.
</P>
<P>
"We will wait and see in which direction they will go", the
commentary concludes.

everything will be transparent, fair and of course, the integrity
of the SEC must be upheld at any given time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also hinted that Yasay, who will step down on March 25,
may face criminal charges for allegedly asking for 1 million pesos
(25,000 U.S. dollars) in bribe from businessman Dante Tan.
</P>
<P>
Tan was among the parties investigated for allegations of stock
price manipulation.
</P>
<P>
The price manipulation scandal scared investors away from the
local bourse and dragged the main index down by more than 20
percent from its level at the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Agrees on Financing Support Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), together with China, South Korea and Japan,
have reached the consensus that the grouping should have a fund as
a regional support mechanism in the event of a financial distress.
</P>
<P>
This consensus was reached between the ASEAN and the three
countries at a meeting in Bandar Seri Begawan, Bernama news agency
reported, quoting Suthad Setboonsarng, ASEAN deputy secretary-
general.
</P>
<P>
Suthad said member countries have more than 700 billion U.S.
dollars collectively in international reserves that could be used
to help each other.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, a most suitable mechanism would have to be
worked out.
</P>
<P>
He added that the meeting agreed that there should be some sort
of preparatory financing facility to help out countries in
financial distress in the future.
</P>
<P>
This matter would be reported to the Fourth ASEAN Finance
Ministers Meeting starting Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Suthad however stressed that the fund would be supplementing
the International Monetary Fund and not duplicate the Washington-
based agency.

<HEADLINE> EU Works Out Road Chart for Next Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders on Friday
worked out a somewhat detailed road chart for the next decade
after they decided at their Lisbon summit to plug into e-commerce
to boost employment.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres described the road
map as a "true revolution" that concerns the lives of EU citizens,
women and men alike, by ensuring life-long training and quality
employment.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc has planned to raise average employment rate
from the current 61 percent to as close as possible to 70 percent
by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"We are not here to write conclusions or empty declarations,"
said the prime minister, "we are here to work out concrete and
detailed measures that will affect the daily lives of the people
in the union."
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit tried to work out what Portugal described as
"a clear strategic goal" for the European Union for the coming
decade in order to make it become the most competitive and dynamic
knowledge-based economy capable of sustainable growth with more
and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
Originally Portugal, which is holding the six-month rotating EU
presidency, proposed a 3-percent annual economic growth as a
tangible mark for the EU member states to achieve boosting
employment. But some member states and the European Central Bank
were opposed to the idea while Italy suggested that the 3 percent
be made a reference instead of a yardstick.
</P>
<P>
The final conclusion of the Lisbon summit did not include the 3-
percent reference though Portugal argued that the EU goal to
increase employment should be matched with "the creation of a
dynamic growth ensuring a sustained average annual growth rate of
at least 3 percent".
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders, however, managed to itemize into a timetable
other tasks needed to complete to boost union-wide employment.
These included setting up the legal framework for e-commerce,
liberalizing and integrating the EU telecommunications and
financial service markets, reducing the costs of electronic access
to online multimedia resources and popularizing the use of online
resources in schools.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit ending Friday also touched upon such issues
as the Balkans and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders decided to continue pressurizing Serbia on a day
that coincides with the first anniversary of NATO air strikes
against the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
The EU premiers and foreign ministers appealed to the Serbian
people to take their future into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
Though they endorsed earlier this week plans to lift a ban on
air links with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, EU foreign
ministers decided to tighten financial sanctions to increase
pressure on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
A visa ban on pro-Milosevic government officials will also be
extended and their financial assets abroad will be frozen.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (
ADB) has agreed to lend 40 million U.S. dollars to Mongolia every
year in a bid to help the country out of poverty, according to an
agreement signed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used in financial, agriculture, public, social
and urban development sectors, said the agreement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ADB will provide technical assistance grants
of about 4 million dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement sets targets for poverty reduction and
establishes mechanisms to monitor the progress. It also aims to
achieve universal primary education and cut by half the mortality
rate of infants and children under five years old by 2005.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Republicans' Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Republican-controlled
House narrowly passed a budget of 1.82 trillion U.S. dollars for
the fiscal year of 2001 Friday, calling for deeper tax cuts and
lower domestic spending than President Bill Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, the Republican-written measure would
set aside at least 150 billion dollars for tax cuts and the entire
1 trillion dollars in projected social security surpluses for debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
Final approval came on a mostly party-line 211-207 roll call
shortly after midnight, nearly 14 hours after debate began.
</P>
<P>
In a replay of last year's budget fight, Democrats accused
Republicans of squandering surpluses from non-social security
programs on tax breaks for the wealthy, and doing little to
buttress social security and medicare.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which does not need the president's signature, sets
overall tax and spending targets for the fiscal year that begins
October 1.
</P>
<P>
The Republican plan would match or exceed Clinton's proposals
for defense, schools and veterans, and calls for tax cuts for many
married couples and for health care and other expenses. But such
details are advisory only, and lawmakers will shape specific
programs in later bills.
</P>
<P>
At issue was the 596.5 billion dollars the budget would set
aside for jet fighters, road building and every other federal
function but automatically paid benefits like medicare and
interest on the debt.
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, 307 billion dollars would be for defense, 1
billion dollars more than Clinton's request. Its 289 billion
dollars for domestic programs are almost 30 billion dollars below
the president's plan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton proposed 99 billion dollars in tax cuts over the next
five years, nearly offset by 96 billion dollars in higher
cigarette and some business taxes.

<HEADLINE> List of Candidates in Russian Presidential Election  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Eleven candidates, led by acting
President Vladimir Putin, will stand in Russia's presidential
elections Sunday. Following is a list of the presidential hopefuls:
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Putin, 47, former KGB intelligence officer and ex-
head of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) domestic security
service, became prime minister last August and took over as acting
president after Boris Yeltsin's resignation on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
By far the most popular politician in Russia, Putin commands a
wide lead in opinion polls. His popularity is attributed to his
bold military actions against Chechen rebels, his no-nonsense
incorruptible image and his promise of rejuvenating the Russian
nation.
</P>
<P>
Putin appeals to popular longing for a strong leader capable
of pulling the country out of its economic morass and uprooting
widespread official corruption. He pledges to stand by free-market
reforms and liberal values.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, Communist Party leader, the Kremlin's main
opponent over the last 10 years, is running for the presidency for
the second time. He lost a campaign to Boris Yeltsin in the second
round of the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
He has been unable to expand his support base, largely
consisting of elderly people longing for the relative security of
the Soviet era. His supporters are considered to be highly
organized but he has so far failed to mobilize a majority in his
favor.
</P>
<P>
Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal economist, lawmaker and the head
of the liberal Yabloko party, also ran in the last presidential
election in 1996 and came fourth. He supports market reforms with
a human face and has promised an end to the Chechen war if elected.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky and his party have never won more than 10 percent of
the vote in a whole string of Russian elections. Opinion polls put
his rating in single figures.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky claimed he will defeat Zyuganov in the first round
of voting and square off with Putin in the second, run-off round.
</P>
<P>
He believes that political talks are the only way to resolve
the Chechnya crisis and authorities of all levels should be
elected, not appointed.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, born on April 25, 1946, an outspoken and
flamboyant nationalist, leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party,
was registered in March after the Supreme Court overturned orders
banning him from the race for not declaring property of his son.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky came in third in 1991 presidential elections. He
was elected to parliament and finished fifth in the 1996
presidential race, but has lost much of his following in recent
years and is not expected to fare well this time.
</P>
<P>
He has been a fixture in the lower house of parliament or the
State Duma, since 1993, and is now a deputy speaker in the Duma.
He promised to establish a "military-police state,'' increase the
size of the army and restore the feared Soviet-era KGB.
</P>
<P>
Ella Pamfilova, born on September 12, 1953 in Tashkent,
graduated in 1976 from the Moscow Energy Institute, is the first
woman to run for the presidency and the only female in this
campaign. She is single, has one daughter and lives in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
She was a member of the previous Duma but did not manage to
get elected in December parliamentary election. As leader of the
Civic Dignity movement, she says her main purpose in seeking the
presidency is to set a precedent for other women.
</P>
<P>
She calls on everyone to get along and work together. She
resigned in 1994 from the Cabinet to protest the first war in
Chechnya, but supports the war today.
</P>
<P>
Konstantin Titov, governor of the Samara region on the Volga
river, is one of the more respected regional leaders and sits in
the Federation Council, upper house of the parliament. He supports
liberal reforms and has the image of a strong economic manager.
</P>
<P>
Amangeldy Tuleyev, left-leaning governor of the coal-rich
Kemerovo region. He backs Russia's Communists and has experience
of running for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Skuratov, a former chief prosecutor suspended a year ago
over a sex and corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin has tried three times to have him permanently
sacked, but the Federation Council voted each time not to use its
power to dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
Umar Dzhabrailov, an ethnic Chechen, is also a businessman with
links to Moscow's upmarket Slavyanskaya hotel.
</P>
<P>
Stanislav Govorukhin, a senior deputy from the Fatherland-All
Russia party led by Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov and former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, worked as a popular film director in
the Soviet era and is a longstanding center-left opponent of the
Kremlin. And,
</P>
<P>
Alexey Podberyozkin, former assistant to Zyuganov, left the
Communist Party to form his own Spiritual Heritage party. He is
seen as representing the intellectual wing of Russia's Communists.

items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.

<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>

the White House's mishandling of e-mail correspondence that may

subpoenas on matters ranging from campaign fund-raising to the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.

The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

against Japan to the World Trade Organization after talks broke

<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) will provide Lebanon a
new loan within the next few months to help the country carry out
reforms on the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Two percent of the loan, whose value was not disclosed yet, will
be delivered as donations.
</P>

CAIRO -- Arab countries are facing a water shortage problem
which was aggravated by a rapid growth in population, water experts
warned.
</P>
<P>
The population of the Arab world, currently estimated at about
250 million, is expected to rise to 600-700 million by the year
2020. The growth will lead to a sharp decline in the present annual
quota of water for individuals which is put at 1,250 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of renewed water resources in the Arab world is
estimated at some 252 billion cubic meters per year, 60 percent of
which comes from outside the Arab region and from international
rivers. Only half of the water is being utilized while the rest is
lost.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the area that can be cultivated is estimated at about
200 million hectares while what is actually under cultivation is
only 47 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Also, underground reservoirs in Arab countries hold a storing
capacity of some 7,700 billion cubic meters whereas they are
currently loaded with only 42 billion cubic meters of water every
year.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Statistics showed that the number of private cars

<HEADLINE> ADB to Host Meeting on Government Bond Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Friday that it will host here from March 28 to 30 a
conference on Government Bond Markets and Financial Sector
Development in Developing Asian Economies.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which is expected to broaden public
understanding of the importance of government bond markets, will
discuss how to channel national savings into industrial and other
strategic sectors through domestic financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said in a press release that industrial and
infrastructure
financing in Asia has been overwhelmingly bank-based.
</P>
<P>
However, the ADB said, the Asian financial crisis highlighted
the danger of using short-term bank-intermediated funds or
volatile foreign funds to finance long-term industrial and
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The ADB noted that a well-functioning government bond market
would build investor confidence in the overall bond market and the
capital market as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be attended by senior government
representatives, capital market policymakers, central bankers,
investment bankers, World Bank officials and academics, said the
ADB.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Conserve Wildlife by Reducing Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- African Forestry and Wildlife
Commission has urged African countries to reduce poverty so as to
conserve wildlife.
</P>
<P>
In its three-day 13th Session of the Commission which ended
here Friday, it said poverty among the vast majority of the
African rural population has proved to be a great hindrance to
wildlife conservation.
</P>
<P>
It said that about 70 percent of Africans living in rural areas
are poor and largely depend on wild animals for a living, making
it difficult to conserve the animals.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which attracted representatives from a number
of African countries, observed that ecological problems resulting
from natural causes and disasters have also brought about problems
in the management of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Other problems, it said, include poor policy formulation and
misapplication of legal tools by managers in wildlife conservation
area.
</P>
<P>
According to the participants, wars and civil strife in Africa
are still affecting wildlife resources conservation as the weapons
used in wars are also being used in the killing of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
The participants further noted that illegal trade of wildlife
products can not be controlled because efforts are being hampered
by lack of equipment and resources to do so.
</P>
<P>
They called on governments throughout Africa to fund protected
areas and enhance public awareness to insure that animals are
conserved.

<HEADLINE> Zambians Urged to Reap Benefit from COMESA Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice President Christon
Tembo has challenged employers in the country to come up with
means of realizing the maximum benefit from the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Free Trade Area scheduled for
October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here on Friday when officially opening the
44th Annual General Meeting of Zambia Federation of Employers.
</P>
<P>
There is need for employers to look at the agreement positively
and take the opportunities rather than being afraid of the unknown
and dwelling on the negatives, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government believes in COMESA and knows its advantages, he
said, adding that it is time now to start preparing as fellow
member states have also started doing so.
</P>
<P>
According to Tembo, the Zambian government is willing to listen
to any suggestions employers have on how the nation can go about
maximizing benefits from this common market.
</P>
<P>
The government would continue to facilitate investment into the
country, he said, adding that it is in the process of building the
investment center into one stop center.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, President Samuel Musonda of
Zambia Federation of Employers expressed concern over the high
tariff rates of electricity and imported raw materials.
</P>
<P>
These tariffs have continued to inhibit production capacities
in various industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
While commending the government for providing good incentives
for new investors coming into the country, Musonda said that the
same incentives should be given to local investors to level the
playing field.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- All necessary arrangements have
been made for Russia's presidential elections on Sunday, chief
officer of the Central Election Commission (CEC) Alexander
Veshnyakov said Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with international observers in the State Duma,
or lower house of parliament, Veshnyakov said about 1,000
international observers from 56 countries and 82 international
organizations have arrived in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The international observers will join some 500,000 Russian
observers sent by candidates to monitor the voting procedures at
94,500 polling stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
The CEC guarantees full transparency of the ballot-counting
process and the local commissions will also meet all the legal
requirements, Veshnyakov said.
</P>
<P>
He said 380 polling stations have been set up at Russian
embassies and consulates abroad.
</P>
<P>
Ballot counting will begin immediately after the voting ends
and will take approximately four hours, Veshnyakov said.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations will be open from 8 a.m. (0400 GMT) till 8 p.
m. (1600 GMT) on Sunday. The voting day coincides with Russia's
transition to summer time.
</P>
<P>
"We expect data from about 50 percent of the polling stations
to come in by 3 a.m. on March 27 (2300 GMT March 26) and from
nearly 90 percent between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m."
</P>
<P>
If none of the candidates wins over 50 percent of the vote,
the CEC is prepared to hold a second round on April 16, Veshnyakov
said. "A total of 800 million rubles (28 million U.S. dollars) has
been set aside for this purpose."
</P>
<P>
There are 107.9 million eligible voters in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Alarm on Crashed Russian Jet Turned Off: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The general alarm system of the
Yak-40 passenger jet that crashed in Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1
airport on March 9 may have been switched off, the Interfax news
agency Friday quoted an investigator as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed on the runway shortly after take-off,
killing all nine people aboard.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the operation of the plane's flaps indicated
that the plane took off with the flaps in an improper position and
the alarm system should have warned the crew of that, said Nikolai
Dolzhenkov, technical director of the Yak aircraft-maker.
</P>
<P>
"Yak-40 planes do have a switch turning off all sound alarms
in the cockpit," Dolzhenkov said. However, the data collected
during the current investigation does not confirm or deny such an
assumption, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pilots tend to turn off this system since it responds to even
insignificant failures which do not hamper the flight, he said. In
such cases, the crew controls the main parameters only visually
and in violation of safety rules.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chairman of the Inter-State Aviation Committee, Rudolf
Teimurazov, said the initial findings of the investigation
indicated that the control system components in the tail of the
plane were functioning normally and the flaps were synchronized.
However, it has also established that the angles of the flaps were
incorrect.

<HEADLINE> EU to Keep Up Pressure on Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- European Union heads of state and
government expressed their determination to continue pressurizing
Serbia on Friday, the first anniversary of NATO air strikes
against the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders, attending a two-day summit here, said in a
draft conclusion that the 15-nation bloc would keep up its
pressure for a democratic change in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"Selective sanctions aimed at the regime will remain a
necessary element of EU policy as long as President (Slobodan)
Milosevic stays in power," said the draft conclusion to be issued
at the end of the two-day summit.
</P>
<P>
The EU prime ministers and foreign ministers appealed to the
Serbian people to "take their future into their own hands and to
reclaim their place in the family of democratic nations".
</P>
<P>
Though they endorsed earlier this week plans to lift a ban on
air links with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, EU foreign
ministers decided to tighten financial sanctions to increase
pressure on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
A visa ban on pro-Milosevic government officials will be
extended and their financial assets abroad will be frozen.
</P>
<P>
Former NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, now high
representative of the EU common foreign and defense policy, was
given a stronger role in coordinating international aid for Kosovo
and the rest of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders said in their draft conclusion that the
international community needs a "more coherent and action-oriented
strategy for providing economic and political support to Kosovo
and the region".
</P>
<P>
They thus gave Solana, who led the 78-day NATO air campaign
against Yugoslavia, the rights while working with the European
Commission to ensure the cohesion of EU policies toward Kosovo and
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The EU started a stability pact for the Balkans soon after NATO
's air strikes ending last June. Up till now, the 15-nation bloc
has provided 28,000 troops for the international peacekeeping
force KFOR in Kosovo and some 50 million euro (48.5 million U.S.
dollars) to the reconstruction program in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The EU is organizing an international donors conference next
week in Brussels to pool more financial assistance to the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Local Government Restructuring Kicks Off (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the meantime, the local government restructuring also calls
for the further shifting of government functions, in addition to
downsizing government departments, the magazine notes.
</P>
<P>
It takes the coastal province of Guangdong as an example. The
provincial government there has shortened its list of items that
must be examined and approved by the government from 1,392 to 414.
As a result, its ability to exercise macro-management will be
greatly strengthened, while the market will have a bigger role to
play in the relocation of resources, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
The magazine also notes differences between the government
restructuring at the central government level and at local
government levels.
</P>
<P>
Local government restructuring has proceeded along with the
restructuring of committees of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
In Beijing, the number of working departments of the municipal CPC
committee has been reduced to 12 from 17.
</P>
<P>
In Hainan, the provincial party committee has reduced its size
by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, local governments have retained special departments
and agencies, such as urban management committees, the magazine
notes.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Leaves for Washington for Week-long Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left here on Friday for Washington to pay a week-long visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Mubarak, a key mediator of the Mideast peace
process, is scheduled to hold talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton Tuesday on the latest developments of the Arab-Israeli
peace negotiations, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Clinton will discuss ways of further pushing the
peace march forward, the news agency quoted senior Egyptian
officials as saying. He will also meet with U.S. Vice President Al
Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and congressional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit came at a time when the Palestinians and Israel
resumed the final-status talks on Tuesday in Washington after a
hiatus of six weeks. The Syrian-Israeli talks are widely expected
to restart soon after a summit meeting between Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad and Clinton in Geneva on Sunday injects a new
momentum to the process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is one of the closest allies of the U.S. in the Middle
East and Washington views Cairo as a key stabilizing force in the
region. Leaders and senior officials of both countries often
exchange visits to discuss bilateral relations and regional issues
of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Gore will discuss means of promoting the bilateral
partnership and cooperation in trade, investment and especially U.
S. technology transfer to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-U.S. trade volume stood at 3.52 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998, but Egypt only exported 620 million dollars worth
of goods. Egypt has expressed hope that the U.S. will help expand
its exports by opening up markets and helping upgrade the
competitiveness of Egyptian products.

<HEADLINE> Pakistanis Do Not Expect Much From Clinton's Stopover: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Pakistanis do
not expect much from U.S. President Bill Clinton's stopover in
their country, believing that America's tilt in South Asia is
clearly toward India, according to a Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll, whose results were published Friday, revealed that 24
percent of the people believed Clinton's visit would be fruitful
for Pakistan while 15 percent said it would be harmful and 58
percent said it would be of little consequence.
</P>
<P>
In the poll, conducted on more than 1,000 statistically-
selected men and women in the urban areas all over the country
from March 19 to 21, at least 25 percent of the Pakistanis
expressed the view that the Americans' friendship is tiled toward
India and only 15 percent saw the United States as Pakistan's
friend.
</P>
<P>
Clinton plans to make a stopover in Pakistan on Saturday after
his visit to India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's disenchantment with America was expressed most
starkly on the issue of nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
America insists that Pakistan should sign the CTBT even if
India does not. However, only 11 percent of those polled supported
this view while 40 percent were against signing the CTBT even if
India does so.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Aid for India's Rural Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton Friday announced an aid of 5 million U.S. dollars for the
spread of the Internet in rural India, saying India has the
potential to become the largest economy in the world using the
power of the Internet for education.
</P>
<P>
Addressing business leaders and entrepreneurs in the so-called
"city of information technology" near Hyderabad, 1,490 kilometers
south of here, Clinton said the Internet could help the poorest
regions in the world to have access to the same learning materials
that the richest schools provide to their students, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president, who later flew to Bombay amidst tight
security, said India was fast becoming one of the world's software
superpowers, proving that in a globalized world, developing
nations could not only succeed but also lead.
</P>
<P>
"Millions of Indians are connected to the Internet, but
millions are yet to be connected to fresh water," said Clinton,
who will wind up his seven-day South Asia tour Saturday after a
stopover in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
India accounts for 30 percent of the world's software engineers,
but it also has 25 percent of the world's malnourished, he added.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that India's software industry, which
provides 280,000 jobs all over the country, had grown from 150
million dollars 10 years ago to 4 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the importance of Indo-U.S. partnership in
information technology, Clinton said many American companies like
Apple, Texas Instruments and Oracle are coming to India.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton promised to provide New Delhi with 5 million
dollars for its AIDS prevention and tuberculosis research programs.

<HEADLINE> ADB, Mongolia Sign Poverty Partnership Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
and the Mongolian government signed Friday a poverty partnership
agreement with the aim of reducing at least by half the proportion
of the country's poor by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said in a press release that the agreement also aims to
achieve universal primary education and cut by half the mortality
rates for infants and children under five, all by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the ADB will assist Mongolia's poverty
reduction efforts in five core sectors -- finance, agriculture,
the public sector, the social sector and urban development.
</P>
<P>
The ADB plans to help Mongolia achieve these targets with
resources from its concessionary lending window, the Asian
Development Fund.Lending is expected to be about 40 million U.S.
dollars per year, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The partnership agreement followed the adoption in November
last year by the ADB of its Poverty Reduction Strategy, which
makes the fight against poverty the ADB's overarching objective.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, 36 percent of Mongolia's 2.5 million
people live below the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Drug-Resistant TB Strains Warned Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has warned the world against super-deadly TB strains, saying that
drug-resistant cases have increased by 50 percent in parts of
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we have evidence the drug resistant TB
outbreaks that have shaken New York City and Russia are increasing
elsewhere," said WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Bruntland while
releasing a new WHO report on the multidrug resistant strains.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the strains have cost New York City
and Russia hundreds of lives and more than one billion U.S.
dollars each and they will continue to emerge in other parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Resistance to at least one TB drug has increased by 50 percent
in both Denmark and Germany since 1996, and it has doubled in New
Zealand. In all three countries, foreign-born TB patients are
nearly twice as likely as native-born patients to be harboring a
drug resistant strain. The report reveals that when drug
resistance is permitted to flourish in developing countries, the
consequences are inevitably felt by wealthy nations.
</P>
<P>
"Improved screening of immigrants will not solve this problem,"
said Director of the Stop TB Initiative program Dr Arata Kochi. "
The only safeguard for wealthy countries is to help countries with
poorly-functioning TB control programs to fix the problem
immediately, by helping them strengthen their programs."
</P>
<P>
In response, top government officials of 20 countries are in
Amsterdam Friday to address the problem. They are expected to
announce an ambitious strategy to "turn off the tap" of drug
resistance in the worst-affected countries. The focus of these
efforts will be the tripling of access over the next five years to
a strategy proven to prevent the multidrug resistant TB from
developing.

<P>
PARIS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Friday that Kosovo should hold general
elections in 2001.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Le Monde, Albright said
that she "believes absolutely" that general elections should be
organized and that it is "the logic step."
</P>
<P>
"I would love to see that take place during 2001. Well, it is
difficult to give a date, but the principle of this electoral
rendezvous should be obtained, as a hope," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright also said the status quo in Kosovo is "impossible to
maintain for a very long time."
</P>
<P>
"What should be done is to let the Kosovar institutions
established by the U.N. take root," she said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is expected to hold local elections in October this year,
according to officials of the United Nations Mission for Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> China Concludes WTO Accession Talks With Poland, Kyrgyz Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China has concluded bilateral
negotiations respectively with Poland and the Kyrgyz Republic on
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) following
friendly and constructive consultations.
</P>
<P>
Chief trade negotiator Long Yongtu signed agreements here
Friday with Polish trade representative Tomasz Jodko and Kyrgyz
Ambassador Omar Sultanov respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the signing ceremonies, Jodka and Sultanov agreed
that the signing of the bilateral agreements with China would
further facilitate the growth of the two countries' trade with
China and the promotion of their trade and economic relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
On March 21 when the two-day ninth session of the WTO Working
Party on China came to an end, Chairman Pierre Girard said that
China's WTO accession had reached the final stage, adding that
China's accession is "on a good track" and a lot of progress has
been made since the eighth session in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 37 WTO members expressing an interest in negotiating
market access in goods and services, China has concluded accords
with 29.
</P>
<P>
They include Hungary, New Zealand, South Korea, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Turkey, Singapore, Pakistan, Indonesia, Japan,
Australia, Chile, the United States, Canada, Venezuela, Cuba,
Brazil, Sri Lanka, Uruguay, Peru, Iceland, Norway, the Philippines,
India, Colombia, Argentina, Thailand, Poland, and the Kyrgyz
Republic.
</P>
<P>
"Moving to the multilateral aspect of our work, I would first
like to thank the Chinese delegation, on behalf of the Working
Party, for submitting valuable new inputs," said Girard. "Here I
am referring to, first the updated Memorandum on China's Foreign
Trade Regime and, second to a compilation of some 177 Chinese laws
and regulations. These will constitute important inputs for our
future work."
</P>
<P>
Girard expected the next session, temporarily scheduled in May,
will be very important. He urged the remaining WTO members to
finalize their bilateral talks with China as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Fatness Retards Sexual Development: Experts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Overweight children are most
likely to be undersexed when they grow up, and in the worst cases
some may have difficulty in leading normal sexual lives or even
suffer lifetime sterility, Chinese medical experts warned today
after a long-term investigation in this field.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiqi, an expert in bariatrics and visiting professor at the
prestigious Harbin Medical Sciences University (HMSU), said that
obese children aged from seven to 12 years old are usually
afflicted by incretion disorder because of the huge deposit of fat
in their bodies, which will possibly restrain the normal
development of their sexual organs.
</P>
<P>
Studies on relations between overweight children and sexual
development used to be neglected, though doctors and nutritionists
have often pointed out that obesity, which is often the result of
an unhealthy diet and a sedentary life, may lead to high blood
pressure, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and related
complications.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of such diseases is about 90 percent among fat
boys and 50 percent among fat girls, Li said.
</P>
<P>
When such boys grow up, he said, they will become feminized,
for instance, with big breasts and buttocks, and high-pitched
voices. Menstruation disorders or even lifetime sterility might
afflict fat girls.
</P>
<P>
According to an investigation carried out by the Ministry of
Education and other departments, five to ten percent of China's
children are overweight and this figure is expected to double in a
decade by growing at an annual rate of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 300 million children, accounting for
around 20 percent of the world's child population.

<P>
Bai Qingzhi, a professor at the HMSU who has been studying this
problem for decades, said children who weigh about 20 percent more
than their normal level can be considered as fat, and the problem
is that many weigh 50 percent more than the normal level.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that excessive body fat is emerging as a
major health problem for Chinese youngsters, especially well-off
urbanites who eat more high-calorie food.
</P>
<P>
Ge Keyou, director general of the China Nutrition Institute,
attributed this problem to an unscientific diet and lack of
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Ge also said that some couples still hold to the tradition that
it is good and lucky to have a fat baby.
</P>
<P>
Specialists warn of a possible sharp increase in the overweight
population in the coming years, and note that obesity may become
China's primary health threat in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
And it is absolutely necessary for pregnant women to watch
their own weight.

BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
called visiting Philippine Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo

</P>
<P>
"I had the pleasure to meet with President Joseph Estrada

the Philippine Parliament. I was warmly welcomed by the Philippine
government and people," said Premier Zhu.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Djibouti National Assembly Speaker (details added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua)-- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress, met with Said
Ibrahim Badoul, speaker of the National Assembly of Djibouti, at
the Great Hall of the People here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Li said relations between China and Djibouti have been
progressing smoothly during the over 20 years since the forging of
diplomatic ties, and expressed the belief that Badoul's visit
would further promote friendship between the two parliaments and
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China advocates multi-polarity in the world,
since this is beneficial to world peace and development. All
countries, big or small, poor or rich, strong or weak, should be
equal members of the world family and enjoy equal rights to
participate in international affairs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China opposes big or strong countries bullying small or weak
ones, and advocates the establishment of a peaceful, stable, just
and rational new world political and economic order, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that China stresses its relationship with Djibouti,
and is pleased with the latter's realization of ethnic
reconciliation and the end of its civil war.
</P>
<P>
China supports Djibouti and other African counties in their
efforts to eradicate poverty and invigorate their economies, he
said, expressing appreciation for Djibouti's pursuit of the "One
China" policy and its position of not having any official contacts
with the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Badoul said during his current visit he has seen with his own
eyes the tremendous changes in China, which demonstrate the wisdom,
courage and industriousness of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly and the government of Djibouti treasure
their relationship with China, and are keen to make unremitting
efforts to accelerate this relationship, he said. He also
expressed the hope that China would realize its reunification at
an early date.
</P>
<P>
Badoul arrived in Beijing Thursday for a ten-day official good-
will visit to China as guest of Li Peng.

<HEADLINE> Local Government Restructuring Kicks Off (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- After two years of preparation,
China's local government restructuring plan has moved into the
phase of implementation, according to the latest issue of the
newsweekly "Outlook".
</P>
<P>
The March 27th issue of the magazine notes that the local
government restructuring will proceed under the direct leadership
of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The make-up of local government departments will largely be in
line with the central government, and their staff will be halved
from the current levels.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the municipal government of Beijing has announced
that the number of its departments and agencies will be reduced to
45 from 67, and the authorized size of administration will be
halved.
</P>
<P>
The east China province of Anhui declared that it planned to
drastically reduce its over-blown provincial government
departments, with about half of the officials and staff leaving
their posts when the reform completes.
</P>
<P>
However, in the southern province of Hainan, only 15.8 percent
of government officials and staff will have to go, the magazine
reports.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that when the province was first established in
the 1980s, the provincial government put much emphasis on "small
government", and consequently the size of its government is quite
small compared to those of other provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since then, the third generation leadership of the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang at the core has spared no efforts to push
forward the strategy of governing by law, the foundation of which
was laid down by Deng Xiaoping, core of the second generation
Party leadership.
</P>
<P>
Jiang advocated law lectures in which legal experts were
invited to equip senior Party and government officials with basic
legal knowledge and offer legal advice and consultation on the
country's social and economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The first such lecture was held on December 9, 1994, and since
then Jiang has presided over all 10 subsequent lectures,
occasionally speaking on his own views on key issues linked to the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
On February 8, 1996, at the third lecture, Jiang said that
increasing the role of law in running the country, an important
part of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, is an important principle in managing state
affairs.
</P>
<P>
One month later, at the fourth session of the Eighth National
People's Congress, China's top legislature, the principle of
governing the nation by law and building a socialist country ruled
by law was included in the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National
Economic and Social Development (1996-2000) and the Long-Range
Objectives to the Year 2010.

How to better protect and realize the fundamental interests of
the people has been a theoretical and practical issue for the CPC
ever since it became the ruling party in October 1949, the article
says.
</P>
<P>
The first generation of CPC leadership led by Mao Zedong
founded a regime of "people's democratic dictatorship" and created
the great cause of a socialist legal system for New China, but for
a certain period, especially the "Great Cultural Revolution" (1966-
1976), China's legal system was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, the Deng Xiaoping-led second generation
leadership has been engaged in the drive to build a socialist
legal system in order to protect democracy for the people. Deng
often said that a legal system is more reliable.
</P>
<P>
The third generation leadership has inherited and developed
Deng's thinking on democracy and the rule of law, and has
accelerated China's advancement on the road to building a
socialist legal system, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 15th Party Congress, Jiang pledged to "
further extend the scope of socialist democracy and improve the
socialist legal system, and governing the country according to law
and making it a socialist country ruled by law."

China must adhere to the leadership of the CPC, the socialist
system, and the people's congress system, he said, stressing that
this is a road compatible with the situation in China for building
a socialist country ruled by law.
</P>
<P>
The guiding principle of "governing the nation by law and
building a socialist country ruled by law" also has been added
into the Constitution in an amendment passed at the second annual
session of the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
On May 12, 1998, Professor Cao Jianjing, president of the East
China Politics and Law Institute, delivered a lecture on
preventing financial crises, which caught the attention of the top
leaders. After the professor ended his 80-minute talk, Jiang spoke
and attached top priority to ruling the financial sector by law in
order to avoid potential financial hazards in the country.
</P>
<P>
The tenth lecture was given at the end of last year, when the
restructuring of state-owned enterprises entered a crucial stage,
as 2000 is the last year of a three-year government program to
rectify the state sector.
</P>
<P>
At the lecture, Professor Wang Weiguo of the China Politics and
Law University aired his views on major issues concerning state-
enterprise reform, including setting-up a scientific property-
rights system and improving the corporate system for state-owned
companies.

For the past decade, China's legislative work has embarked on a
fast track, as the framework of a legal system with China's
characteristics has taken shape, with the Constitution at the
center.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the CPC Central Committee made a proposal on
revising the Constitution to the NPC Standing Committee after
broad consultations with non-communist party leaders and noted
figures.
</P>
<P>
Based on the CPC Central Committee's proposal, the NPC Standing
Committee presented a draft on the revised Constitution to the
second annual session of the NPC. On March 15, 1999, the NPC
session passed the revised Constitution, adding some key elements
and wording to the Constitution, including "Deng Xiaoping Theory."
</P>
<P>
According to the amendments, China will remain at the initial
stage of socialism for a long period; will implement the strategy
of governing the nation by law and building a socialist country
ruled by law; will boost economic development by bringing into
consideration the country's actual situation; will continue
carrying out the two-decades long family contract system in rural
areas; and will recognize for the first time, the private sector
as "an important component of the socialist market economy."

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leader Must Recognize One-China Principle Prior to Mainland Visit: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
reiterated here today that the leader of Taiwan can come to the
mainland for talks at any time, provided that the One China
Principle is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Qian Qichen made this remark at the closing of a
two-day national conference attended by directors of provincial-
level Taiwan affairs offices.
</P>
<P>
Under this prerequisite, "we are also willing to visit Taiwan,
and the (mainland's) Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits and the Straits Exchange Foundation (of Taiwan) may have
contacts and exchanges," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Qian said that the election of the local leaders
in the Taiwan region and its outcome could bring about no change
in the fact that Taiwan is part of China. The One China Principle
is the basis and precondition for a peaceful resolution of the
Taiwan issue and no form of "Taiwan Independence" will ever be
allowed, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The majority of foreign governments adhere to the One China
Principle and have pledged to handle their relations with Taiwan
in the framework of One China, Qian said, adding that the majority
of Taiwan compatriots are not in favor of "Taiwan Independence"
and look forward to stabilizing and developing cross-Straits
relations.
</P>
<P>
He warned that those who are neglecting the security of 23
million Taiwan compatriots and plotting "Taiwan Independence" can
never meet a good end.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and the Chinese people will never make
any compromise on vital issues such as safeguarding the One China
Principle and state sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the Taiwan issue and realize the complete
reunification of the motherland at an early date has been the
common will and sacred mission of the entire Chinese people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier said the central government will strengthen
its contacts with all parties, groups and personages from all
circles in Taiwan that are in favor of the One China Principle,
against "Taiwan Independence," and advocate the development of
cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
He called for solidarity among compatriots on the two sides of
the Straits, and called on all advocates of China's reunification
to jointly strive to develop cross-Straits relations and push
forward the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Decries Tariff Discrimination in ECOWAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Commerce Minister Alhaji
Bello has described an attempt by some members of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) to impose a common tariff on
non-UEMOA countries as a threat to the region's economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Friday quoted him
as saying in Abuja that "all our present efforts would be in vain"
if this attempt by the member-states of the UEMOA is not
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of Ghana-Nigeria trade experts, he said
the situation poses a significant challenge, urging those experts
and participants at the meeting to evolve strategies for
successful integration of the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The forum would come up with a clear position of member-states
for the take-off and implementation process of the Trade
Liberalization Scheme (TLS) of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The meeting would also lay the ground for the implementation of
the community levy and the establishment of a common external
tariff.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry Peter Pepera
said that ECOWAS was not deficient in the formulation of policies,
but the implementation of policies had always been the problem.
</P>
<P>
For any country to advance economically, he said there must
have policies which would aid that advancement, adding: "Economic
power is the determinant of a region's or country's international
profile".

in the Angolan capital Luanda for a several-hour visit to the
portuguese-speaking African country.
</P>
<P>
It is Gusmao's first tour to the African continent since 1999

emphasize the solidarity the Angolan people have given to the
Maubere people during their fighting.

<HEADLINE> First Amputation Executed Under Sharia in Northern Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A man has had his right hand
amputated as a punishment ordered by an Islamic Sharia court in
Nigeria's northern state of Zamfara, the British Broadcast
Corporation (BBC) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Buba Jangebe, a Muslim man described as a notorious cow thief,
had his right hand chopped off from the wrist on Wednesday, the
state government was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be the first such punishment ordered in the
state, which took lead in the country to adopt the Islamic law of
Sharia in January.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a jubilant crowd watched the amputation carried
out on the grounds of a state hospital in the town of
Talata-Mafara.
</P>
<P>
Sharia has recently been a quite controversial issue in the
most populous African country, where the population is almost
evenly divided by Moslems and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Despite a clash in the country's Kaduna state last month
killing hundreds of people and causing nationwide repercussions,
some northern states still expressed the intention to continue
with the introduction of Sharia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States has ruled out any
defense pact with Nigeria but promised to re-open its ties soon
with the country's navy, a leading Nigerian newspaper reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian quoted Rear Admiral Michael Hoskins, deputy
commander-in- chief of U.S. Naval Forces, Europe, as saying that
the subject of defence pact between U.S. and Nigeria was mooted
six to eight months ago by Nigerian federal government but was
turned down.
</P>
<P>
"I said as at that time as I repeat today, we have no interest
in promoting a defense pact (with Nigeria) and it is not on our
agenda. We do not see it in the terms of what we are doing in our
cooperative relationship with Nigeria," he said in Calabar, an
eastern port of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The naval officer, who was on a visit to the West African
country, however said the U.S. and Nigerian Navies "are in the
process of re- establishing ties."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria William Twaddel, who was
accompanying the naval officer on the visit, expressed concern
over the spate of violence in some parts of the country, saying:
"My embassy, my government like others outside Nigeria are very
alarmed and concerned at events a month or so ago."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the federal government as well as the
governments of the Kaduna and Abia states which witnessed
religious inspired violence recently to play appropriate roles in
assessing the extent of the violence with a view to preventing a
recurrence.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Russians to Vote in Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's acting President Vladimir
Putin Friday urged voters to take part in Sunday's presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Prior to a most important event in the life of the country, I
simply must appeal to you, my compatriots, to do your
constitutional duty, go to polling stations on Sunday and name the
president of new Russia," he said in a televised address to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
"On March 26 we will not only be electing the head of state
but also virtually appointing the supreme commander-in-chief as
the president is also the supreme commander-in-chief of the armed
forces."
</P>
<P>
"Russia is a nuclear power," he said. "Not only our friends
remember that."
</P>
<P>
Putin is dubbed to win the elections as opinion polls put him
at a runaway first place. His approval rating was between 50 and
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are electing a president whose duty is to lift the economy,
to return the country's prestige and leading role in the world and
to restore its governability. And to finally bring stability and
prosperity to everyone," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian people are the sole source of power, and this is
inscribed in the constitution. If someone says that there is no
need to take part in elections, this guy is trying to strip the
people of this power."
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's new electoral law, an election will be declared
invalid if the turnout is lower than 50 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
"I am urging you and asking of you only one thing -- go to the
polling stations and cast your ballots. Listen to yourselves. Make
your choice," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the nation has been united as a result of the war he
launched against terrorists in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We have become stronger (due to the war in Chechnya). But
while our soldiers were shedding blood in the North Caucasus, lies
were sometimes spread in this country and beyond. I want to say
that whoever used these hard times against the country and for
whatever reason has failed. Let God be their judge."

<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China will host the 2nd
International Fruit and Vegetable Processing International
Symposium from October 19 to 25 in Yantai, east China's coastal
province of Shandong. The Symposium will become an annual event in
Yantai.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment that China will enter the World Trade
Organization (WTO), it is crucial for China to readjust its
agricultural structure in order to be competitive and meet demands
of home and overseas markets," said Shen Guofang, who is director
of the Symposium and also the vice-president of the Chinese
Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that more importance should be given to fruit and
vegetable processing. China produces the most fruits and
vegetables in the world, only a small proportion of them have been
processed compared to 70 percent in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
China held its first International Symposium and Exhibition on
Fruit and Vegetable Processing Technology and Industrialization
last October in Yantai.
</P>
<P>
The Symposium this year will consist of three parts:
discussions about science and technology, products display and
economic and trade negotiations. Two thousand participants are
expected to attend the Symposium and discuss various issues
related to "A Green Future".
</P>
<P>
Chen Yanming, vice-governor of Shandong Province, hopes the
Symposium will help promote agriculture in the province and
increase local and overseas cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dehe, vice-mayor of Yantai, said that by hosting the
symposium, Yantai will serve as "an orchard and vegetable garden"
for Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Yantai, a coastal city in eastern part of Shandong Province,
was one of the first 14 open cities designated by the State
Council. It yields 2.6 million tons of fruits and 3.5 million tons
of vegetables each year.

of the State Council will launch a series of activities this year
aimed at encouraging overseas Chinese to invest in western China

environment, preferential policies, and economic and science and
technological programs in the western region through the Internet,
and also to hold on-line trade fairs featuring western China, Guo
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the office and its branches across the country will
help the western region develop relations with foreign countries
and regions, and challenge profitable overseas Chinese-funded
enterprises in eastern China to invest in the west.
</P>
<P>
Guo expressed his belief that overseas Chinese will play an
important role in promoting the development and opening up of the
western region of the country.
</P>
<P>
He called on overseas Chinese affairs offices at all levels to
work actively in promoting collaboration between overseas Chinese
and China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council last
year organized 100 overseas Chinese doctors to return for
scientific and technological exchanges. This year, the office will
also organize 100 overseas Chinese doctors to develop cooperation
and exchanges with the western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Guo said his office will actively explore ways of giving full
play to overseas talent, and will cooperate with concerned
departments to work out policies and measures for attracting
overseas talent to serve the strategy of "revitalizing the nation
through science and education."

magnitude over 7.0 on the Richter scale will hit Marmara in the
coming years, although some details are not known.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President to Visit Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
will start a four-day state visit to Israel next Tuesday, local
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The coming visit, the first ever to Israel by a Cyprus head of
state, is a return visit to Israeli President Ezer Weizman's trip
to Cyprus in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Clerides will hold talks with Weizman, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believed that the visit is a bridge-
building act aimed to cement the Israeli-Cyprus ties shaken by an
espionage scandal.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus arrested two alleged Israeli Mossad agents less than 48
hours after Weizman's departure from Nicosia during his first visit
to the island country in 1998.
</P>
<P>
They were caught spying on a secret military shipment near
Larnaca, Cyprus' southern coast and were sentenced to three years
in prison for trespassing on a prohibited military area in February
last year. The two were released six months later.
</P>
<P>
Clerides will also visit the West Bank city of Ramallah for
talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

CANBERRA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Friday condemned advertisements being screened in the
United States by the U.S. National Rifle Association (NRA) that
depict Australians cowering in their homes.
</P>
<P>
"I think it disturbs me in the sense that it is beyond belief
that an organization can get it so wrong," Howard told reporters
in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Hollywood legend Charlton Heston has fronted Internet and
television advertisements for the NRA which claims that crime in
Australia soared as a result of the 1996 gun law reforms.
</P>
<P>
Howard said Australia has introduced tough gun laws and it does
not want to end up with a gun culture like that in the United
States, adding that the appalling American homicide rate is linked
to the fact that the country is awash with guns.
</P>
<P>
He said the NRA advertisements contained lies and nonsense and
that he hopes his comments will be reported to Washington by the U.
S. embassy.

<P>
KIEV, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris
Tarasyuk has proposed an emergency discussion with Turkey over
their latest fishing dispute in the Black Sea, the Interfax news
agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem on
Wednesday, Tarasyuk said that representatives from the two foreign
ministries, border defense agencies and other departments
concerned should participate in the meeting, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk and Cem agreed that the good relations between the two
countries should not be affected by this incident.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk also expressed condolences to the families of the two
Turkish fishermen who were killed on Wednesday by Ukrainian coast
guards. The guards claimed that the Turkish fishermen were fishing
in the Ukrainian territorial waters of the Black Sea without
permission.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry summoned Ukrainian
Ambassador Oleksandr Motsyk to protest against the killing.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Ukraine and Turkey have recorded a rapid
progress after the former Soviet republic announced independence
in 1991. Tarasyuk recently paid his first official visit to Turkey
to expand bilateral trade and economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Goods Market to Grow Steadily in 2000(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by pro-active fiscal
policies and a favorable trade environment, Chinese economists and
market observers predict that China's consumer goods market will
grow steadily this year.
</P>
<P>
A group of senior economists forecast in their latest macro-
economic analysis report that China's total retail sales of
consumer goods are expected to hit 3.36 trillion yuan in 2000, an
increase of 8 percent. The retail sales of consumer goods
registered a nominal growth of 6.8 percent last year; if the drop
in the consumer price index (CPI) is taken into consideration, the
growth rate is in fact around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists pointed out that the actual sales growth rate might
be a little slower than the 10-percent growth last year.
</P>
<P>
The report says market sales of consumer goods picked up
remarkably in the latter half of 1999 as the country's pro-active
fiscal policies began to take effect. China achieved an annual GDP
growth of 7.1 percent in 1999 despite a decrease in trade surplus
and investment growth.
</P>
<P>
Economists noted that expanding domestic demand remains part
of the government's macro-economic policies for 2000. The
government will do everything in its power to "further improve the
living standards of the Chinese people".

<TEXT>
<P>
Global GDP growth is expected to increase in 2000, with the
figure estimated at 3.5 percent. Global trade is expected to
increase by some 2 percent to register a 6-7 percent annual growth.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said that growth in exports will strongly
expand consumption in China's affluent eastern regions.
</P>
<P>
Developing China's western regions will channel more domestic
and overseas capital to these areas and raise the living standards
of local residents, especially a large number of farmers.
</P>
<P>
However, there are a number of disadvantages for the growth of
consumer market. For example, the progress made in China's entry
into the World Trade Organization has made some people believe
that prices for some imports will decrease sooner or later. As a
result, they are reluctant to spend their money. This will
strongly affect sales of automobiles and a number of other
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
The economists also noted that China's on-going reforms of
housing, social security and medical care may also affect
residents' immediate consumption patterns.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: TB Remains Greatest Health Killer (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- An infectious disease that has
plagued mankind for several millennia is likely to launch a new
global offensive against the human race.
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis, or TB, an airborne infectious disease which is
caused by a micro-organism called the TB bacillus and primarily
affects the lungs, is perhaps the greatest killer of all time,
said the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
"Closely linked with the emergence of multi-drug resistant
strains of TB and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, TB has re-emerged as a
major public health problem in both developed and developing
countries," says a WHO pamphlet released in Beijing, that
coincides with World TB Day. March 24 also marks the 118th
anniversary of the Robert Koch's discovery of bacillus.
</P>
<P>
Among two billion people who have been infected by TB, 20
million have developed into active and contagious TB. About three
million of these 20 million die each year, according to WHO's
statistics.
</P>
<P>
WHO predicts that if control of the TB is not strengthened in
the next 20 years, additional 200 million people will become
infected and some 70 million will die.
</P>
<P>
TB epidemic also means huge economic losses. India with the
world's largest TB population suffers economic losses estimated at
about 370 million U.S. dollars each year due to TB-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
"Koch's discovery opened the way to diagnosing, curing and
possibly even eliminating TB. However, while drugs are now
available to cure TB, they are not affordable or not accessible to
those mostly in need," said Chinese specialist Zhao Fengzeng. "
Even when treatment is available, patients often start treatment
and stop before the disease is fully cured."

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: TB Remains Greatest Health Killer (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many other factors are also causing the global epidemic of TB
such as dual TB/HIV epidemics. There are more chances of the
infection spreading among international travelers and people's
ignorance, said Professor Zhao at the TB Control Center attached
to the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best way to battle TB is directly observed
treatment (DOTS), a treatment recommended by WHO as the only way
to reduce the transmission of TB and lower the number of deaths.
</P>
<P>
"With DOTS patients receive their drug dosage daily under the
supervision of health staff to ensure that they take the medicine
for the full six month period required to cure TB," said Zhao,
adding that recovery rates in treatments using DOTS have been much
higher than treatments that do not use DOTS.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Health, China started the world's
largest DOTS TB control project in 1992, covering a population of
560 million in 13 provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The project has helped cure 90 percent of pulmonary TB patients,
five percent higher than 2000 goal set by WHO.

<HEADLINE> China to Enhance TB Treatment Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to have 95 percent of
its population covered by an effective treatment service against
tuberculosis by the year 2005, according to the Chinese Ministry
of Health.
</P>
<P>
At present, only some 720 million Chinese people, or 55 percent
of the population, have access to the service called "directly
observed treatment, short course" (DOTS), which is recommended by
the World Health Organization as the leading weapon against TB.
</P>
<P>
"TB-control work in China has been greatly hampered by the lack
of a DOTS strategy," Vice-Minister of Health Yin Dakui
acknowledged on the occasion of World TB Day today. He said a 95
percent rate for DOTS coverage will be contained in a national
medium- and long-range plan for TB control.
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis claims 250,000 lives each year in China, and has
caused six million people to become TB carriers. Specialists have
warned that without effective measures about 200 million to 300
million healthy Chinese might be infected by TB bacillus in the
next decade, and one-tenth of them could become TB patients.
</P>
<P>
"Under the DOTS strategy, patients receive their drug dosage
daily under the supervision of medical staff to ensure that they
take the medicine for the full six month period usually required
to cure TB," explained Zhao Fengzeng at the TB Control Center
under the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
With World Bank loans totaling 58 million US dollars, China,
since 1992, started the world's largest TB control project in 13
of its 31 provinces, which utilized the DOTS strategy and provided
free diagnosis and treatment. The ministry also initiated a more
modest project in 15 provinces in 1994.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 1.2 million contagious TB patients have been
treated, and over 90 percent of them cured.

<HEADLINE> 20 Academicians Become Advisors to Air Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Air Force of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) has invited 20 leading Chinese scientists in
the fields of aviation, telecommunications, radar, missiles,
electronic warfare and some other disciplines to become Air Force
advisors.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force of the PLA signed an agreement here today with
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Chinese Academy of
Engineering (CAE) to invite the 20 CAS and CAE academicians to
become Air Force advisors.
</P>
<P>
These scientists are required to offer proposals for the
scientific and technological development of the Air Force and help
solve key technological problems in the development of advanced
Air Force arms and equipment.
</P>
<P>
They will also introduce the latest international and domestic
developments on the frontiers of sciences, and foster some 42
outstanding young Air Force technicians.
</P>
<P>
The invited academicians will also make study tours of research
institutions and colleges of the Air Force to help solve problems
in development, application, maintenance of the new equipment and
give lectures.
</P>
<P>
They will also visit several major research institutions and
Air Force troops, and put forward suggestions concerning the
overall building of China's Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Among those 20 scientists, one has been a leading figure in the
development of China's first digital telecommunications device,
another is the chief designer of China's first supersonic
interceptor fighter, and a third led the design of the country's
first three-dimensional radar.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Launch New Fight Against Superstition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars in both the
natural and social sciences today called for increased efforts to
fight against superstition.
</P>
<P>
Although the Falungong cult has been outlawed in China, its
pernicious influences are still not uprooted. Other superstitious
activities are also rampant in some areas of China, said the
scholars at a forum sponsored by the China Association for Science
and Technology (CAST).
</P>
<P>
Superstitions emerging in China include the belief in ghosts,
witchcraft, and supernatural abilities, said Ren Jiyu, president
of the China Atheism Society. Ren said at the forum that
superstitious activities are a disturbing social phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by CAST recently showed that 35.5 percent of
Chinese people believe in fortune-telling and divination, a figure
nearly seven percent higher than the 28.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending today's forum said that China should increase
people's awareness of science and ban the publication of books and
magazines that advocate superstition. Those who cheat people out
of their money by conducting superstitious activities should be
punished.
</P>
<P>
A large exhibition against superstition and advocating science
is being held in Beijing this week.

<HEADLINE> Northern China Cities Report Worse Air This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The quality of air in most major
cities in northern China worsened this week because of wide-
ranging dusty weather in the region, the China Environmental
Monitoring Center said today in its weekly Air Quality Report.
</P>
<P>
Dry weather, high-temperatures, a shortage of vegetation in the
region, and strong winds were blamed for dusty weather resulting
in a drastic increase of suspended air-borne particles in the air.
</P>
<P>
From March 17 to 23, the cities of Xining, Zhengzhou, Tianjin,
Shijiazhuang, Xi'an, Chongqing, Urumqi, and Qinhuangdao reported
slight air pollution; Beijing and Taiyuan reported unhealthy air;
and Yinchuan, Lanzhou, and Hohhot reported hazardous air.
</P>
<P>
Eight cities in southeastern and southern China, including
Ningbo, Suzhou, Shanghai, Haikou, Beihai, Xiamen, and Shenzhen
enjoyed excellent air.
</P>
<P>
Changchun, Guiyang, Changsha, Wuhan, Shenyang, Nanjing, Fuzhou,
and 18 other cities reported good air.
</P>
<P>
Yinchuan, Lanzhou, Hohhot, and 31 other cities listed suspended
particles as the major pollutant. Sulfur dioxide was the major
pollutant in Changsha, Chongqing, Guiyang and Nantong.

<HEADLINE> World Tuberculosis Day Alerts Public to Danger of TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis (TB) is a very
important disease in the world including the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and about 7,000 such cases are
reported here annually, said Paul Saw, acting director of health
of the Hong Kong SAR, today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the "World Tuberculosis Day" ceremony, Saw said the
cooperation between health care workers and the patients' family
members in providing full support to the patients would be an
essential element in successfully controlling TB.
</P>
<P>
"Our slogan for 2000 is: 'Eradicating TB depends on you and me.
' It calls for continuous efforts in our anti-TB work," Saw said.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that the disease could be eliminated through the
joint efforts of the government and the citizens together with
international collaboration," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the public can prevent TB by following a healthy
lifestyle. The most important thing is to maintain a good body
defense, have adequate rest and exercises and have a balanced diet,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization and the International Union
Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases declared March 24 as World
Tuberculosis Day.
</P>
<P>
There were 7,557 TB cases reported in Hong Kong in 1999,
compared with 7,673 and 7,072 cases in 1998 and 1997, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Denies Involvement in Baghdad Mortar Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Tehran has denied involvement in
Tuesday's mortar attack on a residential district in Baghdad, which
killed six people and wounded 38 others.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official as saying "The recent explosions in
Baghdad was a result of Iraqi internal problems and had nothing to
do with Iran," according to the Islamic Republic News Agency on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who was not identified, warned Iraq against the
propagation of "enemies," saying that the reports by some foreign
media were aimed at aggravating the "small problems" between Iran
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Wednesday blamed Iran for the mortar attack Tuesday
night in Baghdad, in which three Palestinians and three Iraqis were
killed and 38 others injured.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi security spokesman said the Iraqi authorities had found
an Iranian 60mm mortar and two unexploded bombs in the area.
</P>
<P>
Iraq holds Tehran responsible for "flagrant aggression against
its security and sovereignty" and "reserves the right to take
suitable action," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the two neighbors, which fought an eight-year
war that ended in 1988, have escalated in recent weeks over cross-
border attacks by the Iranian opposition Mujahedin Khalq
Organization (MKO).
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO has claimed responsibility for a mortar
attack on March 13 on a residential complex in northern Tehran, in
which four people were wounded. It said the target was the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps Commander Major General Rahim Safavi.
</P>
<P>
Days after the MKO attack, Baghdad said its air defense shot
down an Iranian reconnaissance drone and the MKO said its anti-
aircraft systems repulsed an air attack by Iran against one of its
military bases inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The MKO had been an active political and military group fighting
against former shah's regime, but was declared illegal in 1981
following sharp wranglings with the ruling clergy.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, the MKO launched a series of attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside the country. Iran responded
with air raids on the organization's bases near Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The MKO issue, together with the problems of prisoners of war,
border demarcation and war reparation, has been stalling a
normalization of Iran-Iraq relations. The two accused each other of
sheltering opposition rebels and supporting their sabotage
activities.

<HEADLINE> No Polio in Cambodia for 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The poliovirus is no longer
circulating in Cambodia since no case of polio has been detected
in more than three years, Cambodia's National Certification
Committee (NCC) announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The committee for polio eradication met Friday to review the
status of poliomyelities in the country, especially the details of
all cases of paralyzed children reported in 1999, to determine if
any of the cases were polio.
</P>
<P>
The committee completed its review of the detailed information
of all the 197 reported cases of paralysis in 1999 and is
convinced that none of the cases is polio.
</P>
<P>
The last case of polio in Cambodia took place on March, 19,
1997 when a girl of 15 months living in Kandal Province fell ill.
Since then more than 550 reported cases of paralysis have been
investigated throughout the country, and none of them have been
found to be caused by polio.
</P>
<P>
Mean Chhi Vun, the chairman of the NCC, said that Cambodia now
qualifies to be certified polio-free. According to the criterion
of the Regional Certification Commission, three years must pass
after a country's last case of indigenous polio before the country
can be certified polio-free.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia began its polio eradication initiative in 1994. From
1995 to 1999, national polio immunization campaigns were conducted,
even in those difficult-to-reach areas of the county. And a nation-
wide surveillance system was established to detect suspected polio
cases.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Friday responded to overtures from Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid by praising the latter's leadership.
</P>
<P>
"I admire the courage that he (Wahid) has displayed in the time
that he's been the president," Howard told reporters in Melbourne,
referring to Wahid's comments that Howard had shown strength in
the face of criticism, including harsh words from Wahid. The
Indonesian leader's remarks appeared in Friday's Australian
Financial Review.
</P>
<P>
"The relationship between our two countries is an extremely
important one," Howard said, adding that he is looking forward to
Wahid's scheduled visit to Australia in May.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Australia and Indonesia suffered great strain
due to Australia's role in leading a United Nations force in East
Timor last year after bloody violence there.
</P>
<P>
"We recognized that because of what happened in East Timor,
inevitably there was a difficulty in our relationship," Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
"But deep down both Indonesia and Australia seek a very close
bilateral relationship and I see his visit to Australia in May as
an important element in that," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The relationship will remain very high on the government's
list of priorities as far as foreign affairs is concerned, very
high indeed because we are close neighbors, long-standing friends,
" he added.

MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 Russians are expected
to rally outside the U.S. embassy in Moscow on Friday to mark the
anniversary of the U.S.-led NATO's aggression against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow city authorities have authorized the rally, which
was organized by Bely Mir (White Peace) and the Popular Communist
Movement, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The protesters are scheduled to march from Krasnopresnenskaya
metro station to the U.S. embassy at 3:00 p.m. (1200 GMT), the
authorized application reads.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators will protest against "the criminal actions of
the United States and NATO in Yugoslavia," the document says.
</P>
<P>
At least seven political groups have confirmed their intention
to participate in the protests. State Duma (lower house of
parliament) deputies will also attend the event.
</P>
<P>
NATO's aggression against Yugoslavia, a traditional ally of
Russia, sparked massive protests outside the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow last year.

<HEADLINE> Britain Asks to Join Military Maneuvers with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain has expressed interest
in participating for the first time in joint military maneuvers
with Israel, a local daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Britain has asked to send a contingent to the search-and-rescue
maneuvers between Israel and Jordan, even the date for the
exercise, the third joint operation between the two countries, is
not yet known, the Jerusalem Post quoted a senior source of Israel
Defense Force (IDF) as saying.
</P>
<P>
While British forces have routinely participated in joint
maneuvers with Arab armies, this is the first time Britain has
asked to openly participate in military maneuvers with Israel, the
source said, adding that there has been a dramatic change in
Britain's attitude toward defense relations lately with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Last week, senior defense officials from both countries held
strategic talks on ballistic missile defense. Last November, Israel
and Britain signed a memorandum of understanding on joint research
in defense technology and information.
</P>
<P>
Last September, British Chief of the Defense Staff Gen. Charles
Guthrie paid a two-day visit to Israel as guest of IDF Chief of
General Staff Lt.-Gen. Shaul Mofaz. A few weeks ago, Maj.-Gen.
Yitzhak Ben-Yisrael, director of Development of Weapons System and
Infrastructure of the IDF, paid an official visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Until recent years, military-to-military relations between
Israel and Britain have been quite cool, mainly due to Britain's
traditional links with the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The warming of defense relations between Israel and Britain is
not only due to the progress in the Middle East peace talks by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government, but also the ascension of
Prime Minister Tony Blair, a strong supporter of Israel, said
Shlomo Brom, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee
Center for strategic Studies.

</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Strong dust-laden winds, accompanied by cold air, hit Cairo
on Thursday causing low visibility on main roads leading to and out
of the city. High winds also kept the Mediterranean port of
Alexandria closed. Cairo airport officials said flights were

</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Cairo will host the eighth international Egyptology

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In advance of Sunday's Geneva summit between U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak made his peace offer clear to the Americans
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk in several phone
conversations and in two meetings this week that he is willing to
withdraw form the Golan Heights to the June 4, 1967 boundaries,
with certain modifications, a diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak's spokesman Gadi Baltiansky, denied that Barak
had made any offer to the Syrians through the Americans or had
discussed anything specific about the border with Indyk.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak is prepared to delay the opening of an embassy in
Damascus until the latter stages of a withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, exhibiting a willingness to back away from insisting on
opening a diplomatic mission in Damascus right after the first
stage of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Some government ministers see this as a further caving in to
Syrian demands. But the Prime Minister's Office took pains Thursday
to explain that Israel has never included the opening of an embassy
in Damascus as a prerequisite to handing over the Golan.
</P>
<P>
The office cited the peace agreement with Egypt as an example -
an exchange of ambassadors and diplomats came only after the
initial stages of withdrawal from Sinai peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Early elections may be called if no solution is found to keep
both Shas and Meretz in the coalition, sources close to the prime
minister and in One Israel ruling coalition said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-orthodox religious Shas party's spiritual leader Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef had been at odds with leftist Meretz leader Yossi
Sarid. In a latest incident, Yosef drew an analogy between Sarid
and Haman, the villain in this week's Jewish Purim holiday.
</P>
<P>
If one of the parties quits the coalition, this will lead sooner
or later to the government losing its majority in the Knesset and
spell failure for Barak's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Police questioned Transportation Minister Yizthak Mordechai
for eight hours Thursday on suspicious of committing indecent acts
and sexually harassing a female worker in his ministry.
</P>
<P>
During the interrogation, the plaintiff confronted the minister
for about an hour. Mordechai denied all charges, claiming that the
young woman had misinterpreted his friendly behavior.
</P>
<P>
The police reported that Mordechai answered all the questions he
was asked and that "the investigation continues." Mordechai may be
called in for another round of questioning, although no date has
been set.

<HEADLINE> Libya to Help Jordan with Water Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Libya has agreed to provide Jordan
some 500 million U.S. dollars to help the country install a water
pipeline linking capital Amman and the Disi aquifer in the south of
the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still undecided if the Libyan investments would
be in the form of a grant or a loan and the Jordanian government
might seek other donors' assistance to fund the project at a total
cost of 730 million dollars, the semi-official Jordan Times
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the 325-kilometer-long pipeline is expected to
provide 100 million cubic meters of water annually to Amman for
around 30 years, while drought-hit areas between the capital and
the Disi district will also benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Amman and most parts of the kingdom largely depend on
stockpiling rainfalls to meet their fresh water needs.
</P>
<P>
Libya showed interest in the project after it sent a technical
team to Jordan last summer and conducted feasibility studies on the
plan.
</P>
<P>
At home, Libya has completed the first stage of a 25-billion-
dollar five-stage project called the Great Man-Made River to bring
water from its southern part to irrigate and revive the northern
part of Libya.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian experts warned that the Disi-Amman water
project might be controversial, as the ancient aquifer is non-
renewable and had already been over exploited for agricultural
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the water level in the Disi aquifer is dropping by 80
to 85 centimeters each year, said the report.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Grant US$5 Mln to India for AIDS Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton, who will conclude his five-day visit to the South
Asian country Saturday, made the promise on the occasion of the
World TB day at a function in Hyderabad, some 1,500 kilometers
south of here, the fourth stop of Clinton's five-day tour in India.
</P>
<P>
While four million dollars would be contributed this year to
programs to prevent AIDS and for AIDS victims care, another one
million dollars would be for TB research, said Clinton, who
arrived at the ancient city Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president, who is scheduled to fly to India's largest
financial city of Bombay later today, declared that fight against
infectious diseases should be a growing part of U.S.-Indian
partnership.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Clinton visited Jaipur, capital of the northwest
state of Rajasthan, following his tour to Taj Mahal, one of world'
s seven wonders 200 kilometers southeast of here.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he had earlier this year asked the U.S.
Congress to support his one-billion-dollar initiative to encourage
the private sector to speed development of vaccines for diseases
that particularly affect the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He pledged a total of 295 million dollars to India and its
South-Asian neighbors on Wednesday for their efficient energy
programs and environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, Clinton said, the Import-Export Bank of America
would pump 200 million dollars for technical support to change the

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Tanzanian Youths Live Abroad Illegally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Tanzanian
youths are living as illegal immigrants in scores of countries
under the disguise of refugees, the Guardian newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted spokesman for the Tanzanian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Patrick Chokala as
saying on Thursday that they have jumped borders to different
countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent report on some 800 Tanzanian youths
illegally staying in South Africa, Chokala said the government is
not surprised at this.
</P>
<P>
It becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of these
people, because they entered foreign countries without reporting
to Tanzanian missions, the spokesman said, adding that the limited
number of Tanzanian embassies in foreign countries also make the
survey difficult.
</P>
<P>
Illegal entrance of Tanzanian youths to foreign countries is
deeply rooted in socio-economic problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Tanzanian young man, who probably could not endure
the chilliness of self-imposed refugee status in South Africa and
came back home recently, reported to police that at least 800
young Tanzanian illegal immigrants are living a hard life in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The young man, whose name has not been revealed, said that they
disguise themselves as refugees from Burundi, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo or Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has directed its mission in South
Africa to check on the report, Chokala said.

LAGOS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The just-ended 30th ACP(Africa, Caribbean and the
Pacific)-EU Parliamentary Assembly in Abuja did not discuss the
debt forgiveness for Nigeria, since the European Union believed
that issues of investment and debt cancellation could not be
detached from the interest of banks which provide the most funds.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express:
</P>
<P>
-- Investor confidence has been restored in Nigeria's economy
as the inflation and interest rates have maintained downward trend
in the past couple of months after some sound and dynamic monetary
measures were introduced by the country's financial authority, a
high-ranking government official said.
</P>
<P>
Daily Times:
</P>
<P>
-- About 30 people were feared killed Thursday night in the
capital Abuja when a fuel tanker lost control and ran into a
commercial bus and three other cars.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- There will be low level of
rainfall in the northern and eastern parts of Kenya during the
upcoming March-May long rains, the country's Meteorological
Department has announced.
</P>
<P>
The northern Kenya is currently in the grips of famine and
water shortages due to a prolonged drought, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The United States Agency for International Development also
predicted that the eastern part of Kenya will receive "below
normal" rainfall.
</P>
<P>
However, both organizations said that rainfall amounts outside
these areas will be moderate.
</P>
<P>
The rainfall deficit in the 1998 short rains and 1999 long
rains has impacted negatively on the river catchments and
hydroelectric generation in the East African country.

<HEADLINE> NGO to Fund Kenya's Anti-AIDS Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A humanitarian child development
non- governmental organization (NGO) will spend 125 million
shillings (around 1. 7 million U.S. dollars) over the next three
months in fighting HIV/AIDS and enhancing child survival in the
Embu District of central Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Friday quoted Daniel
Kinoti, regional director of the Plan International, as saying
that more than 95 percent of Kenyans are aware of the effects and
transmission mode of the killer disease, but most of them are
still engaging in extremely risky sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
Colossal amount of money has been spent on HIV/AIDS
sensitization campaign with little effect, he said, stressing that
it was time to adopt new and broader strategies to break the
silence and attract participation from the villagers.
</P>
<P>
According to the regional director, his organization would take
the message to villages where many people are still ignorant of
the socio- economic effects of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five million shillings (around 0.6 million U.S. dollars)
will be used in Siakago and Evurore divisions for classrooms,
water tanks and feeding programs in 46 primary schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another 55 million shillings (around 0.76 million U.S. dollars)
will be spent on the provision of laboratory equipment for a
health centre in Gachoka division, the director added.
</P>
<P>
AIDS has become rampant in Kenya since the first AIDS case was
discovered in 1984. So far about 750,000 Kenyans have died of the
killer disease.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The sole stock market in
Tanzania has urged the government to reduce corporate taxes for
listed companies, the Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although some incentives like removal of stamp duty and
reduction of government withholding tax on dividends are already
in place, more stimuli are needed by reducing corporate tax, Dar
es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) Chief Executive Officer Hamisi
Kibola was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
If the current corporate tax of 30 percent is reduced to 20
percent, DSE will talk with some interested companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned that it all depends on the firms' ability
to meet conditions for listing, like corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
So far, only four companies are trading their shares and
securities in DSE, which started trading operation two years ago.

At a press conference, EBRD First Vice President Charles Frank
said he has discussed with Ukrainian officials the EBRD's
financing of the construction of Ukraine's Rivne and Khmelnitsky
nuclear power stations. The two new stations will replace
Chernobyl in electricity supplies. But he did not see a connection
between the closure and the funding. Frank stressed that even the
EBRD failed to resume the funding, Ukraine should close down all
unsafe nuclear power stations. Chernobyl's No. 4 reactor exploded
in April 1986, in the worst nuclear disaster in the world.

TOKYO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed mixed in Tokyo
Friday, with the key Nikkei index briefly topping 20,000 for the
first time in almost three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A travel ban from Friday to Monday
has been imposed in Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya
following rebel threats to stage terrorist attacks and sabotage
during the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The checking regime has been tightened and the protection of
ballot stations strengthened while block stations at the entrances
to villages have been reinforced, the Interfax news agency
reported, quoting military headquarters in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Rebels reportedly plan to attack the towns of Gudermes and
Argun in an effort to derail the voting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some 460,000 registered voters are expected to cast their
ballots in 336 polling stations in 12 districts and part of Vedeno
in Chechnya. Elections will not be held in Shatoi and Itum-Kale.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Price Hike in Rent Not to Affect Many Chinese (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Zhang Yueqing, a professor with Beijing's Capital
University of Economics and Trade, the average expense on public
housing for urbanites is predicted at less than 10 percent of the
household income.
</P>
<P>
Gu Haibing, a professor from the People's University of China,
estimated that raising public housing rent to 10-15 percent of an
average household's total income will be accepted by most Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Gu said if the percentage is lifted to ten percent, that will
generate at least seven billion yuan of funds nationwide, and if
only half of this amount is allocated to building new houses, five
million people can move into new apartments. In this way, the
housing problem in Chinese cities and towns can be basically
resolved in five to eight years.
</P>
<P>
Thus he argued that the government should place raising rent as
the priority of the country's housing reform, instead of selling
public apartments to individuals.

<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey reveals that 76.6
percent of Chinese urban residents are not worried about the
government's new policy for raising public housing rent.
</P>
<P>
China will raise the public housing rent from 1.3 yuan per
square meter per month to 3.05 yuan from the beginning of April.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the China Social Survey Office
among 2,781 respondents from such big cities as Beijing, Shanghai,
Wuhan, Changsha, Harbin, Dalian and Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
It shows that 76.6 percent of the respondents are quite
indifferent about the new rent because 90 percent of them have
already bought new apartments. The other ten percent who do not
own their own apartments say they do not worry about as they will
receive an additional subsidy from their state-own work units.
</P>
<P>
However, 23.4 percent of the respondents are not happy with the
new government policy. Most of them feel the new rent will affect
their lives to a big extent as their work units are unable to
subsidize them.
</P>
<P>
But for those who are in real financial difficulty, rent can be
partially or completely waived with the permission of the local
housing reform office, and this measure is only applicable to
public house tenants.
</P>
<P>
A separate survey conducted in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou
shows that the number of households living in rented houses makes
up 9.49 percent of all urban families. About 6.64 million of
families will be affected by the new policy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Population to Increase by 10 million a Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The population of China will
continue to increase by more than 10 million a year over the next
ten-plus years, and will only begin to decrease when it reaches
the peak of 1.6 billion in the middle of the 21st century,
according to the State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, China entered the list of countries with
low fertility rates, but the gap between the nation's developed
and underdevelopment areas still hinders the implementation of
family planning policy.
</P>
<P>
Population control and maintaining a low fertility rate are key
issues for solving the population problem in China, noted State
Councilor Wang Zhongyu, who added that population control is an
unavoidable choice, and one necessary for guaranteeing the long
existence and health of the Chinese nation.

TB is not only curable but its treatment is also affordable and
available from all the designated government hospitals,he added.

that the proper medicines are taken for the required period, he
said, stressing that public cooperation in this venture is highly
needed.

<HEADLINE> Excavation of Beijing's Big Archaeological Find </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of 30 archaeologists are
now busy excavating a 2000-year-old tomb located 10 kilometers
from cental Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We work at least 12 hours a day, it may take us half a month
to reach the ceiling of the room to where coffin or coffins are
placed, and then we need to set up a 500-sq.-m shed to keep the
tomb protected from rainfall," said Wang Wuyu, deputy director of
the Beijing Institute of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the collapse of a large area of the tomb may
have occurred, and this will make the excavation work more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
At present, the site is being strictly guarded, and visitors
must pass three lookout posts before reaching the site.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the tomb has remained untouched for 2000 years,
so rich cultural relics are expected to be found within.
</P>
<P>
The tomb's occupant is believed to be one of the 12 kings of
Yan, the ancient name of the Hebei and Beijing area, during the
Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
One archaeologist has called the find "one of the most
significant archaeological discoveries in Beijing in the past half
century."
</P>
<P>
The tomb is 26 meters long and 23.5 meters wide, and the aisle
leading to the burial chamber is 24 meters long.
</P>
<P>
Before the discovery of the site, several grave-robbers were
seized by local police.

<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The First Chinese Kunqu Opera Art
Festival is scheduled from March 31 to April 6 in Suzhou, the well-
known tourist city in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The one-week festival, co-sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of
Culture, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government, and the
Suzhou City People's Government, will not only attract Kunqu Opera
troupes from all over China but also draw several from Japan and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the festival's organizing committee say domestic
and overseas performers will present a repertoire of famous Kunqu
compositions, including Peony Pavilion, Palace of Eternal Youth,
and Peach Blossom Fan.
</P>
<P>
A symposium on the development of Kunqu Opera will also be
staged during the festival.
</P>
<P>
Kunqu Opera is one of China's classical operatic forms, which
originated in the Kunshan region of Jiangsu Province about 500
years ago. After centuries of development, it has established a
complete system of acting as well as its own distinct tunes.
</P>
<P>
The music and acting of Kunqu Opera have had a significant
influence on other traditional Chinese operatic forms, including
Peking Opera.

<HEADLINE> 1,600-Year-Old Buddha Statues Recovered by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Police in Shaanxi Province in
northwest China recently recovered two sets of Buddha statues
dating back 1,400 to 1,600 years from the house of a local farmer.
</P>
<P>
Each of the two sets of Buddha statues consists of a standing
Buddha, two small Bodhisattvas, an aureole, a lotus seat, and two
phoenix. The statues are 35.2 centimeters high, 11 centimeters
long, and the base is 8 centimeters high.
</P>
<P>
The statues were reportedly unearthed by the farmer while he
dug a tomb for a deceased villager in the suburb of Xi'an, the
capital of Shaanxi Province, last December.
</P>
<P>
The farmer then took the relics home and hid them in his house,
thus violating the law.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Speeds Up Offshore Oil Development in Bohai Sea (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bohai Oilfield expects to
produce over 10 million tons of crude a year in the early 21st
century by speeding up efforts to explore a group of offshore
oilfields in the Bohai Sea in north China.
</P>
<P>
According to the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC)
, the Bohai Oilfield, a subsidiary of CNOOC, is developing
simultaneously the Qinhuangdao 32-6 and Nanbu 35-2 oilfields, two
large offshore oilfields each with reserves exceeding 100 million
tons, in the central part of the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil turned out by the two oilfields will be piped inland
through the port of Jingtang in the city of Tangshan in Hebei
Province, and the two oilfields are expected to have an annual
crude production capacity of four million tons.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao 32-6 Oilfield, with 170 million tons of verified
geological oil reserves, is some 100 kilometers east of Tianjin,
and to date, eleven wells have been sunk there.
</P>
<P>
Nanbu 35-2 Oilfield lies 20 kilometers south of Tangshan, and
four test wells have been drilled and geological oil reserves of
70 million tons have been identified. Nanbu is estimated to have
total oil reserves of 110 million tons.

<P>
The two oilfields will begin production in 2003, and are
expected to develop an annual production capacity of four million
tons by 2004, which will boost the development of a series of
small- and medium-sized oilfields in the area.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Bohai Oilfield is sinking caissons to build
offshore oil platforms at the Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield in Bohai Bay,
said the CNOOC source, adding that the oilfield, with proven oil
reserves of more than 30 million tons, has developed 27 oil wells,
26 water injecting wells, and one natural gas well. They are
expected to go into operation this year.
</P>
<P>
According to CNOOC, the Bohai Oilfield is giving priority to
developing three oil exploration centers in the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
These are the Liaobei oil exploration center, consisting of the
Jinzhou 20-2 and Jinzhou 9-3 oilfields; the Liaozhong center,
based on Suizhong 36-1 oilfield; and the Shijiu center based on
the Qinhuangdao 32-6 oilfield.

LUSAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Zambia and the

</P>
<P>
At least 58 people have reportedly died from the disease in the

<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- World record holders Chen Yan and
Wu Yanyan will lead the Chinese team to contest the Asian swimming
championships, which is to be held on March 28 to April 2 in Pusan,
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
It will be the penultimate qualifying chance for the Chinese
swimmers who want to enter the Sydney Olympic Games, and the final
line-up will be made after the national trial in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that more swimmers can reach the Olympic standard
through the Asian championships," said Chinese head coach Zhao Ge.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan, world women's 400 meter individual medley titlist in
1998, will compete in 200 and 400 freestyle and 400 medley, while
Wu Yanyan, who holds the 200m medley world record, will swim in
200 and 400 medley.
</P>
<P>
Vetern sprinter Shan Ying, successor to Olympic champion Le
Jingyi in freestyle, will make her debut in the international
event since she won three titles at Military Games last Augest.
</P>
<P>
Also on the roster are Jiang Chengji, men's 50m freestyle
champion and Fu Yong, backstroke gold medalist in Bangkok Asian
Games in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among the 20-member squad, all the nine men's swimmers need to
qualify for the Olympic standard while only three women swimmers
have the same demand.
</P>
<P>
Though China named a second-string diving team to Pusan, they
still hope for a golden-sweep. Their elite divers are preparing
for the national selection in April.
</P>
<P>
The water polo team faces a tough fight against the Asian
powerhouses Kazakhstan and Uzebekstan in this meet. Only the
champion in each qualifying zone and top four in the Olympic trial
in Hanover, Germany during May 6-14, can win the berths to the
Olympic Games.

BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- As more commercial residential
property rises in China's large cities and occupants demand more
qualified personnel for community services, flexible and more
market-oriented non-state institutes of higher learning are
starting to provide related training programs.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Social Correspondence University is offering two
training programs in community services and real estate management
for residents in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shenzhen,
Wuhan, and other major cities.
</P>
<P>
Such programs will help improve the proficiency level of urban
management, and provide opportunities for workers laid-off by
state-owned enterprises to find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Students will be taught related laws, regulations, and standard
practices, as well as vocational techniques.
</P>
<P>
Since opening in 1985, the Beijing Social Correspondence
University has trained more than 160,000 students nationwide.
</P>
<P>
There are 98 non-state institutes of higher learning in Beijing.
Because state-owned universities are sharply increasing their
enrollment, those non-state colleges find it more difficult to
compete for applicants, and have to turn to new training programs
that are not offered in state-run universities.

<HEADLINE> Commission on Gas Exploration to Be Set Up Soon in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A commission to regulate the
exploration, production and distribution of gas by different
companies would be set up by the Bangladeshi government in the
near future, The Independent newspaper reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
And a committee appointed by the Ministry of Power, Energy and
Mineral Resources has been assigned to draft a law on gas for the
purpose, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation and regulatory commission will set the
ground rules and settle the competing interests of the private and
public sector companies in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The draft of a law has been finalized to set the ground rules
and institute a regulatory commission for the power sector, the
report said, adding that the draft has provisions to integrate the
gas sector with it.
</P>
<P>
Gas and power have been monopolized by the public sector in
Bangladesh for a long time. Activities in these sectors have so
far been governed by rules framed by the ministry, the Power
Development Board and the Petrobangla.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of private companies for both generation
and distribution of power and for production and distribution of
gas, law and rules are needed to govern the safety and
environmental aspects and customer handling.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said that the new government will continue the
programs and policies that the previous government had adopted,
The Kathmandu Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The new government has set its priorities based on the
programs and policies of the previous Nepali Congress government,"
Koirala told parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Koirala reiterated that the new government would work for
restoring peace and security, provide improved administration and
control corruption.
</P>
<P>
He pledged a new law that would make it mandatory for ministers
and lawmakers to declare their assets and property every year.
</P>
<P>
Wealth accumulated without known source of income would be
considered earned through corruption and concerned persons would
be punished, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On relations with India, the new prime minister said the
present issues concerning India will be dealt through silent
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The situation arising from the hijacking of an Indian Airlines
passenger jet and the issue of posting Indian security personnel
at Nepal's international airport will be discussed through that
channel too, he said.
</P>
<P>
After an Indian passenger jet was hijacked on route from
Kathmandu to New Delhi on December 24, 1999, India proposed
posting Indian security personnel at Tribhuvan International
Airport in Kathmandu, which was rejected by the previous Nepali
government.

<HEADLINE> European Bank Hopes Ukraine to Shut Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The deputy chief of the European
Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said Thursday that
he hopes Ukraine will shut down Chernobyl nuclear power station
completely in 2000.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, EBRD First Vice President Charles Frank
said he has discussed with Ukrainian officials the EBRD's
financing of the construction of Ukraine's Rivne and Khmelnitsky
nuclear power stations. The two new stations will replace
Chernobyl in electricity supplies. But he did not see a
connection between the closure and the funding.
</P>
<P>
Frank stressed that even the EBRD failed to resume the funding,
Ukraine should close down all unsafe nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
Chernobyl's No. 4 reactor exploded in April 1986, in the worst
nuclear disaster in the world. Two other reactors were closed in
1991 and 1996 respectively. Now only the No. 3 reactor remains in
operation, but its working life is close to end.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has requested that the EBRD provide a loan of 200
Million U.S. dollars to help the closure of the plant and wants
extra money to fund the completion of the two new nuclear power
stations.
</P>
<P>
The bank is willing to deepen cooperation with Ukraine, but an
effective cooperation will depend on the Ukrainian government's
action, Frank said.
</P>
<P>
Frank, who arrived here Wednesday for a two-day visit, held
talks with Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yushenko on further
cooperation and funding renewal.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD, set up in April 1991 in London, aims to unite Eastern
and the Western Europe under the principles of democracy and free
market economy.

to help refugees return to their homes, the Bosnian press reported.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected Croatian president, who arrived Thursday for
a two-day visit, told the press that the talks ended with a
consensus as far as pending issues of bilateral relations were
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Ante Jelavic, one of the three members of the Bosnian
presidency, said the visit by Mesic marks a big step towards the
strengthening of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old Mesic had promised to bolster Croat's
international ties when he was elected president in February
succeeding the late Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
During his campaign, Mesic backed the return of all refugees,
including Serbs, that fled during the 1991-95 war in former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Following last year's NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia, more than
200,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians fled to other parts of
Yugoslavia from Kosovo, swelling a refugee population of roughly
half a million from earlier conflicts, according to figures from
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian politicians were content with Mesic's victory and move.
They said that could lead to improvement of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia and Croatia were involved in a conflict during and
after Bosnia's ethnic war in the early 1990s. Zagreb was accused
of supporting Bosnian Croats. In 1995, the Dayton peace accord
ended Bosnia's 43-month war and divided it into a Moslem-Croat
federation and a Serb republic.

<HEADLINE> Chile Rejects U.S. Request to Question Pinochet Top Aides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Supreme Court Thursday
rejected requests by U.S. prosecutors to question top aides of
former President General Augusto Pinochet about an assassination
occurring in Washington DC 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean Penal Tribunal said they would not admit the two-
person team representing the U.S. government to attend the
questioning, saying that in the opinion of the judges, "There is
nothing to clarify."
</P>
<P>
The 42 members of the former Chilean military regime will be
questioned next week about the death of Chile's former cabinet
member Orlando Letelier.
</P>
<P>
A Pinochet opponent and former envoy to Washington, Letelier
was killed on September 21, 1976, with his American aide by a car
bomb.
</P>
<P>
The two-person team sent by the U.S. department of justice
arrived Wednesday. However, Chile decided that Chilean judge
Joaquin Billard will question the officials and the two U.S.
investigators will get sealed answers afterwards. They were also
forbidden to do anything concerning the case without authorization
from Billard.
</P>
<P>
Another legal team has arrived in Chile to assist the first
team, according to U.S. ambassador John O'Leary.

<HEADLINE> PNG Agrees to Bougainville Independence Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The Papua New Guinea's (PNG)
national government has agreed to a referendum on independence for
the island of Bougainville, Australian TV programs reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The understanding on the referendum was signed late Thursday
night by PNG founding prime minister and current Bougainville
Affairs Minister Michael Somare, Bougainville Governor John Morris,
Bougainville People's Congress President Joseph Kabui and Leitana
Council of Elders Chairman Joel Banam, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the understanding as stating that "the
national government acknowledges the aspirations for a binding
referendum on independence as called for by the Bougainvillean
leaders."
</P>
<P>
However, the understanding said: "The parties agree that the
holding of the referendum may be deferred until after autonomy has
been implemented and can be fairly and properly judged."
</P>
<P>
It was understood that this last clause gave both Port Moresby
and Bougainville leaders the leeway to compromise on the
independence referendum issue, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Referendum on independence has been the stumbling block in the
country's political process since the eight-year secessionist war
ended in ceasefire in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of "referendum" in this new agreement was
reckoned by observers as a major step forward in finding a lasting,
peaceful solution to the Bougainville war, the report added.

CANBERRA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Friday said that he will have talks with Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat during a visit
to Israel late next month.
</P>
<P>
Howard told Melbourne radio 3AW that it was important to

</P>
<P>
He said everyone hoped the Middle East was inching towards a
lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
"Let us remember that Israel and the Palestinians are now
talking to each other in a very effective way and the Israeli
Prime Minister (Ehud Barak) is, I'm sure, keen that any foreign
visitor to his country also has the opportunity of meeting the
Palestinian leader," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard agreed that a sizable lobby in Australia would not
approve of the meeting with Arafat, and said he would once have
agreed with them.
</P>
<P>
But the gathering strength of the peace movement had changed
his mind, Howard said.

HANOI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's export turnover in the

<HEADLINE> EU Ready to Negotiate With Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting European Union (EU)
Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said here Thursday that "most
sensitive" agricultural products will not be included in
multilateral agreements on which the EU is ready to negotiate with
the South American Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Lamy told the press here that negotiations, scheduled to start
in early April between the two groups, will cover the reduction of
subsidies on exports to Europe and easier access of Mercosur goods
to the EU market.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur groups Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, with
Chile and Bolivia as associate partners.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner, who arrived in Brazil on March 19 for a six-
day tour to South America, said that the 15-nation EU wants to pay
more attention to the negotiations of a free trade agreement with
Mercosur and Brazil in industry and services, as it did with
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, "most sensitive" agricultural products
would be out of the agreements, and that the EU will seek ways to
speed up cuts on customs tariffs applied to Brazilian agricultural
and livestock products.
</P>
<P>
Lamy said since the European bloc is ready for the forthcoming
talks, it is necessary for the Mercosur countries to strike a free
trade deal first among themselves so that the negotiations with
the EU can advance.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Brazilian Agriculture Minister Marcus Vinicius
Pratini de Moraes will travel next month to Brussels, headquarters
of the EU, to resume negotiations on sanitary agreements between
Brazil and the EU, which has funded projects to improve sanitation
in Rio.

<HEADLINE> Leading Coal Producer Prioritizes Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Coal-rich Shanxi Province in
north China has been prioritizing environmental protection in its
development agenda and has seen its intensified efforts in that
regard pay off.
</P>
<P>
The massive restoration program which was launched in the late
1980s with an aim to transform areas around the coal mines into
arable fields has reclaimed 180,000 ha of such land since then.
</P>
<P>
Damages on environment in the mine areas were also eased as the
province spared no efforts to restore these areas through growing
various species of green plants.
</P>
<P>
The rare species of animals and plants in the province are also
being better protected today with the establishment of seven
nature reserves in the 1990s, in addition to the four such
reserves built in the past.
</P>
<P>
The province has been greening its waste mountains at an annual
rate of 200,000 ha in recent years, thereby increasing the acreage
of forest to 20.7 percent of the total land area.
</P>
<P>
As the leading coal producer in the country, Shanxi is home to
more than 7,000 coal mines. Massive exploitation of the coal
resources has benefited the province economically but also posed
great damages on the local environment.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Spectacular Fish Trading Center Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China's largest spectacular fish
trading center has opened for business at Heizhuanghu Township,
Chaoyang District in eastern part of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The center covers an area of over 10,000 sq. m. and involves an
investment of over 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The township, known as "township of golden fish", began
breeding golden fish for the royal court more than 200 years ago.
So far, there are 276 households specialized in breeding golden
fish, with breeding area totaling 200 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Golden fish bred by the production base has been sold to
northeast China, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces,
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as well as to Singapore, Germany
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the township exported 250,000 golden fishes and sales
income stood at 38.7 million yuan (4.7 million U.S. dollars) and
profits, at 18.86 million yuan (2.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The newly opened fish trading center was built in accordance
with international standards and equipped with advanced facilities.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has reportedly nearly 667 hectares of water area
for breeding golden fish in Chaoyang District and in the counties
of Daxing, Shunyi and Tongzhou. Over 20 enterprises have been
authorized to export golden fish.

HANGZHOU, March 24 (Xinhua)-- Cockroaches are found all over
East China's Zhejiang Province, except in places above 1,450
meters above sea level, researchers have found.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, mainly from the Epidemic Prevention Station in
this capital of the province, spent ten years studying the
cockroach situation. They found that cockroaches mainly live in
hotels, restaurants, food-processing workshops and breweries as
well as civilian residences.
</P>
<P>
They discovered five types of cockroaches new to the province.
</P>
<P>
They believed that cockroaches' natural enemy is a kind of
parasitic bee which lays eggs inside cockroaches' eggs. Breeding
this kind of bee at the right time may be the solution to the
cockroach nuisance.
</P>
<P>
The findings show that cockroaches carry all sorts of gems and
bacteria, and that they have a normal activity span of six months
in indoor temperatures, with July being the most active period.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Holds Conference to Oil Prospection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Delegates and experts from 12
countries Thursday discussed in Havana the importance of surface
geophysical methods for oil prospection at the first Cuban
National Geophysics Conference.
</P>
<P>
Data obtained through aero-magnetometry, gravimetry and seismic
measurement are "most valuable" for gaining the best knowledge of
Cuban soil, said engineer Guillermo Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Cuba will produce some 3.4 million tons of
hydrocarbons this year, including 2.8 million tons of crude oil,
which will meet almost 30 percent of the country's present
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
In the next three or four years, more than 10 new fields are
expected to be found in the northwestern coast Havana-Matanzas,
Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Cuba has 46 oil producing blocks, 20 of which are
being exploited by foreign companies, which invested some 600
million U.S. dollars in oil prospection and production from 1991
to 1999.

NANNING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Nanning, capital of south  China
's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, will ban the use of coal in
downtown districts starting from July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ruixian, deputy mayor of Nanning, explained that banning
coal is part of a campaign to reduce the affects of acid rain
within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Nanning suffers from acid rain pollution caused by the burning
of high-sulphur coal produced in the region. Roads and buildings
have been seriously affected by acid rain. Nanning has been
designated by the central government as a major acid rain city.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, the city issued a circular calling for a wide
use of low-sulphur coal in industrial production and daily use.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to combat acid rain are showing positive results.
Nanning had less acid rainfall in 1999 compared to that in 1998.
The city also met state requirements in the levels of sulphur
dioxide discharge into the air.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 24 (Xinhua)-- Senior Chinese architect and
urban planner Wu Liangyong has put forward a concept of the "
Greater Beijing", which aims to transfer some functions of urban
Beijing not just to the suburbs but also several hundred miles
away to Tianjin and northern Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the "Greater Beijing" concept is not an idea for a
new administrative zone, but refers to a region that will have its
resources scientifically coordinated for optimum benefits.
</P>
<P>
Wu, a scholar with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the
China Academy of Engineering, said Beijing, Tianjin, and some
major cities in northern Hebei are confronted with a bulging
population, overheated real estate, pollution and other urban
problems. And cooperation and integration in the region are a
matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
Wu, along with some other scholars, have already started
research for drafting of a plan for the Greater Beijing region.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Phoenis Suns coaxed Kevin
Johnson back to the court on Thursday to replace All-Star point
guard Jason Kidd, who had surgery this morning.
</P>
<P>
Kidd, the NBA leader in assists and triple-doubles, broke a
bone high in his left ankle in Wednesday's victory over Sacarmento
Kings.
</P>
<P>
With one of the league's premier players missing for the rest
of the season and questionable for the playoffs, the Suns turned
to one of their best players in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
"KJ", a three-time All-Star, is fifth in NBA history after
averaging 9.2 assists per game.
</P>
<P>
He averaged 20-plus points and 10-plus assists for three
successive seasons from 1988-91, becoming one of only five NBA
players to accomplish the feat.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 34, who retired after the 1999 season, has not played
since the 1997-98 season.

<HEADLINE> Fertility Gradually Returns to NE China's Black Earth Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The use of organic fertilizer is
restoring fertility to northeast China's black earth region.
</P>
<P>
Overuse of inorganic fertilizer in Liaoning Province since the
founding of New China in 1949 has brought desertification and a
hardening of the rich soil there.
</P>
<P>
Now, an annual yield of about 16 million tons of grain, and
surplus vegetables have made it possible for farmers to shift to
sustainable development from the original short-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
Factories have been opened in the province to provide organic
fertilizer, and long-term farmland rental contracts in China's
rural areas also inspire farmers to improve land conditions.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Weiman, who rented some 53 hectares of farmland for 30
years, said that he wants to try organic fertilizers, especially
as there is an increasing demand for pollution-free vegetables and
fruits in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 6.67 million hectares of farmland, or
one fifth of the province's total, now use organic fertilizers,
and stalks are left on about eight million hectares of farmland to
rot back into the soil.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that this move is not only to realize
sustainable economic growth, but also to leave a better ecological
environment for the next generations.
</P>
<P>
The black earth region of northeast China, one of the world's
three-largest fertile areas, is the main grain producer in China,
and residents in the region make up over 50 percent of the
provincial population.

<P>
JINAN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A battlefield of the Sino-Japanese
War of 1894-1895, Liugong Island in the coastal city of Weihai in
east China's Shandong Province, will soon become a tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
The city has decided to invest one billion yuan to build scenic
spots and tourist facilities on the island, including a central
square, a recreation town, and a cableway across the sea, local
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Liugong Island is located in the Yellow Sea and has very
picturesque natural scenery. The Museum of the Sino-Japanese War
of 1894-1895 on the island, built in 1985, holds nearly 1,000
exhibits about the war collected from around China.
</P>
<P>
The war broke out on August 1, 1894 and ended with the Qing
Dynasty's defeat and an unequal treaty with Japan.

<P>
In the late 1980s, the province approved the first group of
star-rated hotels in line with a state regulation concerning the
star hotel classification to ensure the quality of services of the
hotels.
</P>
<P>
In recent year, the province has carried out supervision and
examination on service of its star-hotels to meet the fast growth
of tourism industry, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province's hotels earned 6.12 billion yuan (735
million U.S. dollars) of income, 80 percent of which was for star-
hotels, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to redouble its efforts and make notable
progress in raising hotel service to the international standard.
</P>
<P>
The province ranks fourth in China in terms of various indices
for the hotel industry, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Anderton Extends Deal with Spurs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- England midfielder Darren Anderton
has signed a one-year extension to his contract at English premier
league soccer club Tottenham Spurs.
</P>
<P>
Anderton's future at White Hart Lane has been the subject of
debate for most of the season as he pursued a deal reported to be
worth 24,000 pounds a week.
</P>
<P>
The two parties finally came to an agreement on Thursday as the
deadline approached for domestic transfers.
</P>
<P>
Anderton ranks alongside Frenchman David Ginola, as two of the
club's highest-paid players.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bosman ruling, 28-year-old Anderton could have left
Spurs on a free transfer when his current deal expired in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
Spurs believe Anderton, who returned to action in January after
a four-month Achilles injury, can help their drive to finish in
the Premiership top six in order to qualify for European
competition.
</P>
<P>
"We are now looking to him to put in a closing run until the
end of the season and regain his England place," said director of
football David Pleat.
</P>
<P>
"Darren knows that to achieve those ends he must play regularly
and play well. He is in a very positive mood about the future," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Football Chiefs Ponder Unified Calendar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Michel Platini's plans for a major
upheaval of the domestic football calendar will be considered by
world soccer governing body FIFA's executive committee in Zurich
over the next two days.
</P>
<P>
His blueprint for a harmonised world calendar is one of the
main items on the agenda, along with a debate over the banned
steroid, nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
Described by Platini as the 'Big Bang' of international
football, his masterplan would establish a worldwide break in
December and move domestic league and cup competitions into two
slots: February-June and September-November.
</P>
<P>
July and August would be for international and continental
championships with pre-season training moving to January.
</P>
<P>
To a certain extent the plan is an inevitable compromise needed
to resolve the growing conflict of interests between the world's
most powerful clubs and the football authorities.
</P>
<P>
Platini's aim is to untangle the hopeless web of domestic and
international fixtures in which Arsenal's Nigerian striker Kanu
and Leeds Australian star Harry Kewell have both been
uncomfortably snared this season.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Sepp Blatter is under pressure from the
increasingly influential G-14 lobbying group who want action taken
to ease the increasingly congested fixture list.
</P>
<P>
This season's extended Champions League format - which means
the winning team will have played 16 matches by the time they lift
the trophy - is an ugly and unwieldy product of television's
hunger for cash.
</P>
<P>
The G-14 made up of Europe's most powerful teams such as
Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and AC Milan - are
rebelling.
</P>
<P>
They want more influence on the competitions which their
efforts effectively underwrite.
</P>
<P>
They want to have some change - but they want to retain the
current season format from August to May and have the
international calendar tailored to their needs.
</P>
<P>
The clubs' main gripe is the length of time they are required
to release overseas players for international duty - likely to
become a flashpoint in the build up to the Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
FIFA are to examine a proposal where clubs of players in
qualified teams be required to release them only five days ahead
of international competition instead of the originally planned 14.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's executive committee are to also examine the long-awaited
report on the banned substance nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
The medical report backs the controversial view that, under
physical stress, the body can produce the anabolic steroid in high
enough quantities to breach legal limits.
</P>
<P>
As a result, FIFA says it cannot impose sanctions on
footballers who test positive although the substance is on its
banned list.
</P>
<P>
That stance has put FIFA in direct conflict with the hardline
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
FIFA need to come to some compromise to satisfy the IOC before
the Olympic tournament in Sydney in September.

Villa manager John Gregory had written off any chance of his
five million pound signing from Coventry City playing again this
season. But Dublin returned to training a full month ahead of
schedule and is now on the verge of tasting his first action.
</P>
<P>
Villa skipper Gareth Southgate said: "The surgeons have given
the go-ahead for Dion to start playing again. We are expecting him
to play in a reserve game or a private friendly in the next seven
to 10 days."
</P>
<P>
Dublin has already targeted the FA Cup final for a possible
return to senior action - assuming Villa defeat Bolton in the semi-
final at Wembley on April 2.
</P>
<P>
He had been in outstanding form in the first half of the
campaign with 13 goals before the injury, sustained after he
collided with the Owls' Gerald Sibon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, midfielder Ian Taylor has signed a new contract,
which will keep him at the club until summer 2003.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old had 15 months left on his existing deal and had
been looking to increase his earnings after being one of the club'
s lowest paid players.
</P>
<P>
Villa boss John Gregory said: "I am delighted that he will
effectively be here until the remainder of his career. He is one
of the senior players, a virtual ever present and a well-respected
voice in the dressing room."

<P>
Werder Bremen was defeated with 0-2 by Arsenal at away game
last Thursday in London.

Arsenal is a Premier League club and got the English champion
title much time. Arsenal's triumph tonight should be due to
Parlour who got three goals in the 8th, 25th and 70th minutes and
Henry scored still a goal for Arsenal in the 59th minute. Bremen's
Bode played tonight very well and got two goals for his team, but
it didn't help Bremen. Finally Arsenal won with 4-2 and is

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Receives Message from French President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
received a message Friday evening from his French counterpart
Jacques Chirac on the coming Geneva summit between Assad and U.S.
President Bill Clinton due Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The message touched also on the Syrian-French friendly relations
and cooperation, according the Arab Syrian News Agency (ASNA).
</P>
<P>
In the message, Chirac pledged France's support for Syria's
strategic option, namely to establish fair, permanent and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East under relevant United
Nations Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions provide for Israeli return of the Syrian and
Lebanese territories now under Israeli occupation to the full
sovereignty of the two Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the strategic Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967
Middle East war and it has kept a buffer zone in south Lebanon
since 1985 with the excuse of protecting its northern territories.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has already decided to pull
out Israeli troops from south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Chirac expressed France's readiness to take part in the
implementation of security arrangements in the Golan Heights and
south Lebanon in case Syria and Lebanon reach agreement with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
ASNA did not identify who conveyed the message to Assad.
</P>
<P>
The summit between the Syrian and United States presidents is
intended to breath life to the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Resumed last December in Washington after a four-year freeze,
the talks ran into deadlock on January 10 due to Israel's refusal
to make a pledge to pull out from the Golan Heights to the border
lines of June 4, 1967, as demanded by Damascus.

<HEADLINE> FAO Sets up Animal Health Commission for Near East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The 25th U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) Regional Conference for the Near East agreed
Friday to establish a regional animal health commission aimed to
allow for trade in healthy animals and safe animal food products.
</P>
<P>
FAO said in a news release that the commission's main task is to
monitor animal diseases, prevent the spread of trans-boundary
diseases, upgrade quarantine facilities and strengthen veterinary
services.
</P>
<P>
The news release pointed out that people in developed countries
obtain an average of 27 percent of their calories and 56 percent of
protein requirement from animal food products as against 11 and 26
percent, respectively, for people in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
To close the gap, it concluded, animal health must be given
adequate attention.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Diouf, FAO director-general, told a new conference here
Friday noon that the organization is launching programs for
developing countries to formulate appropriate agricultural policy
and provide technical training and equipments to enforce food
security and avoid food crisis.
</P>
<P>
FAO will train 800 agricultural experts for developing countries
in the period from July 1999 to June 2000, Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine countries attended the conference, which was held in
Beirut on March 20-24.
</P>
<P>
The FAO was founded in 1945. With 179 member nations plus a
member organization, it is the largest specialized agency in the
United Nations system and the leading agency for agriculture,
forestry, fisheries, and rural development.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Protestant Leader Calls for Party Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist
Party leader David Trimble said on Friday that he will see off the
challenge to his position by Martin Smyth.
</P>
<P>
And he called on party members opposed to the Good Friday
Agreement to fall into line and repair internal divisions.
</P>
<P>
The 860-member ruling council of UUP will vote on Saturday
between Trimble and Smyth, MP for South Belfast and the party's
Westminster chief whip.
</P>
<P>
Trimble is favorite to win but a close result could damage him
and increase UUP divisions over the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The pair both held separate news conferences on Friday, with
Smyth accusing the party leader of making too many concessions to
republicans.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Trimble's comments made in the United States last
week that he would re-enter a powersharing government with Sinn
Fein before IRA arms decommissioning, provided guarantees were
given.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Trimble described the leadership contest as a choice
between past and future politics.
</P>
<P>
He told BBC Radio Ulster: "Life is always changing. The
question is whether you try to shape the events around you in
trying to create a better future or whether your attitude is
purely reactive and a nostalgic longing for a golden age that
possibly never was."
</P>
<P>
Smyth, a former Grand Master of the Orange Order, insisted he
was a serious contender and pledged "a more vigorous promotion of
Ulster Unionist policy".
</P>
<P>
He had made it clear that under his leadership the party line
would harden against working with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Those backing the challenge include a majority of the party's
parliamentary party.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the UUP ruling council will also vote on a motion
from the London-based unionist, David Burnside, asking the party
to refuse to take part in a new devolved government,unless the
title of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is retained.
</P>
<P>
The RUC's name is due to be changed under the Patten reforms.
Trimble said he intends to table an amendment to the motion.Losing
this policy vote could cause him as many problems as the
leadership challenge.

<HEADLINE> British Spy Agency Computer Stolen at Rail Station  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- British police said on Friday they
were hunting for a thief who stole a secret service computer
containing information on Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The laptop computer was snatched while an employee of Britain's
domestic Security Service, known as MI-5, was buying a ticket at
London's Paddington train station.
</P>
<P>
The information on the computer was understood to be heavily
encrypted and was related to the situation in Northern Ireland,
but did not refer to the state of the peace process or any
guerrilla threat.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace process is in crisis following last
month's decision by Britain to suspend a fledgling home-rule
government over lack of progress on disarmament by Irish
Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street said it believed the theft from a MI-5 officer
was "opportunistic" and that there was no threat to national
security.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the information stored on the computer was "
well protected" and that there was nothing to suggest a deliberate
attempt to gain access to security service files.
</P>
<P>
And he indicated that the MI5 officer involved could face
disciplinary action for the security lapse.
</P>
<P>
MI-5 is now in the front line of Britain's intelligence-
gathering operation in Northern Ireland after taking extra anti-
terrorist responsibilities in recent years.

<HEADLINE> IMF Ratifies Support to Ecuadorian "Dolarization" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
representative in Ecuador Jeffrey Franks reaffirmed Friday the
support of the institution he represents to this country's
dolarization process.
</P>
<P>
Franks told the press that the signing of a letter of intention
between the IMF and the Ecuadorian government could come at any
moment, because all the previous conditions have been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the letter of intention will be known in the
next weeks to the IMF board of directors for its eventual
ratification and signing.
</P>
<P>
He also informed that the agreement the IMF would sign would be
in the Stand-By modality for 12 months, during which 300 million
dollars would be disbursed.
</P>
<P>
Other multilateral credit organizations, such as the
Interamerican Development Bank (IDB), the Andean Development
Corporation (CAF), and the World Bank (BM) have also offered loans
to the Ecuadorian government.
</P>
<P>
The assistance of these organizations to Ecuador during the
year 2000 could amount to 600 million dollars, and 1.7 billion
dollars in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
World Bank official Gerald Meyerman, who is in this country,
said that to cleanse the Ecuadorian financial system it is
necessary to reschedule the liabilities that can be collected.
</P>
<P>
He said that the state cannot pardon neither the small debtors,
nor the big ones.
</P>
<P>
Meyerman stated his concern for the concentration of the credit,
because more than 50 percent of the debt is accumulated in 500
debtors, while 800,000 people owe 15 percent or the portfolio.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Clarify Syria's "Needs and Requirements": Rubin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will try to clarify Syria's needs and requirements during his
meeting with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria in Geneva on Sunday,
the State Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Rubin said that since Syrian-Israeli peace
talks broke down in mid-January, the Clinton administration
continued its secret diplomacy in a hope that the Mideast peace
process on this track could be resumed. Earlier this week, Clinton
announced his plan to meet Assad for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a face-to-face meeting is the next logical
step in this process," Rubin said. "We have worked with both sides
to try to clarify the needs and the requirements in order to get
the two sides' objectives met."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the president will have something to say to
President Assad, and We'll have to see what he has to say back,"
Rubin added, but he did not disclose what Clinton would say, only
saying: "We don't have meeting like this if we don't have
something to say."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross will join Clinton in Geneva, and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will also be there.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 East German Public Workers Demonstrate for Equal Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 24 (Xinhua)-- Some 10,000 German employees
serving in public divisions of east German states Friday
demonstrated in Potsdam, demanding equal salary with their
colleagues in west states.
</P>
<P>
The parade in the capital of Brandenburg state near Berlin was
organized by a labor union, the Union of Public Service, Transport
and Traffic (OTV).
</P>
<P>
"Without a foreseeable adjustment of east public employees'
salary to the standard of west, there will be no conclusion in
this year's salary negotiation," said OTV leader Herbert Mai.
</P>
<P>
"Ten years after German re-unification, there must be a unity
of income. We want a compromise, " he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Mai, east German public employees, averagely
working 40 hours a week, earn only 86.5 percent as their western
colleagues who work 38.5 hours weekly.
</P>
<P>
The OTV and another trade union, the German Employees' Union(
DAG), are scheduled to begin their annual salary negotiation with
the government five days later.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, every spring begins with a so-called "tariff round
", a series of negotiations between the employers and the powerful
labor unions to determine the salary standard in coming year.
</P>
<P>
And in this year, the OTV and the DAG demand 5 percent
increase of 3.1 million public workers' salary, as well as more
chances of further education.
</P>
<P>
Mai criticized that the employers, including the government,
pursued a "flat income" policy that had kept a salary gap between
west and east Germany.
</P>
<P>
It's the time to raise the salary standard in east Germany,
since the economy has given signs of strong growth and the tax
income is projected to rise faster in this year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Candidates in Last-Ditch Efforts to Woo Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting President Vladimir Putin, who commands a comfortable
lead of more than 50 percent in recent surveys, urged the Russian
voters to go to the polls Sunday to fulfill their constitutional
duty.
</P>
<P>
"I am calling on you and asking you to do just one thing: come
to the polling stations and cast your vote. Listen to yourself and
make your choice," Putin said in an address televised to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Putin stopped short of telling the electorate to vote for him,
but said: "The past three months have shown that despite all
hardships resulting from the events on the North Caucasus and
actions of our army, the society consolidated in the face of
common danger, and we have become stronger."
</P>
<P>
He became the acting head of state on New Year's Eve following
former President Boris Yeltsin's abrupt resignation.
</P>
<P>
Communist party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who trails Putin in a
distant second place, told supporters he remains confident of
making it to the second round in the elections.
</P>
<P>
He even announced a list of cabinet ministers that he will
appoint if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he continued his attacks Friday on remarks made by
Putin earlier this month hinting that Russia might one day join
the NATO if the transatlantic alliance transforms into a political
entity and Moscow is treated as an equal.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out even the hypothetical possibility of a Russia
inside NATO.
</P>
<P>
"If NATO became an organization from San Francisco to Kamchatka.
..Russia would assume the role of cannon-fodder for attaining
Washington-determined objectives," the Interfax news agency quoted
Zyuganov as saying.
</P>
<P>
NATO borders would appear near Pskov and Smolensk, he said. "
Then the 27 million killed (during the Second World War) would
rise and say 'What are you bastards doing? What did we sacrifice
our lives for? So that they would be near Smolensk again?'"
Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal economist who leads the Yabloko
party, was in the third place in opinion polls. He also said he
would face Putin in the run-off.
</P>
<P>
"I rest assured of entry into the second round," Yavlinsky said.
</P>
<P>
Starting from midnight Friday, all campaigning will cease to
allow the voters a quiet 30 hours to ponder their choices before
the polling stations open at 08:00 local time across Russia's 11
time zones.
</P>
<P>
Early voting started on March 15 in remote areas such as polar
stations.
</P>
<P>
Servicemen fighting rebels in Chechnya have also cast their
votes in early voting in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Veshnyakov, chairman of the Central Election
Commission, said all necessary arrangements have been made for
Sunday's balloting.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Friday with international observers in the State
Duma, or lower house of parliament, Veshnyakov said about 1,000
international observers from 56 countries and 82 international
organizations have arrived in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The international observers will join some 500,000 Russian

<HEADLINE> U.N.Report Says World Population Growth To Occur in Urban Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Virtually all population
growth from now until 2030 will be concentrated in the urban areas
of the world, a United Nations report said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
By 2007, the number of urban dwellers is also expected to
exceed the number of rural dwellers for the first time in history,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Those data are part of the 1999 revision of the United Nations
Official estimates and projections of urban, rural and city
population, just released by the Population Division of the
Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Major findings of the study are:
</P>
<P>
-- The world is expected to reach 50 percent urban for the
first time in history in 2007. In 2000. 2.9 billion people live in
urban areas, comprising 47 percent of the world population. By
2030, 4.9 billion are expected to live in urban areas, or 60
percent of the world.
</P>
<P>
-- Virtually all the population growth expected from 2000 to
2030 will be concentrated in the urban areas of the world. During
that period, the urban population is expected to increase by 2
billion persons, the same number that will be added to the whole
population of the world.
</P>
<P>
-- Most of the population increase expected during 2000-2030
will be absorbed by the urban areas of the less developed regions.
The urban population of the less developed regions will probably
rise from 1.9 billion in 2000 to 3.9 billion in 2030.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1995-2000, the world's urban population grew at a rate of
2.1 percent per year. During 2000-2030, it will grow at an average
annual rate of 1.8 percent. At that rate of growth, the world's
urban population will double in 38 years.
</P>
<P>
-- The Urban growth rate of less developed regions reached 2.9
percent per year in 1995-2000, compared to 0.6 percent in more
developed regions. The urban growth rate will continue to be
particularly rapid in urban areas of less developed regions,
averaging 2.3 percent per year during 2000-2030, consistent with a
doubling time of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
-- The level of urbanization is considerably lower in less
developed regions, where just 40 percent of the population lives
today in urban areas. This proportion is expected to rise to 56
percent by 2030.
</P>
<P>
-- The proportion of people living in very large urban
agglomerations is still small. In 2000, 4.3 percent of the world
population lived in cities of 10 million inhabitants or more and
by 2015 that proportion will rise to 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- In 2000, it is estimated that 28.5 percent of the world
population will reside in small cities of less than a million
inhabitants. By 2015, that proportion will probably rise to 30.6
percent. In 2000, 48 percent of the population in developed
countries lived in cities of less than one million inhabitants and
by 2015 that proportion is expected to rise to 49 percent.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips Fall While Tech Stocks Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Friday with blue chips falling while tech stocks rising amid a
report on decline in big-ticket equipment orders.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 7.14 at 11,112.72.
The blue chip index gained 517.49 points this week.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 0.11 at the record closing high of 1,527.46
and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 22.42 at 4,

equipment and machinery fell 2.3 percent in February. But the
index retreated later and finished lower on profit-taking.

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Increase Oil Output by 325,000 bdp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will increase its oil
output by 325,000 barrels a day (bpd) starting April 1, Energy
Minister Luis Tellez said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican minister told the United States during a press
conference that it is not necessary to press too much the oil
producing to have them produce more.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said that he thinks that "an appropriate decision will
be taken" on March 27, while Mexico will announce the exact
amount of its production after the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) makes its own announcement about its
production.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, together with Venezuela and Saudi Arabia agreed in May,
1998 to implement an output cut to prevent the collapse of the oil
prices, which had dropped as much as 10 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
This three-sided agreement, which took out of the market 2.1
million barrels of oil a day and increased the crude price, will
stop being applied April 1. The accord has fueled a tripling of
prices to more than 30 dollars a barrel, a nine-year high.
</P>
<P>
Mexico took out of the market 325,000 barrels of crude a day,
part of those 2.1 million barrels, which now it will put back in
the market to achieve a better equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has been producing 2.9 million bpd of oil due to the
output cut.
</P>
<P>
The Latin American oil producer is playing a decisive role in
the move to lift oil output, analyst said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC will meet next Monday in Vienna to determine the fate of
a year-old producers' pact that stripped more than 5 million
barrels per day of crude from the world market.
</P>
<P>
 Non-OPEC producer Mexico will also attend the meeting as
observer.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Poland to Block Pro-Chechen Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday urged Warsaw to
rescind permissions for pro-Chechen groups to hold demonstrations
outside Russian missions in Poland on Sunday, when Russian
nationals cast their votes there in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"According to available information, on March 26, the day of
the presidential election in the Russian Federation, the Poland-
Chechnya and Free Caucasus committees, scandalously known for
their hooligan behavior, plan manifestations in front of the
Russian Embassy in Warsaw and the Russian Consulate General in
Poznan, where polling stations will be set up that day," the
Russian Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"The manifestations have been sanctioned by the Polish
authorities," the Interfax news agency quoted the ministry as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Such actions may impede voters' access to the places of voting
and cause a real threat to their safety," the ministry said in
reference to a note sent to its Polish counterpart.
</P>
<P>
"Nor can one rule out open provocations on the part of the
demonstrators. Moreover, the organization of mass gatherings in
proximity to polling stations on a day of voting contradicts the
principles of election law generally accepted in democratic
countries and commitments to help to carry through elections in
member states of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which have been made by Poland.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Embassy has made an insistent request to the
Polish authorities to take account of these facts and prevent such
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
"Judging by the silence of official Warsaw, it prefers not to
react to warnings of possible excesses near Russian diplomatic
posts in Poland, with all the consequences that this involves.
This position is bound to cause surprise in view of statements by
Polish officials that Poland wishes to develop all forms of
cooperation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The ministry expressed hope that "the Polish authorities will
after all come to realize that connivance at action in the
interests of the bandit formations in Chechnya will not benefit
Russian-Polish relations."

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Central Bank to Become History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's currency sucre will be
taken out of circulation and will be replaced by fractionary coins
of new characteristics, because of the dolarization that will be
current starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE), which
used to issue the bills and the national coins, will become part
of the South American country's history after April 1.
</P>
<P>
The BCE published a Historic numismatic album titled "Bills and
Coins of Ecuador," a true relic edited in luxurious materials.
</P>
<P>
The inside of the album published Friday by the BCE shows all
the metallic coins and the bills in sucres emitted that will be
taken out of circulation.
</P>
<P>
It also contains the commemorative coins produced by the
Emitting Institute, among which stands out the gold coin minted on
occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Some New York, London, Paris, Madrid, and Tokyo auction houses
are interested because of the characteristics of the publication,
that will be almost unique in the world, and have requested
exclusivity to sell this work of a great historical value for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador has decided to dollarize its economy in order to
rescue the country from its worst economic crisis in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador declared a moratorium on foreign debt payments last
year as total public foreign debt reached more than 13 billion
dollars, equal to its gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Main Chilean Ports Join Workers Stoppage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Maritime and port activities of
Chile's Fifth Region (Valparaiso) are completely paralyzed after
the workers started a mobilization to protest "uncompliance with
an agreement signed with the Eduardo Frei government."
</P>
<P>
Five ships are docked in the port and the same number are lying
at anchor in the bay, while 489 trucks are waiting to load and
unload merchandise, and as many more are parked on Route 68,
outside the city of Valparaiso.
</P>
<P>
Maritime workers national leader Jaime Munoz explained that no
date has been given for the payment of a bonus for the micro-
enterprises, agreed on with the previous administration last year.
</P>
<P>
National Exporters Association chairman Ronald Bown said that
the stoppage of activities endangers some 1.6 million boxes of
fruit that have not been loaded in the five ships that will go to
Saudi Arabia and the United States, meaning a loss of about 50
million dollars, besides the damaging effects on the
entrepreneurial image.
</P>
<P>
The workers of the port of San Antonio joined the stoppage, and
warned that starting at 16:00 local time Friday, the ports of
Talcahuano and San Vicente will join the mobilization for an
indefinite time and will bar the entrance of people to the ships.
