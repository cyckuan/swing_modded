Seeking a hiding place in Lakerland

</P>
<P>
   Scottie, we hardly knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the bolder truth is that in his brief Cup O' Season as
a Rocket, we did get to see the real Scottie Pippen, and that's why
he is suddenly in such a hurry to high-tail it out of town before
he is exposed over the course of an 82-game schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Pippen has come to the realization that even with a
holster filled with silver bullets, some guys are more suited to
being Tonto than the Lone Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, just a few short months after proclaiming his love for the
Houston area and his intention to put down roots, comes Pippen's
yearning to be reunited with his former coach, Phil Jackson in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it might seem a case of requited love, because
Big Chief Triangle openly has talked of his desire to have Pippen
again running his three-cornered offense almost from the moment he
accepted the job as coach of the Lakers. It is a motion offense
that takes the most advantage of Pippen's fluid, raw skills, one
that worked well enough to produce six NBA championships in Chicago
_ though the presence of a certain tongue-wagging extraterrestrial
might have had something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, by having agent Jimmy Sexton work behind the
scenes and by going to former Rockets senior executive vice
president Robert Barr to request a trade to LA, this could be
Pippen's gutless way of admitting he can't stand the heat of being
the main man in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Michael Jordan was on hand to do all the heavy
lifting in Chicago, Pippen was able to drift around the perimeter,
collecting gold rings and accolades as the Bulls' so-called unsung
hero. It was a role that played perfectly into his talent and his
personality, because it often allowed Pippen to showcase his
athleticism while giving him a forum to complain about being
unappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause
were always the bad guys and Jordan was always the man who had to
step up in the clutch and get the job done on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after just a few months of an on-the-run elopement with the
Rockets that had its predictable rocky start, Pippen is ready to
take flight again to the West Coast, where this time he would be
able to continue collecting on his superstar contract ($14.79
million next season) while hiding behind the skirts of Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   It is a perfect scenario for Pippen to assert himself. He gets
to be the teacher's pet in Jackson's learning lab, while never
shouldering the full load of the pressure. To Pippen, O'Neal _ and
to a lesser extent Bryant _ merely would become bigger and younger
versions of Jordan, assuming all the risk while Scottie shakes his
head and makes excuses at their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   By lobbying for a trade, Pippen is trying to lay off all of the
blame for his miserable 1999 season on Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich and his offense. But what Scottie is doing is revealing
the essence of his character as a competitor and a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen spent so much of last season telling everyone how
uncomfortable and unhappy he was with the offense. Yet the coaching
staff defended his play at every turn and said he delivered the
goods. And their noses didn't even grow.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several of his veteran teammates shook their heads in
disgust at Pippen's complaints about the offense, saying all the
chances for him to score and to run were there, if only he would
have taken them. Then Pippen topped off a shameless season by
pointing his finger at Charles Barkley, the buddy who had covered
his back all year, in the Game 1 playoff loss to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the pride to come back and prove everybody wrong?
Didn't he learn that much from Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Rockets are caught in a difficult spot, knowing they
are committed to four more years of a player who didn't like his
experience and doesn't believe Rudy T's pledge to open up the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Barr, unofficially the vice president of ego
massages, hurts any effort to placate Pippen, who needs more
pampering and high maintenance than a tractor-trailer full of Miss
America contestants.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets can acquiesce and send Pippen to the Lakers, though
it will take much more than Robert Horry and jump-shooting,
no-defense, grumpy oinker Glen Rice to seal the deal from a
basketball and salary-cap standpoint. Now if the Lakers were to
mention the name Kobe, well, we're definitely talking.
</P>
<P>
   But a deal like that might not sit too well with Pippen. After
all, it would give him one less skirt behind which to hide in LA.

Elkington drops everything to stand by fallen caddie
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   GLENDALE HEIGHTS, Ill. _ When Steve Elkington stepped from his
car at Medinah Country Club late Thursday morning, less than two
hours before he was to tee off in the 81st PGA Championship, he had
nothing except golf on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He wore his game face. He couldn't have felt better. After two
solid practice rounds, he couldn't have been more ready for
Medinah's green monster. His caddie, Gypsy Joe Grillo, had slapped
Elk on the back and told him so Wednesday afternoon. Gypsy Joe said
he liked his man's chances.
</P>
<P>
   A huge weekend loomed for Elkington. The PGA has been a special
tournament since he won it at Riviera in 1995, and it carried extra
significance here. He is trying to bolster his 1999 earnings to
secure a spot in the season-ending Tour Championship, scheduled for
his home course, Champions, at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   He's not there yet. After a difficult year _ his only top-10
finish came at Doral, which he won _ he's right on the bubble. A
third bout with viral meningitis cost him a high finish, perhaps
even a victory, in the Shell Houston Open, from which he had to
withdraw after being 6-under through three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Only the top 30 will qualify for the Tour Championship. He needs
to move up a couple of notches, then build a fail-safe cushion for
himself. No offense, folks, but this man with the perfect golf
swing doesn't want to hobnob with you in the Champions gallery. He
doesn't want his nose pressed to the windowpane while his peers
traipse by on the fairway beyond his rose garden and swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, he had decided to enter four tournaments in a row,
something players of Elk's stature rarely do. The PGA would be the
second of the bunch _ and easily the most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the PGA,'' Elk said.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, it might be his favorite major.
</P>
<P>
   He said so while we were sitting alone in the ICU waiting room
at Glen Oaks Hospital in Glendale Heights, a Chicago suburb down
the road from Medinah. He was dressed in golf clothes, save for his
spikes, which wouldn't be needed. Elkington had withdrawn from the
PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Walking to the Medinah clubhouse, he noticed a commotion. He saw
a man on a gurney being rushed to a waiting ambulance. Curious, he
looked closer. He saw a frightened face and a familiar one.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsy's.
</P>
<P>
   Now, down the hall, Grillo was being hooked up to a bank of
machines that beep and blink. The popular veteran caddie,
Elkington's good buddy for 13 years, his regular bag-toter since
1996 and his partner for six PGA Tour wins, apparently is out of
danger, but doctors won't be sure until today, after they have put
him through a battery of tests.
</P>
<P>
   Grillo, 48, might have suffered a heart attack Thursday morning.
Then again, he might not have. But it didn't much matter either way
to Elk. How could he go out on the golf course, even for the PGA,
not knowing if Gypsy was OK?
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials told him they would rustle up a caddie in a
jiffy. Elkington passed. Instead, he got back in his car and
followed the ambulance to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gypsy is family,'' he said, his eyes glistening. ``I wouldn't
have been much good out there, under these circumstances. What if
something happened and I wasn't there for him? What if
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he'd gone down? What if I'd never seen him again?
Look, Gypsy doesn't have anybody. It wasn't a hard decision at all.
This is a guy who cooks for me, who takes care of my kids. He'll
drive over (from San Antonio, his home) and work on my car. There
are a lot more important things in life than golf.''
</P>
<P>
   But Grillo didn't fully second Elkington's emotions. Seeing his
boss standing over him in the emergency room, he frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the are you doing here?'' Gypsy said.
</P>
<P>
   But anybody who understands Elkington, Grillo foremost among
them, wouldn't have expected him to be anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Elk isn't always an easy read. He can be grumpy, impersonal,
aloof. He has a temper. Remember how he took his foot to the wall
of the scorer's trailer at Doral _ after he shot a 64? Nonetheless,
he has a heart that's about the size of his native Australia's
Outback.
</P>
<P>
   He participated in a stirring tribute to the late Dave Williams,
his coach at the University of Houston, when Williams was too ill
to attend a charity gala for the school's athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who owns a popular steakhouse near Elk's home was
fighting a losing legal battle with a national restaurant chain
over the use of a name. She had, out of desperation, suggested
resolving the dispute on the golf course, and Elk's skills were
solicited on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never had met her, the particulars of the case
bugged him. To tempt them to back off, he offered the chain's top
executives a free full-day clinic, something that normally would
earn him upwards of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to help that lady,'' he said. ``What's happening to
her is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Elk. Fittingly, his place in the PGA field would be
filled by Bob Friend. It would appear you can't have a better
friend than Steve Elkington.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is the year's other war. While the nation's
attention has focused on Kosovo, American warplanes have
methodically and with virtually no public discussion been attacking
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past eight months, American and British pilots have
fired more than 1,100 missiles against 359 targets.
</P>
<P>
   That is more than triple the targets attacked in four furious
days of strikes in December that followed Iraq's expulsion of U.N.
weapons inspectors, an assault that provoked an international
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   By another measure, the pilots have flown some two-thirds as
many missions as NATO pilots flew over Yugoslavia in 78 days of
around-the-clock war there.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes, including ones as recently as Tuesday, have done
nothing to deter Iraqi gunners from firing on American and British
planes patrolling the ``no flight'' zones over northern and
southern Iraq. They, like officials in Baghdad, are acting as
defiant as ever. And there appears to be no end in sight to the war
_ to the surprise and chagrin of some administration and Pentagon
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle of tit-for-tat skirmishes has gone on so long that the
administration is debating whether to intensify its attacks,
expanding the list of targets to include more significant military
targets, from air defenses to things like bases and headquarters,
as long as Iraq fires at American and British jets, according to
senior Administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has not made a decision, but within the
administration, some hawkish officials have argued that broader,
more punishing strikes would deter the Iraqis and do more to weaken
President Saddam Hussein's government, the officials said. On the
other hand, a tougher stand could also draw attention to strikes
that have generated little opposition at home and abroad, in part
because no American pilots have died or been injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our use of force so far has not risen to a threshold to cause
international concern,'' especially among Arab allies in the
Persian Gulf, one senior official said. ``Disproportionate
responses might.''
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed for much of the year by the war in the Balkans, the
administration's policy toward Iraq is increasingly facing
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of prominent senators and
congressmen sent a letter to Clinton scolding him for what they
called ``the continued drift'' in the administration's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   While they expressed support for the strikes, they called on
Clinton to give Iraq a new deadline to comply with U.N. inspections
and threaten ``serious consequences'' if Saddam refuses, including
more potent air strikes throughout Iraq and an expansion of the
``no flight'' zones. They also called for increased support,
including military aid, to Iraqi opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott
of Mississippi; Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Richard Shelby
of Alabama and Sam Brownback of Kansas, all Republicans; Sens.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, both
Democrats; Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., and Rep. Howard Berman,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and Pentagon officials defend their policy _
including the unending air strikes _ as a firm, but measured effort
to isolate Saddam and weaken his armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   They concede, however, that the Iraqis have proved more
resilient than expected. They have quickly repaired damage done to
air-defense weapons, forcing the Americans to bomb some targets
over and over. They have even rebuilt some of the factories,
barracks and other sites destroyed in December's raids, including
buildings at the Al Taji missile complex, one of the critical
targets, according to Defense officials.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern is Iraq's ability to rebuild its nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons, programs that Saddam pledged to
halt as part of the cease-fire that ended the Persian Gulf war in
1991. In their letter, the lawmakers said there was ``considerable
evidence'' that Iraq continued to pursue those weapons, though
neither they nor their aides elaborated.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and Pentagon officials maintain there is no
evidence of that, but without international inspections, some
acknowledged, there is little to stop Saddam's government from
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've very concerned,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who
served as the chief American representative at the United Nations
during last year's confrontation, told reporters on Wednesday. ``My
experience with the Iraqis is if you give them an inch, they take a
mile.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the administration is quietly supporting a draft
U.N. Security Council resolution by Britain and the Netherlands to
renew the international weapons inspections. That resolution, which
would create a new inspection agency to replace the United Nations
Special Commission, is expected to go before the council in
September but still lacks support from France, Russia and China,
which have veto power.
</P>
<P>
   Without some inspections, the patrols of the ``no flight'' zones
remain the core of the administration's effort to contain Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies created the zones _ north of
the 36th parallel and south of the 33rd _ in the years after the
Persian Gulf war to protect ethnic populations long repressed by
Saddam's government. Iraq has never recognized the zones, but
rarely challenged allied patrols of them.
</P>
<P>
   After December's raids, however, Saddam declared the zones a
violation of Iraq's sovereignty, and his troops have made good on
threats to challenge them. Iraqi MiG jets dart in and out of the
zones. Missile radars have tracked allied patrols and gunners have
fired anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles at them.
</P>
<P>
   American and British warplanes respond when challenged, though
not every time. Every few days, in almost numbing routine, they
have struck missile sites, radar stations and radio towers across
both the northern and southern zones. Since late July, there has
been a new flurry of strikes in response to newly vigorous Iraqi
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday alone, American A-10s and F-16s based in Kuwait or
Saudi Arabia and F-14s and F-18s aboard the aircraft carrier
Theodore Roosevelt attacked three anti-aircraft artillery batteries
and two radar sites in southern Iraq, while F-16s and F-15s based
in Turkey went after two communication centers in the north. Those
attacks followed heavy strikes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says the air strikes are merely defensive responses
to the provocations, meant to protect the pilots. But the targets
American and British pilots strike are often not the ones that
directly threaten them, especially since Iraq has placed many of
its weapons in places the Pentagon says is meant to put Iraqi
civilians at risk. When Iraqi forces fired an anti-aircraft battery
on Tuesday, they did so from downtown Mosul.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. David Deptula, who commands the patrols over northern
Iraq from the air base in Incirlik, Turkey, said the strikes could
stop at any time, as soon as Iraq stopped challenging the zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam really is in control over whether or not we drop any
weapons over his country,'' Deptula said in a telephone interview.
``We didn't for six years'' before December.
</P>
<P>
   With the increase in tempo, the fighting over the zones is
costing upwards of $1 billion a year, though Pentagon officials say
it is difficult to fix an exact cost. More than 200 aircraft, 19
warships and 22,000 American troops are devoted to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The officials acknowledge that the strikes alone will not topple
Saddam, even though the White House has openly called for the
overthrow of his government and promised nominal support to
opposition figures. That has led to frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been kept in check,'' one Defense official said. ``But
the question is: Have you met any of your long-term goals? I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that until a change in
government occurs, containment was the only viable policy at this
time, politically and diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither this administration, nor this Congress, nor any other
country is prepared to take the measures that would be truly
necessary to ensure there was a change of regime,'' the official
said. ``If you want to go beyond containment, you have to put your
money where your mouth is. And that means ground troops.''

DEBRUCE GRAIN FILES MOTION IN OSHA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Experts who investigated last summer's
fatal DeBruce Grain Inc. elevator explosion near Wichita, Kan., for
a federal agency are unfairly being allowed to work against DeBruce
in private lawsuits, the North Kansas City company alleged in legal
documents filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce also asserted that the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration ``has selectively leaked information to the national
and local media,'' prejudicing potential jurors and affecting the
fairness of multiple legal proceedings against the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taint of what has already happened is considerable and
prejudicial,'' DeBruce said in its request to an OSHA appeals panel
to dissolve a stay in the matter and immediately let the company
review OSHA's investigative reports, interview its experts and
begin defending itself.
</P>
<P>
   An OSHA spokesman in Kansas City, Mo., on Thursday said the
agency would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The June 8, 1998, blast destroyed sections of the vast grain
elevator complex and left seven workers dead and others injured.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year OSHA issued three dozen workplace-safety
violations against DeBruce, with civil fines totaling $1.74
million.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 36 violations, 26 fell into the most serious ``willful''
category, including at least nine instances of inoperative grain
dust collection systems. DeBruce appealed and the case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   To date, OSHA has not released its investigative report on the
cause of the blast. But its experts publicly have attributed the
explosion to the presence of volatile grain dust in an underground
conveyor-belt tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator Vernon Grose told The Wichita Eagle newspaper last
summer that a seized bearing in that machinery caused friction and
generated enough heat to ignite grain dust.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce officials have taken sharp exception to that, arguing
that grain was not being moved in that area at the time of the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn affidavit, a lawyer for DeBruce said C.W. Kauffman,
an expert used by OSHA, was simultaneously working for Industrial
Maintenance Inc. of Wichita, a DeBruce subcontractor that also has
been sued in connection with the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the OSHA Review Commission in Washington stayed all
activity in DeBruce's appeal until federal prosecutors in Wichita
completed their investigation of possible criminal wrongdoing. That
matter also is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   But DeBruce also complained Thursday that OSHA representatives
were working with the Justice Department and eventually would be
allowed to disclose non-grand jury evidence in the case to OSHA for
use in its civil proceeding against the company.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce objects to that because OSHA in effect is continuing to
develop its case against DeBruce despite the stay order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to mitigate the effect of this outrageous
development is to level the playing field by dissolving the stay
... and eliminate the one-sided nature of these actions,'' the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Williams, the U.S. attorney in Wichita, did not return
calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for the stay earlier this year, government lawyers
said it was essential to prevent DeBruce from ``making use of the
liberal discovery procedures applicable to a civil suit as a dodge
to avoid the restrictions on criminal discovery and thereby obtain
documents he would not otherwise be entitled to for use in his
criminal trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery is a legal procedure in which both sides must disclose
certain evidence.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA has 10 days to respond to DeBruce's motion to lift the
stay.

HEAT TAKES ITS TOLL ON MISSOURI STATE FAIR'S OPENING DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDALIA, Mo. _ ``The Best Fun Around'' is the theme for this
year's Missouri State Fair, but opening day was no fun for 50
members of the Sedalia Smith-Cotton High School band who collapsed
in the 100-degree heat after marching a half mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' band director Andy Kroesen said.
``We've done this several years, but we get to the end of this
year's parade and everyone starts dropping. It was only a half-mile
parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarinets, flag poles and band cases were strewn on the ground
as band members, their faces red and their hair drenched with
sweat, were taken to the Red Cross center for treatment. Some were
crying, others vomiting and others shaking.
</P>
<P>
   The students, who were wearing summer uniforms of T-shirts and
shorts and no hats, were taken to the center by ambulances and golf
carts, or in some cases, carried by friends.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Allen, the fair's marketing director, said 22 persons
were treated at the fair's first-aid station. Of those, nine were
taken to Bothwell Regional Health Center, where they were treated
and released.
</P>
<P>
   Four other persons were treated at the Red Cross center. Ron
Pauble, fire chief in Claycomo, Mo., and in charge of the fair's
emergency crew, said these were the worst heat-related problems he
could remember in his 10 years working at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular person at the fair on Thursday might have been
Todd Lagessie, 34, of Kansas City, Mo., who stood 8 1/2 feet tall
on his stilts and was dressed as a firefighter, spraying people
with a huge squirt gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a squirt?'' he'd ask passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   Then he'd spray them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get wet, I want to get wet,'' shouted Janie
Fitzpatrick, 10, of Salisbury, Mo., as she ran under Lagessie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever fallen?'' someone else asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't say the `F' word, please,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   You could see the heat in the faces of people as they entered
the Missouri Farm Bureau building, one of seven air-conditioned
buildings on the fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, they'd lift their arms and smile.
</P>
<P>
   Back outside, business was less than brisk at the funnel cake
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only sold eight,'' said Misty Ross, 19, of Sedalia,
working at Carol's Funnel Cakes.
</P>
<P>
   The air conditioner in the funnel cake trailer broke Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants a hot funnel cake, but they want a lot of
drinks,'' Ross said as she wiped the sweat from her face.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Whitaker, in blue jeans and a straw cowboy hat, was
sitting in front of a box fan inside a sweltering barn.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old stable hand from Center, Mo., washed down the
horses every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work 'em hard and they show hard, then we run ice cubes
over them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was hot and dusty in the outdoor arena where a cattle show
was being judged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like we're out in Kansas during the dust bowl,'' said
Barbara Kendrick, 56, of Mineral Point, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandsons were showing cattle and her daughter showing
sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we have a wind or we'd be burning up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The family was camping at the fair, as they've done for the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hottest it's been so far,'' she said. ``We're
hoping it will cool down tomorrow.''

CHINA WARNS OF MILITARY ACTION AGAINST TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add six grafs to end of original text.)  (Eds: This story replaces CLINTON-DEFENSE) 
(mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chinese government officials have warned the
Clinton administration that Beijing may be compelled to take
military action to ``punish'' Taiwan for what Beijing sees as moves
toward independence, administration officials and China experts
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, Washington has warned Chinese officials that any
military action by China against Taiwan would bring retaliation by
the United States, administration officials said. In the past week,
the administration has also publicly and privately urged the two
sides to resolve the situation between themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings about the possible use of force have come not from
top Chinese leaders, but lower-ranking Chinese officials in
meetings with administration officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was not entirely clear whether the Chinese officials were
attempting to gauge American reaction to the use of force, or
trying to enlist American help in pressuring Taiwan to back down.
China has considered Taiwan a renegade province since the civil war
ended 50 years ago, and has never renounced the use of force to
reunite Taiwan with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said it was also not clear whether
Beijing had decided what course to take.
</P>
<P>
   If military action was employed, administration officials said,
it could range from striking at Taiwan to seizing an unpopulated
island belonging to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Military action against Taiwan itself appeared to be the least
likely course for Beijing, several administration officials said.
But one official said the military situation in the Taiwan Strait
was ``dangerous'' and ``very delicate.'' For more than a week,
military aircraft from China and Taiwan have been flying close to
each other over the 100-mile-wide waterway, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances are very real for an inadvertent thing or
something more ominous,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was preparing for ``contingencies'' in the
Taiwan Strait, another official said. But he declined to elaborate
on what those preparations were.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the United States came the closest to a military
confrontation with China since the Eisenhower era after the Chinese
lobbed missiles near Taiwan and the Clinton administration moved
two aircraft carrier groups into the region.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Chinese leaders, who have just returned from
their annual retreat in Beidahe, appeared to be divided on how to
respond to recent statements by Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui,
that negotiations with Beijing over the island should take place on
a ``state to state'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard-liners want to be tough. Others are saying let's
wait,'' one administration official said. He added that, overall,
China appeared to be ``waiting to see if Taiwan could be put back
into the box.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge d'affaires at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu
Xiaomin, was summoned to the office of assistant secretary of state
for East Asia, Stanley Roth, last week.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony the following day before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Roth said that the Chinese and the Taiwanese
had been given six demarches by the United States urging them to
restrain their military activities in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government may also be sending their warnings about
taking military action to test the United States, several China
experts said. The government has used the South China Morning Post,
a Hong Kong newspaper, to float stories about pending action.
Thursday's edition of the paper said that 500,000 troops of the
People's Liberation Army were being mobilized in a southern
province.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon officials have said in the last several days that
they have seen no sign of such massive mobilization.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to take a smaller island belonging to Taiwan would not
need such a large mobilization, however.
</P>
<P>
   A former American diplomat to China, Chas. Freeman, said that he
believed the Chinese were serious in their intent to ``punish''
Taiwan. It was not clear what form that would take, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing regards Taiwan as a Chinese province that must
eventually be rejoined to the mainland. Freeman said recent
statements from Taiwanese officials about a ``state to state''
relationship with China appeared to nudge the island closer to
independence and have encouraged Beijing to be more assertive in
trying to demonstrate its sovereignty with air flights over the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   The United States finds itself in the middle of the dispute
because of its pledge to provide for Taiwan's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Washington announced that it was going ahead with the
sale of $500 million of military equipment to Taiwan. Beijing
protested the sale, which had been agreed to between Taipei and
Washington well before the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Several administration officials said they hoped that the
Chinese government's actions would be tempered by two important
dates. The first is the planned meeting between President Clinton
and President Jiang Zemin in New Zealand in September. The second
is the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China, on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   These officials and China experts said they believed that
Beijing might be reluctant to take dramatic action against Taiwan
that would mar those two events.
</P>
<P>
   Moderates in the Chinese government appear anxious, for example,
to revive talks on China's entry into the World Trade Organization,
the officials and experts said. That topic is a recurrent one in
talks between Clinton and Jiang.

SOME VETERANS WONDER WHETHER PUBLIC VIEWS THEM WITH INDIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The foreign wars were challenge enough.
</P>
<P>
   The home front represents a whole new battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Veterans of Foreign Wars holds its national convention next
week in Kansas City. The gathering, which begins Monday in Bartle
Hall, marks the 100th anniversary of the VFW, the country's
second-largest veterans group, with 1.9 million members.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the milestone, VFW organizers have invited the
public to an airshow and other entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Several area VFW members, however, aren't sure the public wants
the veterans' company. Many of them wonder whether their years in
uniform spark only indifference in the civilian community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's kids don't have the faintest idea of what veterans
are,'' said Paul Connors, a Vietnam veteran who serves as
quartermaster of VFW Post 30 in Blue Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending upon the age of the individual, the perception of
what a veteran is will be completely across the spectrum. While the
older people from the 1940s and 1950s are aware, teen-agers still
wonder what went on during World War II. I spoke with some young
people who saw `Saving Private Ryan' and they asked me, `Why were
we bombing the French?'
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no concept of what went on during D-Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors, like many VFW members, is fighting such disinterest by
working to make veterans in general and the VFW in particular
relevant to the community. In May his post cooperated with other
service groups to organize a child safety and identification
program through St. Mary's Hospital of Blue Springs, Mo. Some post
members also cook for senior citizen food programs and perform
other community service.
</P>
<P>
   But creating significant awareness of veterans, some say, is a
challenge during peacetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have a major war going on, veterans become very
popular,'' said Jerry Jones of Raytown, a Vietnam veteran who
commands the VFW's 4th District in Missouri, covering metropolitan
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have no major war now, so there's no need for the
military and no need for veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   VFW member Margaret Wescott offers a similar perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't seem to be much information put out about how
veterans are soldiers willing to give their lives,'' said Wescott,
quartermaster of VFW Post 11555 of Topeka, Kan., the first
female-only VFW post, chartered in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start asking younger people, it's `What's a veteran?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moskos, a military sociologist at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Ill., even wonders whether the public's
ultimate view of veterans is all that flattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Moskos said. `` `Forrest Gump' was considered to
be a movie favorable to the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet Forrest was still a moron.''
</P>
<P>
   It all hints at a gulf between veterans and the American
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government dropped the draft in 1973, and the share
of Americans who have served since has diminished. Moskos has
argued that if lawmakers bring back the draft, it would strengthen
ties between the civilian and military worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe it would at least raise awareness of veterans'
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have a veteran in your family, you probably don't
care or think about veterans,'' said Jim Hughes, assistant
quartermaster of VFW Post 5789 in Lee's Summit, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, former soldiers returning to civilian life
made veterans issues high priority. Through the July 1956 cutoff
date, more than 2.2 million World War II veterans had enrolled in
college through the GI Bill, with the government spending $1,858
for every veteran it sent through school.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran, however, didn't always command such clout. Consider
the different environments for veterans in 1999 and 1931, the last
time the VFW convened in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the federal Veterans Administration was only a year
old.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs receives more than $17
billion to provide health care to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans' groups today represent ``one of the more powerful
lobbies in Washington,'' The New York Times recently said.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, VFW convention delegates will consider more than 100
resolutions regarding veterans' care.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1931 convention, however, priorities were more basic.
A federal veterans' administrator drew cheers after promising to do
his best to see that ``no veteran goes hungry or is out in the cold
this winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in part because of debates over benefits or entitlements,
the relationship of veterans and the public has been fluid.
</P>
<P>
   The 1931 convention occurred only months before the lowest
moment in the veterans' movement. In July 1932, Army troops, using
tear gas, routed about 20,000 World War I veterans from their
Washington encampment.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans were demanding an immediate cash payment of a bonus
promised by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However shameful their treatment, the veterans still didn't
command unflinching sympathy from the public, said Michael Neiberg,
assistant professor of history at the U.S. Air Force Academy in
Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the Depression hit, the country really began to polarize
over issues,'' Neiberg said. ``And the perception then was that
anyone in the enlisted ranks was a person of pretty low skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you have to have a high school diploma to get into the
military. That wasn't the case in 1931.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, some newspapers were affronted that the World War
Disability Act, passed that year, committed $73 million to veterans
in the middle of hard times. Veterans totally disabled by wounds
could receive as much as $2,400 a year _ this when 65 percent of
Americans earned less than $3,000 yearly.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans benefits today are a familiar concept to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But today's veterans, because of the public's sometimes fickle
regard for their needs, should never assume that their entitlements
are sacrosanct, said Jones of the VFW's 4th Missouri District.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now veterans are fighting a Cold War for their rights and
entitlements,'' said Jones.

LINGERING INJURY COULD END BEAU MORGAN'S ROSTER BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey wants to
give Beau Morgan every opportunity to make this club. The
versatility the former Air Force all-conference wishbone
quarterback brings provides plenty of intriguing possibilities in
various Gailey schemes.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, however, a lingering injury to the second toe
on his left foot has put Morgan's potential pro career on
indefinite hiatus. It has Morgan and Gailey frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan spent Thursday in Dallas and was examined by Dr. Gene
Curry, who diagnosed the injury as a sprained second toe, Cowboys
trainer Jim Maurer said. Morgan, who injured the toe on Aug. 1, is
expected to be out one to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The injury is considered unusual, but not as bad as a sprain to
the big toe as in cornerback Deion Sanders' case, Maurer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one more frustrated right now than Beau,'' Gailey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys want to give the undersized Morgan, who won two
private-school state championships as quarterback at Trinity
Christian-Addison, every opportunity to make the final roster.
Gailey loves his grit and competitiveness, plus all the interesting
options a small but strong former option quarterback can provide
out of the backfield, albeit in limited scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's career is now relegated to a strict timeline. If he can
get healthy and return to practice, he can still make the squad.
Gailey did not rule out a slim chance that Morgan will find a
roster spot if he is not healthy, but he said it would be extremely
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody that's not been on this team and hadn't
proven himself in the NFL can make it on just what they did in camp
a year or so ago,'' said Gailey, referring to Morgan's time at camp
the last two years while serving out his commitment to the Air
Force. ``I think you have to show it on the field. But, don't hold
me to that.'' nn

KEVIN SMITH OUT WITH BAD BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN AND RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith
will be out of action indefinitely as he continues to seek a remedy
for a back problem that first surfaced last season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who did not return to training camp this week after the
exhibition game against Cleveland, went to Dallas and received an
epidural injection Thursday. He will undergo rehabilitation this
week and be re-evaluated Monday by Dr. Drew Dossett, Cowboys
trainer Jim Maurer said. Smith played briefly in Monday night's
exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are seriously hurting at cornerback with Deion
Sanders out indefinitely and now Smith out at least another week
and perhaps much longer. Kevin Mathis, who is slated to start
opposite Smith at cornerback in Sanders' absence, returned to
practice Wednesday after suffering a lower back contusion last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries open the door for rookie Duane Hawthorne, who
impressed coaches in Monday's exhibition while getting the start in
place of Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Injured safety Charlie Williams (fractured left forearm) is
expected back at practice next week. ROCKET GROUNDED; LaFLEUR WON'T
PLAY
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail would make his Cowboys debut
Sunday against the Raiders in Oakland fizzled Thursday. Gailey said
Ismail will not play in the team's second exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail walked through drills on Wednesday, but did not practice
Thursday due to a sprained left shoulder suffered on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end David LaFleur is back at practice and looking good,
Gailey said. However, Gailey said LaFleur will likely not play
Sunday for precautionary reasons. ``If did (play) it would be
special situations in a very limited amount,'' Gailey said. IF
HEALTHY, McIVER STARTS
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are targeting the final week or two of training camp
for right guard Everett McIver's return.
</P>
<P>
   McIver is rehabilitating his left knee after surgery in the
latter portion of the 1998 season after suffering a torn anterior
cruciate ligament. Gailey said as long as McIver is healthy he will
be the starter, but he couldn't say if McIver would be ready for
the Sept. 12 opener at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Solomon Page, a tackle from West Virginia, started at
right guard in Monday's exhibition. Page will compete with injured
Tony Hutson (sprained knee ligament) for the position upon Hutson's
return. FRICKE IMPRESSES
</P>
<P>
   Ben Fricke, a recent addition from Amsterdam of NFL Europe, has
impressed coaches enough to have a shot at earning a roster spot.
Fricke, a center, got an opportunity after center Mike Kiselak
suffered a season-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey called Fricke (6-foot, 295 pounds) ``a pleasant
surprise'' and lauded his technique. Fricke, out of the University
of Houston, said he spent three weeks in Houston working out after
the NFL Europe season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is set in stone,'' he said. ``You have to demonstrate
your skills all over again.'' BEATING THE HEAT
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys got a bit of a breather during Thursday's afternoon
practice. Gailey allowed the team to forgo helmets as a way to beat
the heat _ sort of. Most players donned ball caps or bandanans.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature again hit 106 degrees on the practice field with
a heat index of 109.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand all the physcial stuff of how it works, but
evidently you lose a lot of heat through your head and that's how
your body gets rid of all that stored up heat in you. So we're
going to take a look at that,'' Gailey said. McGARITY THE RETURNER
</P>
<P>
   Rookie wide receiver Wane McGarity keeps giving the Cowboys'
coaching staff reasons to keep him. The latest is his ability to
return punts _ a task that before Monday night he hadn't done since
before his Texas Longhorns days.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think about a guy who hadn't caught punts since high
school, and his first game is on Monday Night Football in Canton,
Ohio, at the Hall of Fame, against a left-footed punter, and he
goes out there and catches every one of them ... that's pretty
impressive,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity flawlessly fielded four punts against Cleveland,
returning three of them for a 6.0-yard average. He will get more
work there Sunday at Oakland. AIKMAN'S BLINDSIDE
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman was complimentary Thursday when asked
about second-year Flozelle Adams' switch from right guard to
``protector of Aikman's blindside'' at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't noticed his play that much, which is a good
thing. I think he's more comfortable there,'' Aikman observed.
``When you have Mark Tunei protecting your blindside for nine
years, and Larry Allen doing it for a year ... you tend to get
spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had to worry about that backside. And Flo knows
that I don't anticipate worrying about it this year, either.'' nn

STARS REACH CONTRACTS WITH TWO, TURN FOCUS TO MATVICHUK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug Armstrong's ``To-Do'' list continues to grow shorter. But
the Stars' assistant general manager said he knows there's plenty
to accomplish before the Stars open training camp Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong took care of two potential arbitration cases in
Toronto before speaking to an arbitrator, settling a two-year deal
with Jamie Pushor and a one-year deal with Derek Plante before
returning to Texas on Thursday. He now will attempt to sign the
Stars' remaining restricted free agents, the most important of whom
is defenseman Richard Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have moved along pretty well this summer, but we still
have a few players we need to get signed,'' Armstrong said. ``Our
goal has always been to get everyone signed before training camp,
and that's no different this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Matvichuk under contract before training camp begins in
Vail, Colo., is the biggest challenge. In fact, it might be a
challenge to get the 26-year-old defenseman signed before the
season opener Oct. 1. Neither Armstrong nor Matvichuk's agent, Art
Breeze, would comment on potential salary figures, but one source
said the two are far apart in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk, who made $871,000 last season, is seeking a salary
similar to that of Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor's $2.5 million.
The Stars are looking more in the range of $1.5 million, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides appear to have plenty of willpower as far as waiting
is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no question in our mind that Rich is
recognized leaguewide as one of the top five defensive defensemen
in the NHL,'' Breeze said. ``When you consider that and when you
consider his ice time \Rthird on the Stars behind Derian Hatcher
and Sergei Zubov\S, Rich's value is very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Breeze said that the negotiation ball is in the Stars' court _
that he is awaiting an offer. Armstrong said he is working on that
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our goal is with every player is to get a contract that's
fair to both sides,'' Armstrong said. ``If either side is unhappy
with the contract, that's not good for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has plenty of experience in waiting out contract
negotiations. Mike Modano and Derian Hatcher have missed training
camp within the past two seasons. And with Pushor now under
contract and negotiations continuing with Brad Lukowich, the Stars
expect to have six strong defensemen _ Hatcher, Zubov, Sydor,
Pushor, Lukowich and Shawn Chambers _ at training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Pushor, 26, was acquired from the Atlanta Thrashers this summer
in a trade for winger Jason Botterill. A defensive defenseman who
played most of his career with the Detroit Red Wings, Pushor is
seen as a younger version of Craig Ludwig, who the Stars said they
will not re-sign. Pushor, who made $350,000 last season with the
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, agreed to a two-year deal and surrendered
the right to have his case heard by an arbitrator. Terms of the
deal were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Plante's deal is one year for $750,000, a decrease in pay from
the $1 million he made last season.

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As crews patched and painted the bullet-scarred
interior of the North Valley Jewish Community Center, well-wishers
came by bearing gifts _ brownies, religious literature or simple
good will.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching as far as the locked and guarded gates of the center
Thursday, visitors of many faiths said they were so appalled by the
acts of Buford Furrow Jr. that they were drawn to the center two
days after the rampage there that wounded three children, a teen
and a grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart brought me here,'' said Jehovah's Witness Dolly
Gerston, 74. ``I don't know anybody here but we all belong to each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerston, who normally drives past the center on Tuesdays on the
way to the grocery store, brought a purseful of Jehovah's Witness
pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   Repair trucks entered the community center grounds throughout
the day. Iron gates were closed behind them to keep onlookers away.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Rouss, executive director of Jewish Community Centers of
Los Angeles, said that walls pockmarked by Furrow's bullets were
filled and repainted, some windows were replaced and some chairs
were fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Rouss announced that the center will reopen Monday. About 80
children, two-thirds the normal number for a Thursday, took part in
activities at the transplanted day camp. Rouss said that lack of a
swimming pool probably kept some away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some parents are still working on some issues at
home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A guard accepted gifts and allowed flowers to be laid at the
gate but the Center declined offers of help. Some visitors simply
wanted to offer support.
</P>
<P>
   Najee Ali, executive director of Project Islamic HOPE, stopped
outside the center where a shrine of flowers grew steadily
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to show our concern,'' he said. ``Even though
Jews and Muslims have differences in the Middle East, when things
like this happen, it doesn't matter what the issues are.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzie McCarthy and her mother, Janis, bore two platefuls of
baked goods as they walked into the complex where center day camp
and preschool activities have been relocated, a plot of land shared
by a temple and an Episcopal church. The mother and daughter said
they are Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends are Jewish and we love the Jewish
community. We wanted to show we care and we do,'' said Suzie
McCarthy, 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anyone can say they're Christians and not
love Jews,'' Janis McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Rouss said Sabbath services at 6 p.m. tonight at the center will
be ecumenical. He said the event will be a ``community gathering of
solidarity and healing'' but space will limit attendance to center
members and immediate neighbors of the Rinaldi Street complex.
</P>
<P>
   A larger event open to the entire community will take place
Sunday at 2 p.m. at Cal State University, Northridge, Rouss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a large enough place to say that evil will not win. We
will not let this man's evil stop us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Socorro Weinstein, a Catholic whose husband, Daniel, is Jewish,
said she came to the school in person because she couldn't find out
by phone when the center swimming pool would reopen. Her two
daughters Gabriella, 6, and Julietta, 2, would have gone swimming
Tuesday afternoon were it not for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   She was told her children could swim Tuesday. She plans to be
back then despite the worry that sometimes crosses her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to follow my heart,'' she said. ``I'm really fine and I
think now we're going to be OK here.''
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in volunteering at the North Valley Jewish
Community Center are asked to call (818) 360-2211 on Monday.
Donations can be sent to Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los
Angeles, 5700 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 2705, Los Angeles, Calif.
90036.

PENNANT RACE SHOULD STIR RANGERS' FANS TO FEVER PITCH (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Did you notice the recent cold front? I
wouldn't exactly call it frigid, but there was definitely a
cooling-off period.
</P>
<P>
   By usual standards, it was an icy reception given the Texas
Rangers during the recent two-week homestand. Where did the fans
go? What turned them off? Wasn't it hot enough for them,
baseball-wise?
</P>
<P>
   Blame it, if you like, on the triple-digit temps, but
made-in-the-shade weather in August isn't a local custom. And when
you're talking triple digits, it doesn't apply to just the weather.
The Rangers remain on pace to reach 100 wins for the season,
totally unheard of around here.
</P>
<P>
   A hot team in North Texas usually translates into smokin'
turnstiles, but ...
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers averaged only 31,000 for the 13 games of the
homestand. Crowds of 40,000-plus happened only twice. Six times,
the attendance dipped below 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   What's the problem here?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe general manager Doug Melvin inadvertently had the answer
when he was talking Thursday about his failure to pursue a trade
for veteran pitcher Kevin Appier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if I failed to take into account Appier being
re-energized by leaving Kansas City and going to a team playing for
something,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   At the major-league trading deadline on July 31, Melvin did
nothing while Appier was acquired by Oakland, where he has had two
strong starts, for a 2-0 record and a sizzling 1.20 earned-run
average.
</P>
<P>
   The recent homestand opened on the weekend of the trading
deadline. Did a passive Melvin drain a certain amount of energy
from the fans?
</P>
<P>
   Winning a division has become mundane stuff for the Rangers.
Everyone, including Melvin, wants more. But the way the Rangers'
pitching rotation is structured, it's very doubtful there can be
more in October.
</P>
<P>
   With low expectations for the coming postseason, and with
microwave heat descending upon the ballpark (only one of 13 first
pitches in the homestand came with the temperature below 94), did
the fans say to heck with it?
</P>
<P>
   Apathy appears to be the case, but we will know for sure in
another week. The next homestand has Boston for the weekend
(starting next Friday), and the Yankees on Monday through
Wednesday. If those six games don't average more than 40,000, then
the fans are definitely yawning this season away.
</P>
<P>
   Do not mistake any of this, however, for a second-guess of
Melvin being docile at the trading deadline. Even if it turns out
he did need to goose the fans, and the team, by upgrading the
rotation, you didn't read it here at the time. Therefore, I have no
second-guess privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what pitchers were available, supply didn't seem to
equal demand. Plus, it did appear time to finally leave the farm
system alone and allow continued growth. Overall, Melvin did the
right thing by sitting tight on pitching trades at the deadline,
and before.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the early returns say his patience backfired.
Again, I'm not one who can second-guess on this issue, but the
facts follow:
</P>
<P>
   Besides Appier, the A's picked up Omar Olivares from the Angels,
and he's 2-0 with a 2.95 ERA in three starts. The Rangers talked
about reacquiring Darren Oliver from the Cardinals, and he's 3-2
with a 2.21 ERA in his past five starts. When Andy Pettitte's name
came up with the Yankees, everyone was scared of damaged goods. But
New York kept him, and Pettitte is 4-1 with a 3.30 ERA in his past
five starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' asking price for Chuck Finley was so steep neither
the Rangers nor Indians could land him. Finley is pitching decent,
with a 1-1 record and 4.12 ERA over six starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to say we did right or wrong,'' Melvin said,
``but for now, Olivares is the one guy we'd like to have. I thought
he was a fit here. But when the Angels wanted to package him with
(infielder) Randy Velarde, we backed off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scouted Appier for three months ``and I never got
the reports I wanted to hear,'' Melvin said, ``plus, Oakland gave
up three pitchers for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other traded pitchers, Kenny Rogers went from the A's to
the Mets. ``They never offered him to us,'' Melvin said. And Juan
Guzman went from the Orioles to the Reds. ``The Reds paid a steep
price,'' Melvin added.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Melvin is trying to drum up a waiver-wire deal for a
pitcher, ``but I can almost guarantee nothing substantial is going
to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rangers are close to the stretch run of what
might become the best season in franchise history. But after this
homestand, the next question is how many fans still care? nn

TCU FACES PRESSING QUESTIONS HEADING INTO FALL DRILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Two-a-days begin bright and early this
morning at TCU. You know what that means?
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice a day, we will be asked whether we can beat Arizona,''
Horned Frogs wide receiver Cedric James quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Twice? Try 457 times. And the question is not just whether TCU
is capable of toppling Arizona, a national-championship contender.
TCU has a number of questions to be answered during two-a-days.
Coach Dennis Franchione just hopes to have them answered before
opening the season against the Wildcats on Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   With full-squad practices beginning this morning, there is no
better time than the present to get started. So here's a list of
the Top 10 questions Franchione finds himself facing as two-a-days
begin:
</P>
<P>
   NO. 10 _ WHO IS GOING TO MAKE ALL OF THE TACKLES JOE PHIPPS MADE
LAST SEASON?
</P>
<P>
   Phipps has taken his pursue-and-destroy linebacking philosophy
to Cowboys camp. So what's the big deal? Well, Phipps registered a
limb-numbing (and team-leading) 153 tackles in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to pick up the load? On his locker, junior Shannon
Brazzell has a sticker that says ``Count on me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't put it up last year because I was a young pup. I was
just following Phipps to see how he got it done,'' said Brazzell,
who started alongside Phipps last season. ``I put that up this year
because I want to be that guy. I wanted guys to know when it comes
down to it they can count on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will play alongside Brazzell is still to be determined, and
coaches will be keeping a close eye on redshirt freshman John
Turntine during two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 9 _ WHAT SIDE OF THE BALL WILL KYLE WILLIAMS PLAY ON?
</P>
<P>
   Just call Williams the big man's version of ``Slash.'' He'll be
practicing two positions, tight end and defensive tackle. He'll
spend the first three days of two-a-days at tight end and then do a
little of both on Day 4. Franchione plans to have him settled into
one or the other before the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to have to guess today, I'd say he'll be a tight
end,'' Franchione said. ``But we're going to use him wherever we
need him most.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 8 _ WHAT WILL BE THIS SEASON'S BONDING THEME?
</P>
<P>
   Every team needs a cause. Last year, it was about proving the
Horned Frogs weren't as bad as their 1-10 finish in 1997. So what
is this year's team out to prove?
</P>
<P>
   ``That last year wasn't a fluke,'' Franchione said. ``We're
about to find out how much getting that point across means to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   NO. 7 _ WHO IS GOING TO BE THE BACKUP TAILBACK?
</P>
<P>
   At last check, tailback LaDainian Tomlinson wasn't Superman, so
the chances of him carrying the ball on every TCU running play
aren't good. When he goes to the sideline for a breather, who goes
in?
</P>
<P>
   ``Good question,'' Franchione said. ``We don't have an answer
for that today. We have candidates, and we have choices. Now, we
need for somebody to separate themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are junior Charles Jones and redshirt freshmen
LaTarence Dunbar and Frank Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach has said that the second tailback spot isn't taken. He
has a name put in, but it's not promised to anybody,'' Dunbar said.
``I'm going to come out during two-a-days and try to make that
backup role mine.''
</P>
<P>
   NO. 6 _ WHAT CRAZY PROMISE WILL fRANCHIONE MAKE THIS TIME
AROUND?
</P>
<P>
   During two-a-days last year, Horned Frogs punter Royce Huffman
talked Franchione into promising to bleach his hair if TCU went to
a bowl game. One Sun Bowl-berth later, Franchione's salt-and-pepper
locks were blond.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught me at about Day 8 of two-a-days. It was one of
those things where I said yes in a weaker moment,'' said
Franchione, who isn't figuring on Huffman's late arrival for
preseason drills (he's playing minor-league baseball) to help him.
``By the time he gets here he'll be kind of feisty, and I'll be
wearing down.''
</P>
<P>
   NO. 5 _ WHO IS GOING TO BE THE LEFT CORNERBACK?
</P>
<P>
   There are two positions on TCU's defense without an experienced
player returning or ready to step in. Left cornerback is one of
them. It isn't a good one for an inexperienced player. ``It's such
a high-pressure position for us,'' defensive coordinator Gary
Patterson said. ``Our corner is on an island quite a bit. So it
takes a little bit of a special individual.'' Kendrick Patterson
was penciled in on the depth chart, but his shoulder problems have
left the race up in the air. The front-runner looks to be redshirt
freshman Jason Goss, who had a good spring, with redshirt freshman
Bo Springfield in close pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 _ CAN TCU'S DEFENSE BE AS GOOD AS IT WAS IN 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Minus 23 yards. TCU defensive tackle Shawn Worthen smiles as he
repeats Southern Cal's Sun Bowl rushing numbers to himself. Pretty
good day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we can be more dominant,'' Worthen said. ``We're
more experienced, so now we can do more things with the defense _
blitzes, coverages. Really, I see last year as being a
steppingstone for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   NO. 3 _ CAN TCU'S PASSING OFFENSE BE BETTER THAN IT WAS IN 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Franchione isn't kidding when he says they have to get better
because they can't get much worse. How much better will depend on
what second-year quarterback Patrick Batteaux and the receiving
corps show they are capable of handling during two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to compete, we've got to throw the ball,'' receiver
Cedric James said. ``That means I've got to step it up, and I
expect a bigger season out of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   NO. 2 _ LET'S SAY BATTEAUX GETS LOST ON HIS WAY TO AMON CARTER
STADIUM FOR TCU'S OPENER AGAINST ARIZONA. WHO WOULD START AT
QUARTERBACK?
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a No. 2 signal caller to pencil in?
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs are waiting to make sure Jeff Dover, last
season's backup, makes his grades. If so, he'd be the No. 2 against
Arizona. If not, Franchione will be looking at redshirt freshman
Sean Stilley and sophomore transfer Matt Schobel. Neither has
played a game in college. Would they be ready to play?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 15 practices during spring ball; now, compared to when
spring ball started I definitely feel better,'' Schobel said.
``What you have to realize is we have 29 practices between now and
Arizona. That's like two spring balls, so I'm sure I'll be even
more comfortable than I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   And the No. 1 question TCU needs to answer by the end of
two-a-days: Can this team beat Arizona?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they are known as a powerhouse,'' James said, ``but
this is college football. Anything can happen.'' nn

THE FAMILY ZITO: PERSPECTIVE PERFECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Barry Zito is on the road to Oakland, his mother
is on the road to recovery and they have such a hale wind at their
backs that the inconceivable now appears indisputable:
</P>
<P>
   Zito, a former Pierce College and USC baseball standout, is
going to pitch in the big leagues and Roberta Zito will be around
to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, both mother and son took big steps on Thursday
_ Barry was promoted to the Athletics' Class AA affiliate in El
Paso, Texas, and Roberta walked without help for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Barry's progress was much easier to foresee.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, Zito was driving a fast car, his scheduled start for
Class A Visalia Oaks a fading speck in his rear-view mirror. The
southpaw was hurrying to Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where his mother
lay with a ravaged liver, fending off death.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta, a woman of smiles and substance, had been bedridden
since January. Her body began failing her in May, a month before
Barry helped lead USC deep into the playoffs and became Oakland's
top draft pick, No. 9 overall.
</P>
<P>
   The contract that Zito, 21, signed with the Athletics in June
contained an escape clause. He was free to leave the Oaks whenever
he wanted, to go to his mother's side. That left Zito torn between
love and honor. His mother is his best friend. Her health was all
he thought about when he wasn't pitching. And yet he also felt
beholden to teammates he hardly knew.
</P>
<P>
   In late June and again in early July, Zito received telephone
calls from his older sisters, Bonnie and Sally. You better come
home, they told him. And hurry.
</P>
<P>
   So Zito hopped in his car _ the first time on a day he was
scheduled to pitch _ and burned energy faster than gasoline
worrying about the impression he was leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
   Zito didn't want his new teammates to get the wrong idea. What
if they labeled him a prima donna? He was alone with that thought
during his drives to the hospital and his family's home in the L.A.
neighborhood of Encino.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to come to a team and leave it at will,'' Zito
said. ``Then your teammates might start to think you have more pull
than the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito's guilt would mutate, taking on new and grotesque shapes,
when he got to the hospital and saw his mother hooked up to all the
contraptions that were keeping her alive. Then the remorse that
washed over Zito would be along the lines of this: His mother was
going to die before he could find all the right words to tell her
how much she meant to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crossed my mind,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   Death cast a long shadow in the operating room that Roberta was
wheeled into on July 11. A compatible liver arrived by helicopter
at the hospital shortly before Barry did, barely in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other organ in her body had pretty much given up,'' said
Zito's surgeon, Dr. Walid S. Arnaout. ``It was like a ticking
bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arnaout nearly aborted the transplant because her body
seemed too far gone for the liver to do any good. In the time it
takes to blink, Dr. Arnaout made his Solomon-like decision. He
proceeded with the eight-hour surgery anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, Roberta was able to will herself to sit up. A
few days later she was shuffling along with the aid of a walker and
Wednesday she tried to take her first step. She is due to be
discharged from the hospital on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Her son spent two days with her between starts last week.
``She's looking more and more like the same old mom,'' Barry said.
``It's kind of reassuring for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctors visit her every morning and ask, ``How's our miracle
patient doing?'' They are smiling, but they aren't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta isn't sure how to reply. She had no idea how sick she
was until her family started filling in the blanks in her memory.
The truth? She'd feel fine if she could just get out of her
hospital frock and resume her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to see Barry pitch,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not just a proud mother talking. You'd have to be an
opponent not to enjoy seeing Zito outfinesse batters with his curve
and changeup. Like his mother, Barry is making confetti of all his
projected timetables.
</P>
<P>
   He has a 3-0 record in eight starts with Visalia. He has struck
out 62 batters in 401/3 innings while issuing 22 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Throw out his first outing _ 22/3 innings of hard labor at San
Jose on July 2 when his mother's health was weighing heavily on his
mind _ and opposing batters are hitting .140 against Zito.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got one of the best arms I've ever seen come through
Visalia,'' said Oaks general manager Andrew Bettencourt. ``He knows
how to set up batters, he has got good control. He knows how to
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettencourt said Zito is ``definitely on the fast track.'' Word
of his promotion to Class AA came Thursday night. He isn't expected
to get a big-league call-up this fall but should compete for a spot
in the Athletics' starting rotation in spring training next March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be preoccupied with (getting called up),''
Zito said. ``It's something that's out of my control.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Zito five minutes and he'll find all kinds of faults he has
to fix. In a six-inning outing at San Bernardino last week, for
example, he gave up no earned runs but thrice had to extricate
himself from two-on, no-out jams.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, he yielded two runs and a walk to San Jose in
the first inning before settling down.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of stuff can keep a perfectionist up at night.
</P>
<P>
   As for his 1.5 strikeouts-per-inning average, Zito advises
against reading too much into that. ``Here the hitters are really
aggressive,'' he said. ``They'll swing at some pitches that hitters
at the higher levels will lay off.''
</P>
<P>
   When Zito was drafted, his family laid off the bubbly, the
cigars and the high-fives. They couldn't bring themselves to
commemorate the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could we celebrate,'' Zito's father Joe said, ``when
Roberta was dying?''
</P>
<P>
   The Zitos were as down as you can get in the penthouse. In one
month their view has changed 180 degrees. The party they put off
planning, for fear it would turn into a wake, is on. And it
promises to be grand.

`NICE RACETRACK' FACES A NIP AND TUCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the folks in San Antonio heard that I was headed to the
``Star-Telegram'', the parting comments always contained something
like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a nice racetrack to cover up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Retama Park is a pit, though there is one in the
infield that they'll refill with water one of these days. It's
still a nice place to watch the races.
</P>
<P>
   More compliments can be made, but the bottom line used to judge
anyone's racing product is purses. And the money bags are three
times larger up here.
</P>
<P>
   But every time someone verbally knighted Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie, they did so without looking at the fine print. It has not
even been three weeks since Lone Star completed its thoroughbred
season, and the fine print has filled a couple of chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, you've got a nice racetrack up here. But what's going on
during this off-season could have an effect on how racing goes when
the thoroughbreds come back to Lone Star in April.
</P>
<P>
   When racing got started at Lone Star in 1997, it was like the
place was a new Arlington Park, an attractive facility offering
quality purses in some of racing's prime months. Well, Arlington
International Racecourse, which closed the year before Lone Star
opened, will be back next year near Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   They're talking about $300,000 a day in purses up there (Lone
Star offered about $220,000 this year). Though Lone Star general
manager Corey Johnsen says almost all the top trainers at Lone Star
will return next year, things are serious enough that the track
announced a 10 percent purse increase for 2000 before this year's
season was finished. That's the earliest a purse determination has
ever been trumpeted around Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear when Arlington will be racing. But a schedule
that would find Lone Star and Arlington overlapping for all but the
first three weeks of Lone Star's season isn't inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Louisiana Downs, and that situation's more unclear.
No one really has a true handle on how much purses can be bumped
with the installation of slot machines next year.
</P>
<P>
   Slots shot purses through the roof at Delaware Park and Prairie
Meadows. But Louisiana Downs had video poker machines for seven
years and purses moved mostly sideways.
</P>
<P>
   What's on the table right now, from Louisiana Downs or
Arlington, isn't enough to go ringing the fire bell.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, this off-season of change is turning out to be a nip
here and a tuck there. Maybe Arlington and Louisiana Downs might
nip at Lone Star's racing product, but other things could happen to
tuck some horses and trainers back into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The word that the Fair Grounds is bumping the purse for the
Louisiana Derby from $500,000 to $750,000 could ripple positively
toward Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   With such a purse _ only the Santa Anita Derby and Florida Derby
can match it among the Kentucky Derby preps _ a superstar likely
will win it and head somewhere other than Lone Star for a final
Derby prep. But more horses will be in New Orleans running in
allowance races and other stakes events. If they're unsuccessful in
their Louisiana Derby chase, they might be brought here.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not a bad thing if you remember the comments from
Chris Candies when he brought T.B. Track Star to the Lone Star
Derby after training him through the winter at Fair Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather come here with a good allowance horse from Fair
Grounds than a stakes horse from Oaklawn,'' Candies said.
</P>
<P>
   T.B. Track Star won the Lone Star Derby at odds surpassing 20-1.
He added to Lone Star's stakes program when he was kept here to
race.
</P>
<P>
   It's those sorts of stories that prompt people to say ``You've
got a nice racetrack to cover up there.''
SPOTLIGHT ON... D. WAYNE LUKAS
</P>
<P>
   When it was announced that D. Wayne Lukas would be inducted into
the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, it wouldn't have
surprised many in the horse racing world to hear Lukas respond
``about damn time.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lukas has been taking the high road, which ended with
his induction ceremony Monday in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Until this
year, Lukas disputed the eligibility requirements, which hold that
a trainer must have handled thoroughbreds for 25 consecutive years.
It's been documented that Lukas began training thoroughbreds more
than 30 years ago, but some years were broken up by his attention
to quarter horses.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lukas sometimes has referred to his critics in the media
as ``cockroaches,'' none of that was heard Monday. He was
introduced by six former or current assistants: Jeff Lukas, Randy
Bradshaw, Mark Hennig, Kiaran McLaughlan, Todd Pletcher and Dallas
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys have propped me up and carried me so many times, and
I'm not the easiest guy to work for,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of quarter horses, Lukas joined with prominent
thoroughbred owners Will Farish and Eddie Gaylord to spend $500,000
on a yearling quarter horse filly by First Down Dash out of
champion Corona Chick to top the sale at an auction in California
this week. On the same day, Lukas signed a sales ticket on behalf
of Satish Sanan to buy a thoroughbred filly by Capote at the
Saratoga summer sale.
QUICK HITS STRONACH'S BINGE CONTINUES
</P>
<P>
   Frank Stronach, a Canada-based auto parts magnate whose success
as a horse owner includes 1997 Belmont Stakes winner Touch Gold and
1998 Breeders' Cup Classic champion Awesome Again, apparently has
bought another racetrack or two. Several news sources indicate
Stronach has agreed to purchase Thistledown near Cleveland and
Remington Park in Oklahoma City from the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Stronach has purchased Santa Anita for more
than $120 million and Gulfstream Park for more than $80 million. No
purchase price has been reported on Thistledown and Remington.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Retama Park investors agreed to buy Thistledown,
Remington and Louisiana Downs from the DeBartolo family for about
$70 million, but the deal fell apart when the Retama investors
couldn't attract additional partners.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Downs is considered by many to be the most attractive
investment possibility of the DeBartolo family's generally
unattractive portfolio of racetracks. It has a minimal debt load
and is the only DeBartolo track with expanded gambling (video poker
and slots).
</P>
<P>
   So expect a Thistledown-Remington deal to extract less than $40
million of Stronach's loot.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach's seemingly bottomless barrel of money has been dipped
into by others in the past week. His publicly traded auto parts
company, from which his racetrack acquisitions are a spinoff, has
hit a 52-week trading low. And his former trainer, Patrick Byrne,
reached an out-of-court settlement to obtain more than $300,000 for
training and other fees. DATING IN ILLINOIS
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the three Chicagoland thoroughbred tracks have
until Sept. 21 to come to an agreement over race dates for next
year. If the overlapping dates can't be resolved by that time, the
Illinois Racing Board will mediate.
</P>
<P>
   Sportsman's Park has applied for a spring season (March 1
through May 13) that would conflict with Arlington (May 1 through
Oct. 31). And Hawthorne (Sept. 9 through Dec. 23) would conflict
with Arlington. Sportsman's also has applied for a fall meeting
(Nov. 2 through Dec. 31). nn

MENTAL-HEALTH EXPERTS CAUTION AGAINST SAYING SYSTEM FAILED FURROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Family friends and advocates for the mentally ill on
Thursday questioned whether Buford O. Furrow Jr. got the treatment
he needed from Washington state's mental-health system.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Merrill, a friend and neighbor of the Furrows in Olympia
for 24 years, said Furrow's father is angry that his son didn't get
closer supervision from mental health professionals after his
release from prison in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are disappointed that (the system) didn't give him more
help,'' Merrill said. ``If a person doesn't want to take their
medicine, they won't. That is what his dad thinks, that he didn't
take his medication, and he sort of went off.''
</P>
<P>
   But because Furrow's mental-health records remain confidential
under state law, it's not clear that there is more that authorities
could have reasonably been expected to do to prevent Furrow from
allegedly launching his hateful attack on a Los Angeles-area Jewish
day care center Tuesday. Furrow has also been charged in the
killing of a postal worker after the day-care shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week before the attack, Furrow made his regularly
scheduled appointment in Olympia with his community corrections
officer, who concluded Furrow was meeting all the conditions of
release. Officer Pat Gosney concluded that Furrow had been staying
away from alcohol, guns, and the psychiatric workers he had
attacked nine months before, and was consistently taking his
medications. Random drug testing ordered by Gosney had confirmed
those prescription drugs were in his system in July, Department of
Corrections spokesman Veltry Johnson said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that corrections staff did not search Furrow's home
or car for guns or alcohol, as they can legally do.
</P>
<P>
   Critics Thursday charged that given Furrow's mental-health
history, the court also should have ordered intensive mental-health
treatment after his release. The King County Superior Court judge
who handled his case, Harriet Cody, did not order such treatment.
She could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty clear that he came out of the King County
Jail and fell through the cracks,'' said Tom Richardson, Washington
president of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. ``Mentally
ill people on medications need supervision. There is an ignorance
on the part of the court in thinking that you can just require
someone to take their medication and that is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But mental-health professionals Thursday cautioned the public
from jumping to the conclusion that Furrow, a card-carrying member
of the Aryan Nations Church, allegedly sprayed the day-care center
with gunfire because of mental illness. Without having seen his
mental health records, they said it's dangerous to surmise his
violence was a result of his lack of treatment, or could have been
prevented if he had been confined for longer in a psychiatric
hospital, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not appropriate for everyone who demonstrates dangerous
behavior to be in a hospital,'' said psychiatrist Ira Klein,
director of civil adult services at Western State Hospital.
``Thousands of people commit violent crimes, and they aren't
schizophrenics.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that psychiatric hospitals can only treat people for
major mental illnesses, and not hold them because they are racist
or express a desire to do violence against certain groups.
</P>
<P>
   Because of patient confidentiality rules, state authorities
cannot release the files they compiled during the seven months
Furrow spent in two state psychiatric facilities and in a county
jail with a staff of psychologists and psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's only run-in with police in Washington stemmed from his
attempt to check himself into a Kirkland psychiatric facility last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow told psychiatric workers then that he had been
fantasizing about opening fire at the Alderwood Mall and killing
his estranged wife and her friends. But his plea for help turned
violent when he pulled a knife on psychiatric workers who refused
to give him back his car keys. He only dropped the switchblade when
a county sheriff's deputy pulled his gun.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest on a Wednesday, the county jail's
well-respected psychiatric unit quickly spotted Furrow as someone
in need of a thorough evaluation. A jail psychologist pushed
deputies to file charges quickly so he could be held for that
evaluation. Deputies did move fast, closing the case on Friday, but
Furrow managed to post bond before prosecutors filed the charges
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he and his parents recognized he needed help, and they
took him to Harborview Medical Center for an evaluation, according
to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after he was charged with second-degree assault, he was
taken to Western State Hospital in Steilacoom for further
evaluation and treatment, Dan Donohoe, spokesman for the King
County Prosecutor's Office, confirmed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But Furrow was not sent to Western State for an evaluation of
whether he was competent to stand trial, Klein said, and therefore
he was not judged to be insane at the time he assaulted the
psychiatric workers in Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one other reason the hospital could have taken him
for treatment: He had been committed because he was deemed a danger
to himself or the community.
</P>
<P>
   Klein could not legally comment on what treatment Furrow
received. But he said the hospital's goal is to evaluate patients,
stabilize them, and then return them to the community supported
with ongoing treatment and medication.
</P>
<P>
   One Dec. 11, Furrow was sent from Western State back to the
county jail.
</P>
<P>
   Klein cautioned that a decision that a patient is stable enough
to be returned to the security of the jail, where their treatment
and medication can be supervised by psychiatric professionals, is
not the same as deciding the person is ready to be released into
the community.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, Furrow was arraigned on the assault charges.
Initially, Furrow's defense attorney, Leona Thomas, entered a
not-guilty plea by reason of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Thomas' request for more expert evaluation of
Furrow was granted. But the portion of his file containing his
mental health record has been sealed by the court. Later, Furrow
withdrew the insanity plea and entered a guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   Both Klein and Sherry Storms, the Mental Health Ombudsman for
the county, said mentally ill people often decide to plead guilty
to criminal charges because they realize that their stay in a
psychiatric facility would keep them confined even longer. But
neither had specific knowledge of why Furrow changed his plea.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow was released from jail on May 21, and met with his
probation officer in Olympia on June 16, July 6, July 20 and Aug.
3.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's parents last saw their son on Saturday. Furrow's
mother, Monnie, is ill, and broke down upon hearing the news of
Furrow's arrest, Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what bothers his dad the most was that he shot all
those little kids. He loves little kids.''
</P>
<P>

Porterfield contributed to this report.

INTERNET IS PROTECTED TERRITORY FOR WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Like Coca-Cola, Sony Pictures and Microsoft, Alex
Curtis knows the power of marketing on the World Wide Web. The
23-year-old's tips to aspiring Webmasters read like a how-to on
reaching out and grabbing Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get (a Web site) up, be sure to put out useful
information and not just `I'm white and proud,' and a few links,''
Curtis writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us your ideas on strategy and what we need to get done.
Only concrete ideas. ... Go for the throat _ this is the freest
expression you'll ever have. If you don't like the fact that Jews
exist, go ahead and say so.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis is a committed white supremacist. The San Diego State
University history major is also the editor of the Nationalist
Observer, a magazine advocating racial purity.
</P>
<P>
   To the chagrin of some, the Internet remains protected ground.
Even the writings of extremist hate groups spewing hatred of blacks
and Jews is protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the FBI cannot target groups for investigation based on
their beliefs, at least not overtly. This restraint rests on the
belief that the government should respect free speech and not crack
down on groups or individuals who espouse unpopular ideas, unless
there is some criminal activity involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites of hate groups are not monitored unless there is
compelling evidence the group is plotting an act of domestic
terrorism, said FBI spokesman Tron Brekke.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every group that has a Web site, there is not a
corresponding FBI file. Talking about violence is a whole lot
different than actually taking the steps to do the violence. ...
There has to be some criminality or potential criminality
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Ward of the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious
Harassment, said, ``Many people now feel frustrated, because law
enforcement is effectively restricted from monitoring these groups.
But the cost of that would be our civil liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors fringe groups,
estimated earlier this year that there were 254 active
``extremist'' sites, up from 163 a year before. It is hard to get a
handle on how many sites there are, since they are shut down or
move with such great frequency.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI does work in tandem with non-profit agencies such as the
Southern Poverty Law Center. ``Law enforcement agencies come to us
every day with questions about particular groups,'' said Mark
Potok, a spokesman for the center. ``I think the current division
of labor is a good one, in which the government has police powers
but is precluded from investigating groups merely because they have
unpleasant views.''
</P>
<P>
   As the tug-of-war over civil liberties and freedom of speech
plays itself out, the opportunities of the Internet grows
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this medium, it's an opportunity for companies or
organizations or individuals to share lots of information at a
relatively inexpensive price,'' said Doug Levy, president of
Dallas-based Internet Marketing &AMP; Creative Concepts, which designs
Web sites for such clients as the Campbell Soup Co. and ABC's
``Monday Night Football.'' ``It's like having their own channel to
put whatever they want to tell the consumer about out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology of the Web _ which allows music, moving pictures
and chat as well as text _ creates a more powerful marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be everything,'' said Richard Yalch, a professor of
marketing at the University of Washington in Seatte. ``Look at
garden.com as an example of this. Gardening is a hobby. You can buy
products at the site. You can talk about it at the site in a chat
room. Everything that exists in the real world exists in
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   One white supremacist site has files to download, message
boards, links to other supremacist sites and a collection of racist
cartoons. But it also has a page for Aryan singles to meet each
other _ for ``heterosexual, white gentiles only.''

WE HAVE BEGUN TO EXPECT THE HATE CRIMINAL TO BE FROM THE WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JESS WALTER  
 SPECIAL TO THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The satellite news trucks have finished dusting up the gravel
ribbon that leads to Buford Furrow's old house.
</P>
<P>
   Notebooks are full of stories of Furrow's gun-nut racism and
cameras with tight shots of the ``Keep Out'' signs marking his
ex-wife's driveway. After some debate, reporters have decided
against calling her mobile home and outbuildings a ``compound.''
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous live shot _ ``it was here that the suspect in
yesterday's shooting may have developed his racist beliefs'' _ was
done four miles away, in Metaline Falls, Wash., which presented
itself rustic and postcard-pretty, home to 260 people who get along
just fine in this rivercut seam of Colville National Forest and
Selkirk Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   On TV and in person, these people come across as disquietingly
familiar. Friendly and easy-going. When they say Furrow kept to
himself, it is a fair compliment. Some of them have no trouble
describing Furrow's former wife, Debbie Mathews, in one breath as
``a great lady, a wonderful mother'' and with the very next saying
that she believes that Jews are the spawn of Satan.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to be surprised anymore at this paradoxical tolerance
of the intolerant.
</P>
<P>
   And the worst part is: This all feels routine. We have begun to
expect the hate criminal to be from the West.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 years of bombings and murders and bank robberies and
cross burnings and racial pamphleteering, the details have begun to
blur into a single story of the West as a place where hatred
blooms.
</P>
<P>
   The places blur too, towns so striking it makes you ache a
little bit, built along cold-running streams and deep mountain
lakes. Even the people start to blur, their honest and admirable
defense of their towns as good places seeming less and less
believable.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the grocery store in Metaline Falls, where a CNN crew
groused about the lack of cell phone service, two local women made
eye contact and shared a sad, knowing smile, recalling the first
time a white supremacist was traced back to this town, back in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said one woman, ``here we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   She might as well be speaking for the entire Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again puzzling over this region's reputation as a
haven for neo-Nazis, white separatists, Phineas Priests, Identity
Christians, skinheads and the just plain government-weary. Here we
go again looking for explanations that sound too much like excuses
_ the accident of open space, our ethnic homogeny, too much John
Wayne. Here we go again trying to understand how someone like
Buford O. ``Neal'' Furrow could believe he was called to shoot
Jewish children.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again looking for reasons in the unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Start with space. There are great open chunks of it in the
Northwest, from Southern Oregon to Eastern Washington to Northern
Idaho to Western Montana, places on the map where you can put your
finger and barely cover a town.
</P>
<P>
   People drawn to white supremacy are usually running from society
and feel disenfranchised. They are people who, ironically, seek
refuge in the small-town values of the West.
</P>
<P>
   The religion of the Aryan Nations and other groups is called
Christian Identity and is a mishmash of paranoia, solipsism and
Old-Testament fervor whose theology can be boiled down to the
belief that white American Anglo-Saxons are the true Israelites and
that Jews are descendants of Cain, the result of Satan's seduction
of Eve.
</P>
<P>
   It is a religion of hate, certainly, but also of uncompromising
fear. Christian Identity followers believe we are in a time of
approaching Apocalypse as described in the book of Revelation, and
that it will be manifested as a great racial holy war in which they
will have to defend their families from marauding hordes of
non-Israelites. That's why many followers of Christian Identity
seek mountain retreats in the woods, looking for ``defensible''
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the myth of the West itself, which says that the
taming of the wilderness is that thing which is uniquely American,
what the dean of Western writers Wallace Stegner called ``the
challenge against which our character as a people was formed.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeals heavily to people who see America as a holy land
defending its borders against other races, a place where the
dominant cultural tool is the gun. Gun ownership is practically a
sacrament of Christian Identity churches, survivalism the dominant
way of life.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying reason for the flourishing of hate groups in
the Northwest may lie with one man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, a Lockheed engineer and budding white supremacist named
Richard Butler left California for a ``defensible'' 20-acre parcel
of land near Hayden Lake, just north of Coeur d'Alene. He began
touting the Inland Northwest as a white homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's Aryan Nations Church would end up becoming the premier
hate group in the country and a sort of petri dish for neo-Nazis
and others to grow into virulent criminals. Many of the hate crimes
in or originating in the Northwest can be traced to Butler,
spiraling out from him like a string of Old Testament begats.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with The Order, a group of Aryan Nations followers who
formed their own terrorist group in 1984 and killed Jewish radio
talk-show host Alan Berg and pulled a series of bank robberies
meant to fund a larger race war.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, countless groups and individuals have spun off from
Aryan Nations and used The Order as a template for committing
crimes, from murder to robbery to bombings to the most recent _
Furrow's shooting spree this week at a Jewish community center in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, Furrow worked as a security guard at
Butler's compound and was married by Butler to Debbie Mathews, the
widow of Robert Mathews, the founder of The Order who was killed in
a shootout with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents and those tracking hate groups say the
82-year-old Butler is no longer a key figure among the radical
right, but his legacy remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   When, in 1991, an up-and-coming Christian Identity preacher
named David Barley looked to move his America's Promise Ministries
out of Arizona, his group ended up looking in Idaho and Montana,
and ultimately located in Sandpoint, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first impression was good,'' Barley wrote to his followers
when he found his new home in Idaho in 1991, ``and once we looked
around the area (we) saw many positive aspects ... including very
friendly and mostly non-Babylonian government hungry people.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a man called Barley's protege, Jay Merrill, led a
group of three men who bombed an abortion clinic and a newspaper
office and robbed banks in Spokane. There are people like that
everywhere, of course. The Southern Poverty Law Center recently
listed eight active hate groups in Idaho, 10 in Washington, 35 in
California, 48 in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But that's little consolation to the people in Metaline Falls or
to anyone in the West, who must defend their home as a tolerant
place to live and who will hold their collective breath every time
a loner ventures out to commit a crime based on hate.
</P>
<P>
   Jess Walter is the author of ``Every Knee Shall Bow,'' a 1995
book about the case of white separatist Randy Weaver. A free-lance
writer and journalist in Spokane, he also is the co-author of ``In
Contempt,'' Christopher Darden's account of the O.J. Simpson murder
trial.

SHOOTING VICTIMS' RECOVERY PROGRESSING

   LOS ANGELES _ Two days after a gunman's bullets tore into Mindy
Finkelstein's leg, the 16-year-old left the hospital, raising her
arms triumphantly to show the world she was healing from the
hate-fueled attack.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting back tears, Mindy's father read a statement expressing
his gratitude for the community's support following Tuesday's
shooting rampage at the North Hills Jewish Community Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled that Mindy's recovery is going well and that
we can now go home as a family,'' said David Finkelstein, standing
beside his daughter at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prayers and thoughts are with the victims _ the other
victims and their families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old James Zidell also was released from the hospital
Thursday, and he spent the day with his wounded leg propped up on a
pillow while he sucked lollipops and played with Beanie Babies,
gifts from police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing really, really good. He's fine and happy,'' his
mother said. ``It'll take a while to heal. He'll have to get on
crutches.''
</P>
<P>
   She figures her son will be healed in a couple weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to move on and just act normal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other children _ 5-year-old Benjamin Kadish and 6-year-old
Joshua Stepakoff _ remained hospitalized Thursday, although Joshua
was expected to be discharged Friday. Kadish was the most seriously
injured and remains in critical but stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   North Valley Jewish Community Center receptionist Isabelle
Shalometh, 68, was released from a local hospital Tuesday night
with wounds to her back and arm.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the San Fernando Valley, encouragement for the
victims poured in Thursday, as police officers delivered flowers
and gigantic get-well cards from the LAPD's Devonshire Division,
which responded to Tuesday's attack in Granada Hills. A company was
going to give the Jewish day-care school with 250 kids teddy bear
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the three children and two staff members shot at the
community center, Benjamin Kadish's wounds were the worst and his
recovery will take the longest. He was struck in the stomach and
leg, and he remains at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and his vital
signs remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors said they missed the youngster's vibrance and
recalled his smile and love for his puppy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kadish's children play catch with their dad,'' recalled
neighbor Erin Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of Benjamin banded together to collect money to help
his family with medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very nice. My next door neighbor called me
(Wednesday) night to get the neighborhood together to help the
family,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors are going door-to-door asking for money donations for
the boy and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole neighborhood is concerned,'' said Sherlene Bamossy,
a next-door neighbor to the Kadish family. ``It's a terrible shock.
I can hardly believe it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Gladis Murray, said knowing one of the victims
brings the horror painfully close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we thought it was close to home in Granada Hills,
and now, we find out that it's our neighbor. It's real, real close.
We're still in shock,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 6-year-old boy who was shot, Joshua Stepakoff, was
expected to be released from the hospital Friday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Porter Ranch youngster was wounded in his left calf and hip,
and he was listed in good condition after the bullet to his hip was
removed at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, said Steve Rutledge,
hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's neighbors, Keith and Yolanda Douglas, said the boy's
parents have been coming home at 11 p.m. and leave first thing in
the morning to see their son at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stepakoffs are a very warm and loving family,'' Keith
Douglas said, adding the boy's father works for the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and the mother is in the health-care field.
</P>
<P>
   The Douglases left a ``Welcome Home Josh'' note and a teddy bear
on the Stepakoff's front door.
</P>
<P>
   They described Joshua as a very bright, inquisitive, friendly,
sensitive child who is always riding his bicycle, playing catch or
in-line skating with his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them are very close,'' Keith Douglas said. ``It's hard
to imagine two parents who are more concerned with the best
interests of their children in trying to protect them. If something
like this could happen, especially to them, it's sad and
mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Finkelstein, a day camp counselor and Chatsworth High School
senior, left Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills Medical Center in a
wheelchair, unable to walk because of gunshot wounds to her right
leg.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother said Mindy was mainly concerned about the other
children who were hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's doing OK, and she's worried about the kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Finkelstein said that his family's prayers and thoughts
were with the families of the other victims and thanked the
authorities for their ``quick response'' and ``incredible medical
care.''
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed thanks for the ``tremendous outpouring of love
and support'' from friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokesperson said Mindy is expected to make a full
recovery within a couple of weeks, and had already begun physical
therapy earlier Thursday.

CLASH CURB REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The first MLS Kraft Derby revived the
playoff hopes of the San Jose Clash but went far in dampening the
Revolution's chances. The Clash took a 2-1 victory over the
Revolution Thursday &UR;  &LR; night in a battle of teams owned by Kraft
Sports Group.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Revolution's fifth consecutive defeat, leaving them
in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with 18 points in 21
games. It was particularly discouraging since the Clash had only
two previous regulation-time victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution started aggressively and imposed their pressing
tactics on the Clash. Mike Burns and Ted Chronopoulos advanced from
the back to create offensive opportunities, and Paul Keegan
injected spirit into the attack from midfield.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clash remained composed and the Revolution seemed to
lose faith in the second half. Keegan departed with a right knee
ligament injury late in the first half and Ivan McKinley left with
a hamstring injury early in the second half. And the Revolution
struggled to maintain their edge.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Clash only tied the score on a corner kick, which was
saved by goalkeeper Jeff Causey, replacing Walter Zenga (knee),
before being kicked into the net by Causey in the eighth minute of
the second half. The Revolution continued to press forward, but
they seemed more desperate than the Clash.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Wright brought composure to the Clash defense, parrying
crosses and calmly playing the ball out of the back.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution felt compelled to attack at full speed,
becoming predictable and causing their own downfall by failing to
compensate when defenders went forward.
</P>
<P>
   Former US national team midfielder Dario Brose scored the
deciding goal on a swift counterattack in the 77th minute.
Revolution defender Mario Gori, who played the second half with a
broken left hand, had advanced into the offensive end, and the
Revolution failed to compensate as Eddie Lewis and Scott Bower
played the ball forward through the center of the field to Brose,
who ran in alone on Causey and slotted a shot into the right side
of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have been working at 200 percent, now I'll have to work
at 300 percent,'' Zenga said. ``We have to find a solution
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution were discouraged after the match, but can revive
their chances with games against Tampa Bay Wednesday, at San Jose
Aug. 21, and at the MetroStars Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seemed to lose faith in ourselves in the second half,''
Keegan said. ``After they tied the score, it was the old attitude
of here we go again. In the first half we played together as a
team, but it didn't seem like that in the second half. Now we have
to just stay together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronopoulos scored in the sixth minute, the residue of the
Revolution's pressing tactics. Mike Burns intercepted a clearance
and Keegan took a defender to the end line and crossed just over
Chronopoulos. McKinley recovered possession, crossed again, and
this time Chronopoulos glanced a header past goalkeeper Joe Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   John Harkes and Joe-Max Moore had close calls on free kicks in
the first half. Causey was lured out of position often in the first
half, but San Jose could not take advantage. And after the tying
goal, the Revolution visibly faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, there was a change in attitude in our
guys,'' Clash coach Brian Quinn said. ``We started winning the
50-50 balls. The players decided they wanted to play for themselves
and for pride.''

DAVENPORT CRUISES BY HUBER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Commuting from Newport Beach to
Manhattan Country Club, Lindsay Davenport spent more time on the
405 freeway Thursday than in her match.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't mind the lengthy commute as she welcomed herself back
in style to Southern California, its colossal freeway system and
cellular-phone-wielding tennis crowd. Davenport beat Anke Huber
6-2, 6-2 in 58 minutes in the second round of the Acura Classic in
Manhattan Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The smooth victory was exactly what the Acura Classic's
defending champ and top seed needed. This is her third California
tournament in three weeks. She became so fatigued from her tennis
schedule that she requested to start the tournament Thursday, and
tournament officials complied. So after getting a bye as one of the
top four seeds, her victory completed the tournament's second
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win this easily, to have an easy match for my first match
really helped me,'' Davenport said. ``I wanted to serve well, hit a
lot of first serves in and not allow her to get on the offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's game plan worked. Huber, whose serve was shaky
throughout the match, never had a chance. The 24-year-old German
broke Davenport once to pull to 2-2 in the first set. Davenport
then won the next eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport hasn't just been busy on the court. Earlier this week,
she moved from ``Newport Beach to Newport Beach, about two miles.''
Her new house is full of boxes and she's spent any spare time
visiting friends and family in her old neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Move'' is the operative word with Davenport. The 6-foot-2{,
175-pound, 23-year-old has improved her quickness and speed, but
her footwork still is the weakest part of her game.
</P>
<P>
   Huber and Davenport are power players. Since Davenport is one of
the most powerful and steady players on the WTA Tour, Huber's game
played into Davenport's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to try to stay aggressive,'' Huber said. ``There is
nothing more I can do. You have to serve well and return well.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where Huber's strategy is befuddling. Huber, who is 1-9
against Davenport, didn't have the finesse needed to keep Davenport
off balance. Huber did try a few drop shots but not nearly enough
to any damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a pretty good record against Anke Huber and Mary
Pierce,'' Davenport said. ``I don't know why I like the challenge
of hitting against someone like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, fighting Davenport with power, as Huber and Pierce do,
usually is counterproductive. A quick and crafty player, such as
top-ranked Martina Hingis, has a better chance. The two could be
heading to a rematch of last year's Acura Classic final, won by
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Although she lost to Venus Williams in the semifinals of a WTA
stop in Carlsbad last week, Davenport hasn't been disappointed in
her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great summer, and so far I haven't felt any
pressure,'' she said. ``Winning Wimbledon really helped take away
the pressure.''

SEGMENT OF PIPELINE CLOSED AFTER BLAST MAY STAY CLOSED FOR MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLINGHAM, Wash. _ The northern section of fuel pipeline that
ruptured in June and killed three people may remain closed for
months and even into next year, federal regulators indicated
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The line closed after the June 10 accident. Then the federal
Office of Pipeline Safety ordered the Olympic Pipe Line Co. to keep
the 37 miles of pipeline from Cherry Point to northern Skagit
County closed pending the results of tests and implementation of
safety improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators strengthened their control of Olympic earlier this
week, imposing new inspection requirements on the Renton-based
company and ordering it to report any significant changes planned
for the pipeline. The pipeline sections from northern Skagit County
to Portland continue to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Coyner, who heads the Office of Pipeline Safety, told
reporters Thursday that much more needs to be known before Olympic
can open that northern section.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to allow it to reopen without the facts,'' she
said. ``We're not going to open that line before we are comfortable
the line is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators must analyze data from internal inspections of
Olympic's pipeline in 1996 and 1997, she said. Those inspections,
done by a device known as a smart pig, showed more than 250
anomalies, though the company considered most insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic spokeswoman Maggie Brown said the company has provided
inspection data. But she said the company is still working out the
parameters of what Coyner indicated is vital information: a surge
analysis, which will focus on pressure in the line.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, a valve in Skagit County intended to relieve excess
pressure apparently malfunctioned, increasing pressure up the line
to the spot of the rupture in the Whatcom Creek watershed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing data, Olympic had weeks of digging
ahead of it. This week, federal regulators ordered Olympic to dig
up and inspect any section of pipeline from Whatcom County to
Renton that may show signs from previous internal inspections of
outside damage.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility under investigation in the June 10 accident is
that construction work for Bellingham water lines may have damaged
the fuel pipeline several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That order means Olympic faces ``a dig a day,'' said Chris
Hoidal, who directs the Western region of the Office of Pipeline
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the dig-and-inspect order applies only to Olympic's
16-inch line from Whatcom County to Renton. The company also has a
parallel 20-inch line that runs from Skagit County to Renton, a
main line that continues after Renton to Portland and several
lateral lines, including one through the Rainier Valley and Beacon
Hill in Seattle, another to Sea-Tac Airport and a third to
refineries in Anacortes.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what is found on the 16-inch line, the order could
be expanded to other sections of the pipeline, Hoidal said.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators' decision to let the pipeline reopen may also
hinge on the investigation by the National Transportation Safety
Board. That investigation may not be complete until next year,
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, NTSB chairman, said the fact-gathering part of the
investigation may be done in January. Then there may be
congressional hearings on the Bellingham accident, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   After its factual report is done, the NTSB will turn to
analyzing what it has found and conclude what caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB likely will issue recommendations to the industry and
regulators to prevent similar accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB is:
</P>
<P>
   _Working on pressure tests to try to determine what the pressure
in the line at the point and time of rupture was.
</P>
<P>
   _Preparing to scrutinize data obtained from Olympic's computers.
</P>
<P>
   _Setting up the procedures to test the damaged section of pipe
and the surge relief valve in Skagit County that may have
malfunctioned and increased pressure upstream.
</P>
<P>
   _Trying to arrange interviews with contractors who worked on the
water pipes near the Olympic line.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the investigation is still in the ``Joe Friday
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you've got to do is get the facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Coyner were in Bellingham on Thursday to tour the site
of the pipeline accident and meet with city officials. Each also
spent more than a hour meeting with the families of the three
people killed: two 10-year-old boys and an 18-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   David Beninger, a lawyer for the parents of the 10-year-olds,
said the families found the meetings reassuring.

FREED MISSIONARY SPEAKS FOR FIRST TIME ON ORDEAL IN SOUTHERN
RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a marathon against death, but God was on his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many times I felt like I was just on the absolute edge
of life and death,'' said Herb Gregg, 52, a Mesa missionary held
hostage in southern Russia for nearly eight months. ``I desperately
wanted to be pulled back from that edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg, who described his ordeal for the first time publicly
Thursday night, said he took solace in prayer and the Scripture he
has memorized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremiah 33:3 says, `Call on me and I will answer thee and
show you great and mighty things which thou knoweth not,' '' Gregg
said. ``It's actually a challenge by God to pray and ask for great
things. So I did. I asked for my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked God for four other things: That his hand would not be
cut off; that he would not be sent to a death camp; that the ransom
would be paid; and that he would be released.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg spent 230 days in a dim, 6- by 9-foot room in the barracks
of Chechen rebels seeking money for weapons to use against Moscow's
troops. He had only the clothes he was wearing, little to eat, a
thin mat to sleep on and rare human contact.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg was released June 29 after Russian Interior Ministry
troops freed him. He still doesn't know all the details of his
release, only that his captors were still discussing whether he
should live or die on the day of his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main reason I'm alive is that God just pulled me
right out of there,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife were reunited and spent some time in Europe so
Herb could rest and they could reconnect. He quietly returned to
Arizona in early July to be reunited with his two children, Jason
Gregg and Amy Glover, who is expecting twins.
</P>
<P>
   He's free of nightmares, he said, but will need time to regain
his strength. He's put back on 30 of the 40 pounds he lost but
still appears thin and tired. His finger, severed as part of a
ransom demand, is healing nicely and no longer is bandaged. He can
walk but wears down after 20 minutes or so.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Linda, have been missionaries in Brazil,
Portugal and then Russia for more than 20 years. They expect to
return to missionary work in the future, but Herb Gregg said he
isn't sure about returning to Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's appearance at Scottsdale Bible Church was Gregg's
first in public since his release, when he spoke briefly with
reporters and said to tell his captors ``that God really loves
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' two goals in capturing him were to convert him to
their extremist form of Islam and to obtain money for weapons,
Gregg said. They had selected him as a target for teaching because
he taught Christianity in an Islamic city, he said. They watched
his comings and goings and knew he would be leaving the orphanage
after a basketball practice that Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   When he would not convert, the kicking began and the talk of
cutting off his hand. At one point, he laid his hand on the towel,
fully expecting it to be cut off, but his captors changed their
minds at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   His captors would ask him why he didn't pray, bowing down five
times a day like they did. He said he did pray. They would tell him
that God is one. He would reply that God is love. He has forgiven
his captors, he said, and prays for them and their salvation.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he tape-recorded a ransom plea for $3 million, and
on April 12, the kidnappers videotaped him as they cut off part of
a right finger and repeated their demand.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Gregg spoke briefly Thursday of the prayers of hundreds of
thousands of people around the world who supported her. She got
letters of encouragement from people in countries she didn't know
existed and shared a story of one small girl who prayed every day
that the ``bad men would let Herb go.'' When the girl's father told
her of the release, the girl said, ``It was because I prayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greggs are missionaries with The Evangelical Alliance
Mission, or TEAM, based in Wheaton, Ill. The organization's 1,000
missionaries work in 40 regions of the world. The Greggs taught
English at the university in Makhachkala, the crime-plagued capital
of the republic of Dagestan, coached youth sports and visited
orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   Church of the Redeemer in Mesa and Scottsdale Bible Church are
among the churches that have sponsored their missionary work. &QL;

WILLIAMS ENDS SKID, READY FOR PETE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ The losing streak wasn't compatible to
one of the woeful Clippers terrible skids. But Serena Williams
clipped a losing streak, even though she didn't know of its
existence.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in five attempts, Williams beat Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario. Williams controlled the match, winning 6-2, 6-3
Thursday night in the quarterfinals of the Acura Classic at
Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 Williams comically tried to deny she was on a four-match
losing streak to No. 4 Sanchez-Vicario. One loss she said was due
to ``young age.'' Another was because she pulled out with an
injury. Eventually, she conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know,'' Williams said. ``I didn't know I was down
4-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams set the tone early, breaking Sanchez-Vicario in the
Spaniard's first service game. Sanchez-Vicario briefly looked as if
she could turn the match around by breaking Williams' serve to open
the second set. But Williams responded with a break in the next
game and four games later in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams could face Martina Hingis, the No. 1 player in the
world, in the semifinals, but she's not concerned with who her
opponent will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I play Hingis or Pete (Sampras),'' she said.
``It really doesn't matter to me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Zvereva injures ankle: Natasha Zvereva strained her right
ankle and was forced to retire from her match. No. 7 Barbara Schett
had won the first set 6-2, but Zvereva led 4-2 in the second set
when she left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I won the match,'' Schett said. ``I wasn't very
satisfied with the way I played.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Martinez advances: Conchita Martinez advanced against Detroit
native Corina Morariu 7-5, 6-2. Morariu injured her right elbow
during the match. It was evaluated as a strain.
</P>
<P>
   __ The next best thing: Lisa Raymond put a scare into Hingis,
losing 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 Wednesday night. Raymond is playing in the
tournament with partner Rennae Stubbs. Raymond/Stubbs, seeded
third, is the only seeded doubles team left and is in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   __ Today's matches: 11 a.m. Larisa Neiland/Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario vs. Irina Spirlea/Caroline Vis, No. 3 Mary Pierce
vs. Julie Halard-Decugis, No. 7 Schett vs. No. 2 Hingis. 7 p.m. No.
1 Lindsay Davenport vs. Martinez, who is 7-2 against the Newport
Beach resident. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

SEGMENT OF PIPELINE CLOSED AFTER BLAST MAY STAY CLOSED FOR MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLINGHAM, Wash. _ The northern section of fuel pipeline that
ruptured in June and killed three people may remain closed for
months and even into next year, federal regulators indicated
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The line closed after the June 10 accident. Then the federal
Office of Pipeline Safety ordered the Olympic Pipe Line Co. to keep
the 37 miles of pipeline from Cherry Point to northern Skagit
County closed pending the results of tests and implementation of
safety improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators strengthened their control of Olympic earlier this
week, imposing new inspection requirements on the Renton-based
company and ordering it to report any significant changes planned
for the pipeline. The pipeline sections from northern Skagit County
to Portland continue to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Coyner, who heads the Office of Pipeline Safety, told
reporters Thursday that much more needs to be known before Olympic
can open that northern section.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to allow it to reopen without the facts,'' she
said. ``We're not going to open that line before we are comfortable
the line is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators must analyze data from internal inspections of
Olympic's pipeline in 1996 and 1997, she said. Those inspections,
done by a device known as a smart pig, showed more than 250
anomalies, though the company considered most insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic spokeswoman Maggie Brown said the company has provided
inspection data. But she said the company is still working out the
parameters of what Coyner indicated is vital information: a surge
analysis, which will focus on pressure in the line.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, a valve in Skagit County intended to relieve excess
pressure apparently malfunctioned, increasing pressure up the line
to the spot of the rupture in the Whatcom Creek watershed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing data, Olympic had weeks of digging
ahead of it. This week, federal regulators ordered Olympic to dig
up and inspect any section of pipeline from Whatcom County to
Renton that may show signs from previous internal inspections of
outside damage.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility under investigation in the June 10 accident is
that construction work for Bellingham water lines may have damaged
the fuel pipeline several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That order means Olympic faces ``a dig a day,'' said Chris
Hoidal, who directs the Western region of the Office of Pipeline
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the dig-and-inspect order applies only to Olympic's
16-inch line from Whatcom County to Renton. The company also has a
parallel 20-inch line that runs from Skagit County to Renton, a
main line that continues after Renton to Portland and several
lateral lines, including one through the Rainier Valley and Beacon
Hill in Seattle, another to Sea-Tac Airport and a third to
refineries in Anacortes.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what is found on the 16-inch line, the order could
be expanded to other sections of the pipeline, Hoidal said.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators' decision to let the pipeline reopen may also
hinge on the investigation by the National Transportation Safety
Board. That investigation may not be complete until next year,
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, NTSB chairman, said the fact-gathering part of the
investigation may be done in January. Then there may be
congressional hearings on the Bellingham accident, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   After its factual report is done, the NTSB will turn to
analyzing what it has found and conclude what caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB likely will issue recommendations to the industry and
regulators to prevent similar accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB is:
</P>
<P>
   _Working on pressure tests to try to determine what the pressure
in the line at the point and time of rupture was.
</P>
<P>
   _Preparing to scrutinize data obtained from Olympic's computers.
</P>
<P>
   _Setting up the procedures to test the damaged section of pipe
and the surge relief valve in Skagit County that may have
malfunctioned and increased pressure upstream.
</P>
<P>
   _Trying to arrange interviews with contractors who worked on the
water pipes near the Olympic line.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the investigation is still in the ``Joe Friday
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you've got to do is get the facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Coyner were in Bellingham on Thursday to tour the site
of the pipeline accident and meet with city officials. Each also
spent more than a hour meeting with the families of the three
people killed: two 10-year-old boys and an 18-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   David Beninger, a lawyer for the parents of the 10-year-olds,
said the families found the meetings reassuring.

WE HAVE BEGUN TO EXPECT THE HATE CRIMINAL TO BE FROM THE WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JESS WALTER  
 SPECIAL TO THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The satellite news trucks have finished dusting up the gravel
ribbon that leads to Buford Furrow's old house.
</P>
<P>
   Notebooks are full of stories of Furrow's gun-nut racism and
cameras with tight shots of the ``Keep Out'' signs marking his
ex-wife's driveway. After some debate, reporters have decided
against calling her mobile home and outbuildings a ``compound.''
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous live shot _ ``it was here that the suspect in
yesterday's shooting may have developed his racist beliefs'' _ was
done four miles away, in Metaline Falls, Wash., which presented
itself rustic and postcard-pretty, home to 260 people who get along
just fine in this rivercut seam of Colville National Forest and
Selkirk Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   On TV and in person, these people come across as disquietingly
familiar. Friendly and easy-going. When they say Furrow kept to
himself, it is a fair compliment. Some of them have no trouble
describing Furrow's former wife, Debbie Mathews, in one breath as
``a great lady, a wonderful mother'' and with the very next saying
that she believes that Jews are the spawn of Satan.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to be surprised anymore at this paradoxical tolerance
of the intolerant.
</P>
<P>
   And the worst part is: This all feels routine. We have begun to
expect the hate criminal to be from the West.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 years of bombings and murders and bank robberies and
cross burnings and racial pamphleteering, the details have begun to
blur into a single story of the West as a place where hatred
blooms.
</P>
<P>
   The places blur too, towns so striking it makes you ache a
little bit, built along cold-running streams and deep mountain
lakes. Even the people start to blur, their honest and admirable
defense of their towns as good places seeming less and less
believable.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the grocery store in Metaline Falls, where a CNN crew
groused about the lack of cell phone service, two local women made
eye contact and shared a sad, knowing smile, recalling the first
time a white supremacist was traced back to this town, back in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said one woman, ``here we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   She might as well be speaking for the entire Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again puzzling over this region's reputation as a
haven for neo-Nazis, white separatists, Phineas Priests, Identity
Christians, skinheads and the just plain government-weary. Here we
go again looking for explanations that sound too much like excuses
_ the accident of open space, our ethnic homogeny, too much John
Wayne. Here we go again trying to understand how someone like
Buford O. ``Neal'' Furrow could believe he was called to shoot
Jewish children.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again looking for reasons in the unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Start with space. There are great open chunks of it in the
Northwest, from Southern Oregon to Eastern Washington to Northern
Idaho to Western Montana, places on the map where you can put your
finger and barely cover a town.
</P>
<P>
   People drawn to white supremacy are usually running from society
and feel disenfranchised. They are people who, ironically, seek
refuge in the small-town values of the West.
</P>
<P>
   The religion of the Aryan Nations and other groups is called
Christian Identity and is a mishmash of paranoia, solipsism and
Old-Testament fervor whose theology can be boiled down to the
belief that white American Anglo-Saxons are the true Israelites and
that Jews are descendants of Cain, the result of Satan's seduction
of Eve.
</P>
<P>
   It is a religion of hate, certainly, but also of uncompromising
fear. Christian Identity followers believe we are in a time of
approaching Apocalypse as described in the book of Revelation, and
that it will be manifested as a great racial holy war in which they
will have to defend their families from marauding hordes of
non-Israelites. That's why many followers of Christian Identity
seek mountain retreats in the woods, looking for ``defensible''
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the myth of the West itself, which says that the
taming of the wilderness is that thing which is uniquely American,
what the dean of Western writers Wallace Stegner called ``the
challenge against which our character as a people was formed.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeals heavily to people who see America as a holy land
defending its borders against other races, a place where the
dominant cultural tool is the gun. Gun ownership is practically a
sacrament of Christian Identity churches, survivalism the dominant
way of life.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying reason for the flourishing of hate groups in
the Northwest may lie with one man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, a Lockheed engineer and budding white supremacist named
Richard Butler left California for a ``defensible'' 20-acre parcel
of land near Hayden Lake, just north of Coeur d'Alene. He began
touting the Inland Northwest as a white homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's Aryan Nations Church would end up becoming the premier
hate group in the country and a sort of petri dish for neo-Nazis
and others to grow into virulent criminals. Many of the hate crimes
in or originating in the Northwest can be traced to Butler,
spiraling out from him like a string of Old Testament begats.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with The Order, a group of Aryan Nations followers who
formed their own terrorist group in 1984 and killed Jewish radio
talk-show host Alan Berg and pulled a series of bank robberies
meant to fund a larger race war.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, countless groups and individuals have spun off from
Aryan Nations and used The Order as a template for committing
crimes, from murder to robbery to bombings to the most recent _
Furrow's shooting spree this week at a Jewish community center in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, Furrow worked as a security guard at
Butler's compound and was married by Butler to Debbie Mathews, the
widow of Robert Mathews, the founder of The Order who was killed in
a shootout with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents and those tracking hate groups say the
82-year-old Butler is no longer a key figure among the radical
right, but his legacy remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   When, in 1991, an up-and-coming Christian Identity preacher
named David Barley looked to move his America's Promise Ministries
out of Arizona, his group ended up looking in Idaho and Montana,
and ultimately located in Sandpoint, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first impression was good,'' Barley wrote to his followers
when he found his new home in Idaho in 1991, ``and once we looked
around the area (we) saw many positive aspects ... including very
friendly and mostly non-Babylonian government hungry people.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a man called Barley's protege, Jay Merrill, led a
group of three men who bombed an abortion clinic and a newspaper
office and robbed banks in Spokane. There are people like that
everywhere, of course. The Southern Poverty Law Center recently
listed eight active hate groups in Idaho, 10 in Washington, 35 in
California, 48 in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But that's little consolation to the people in Metaline Falls or
to anyone in the West, who must defend their home as a tolerant
place to live and who will hold their collective breath every time
a loner ventures out to commit a crime based on hate.
</P>
<P>
   Jess Walter is the author of ``Every Knee Shall Bow,'' a 1995
book about the case of white separatist Randy Weaver. A free-lance
writer and journalist in Spokane, he also is the co-author of ``In
Contempt,'' Christopher Darden's account of the O.J. Simpson murder
trial.

INTERNET IS PROTECTED TERRITORY FOR WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Like Coca-Cola, Sony Pictures and Microsoft, Alex
Curtis knows the power of marketing on the World Wide Web. The
23-year-old's tips to aspiring Webmasters read like a how-to on
reaching out and grabbing Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get (a Web site) up, be sure to put out useful
information and not just `I'm white and proud,' and a few links,''
Curtis writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us your ideas on strategy and what we need to get done.
Only concrete ideas. ... Go for the throat _ this is the freest
expression you'll ever have. If you don't like the fact that Jews
exist, go ahead and say so.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis is a committed white supremacist. The San Diego State
University history major is also the editor of the Nationalist
Observer, a magazine advocating racial purity.
</P>
<P>
   To the chagrin of some, the Internet remains protected ground.
Even the writings of extremist hate groups spewing hatred of blacks
and Jews is protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the FBI cannot target groups for investigation based on
their beliefs, at least not overtly. This restraint rests on the
belief that the government should respect free speech and not crack
down on groups or individuals who espouse unpopular ideas, unless
there is some criminal activity involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites of hate groups are not monitored unless there is
compelling evidence the group is plotting an act of domestic
terrorism, said FBI spokesman Tron Brekke.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every group that has a Web site, there is not a
corresponding FBI file. Talking about violence is a whole lot
different than actually taking the steps to do the violence. ...
There has to be some criminality or potential criminality
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Ward of the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious
Harassment, said, ``Many people now feel frustrated, because law
enforcement is effectively restricted from monitoring these groups.
But the cost of that would be our civil liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors fringe groups,
estimated earlier this year that there were 254 active
``extremist'' sites, up from 163 a year before. It is hard to get a
handle on how many sites there are, since they are shut down or
move with such great frequency.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI does work in tandem with non-profit agencies such as the
Southern Poverty Law Center. ``Law enforcement agencies come to us
every day with questions about particular groups,'' said Mark
Potok, a spokesman for the center. ``I think the current division
of labor is a good one, in which the government has police powers
but is precluded from investigating groups merely because they have
unpleasant views.''
</P>
<P>
   As the tug-of-war over civil liberties and freedom of speech
plays itself out, the opportunities of the Internet grows
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this medium, it's an opportunity for companies or
organizations or individuals to share lots of information at a
relatively inexpensive price,'' said Doug Levy, president of
Dallas-based Internet Marketing &AMP; Creative Concepts, which designs
Web sites for such clients as the Campbell Soup Co. and ABC's
``Monday Night Football.'' ``It's like having their own channel to
put whatever they want to tell the consumer about out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology of the Web _ which allows music, moving pictures
and chat as well as text _ creates a more powerful marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be everything,'' said Richard Yalch, a professor of
marketing at the University of Washington in Seatte. ``Look at
garden.com as an example of this. Gardening is a hobby. You can buy
products at the site. You can talk about it at the site in a chat
room. Everything that exists in the real world exists in
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   One white supremacist site has files to download, message
boards, links to other supremacist sites and a collection of racist
cartoons. But it also has a page for Aryan singles to meet each
other _ for ``heterosexual, white gentiles only.''

have collided with President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy for gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Army Reserve officials are investigating May after learning of
statements he made to the press during the 1999 legislative session
indicating he was gay. In college, May transferred to the Army ROTC
after briefly serving in the Navy ROTC; and after graduation, he
went into the Army.
</P>
<P>
   But May says he wasn't subject to Defense Department regulations
when he spoke to the press because he was not an active reservist.
He wasn't recalled to active duty until February, after the
comments were made to local newspapers in response to an anti-gay
bill in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   May says he has never discussed the issue with Army colleagues
or while on active duty, which means he hasn't violated the policy.
Others, including advocacy attorneys for gays in the military,
aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   May believes the case could present an interesting legal dilemma
for the military, pitting his First Amendment rights as a lawmaker
against a military policy he calls destructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My case shows the silliness of the `don't ask, don't tell'
policy,'' he said. ``I'm trained and qualified to serve the
military. The military has chosen to exclude trained and qualified
people simply because of a stated sexual preference.''
</P>
<P>
   May, a lieutenant trained in nuclear, chemical and biological
warfare defense, also is qualified as a paratrooper. He is
second-in-command in the 348th Transportation Company.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Eileen Norton, commander of the 484th Transportation
Battalion, confirmed that an investigation is under way, but she
provided no other details.
</P>
<P>
   The ``don't ask, don't tell'` policy, adopted in 1993, allows
commanders to investigate a subordinate's sexual orientation in one
of three scenarios: when there is ``credible information'' to
believe the subordinate is gay; the soldier has engaged in
homosexual conduct; or the person has attempted to marry someone of
the same gender.
</P>
<P>
   May's case focuses on whether there's ``credible information.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Sobel, senior attorney with the Washington, D.C.-based
Service Members Legal Defense Network, said the fact that May's
comments came before he was recalled into active duty may not make
a difference. The network represents military employees who are
involved in ``don't ask, don't tell'' cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has made a statement in the past . . . they can try to
pursue a discharge,'' said Sobel. ``We've had cases where third
parties have turned people in.'' But May says it's unfair that he
should be required to stay silent as a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   In early February, May denounced a bill proposed by Rep. Karen
Johnson, R-Mesa, that would have prohibited the use of public money
to pay for benefits for same-sex couples. Johnson also made
disparaging comments about gays in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this mean that every time that Karen Johnson pulls her
crazy antics that I have to keep my mouth shut?'' May asked.
</P>
<P>
   May argues that the policy is hurting the military by
discharging qualified people. Military retention recently has
dropped significantly, so much so that some members of Congress are
calling for a reinstatement of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 1,145 gay people discharged from the
military, up from 997 in 1997, according to Defense Department
figures. Sobel expects the trend to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely see quite a number of cases where highly
qualified men and women who have served with distinction are being
forced out of the military because of sexual preference,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   May, who was up for a promotion to captain this fall, said he's
frustrated that he once again is forced to fight a gay-rights
issue, which was not his motivation for entering public life. A
Republican, he has been criticized by some in the gay community for
not being vocal enough on gay-rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   May is more interested in talking about about tax cuts,
education or conservative economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resent being forced into this,'' he said. ``It's an awkward
situation, one I didn't want to be in. I'm not trying to make a
gay-rights issue out of it. Service isn't a right. This is an
obligation. Why do gay people have less of an obligation to defend
the nation?''
</P>
<P>
   The case could take months to resolve. In the meantime, May said
he will keep working weekends, training soldiers. He says he has a
great working relationship with both his soldiers and the officers
he serves.
</P>
<P>
   He says his commanders don't want to pursue the case, but
they're stuck with the policy. Ultimately, he says he'll follow his
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got called back to the military, I went,'' he said.
``If they want to kick me out. . . . I'm trying to do the right and
honorable thing.'' &QL;

MENTAL-HEALTH EXPERTS CAUTION AGAINST SAYING SYSTEM FAILED FURROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Family friends and advocates for the mentally ill on
Thursday questioned whether Buford O. Furrow Jr. got the treatment
he needed from Washington state's mental-health system.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Merrill, a friend and neighbor of the Furrows in Olympia
for 24 years, said Furrow's father is angry that his son didn't get
closer supervision from mental health professionals after his
release from prison in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are disappointed that (the system) didn't give him more
help,'' Merrill said. ``If a person doesn't want to take their
medicine, they won't. That is what his dad thinks, that he didn't
take his medication, and he sort of went off.''
</P>
<P>
   But because Furrow's mental-health records remain confidential
under state law, it's not clear that there is more that authorities
could have reasonably been expected to do to prevent Furrow from
allegedly launching his hateful attack on a Los Angeles-area Jewish
day care center Tuesday. Furrow has also been charged in the
killing of a postal worker after the day-care shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week before the attack, Furrow made his regularly
scheduled appointment in Olympia with his community corrections
officer, who concluded Furrow was meeting all the conditions of
release. Officer Pat Gosney concluded that Furrow had been staying
away from alcohol, guns, and the psychiatric workers he had
attacked nine months before, and was consistently taking his
medications. Random drug testing ordered by Gosney had confirmed
those prescription drugs were in his system in July, Department of
Corrections spokesman Veltry Johnson said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that corrections staff did not search Furrow's home
or car for guns or alcohol, as they can legally do.
</P>
<P>
   Critics Thursday charged that given Furrow's mental-health
history, the court also should have ordered intensive mental-health
treatment after his release. The King County Superior Court judge
who handled his case, Harriet Cody, did not order such treatment.
She could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty clear that he came out of the King County
Jail and fell through the cracks,'' said Tom Richardson, Washington
president of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. ``Mentally
ill people on medications need supervision. There is an ignorance
on the part of the court in thinking that you can just require
someone to take their medication and that is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But mental-health professionals Thursday cautioned the public
from jumping to the conclusion that Furrow, a card-carrying member
of the Aryan Nations Church, allegedly sprayed the day-care center
with gunfire because of mental illness. Without having seen his
mental health records, they said it's dangerous to surmise his
violence was a result of his lack of treatment, or could have been
prevented if he had been confined for longer in a psychiatric
hospital, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not appropriate for everyone who demonstrates dangerous
behavior to be in a hospital,'' said psychiatrist Ira Klein,
director of civil adult services at Western State Hospital.
``Thousands of people commit violent crimes, and they aren't
schizophrenics.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that psychiatric hospitals can only treat people for
major mental illnesses, and not hold them because they are racist
or express a desire to do violence against certain groups.
</P>
<P>
   Because of patient confidentiality rules, state authorities
cannot release the files they compiled during the seven months
Furrow spent in two state psychiatric facilities and in a county
jail with a staff of psychologists and psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's only run-in with police in Washington stemmed from his
attempt to check himself into a Kirkland psychiatric facility last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow told psychiatric workers then that he had been
fantasizing about opening fire at the Alderwood Mall and killing
his estranged wife and her friends. But his plea for help turned
violent when he pulled a knife on psychiatric workers who refused
to give him back his car keys. He only dropped the switchblade when
a county sheriff's deputy pulled his gun.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest on a Wednesday, the county jail's
well-respected psychiatric unit quickly spotted Furrow as someone
in need of a thorough evaluation. A jail psychologist pushed
deputies to file charges quickly so he could be held for that
evaluation. Deputies did move fast, closing the case on Friday, but
Furrow managed to post bond before prosecutors filed the charges
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he and his parents recognized he needed help, and they
took him to Harborview Medical Center for an evaluation, according
to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after he was charged with second-degree assault, he was
taken to Western State Hospital in Steilacoom for further
evaluation and treatment, Dan Donohoe, spokesman for the King
County Prosecutor's Office, confirmed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But Furrow was not sent to Western State for an evaluation of
whether he was competent to stand trial, Klein said, and therefore
he was not judged to be insane at the time he assaulted the
psychiatric workers in Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one other reason the hospital could have taken him
for treatment: He had been committed because he was deemed a danger
to himself or the community.
</P>
<P>
   Klein could not legally comment on what treatment Furrow
received. But he said the hospital's goal is to evaluate patients,
stabilize them, and then return them to the community supported
with ongoing treatment and medication.
</P>
<P>
   One Dec. 11, Furrow was sent from Western State back to the
county jail.
</P>
<P>
   Klein cautioned that a decision that a patient is stable enough
to be returned to the security of the jail, where their treatment
and medication can be supervised by psychiatric professionals, is
not the same as deciding the person is ready to be released into
the community.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, Furrow was arraigned on the assault charges.
Initially, Furrow's defense attorney, Leona Thomas, entered a
not-guilty plea by reason of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Thomas' request for more expert evaluation of
Furrow was granted. But the portion of his file containing his
mental health record has been sealed by the court. Later, Furrow
withdrew the insanity plea and entered a guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   Both Klein and Sherry Storms, the Mental Health Ombudsman for
the county, said mentally ill people often decide to plead guilty
to criminal charges because they realize that their stay in a
psychiatric facility would keep them confined even longer. But
neither had specific knowledge of why Furrow changed his plea.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow was released from jail on May 21, and met with his
probation officer in Olympia on June 16, July 6, July 20 and Aug.
3.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's parents last saw their son on Saturday. Furrow's
mother, Monnie, is ill, and broke down upon hearing the news of
Furrow's arrest, Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what bothers his dad the most was that he shot all
those little kids. He loves little kids.''

SONICS TRADE HAWKINS FOR BARRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Hersey Hawkins knew something was about to happen.
There was this daily flood of phone calls from friends.
</P>
<P>
   So the former Sonics guard figured he would hear another trade
rumor when his phone rang Thursday morning. Only this time, Sonics
president Wally Walker was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   To Hawkins' surprise, a deal had been done.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics continued to revamp their roster, trading Hawkins and
little-used guard James Cotton to Chicago for shooting guard Brent
Barry. Hawkins was caught off guard although a trade involving him
had been anticipated for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing about it is I never heard Chicago,'' Hawkins
said from his home near Charlotte, N.C. ``About the only thing I'm
disappointed about is Wally said they were never shopping me. But
it's evident that they were. He told me teams were calling him. But
if you're going to look to trade me, be honest about it. ... I
mean, I figured once they lost Detlef (Schrempf) that I was next.''
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Hawkins leaves Gary Payton as the only
remaining player from the Sonics' 1996 NBA Finals team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came up in the last couple of days,'' Walker said. ``We
were open to whatever was required to improve the team. A couple of
things dictate what we're doing. Aside from the proposed rules
changes, how our young guys performed in the summer league impacted
what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker tried relentlessly to complete a sign-and-trade deal with
Hawkins in order to land Washington free agent guard Mitch
Richmond. However, that and a number of subsequent deals faltered
because Hawkins has two years and $8.7 million remaining on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   It was believed the Sonics were still working on a trade for
Hawkins once they signed free agent gunner Vernon Maxwell earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel indifferent,'' said Hawkins, a Chicago native. ``Of
course I didn't want to leave Seattle. We were really at that point
where we were settled. I'm excited about going back home. I told
Jerry (Krause, Bulls general manager) why didn't they pull the
trigger five years ago? But what more can you ask other than to
finish up in Chicago, where I grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' salary plus Cotton's came close to matching Barry, who
signed a six-year contract with the Bulls in January.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Sonics announced they also signed a back-up point
guard Shammond Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1 North Carolina product starred on the Sonics'
summer league team in Boston. Williams was a 1998 draft pick who
played in two games for Atlanta before being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great situation here,'' said Williams, who played at
North Carolina from 1995-98. ``Coach (Paul) Westphal is behind me,
and he has been pushing me this summer. I'm going to come in here
and learn a lot from Gary Payton and do whatever it takes to help
this team become successful.''
</P>
<P>
   By adding Barry, Walker continued his campaign to make the
Sonics younger and more athletic.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, 27, will battle Maxwell for the chance to replace the
32-year-old Hawkins as the starter next to Payton. Barry averaged
11.1 points, 3.9 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 37 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   He is best known for winning the 1996 Slam Dunk Contest as a
rookie for the Los Angeles Clippers. He was traded to Miami two
years later before signing with Chicago as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Critics question Barry's toughness and ability to stay healthy.
However, Barry is an exciting player in the open court because he
finishes plays with flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to trade Hersey we needed to receive someone very
special in return,'' Westphal said. ``We think Brent's athleticism,
versatility and youth will fit perfectly with the new direction of
our team. We hate to see Hersey and James go, but this opportunity
was too good to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the Sonics have passed on 10 players from last year's
25-25 team: Hawkins, Schrempf, Cotton, Dale Ellis, Billy Owens, Don
MacLean, Olden Polynice, Aaron Williams, John Crotty and Brent's
younger brother, Drew Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf signed a free agent deal with Portland, while Ellis and
Owens were traded to Orlando for forward Horace Grant. The team
renounced its rights to Polynice, Williams, Crotty and the younger
Barry on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Sonics have re-signed second-year forward/center
Jelani McCoy and acquired Maxwell, Grant and small forward Ruben
Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said a deal with forward Vin Baker could be struck next
week. The Sonics also are looking to add another center to the
roster soon. Walker was working with slightly more than $1 million
under the salary cap after Thursday's trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics made no secret about their plan to upgrade the
shooting guard position. The team wanted a player who could slash
to the basket and create a shot off the dribble.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins averaged 10.3 points, 4 rebounds and 2.5 assists last
season. Although he struggled with his outside shot, Hawkins said
in June he could find other ways to score if given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But Hawkins and the Sonics have gone in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish them well,'' said Hawkins, whom the Sonics acquired
from Charlotte before the 1996 season. ``It wasn't going to be the
same. I was thinking about the roster, and even if I was back, it
would have been me and Gary from a team that went to the finals
three years ago. How does (the turnover) happen so fast?''

M'S PITCHERS FINALLY FEEL SAFE AND SANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Amazing how different Stan Williams seems _ and not
just because he's pale from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Williams now is a genius. A month ago, he was a dope.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that mitigates against his certification as the
pre-eminent baseball sage is one niggling point:
</P>
<P>
   Every major league pitching coach becomes a genius when the
outfield fences are moved back a first down or so.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 games at the Guilty Pleasure, the Mariners' earned-run
average is 4.29, almost 2{ runs fewer than the 38-game Kingdome
average.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that: For 22{ years, the quest for quality pitching
has been futile NOT because Mariners ownership and management have
been stupid.
</P>
<P>
   They were playing in the wrong park.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well ... addresses in Seattle can be confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us in the media were just as confused. For weeks during
the run-up to the new park, all we talked about was the grousing by
Mariner hitters about the generous dimensions, the heavy, moving
air, the soft grass.
</P>
<P>
   All of us missed a key point.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the roster were pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   In our defense, it must be argued: Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   The club's universal emphasis on dinger-rama the past decade has
helped create a complete whiff by us on the idea that there might
be guys on the roster real happy about the move.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it's not as if most of the 26 Mariners pitchers have
been around long enough this season to finish a handshake, much
less answer a question.
</P>
<P>
   Those few on the roster at the moment are nearly kid-like in
their giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it _ the pitchers are raving about it,'' said
Paul Abbott, who pitched five solid innings and was the winner
Wednesday in the 11-2, series-sweeping victory over the Chicago
White Sox. ``You don't have to make the perfect pitch. If you find
yourself in a hole, you can be more aggressive. It takes more
pressure off you.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as he would like to take credit, Williams is quick to
acknowledge it was not exactly his cunning that helped curtail the
staff's term as human pinatas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park obviously helps a lot,'' Williams said after his
pitchers gave up nine runs in three games against Chicago. ``It's
giving the pitchers some confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know how tough the Kingdome was until we got out of
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Mariners are just 12-9 at the GP, and they were
massively hosed by the Yankees in the series before the White Sox
staggered to town. Yet it was an 8-5 homestand thanks mostly to
pitching that bordered on _ dare it be said? _ credible.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Kingdome, our pitchers tried to be too careful,''
Williams said. ``If they missed, it's a huge mistake. Here, a
pitcher gets behind a hitter, and he throws up and away and the
ball will stay in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Dan Wilson, who has borne intimate witness to the mound
horrors, attests to the additional wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers can challenge the hitters here more and not give up a
cheap home run to right,'' he said. ``At this point, it has been an
advantage for our pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, 21 games is not definitive, particularly since few
have been played with the wind coming from the southwest, the
sodden direction of spring that will turn fly balls into cannon
shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the psychological value for pitchers is undeniable. Young
pitchers often came into the Kingdome cowering from apocryphal
stories of hurlers scraping the center-field wall during windups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 405 feet to center field in the Kingdome, too,'' Williams
said. ``It just didn't play like it. The 73-degree temperature
never varied, never had moisture, and balls always carry in warmer
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``On turf, grounders go through like bullets. Gappers go for
triples. The Kingdome gave up a higher percentage of hits and a
higher percentage of home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get to a pitcher. Anytime you get negative thoughts, it
takes room away from positive concentration. And positive
concentration is what's needed to avoid things like walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this park is, is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Just not to Mariners hitters used to the ultrafriendly confines.
Still, the homestand featured bountiful attempts by the offense to
bunt, steal, sneak, subvert, tip-toe and filch some runs, a
delightful contrast to the hairy-knuckle style that proved so
breathtakingly inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Anytime Edgar Martinez attempts three steals in a homestand,
either the continents are about to collide, or Mariners hitters
have ended their resistance to Small Ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have the experience that we can play this kind of
baseball,'' Wilson said. ``It's good to have options and
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The awareness was forced upon them too late for this postseason.
At least the next six games back in the crimped yards of Boston and
Toronto will offer clues about retaining the new game for old
parks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a fan can positively concentrate on a green light for
Martinez and a stop light for the pitching staff _ although the
risk is high for a mind blown beyond recognition.

DIALLO'S MOTHER SEEKS TO REPLACE LEGAL `DREAM TEAM' 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a bid to acquire greater control of a civil suit
against the city, the mother of Amadou Diallo hired a new lawyer on
Thursday and wants to replace the ``Dream Team'' of Johnnie L.
Cochran Jr. and five others now representing Diallo's estate,
family members and the new lawyer said on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, hired the firm of Robert D.
Conason, a prominent personal injury lawyer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not happy with the way they are handling the case,''
her brother, Bob Diallo, said on Thursday night. ``She wants
someone who has got enough time for her, and she wants to get more
involved in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo was shot 19 times by members of the Police
Department's Street Crime Unit in the doorway of his Bronx home in
February in a case that touched off a furious debate about the
police's treatment of minorities in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of the six-member team of lawyers representing the
estate _ Cochran, Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld, Kyle Watters,
Jonathan Svetkey and Michael Warren _ is not a simple matter
because any legal moves must involve both of Amadou Diallo's
parents, who are divorced and are at odds. New lawyers for the
estate can only be hired by the estate's administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Amadou Diallo's death, his parents, Kadiadou and
Saikou Diallo appointed Wyatt Tee Walker, an associate of the Rev.
Al Sharpton's as the administrator of the estate. The only asset of
the estate would be the proceeds of a succesful civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   Walker selected Cochran and the others. Both parents are now
trying to install an administrator who will represent their
interests more effectively, Watters said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo's intention is to get herself appointed as
administrator, giving her power to hire Conason's firm as lawyers
for the estate, Conason said. He said he planned to file papers
soon to have her installed. Because she is not a resident of New
York state, she would have to have a co-executor, he said, adding
that he expected Saikou Diallo to oppose the motion.

M'S LOU PINIELLA ON THE BUBBLE AS HE APPROACHES 1,000 VICTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the time comes, it will be obvious to Lou
Piniella. He will sit still on the bench. The scraps of paper on
his desk will no longer be covered with lineup ideas. The sound and
the fury will be muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That feeling inside where you don't get excited before a
ballgame, where you don't enjoy the wins, where the losses don't
hurt you,'' said the Mariners manager. ``I'll know. Nobody'll have
to tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has not reached that point, even as defeats have come more
frequently the past two years. Piniella handles losing better now,
because he knows there is only so much he can control. But Anita
Piniella can still tell the subtle differences in her husband after
a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an I'll-forget-about-it type of guy,'' she said of
her husband of 32 years. ``He's really not. I know what's going on.
He's playing it over and over. The best thing he can do after a
loss is just go to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   And even that's not a sure thing. After all, this is a man who,
as a player, loved to tinker with his swing in the middle of the
night. Anita awakened once to see a figure wielding a baseball bat,
and screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Just Lou. Perfectionist, then and now.
</P>
<P>
   That is why his tenure in Seattle, while leading him to the
brink of 1,000 career victories, has been somewhat disappointing
for Piniella. He takes pride in the club attendance records the
Mariners have set under him; his teams in New York and Cincinnati
did the same.
</P>
<P>
   But at .508, Piniella's winning percentage in Seattle is the
lowest of his three stops. And he has not captured another World
Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here to Seattle, people told me it's not going to
work,'' said Piniella, who needs four victories to become the sixth
active manager to reach the milestone. ``I took that as a personal
challenge. And we've been very representative in the years I've
been here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I satisfied with what we've done? Not really. I'm very
pleased that the team stayed in Seattle and got a new ballpark. But
winning two divisions ... we just didn't keep our team together.
Some of the pieces started going elsewhere. And we've been in a
position here, since '97 anyway, where we've been in transition.
It's not easy to win, that's what I've learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella's chance of staying through that transition depends
largely on how dramatic it is. If the Mariners retain enough of
their core to make a run in 2000 _ and ownership continues to
endorse Piniella _ then he should serve at least through his
contract, which ends after next year. But if the Mariners decide to
start over, they won't do it with Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a rebuilding type manager,'' said Piniella, who makes
more than $1 million a year. ``I don't think (dismantling the team)
will be the situation here in Seattle. But why pay a manager a lot
of money to rebuild? Get a young manager that you can grow with,
and build with him, too. I'm in it to give ourselves a shot to win.
That is my satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   A kinship with Steinbrenner
</P>
<P>
   The Piniellas never thought Lou would stay in baseball after his
18-year playing career ended in 1984. He was active in business and
seemed to have an acumen for it, and he'd already given 23 years to
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then George Steinbrenner called. The New York Yankees principal
owner asked Piniella to stay with the team as a coach, with the
promise that he could become manager one day. That day came in
October 1985, and Piniella directed the Yankees until mid-1988,
serving as general manager for part of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   After a year as an adviser and broadcaster with New York,
Piniella was up for the Reds job. Steinbrenner spoke with
Cincinnati owner Marge Schott, who was not favoring Piniella, and
gave a winning recommendation. There is a kinship between owner and
former outfielder _ ``I think they're one in the same,'' said
former Yankees reliever George Frazier _ and Steinbrenner remains
fond of Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou is a winner,'' Steinbrenner said. ``If you were in a
foxhole, you would want Lou Piniella in with you. That's about the
biggest compliment you can give a guy. You'd want him right by your
side. He's a warrior, he knows how to win, and he gets the job
done. That's how he was with me, always.''
</P>
<P>
   With Thurman Munson and Graig Nettles, Steinbrenner said,
Piniella was one of three leaders on the Yankees teams that won the
World Series in 1977 and '78.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of leadership in Lou, I really did,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``You came to recognize it after a while and see it in him.
If there was a fight, he was the first guy in to defend his
teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   And also the first to criticize them for mental lapses. Texas
Rangers coach Bucky Dent, a former teammate, said players who made
mental mistakes knew better than to get on Piniella's bus. He and
other veterans could be merciless.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would verbally beat you up to where you said, `I don't
want to mess up again,''' Dent said.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, now a Colorado Rockies broadcaster, said Piniella was a
student, sometimes noting what moves he'd make in certain
situations. When Piniella became a manager, Frazier said, it was
easy to see who had molded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's Billy Jr.,'' said Frazier, referring to Billy Martin, who
had five managing stints in the Bronx. `` ... With Lou, you get one
or two chances and then you're done, and I think that's strictly
based on how he was raised as a player and who he played for.
Playing for Billy was the same way. Fiery, competitive, players'
manager. Billy, he'd chew your ass and then he'd hug you. I think
Lou's a lot the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners right fielder Jay Buhner, who played for Martin in New
York, sees the same things. You could never outsmart either in game
strategy, Buhner said, and both were open to player ideas. Buhner
and Piniella have clashed over the years, he said, but nothing
lingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I love about the guy,'' Buhner said. ``The next
day, it's `How ya doing, big fella?' like nothing ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And also like Martin _ and Earl Weaver, Piniella's minor league
manager _ there's the famous Piniella temper. He's fought it all of
his 55 years, and though he's mellowed ``a hell of a lot,''
Piniella said, it's something he's learned he can't change.
</P>
<P>
   In an era where TV cameras dissect every angle of every cap
kick, dirt swipe and base toss, the temper can make Piniella come
off as rash, if not unstable. On ``Lou Piniella Day'' at Yankee
Stadium in 1984, clips of his tantrums were played to an upbeat pop
song, ``He's So Fine.'' Last month, an ESPN compilation played to
ominous, sinister notes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: sinister notes.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners pitching coach Stan Williams, who has known Piniella 33
years, believes he snaps because he's hard on himself and he cares
_ and not just about winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather see a guy fly off the handle because he let the
team down than be passive about it,'' Williams said. ``That means
they care. And Lou cares. That's why he's a good man to work for,
too, because he's a very caring man. That's something a lot of
people may not know. He cares about his friends. He'll do anything
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams sees that when Piniella helps old business partners
from deals that never worked out. Anita Piniella sees it in her
husband's compassion for homeless people. Even to those who don't
know Piniella well, that quality comes through.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people profess to believe in something, but when it
comes down to it, they're not there to back it up,'' said Cleveland
Indians manager Mike Hargrove. ``Lou stands by what he believes. He
can be brutally honest, and he's a very funny man, but there's also
a very sincere side that I enjoyed finding out he had.''
</P>
<P>
   `I've got to make it happen'
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in baseball likes to lose, of course. Anita Piniella
recognizes this; if her husband seems like he wants to win more
than others, she said, it could be because he shows emotion like
few do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a man for whom winning is primal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anybody detest losing as much as Lou,'' said
bench coach John McLaren. ``I've seen him get physically sick from
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella does not spout five-year plans. His charge, as he sees
it, is to win with what he has _ now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't adhere to the theory that, well, I don't have the
players, or I need this or I need that,'' Piniella said. ``I've got
to make it happen with what I've got. I've got to shuffle, I've got
to prod, I've got to plead _ whatever I've got to do, I've got to
make it happen somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shoulder it. I don't make any bones about it. We don't play
well, I don't blame the players. I don't blame the front office.
It's my job to get the damn team to play better. That's basically
it, you know? And that's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that effort, some young Mariner pitchers have been
traded, rushed or _ some would argue _ ruined. Lately, Piniella has
shown an increasing acceptance of the Mariners' plan to stockpile
young arms _ and the growing pains that go with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't shown up in the win/loss column yet, but it will,''
Piniella said. ``I know where we're headed and I know it's the
right approach, and we're not that far.''
</P>
<P>
   The rap about Piniella and young pitchers gnaws at him. He was
hailed for his handling of the Reds pitchers in 1990, when they won
the World Series, and also developed Doug Drabek and Bob Tewksbury
as rookies in New York. This year, rookies Freddy Garcia and John
Halama have turned out well.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no mistaking Piniella's belief on pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing has been constant about baseball: Veteran pitching
wins for you,'' Piniella said. ``Yeah, you may have the `Kiddie
Corps' of the Baltimore Orioles back when, but if you look in
general, teams that have veteran pitching, especially late in
ballgames, tend to do a whole lot better than teams that get
younger as they get deeper into the ballgame. That's the experience
factor: you get more consistency, you know more of what to expect.
There are less surprises, and it's more conducive to winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if you look at my track record, and not only here but in
Cincinnati and New York, I've given more young pitchers
opportunities than any manager that's managed as long as I have,
and probably more. Now they say I'm hard on young pitchers. I'm not
hard on young pitchers. I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hard on young pitchers that can't pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosophies tend not to change after 1,000 victories, and there
is no doubting Piniella's influence on the Mariners' personnel
moves. Vice president for baseball operations Woody Woodward calls
Piniella ``performance-oriented'' _ which seems a polite way of
saying ``demanding'' _ and relies heavily on Piniella's input.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has more to say in the makeup of the club than just about
any manager in the game today,'' Woodward said. ``There may be
exceptions, but he has more impact during the offseason as we plan
for the following season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the experience winning, and I think when you have a
manager like that, you should take advantage of that. I would
prefer to have a manager who gets involved. His credentials justify
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those credentials include a 517-500 record since joining the
Mariners, who had finished above .500 once in 16 years before he
arrived. Only one other active manager, the Dodgers' Davey Johnson,
has won a title as a player and manager. That credibility was
invaluable in 1995, when Piniella was named AL Manager of the Year
and the Mariners rallied to win the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in the fire; he knows what it takes,'' said catcher
Dan Wilson. ``When you go through it, you don't realize it, but
looking back (to '95), during that stretch he was more or less
hands-off. Just go out and play. He didn't interfere, because he
knew we all wanted the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner has noticed the way Piniella is adapting to Safeco Field,
calling more National League-style sacrifices and squeeze plays
because runs are at more of a premium than at the Kingdome.
Piniella seems comfortable at the ballpark, except, perhaps, in his
office, where photos and wall-hangings still sit on the floor,
waiting to be displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Contractually, he has every right to decorate the walls as he
pleases. And internally, the desire remains. The biggest reason
he's nearing his 1,000th victory, Piniella believes, is his ability
to get along with people. After 38 years in baseball, leaving
everyone behind would not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been a hard 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when you take it with the intensity and the care
that he does, you could get to the point where you're a little
tired,'' Anita Piniella said. ``But it won't happen right away.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be another thousand, Piniella has said, laughing.
But if things don't last in Seattle, he is not prepared to walk
away from managing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' he said, ``but I don't think about that yet,
because it's not my option. That option belongs to other people. If
it happens, it happens; if it doesn't happen, then I'll go home. I
could see myself going home and enjoying it, I really could. But
I'd like to stay in baseball in some capacity, scouting or
whatever, just to keep my foot in the door a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I know best.''

BY HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let the healing begin.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message Thursday night at a forum that brought
together counselors, political leaders and public safety officials
to talk to the community about the shooting rampage that killed a
postal worker and wounded two adults and three children at the
Jewish Community Center in the suburb of Granada Hills.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people attended the session organized by conflict
resolution trainer Jane Lowenthal, held at a local school.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the officials offered comfort and solace to
community members, they also pledged to stand strong against hatred
and intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you touch one child, you touch all of us and we will not
stand for it,'' said Ruben Zacarias, superintendent of the Los
Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   The LAUSD, he said, has one of the top emergency response teams
in the country, one that has been sent to the scenes of tragedies
all over the world to offer help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety of our children is a top priority,'' he said. ``We
take this issue of young people learning to respect each other very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Police Chief Michael Bostic, the San Fernando Valley's
top cop, praised the quick and massive response from emergency
crews Tuesday but said the frightening truth is that it is nearly
impossible to prevent this kind of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, when someone is this sick, this far gone, with
no remorse, no moral fiber, nothing in his being that's nearly
human, frankly there is not much we can do,'' Bostic said.
</P>
<P>
   A white supremacist suspected of being the gunman turned himself
in to federal authorities in Las Vegas Wednesday, telling them,
according to sources, that the shootings were ``a wake-up call'' to
kill American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Mayer, director of the Jewish Federation, said he refuses
to be cowed by the violent, racist act.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent and as a person who runs a community facility much
like the one that was attacked, I'm not frightened,'' he said,
``and none of the people who work for me are frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, people need to react in a positive way to
``make a world that is safe for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowenthal said she called the meeting to tell parents how they
can talk to their children about what happened and figure out what
to do next to keep children safe at schools and in public areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to see each other face-to-face to have
the chance to see we're more alike than we're different,'' she
said. ``Hate is the worst four-letter on this Earth. If I could ban
only one word, that would be the word I would ban.''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen children who came to the meeting with their
parents were treated to a tour of a fire engine parked outside.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending included City Councilman Hal Bernson, Fire Capt.
Steve Ruda and Robert Tynoos, director of the University of
California, Los Angeles trauma psychiatry service.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, across town in Hollywood, Assemblyman Wally Knox held
a forum on hate crimes and invited people to sign a 30-foot banner
that read, ``JCC kids, we love you.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum was held to discuss Knox's pending assembly bill to
expand the definition of hate crimes to include those involving
sexual orientation and gender.

</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-POLICY (Washington) _ It is the year's other war. While the
nation's attention has focused on Kosovo, American warplanes have
quietly, methodically and with virtually no public discussion been
attacking Iraq. Over the past eight months, U.S. pilots, joined by
their British comrades, have flown some two-thirds as many missions
over Iraq as NATO pilots did in 78 days of around-the-clock war
against Yugoslavia. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   EICHMANN-MEMOIRS (Berlin) _ ``Obeying an order was the most
important thing to me. It could be that is in the nature of the
German.'' This is how Adolf Eichmann seeks to explain his central
role in the extermination by the Nazis of 6 million European Jews
in memoirs published Thursday by the German daily Die Welt. The
statement was part of an attempt by Eichmann to portray himself as
a man driven by a visceral sense of duty rather than hatred, and it
appears in the handwritten reflections that Die Welt says it found
at the Center for Research on Nazi Crimes. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ Ordinary citizens and political
commentators are wearily picking their way through the debris of
what some were still calling a government crisis, despite the fact
that Boris Yeltsin has changed his government so many times in the
last 17 months _ four to be exact _ that the word ``crisis'' has
lost all meaning. By Celestine Bohlen.

   SCHOOL-SECURITY (Atlanta) _ At rural schoolhouses and urban
campuses across the country, millions of students returning to
class in the next few weeks will encounter a steely array of new
security measures. In many schools, lockers are being removed,
cameras are being installed as hallway monitors and students will
have to swipe a computerized ID card just to get in the door. By
David Firestone.

<P>
   INTERNET-ACCESS (Washington) _ The fight here and in cities
around the nation over ``open access'' to high-speed cable Internet
service between AT&AMP;T and a coalition led by AOL and GTE has quickly
turned into the most expensive telecom fight of the year and the
latest full employment act for lawyers and lobbyists. It also
features remarkable alliances like President Clinton's top personal
lawyer and the former top Starr aide who wrote the heart of the
independent counsel's impeachment report. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OLDEST-LIFE (Undated) _ Researchers report in the journal
Science that they have pushed the origins of complex life back by a
billion years, with the discovery of the remains of 2.7
billion-year-old algae in ancient Australian shale. But
commentators on the study say that claim goes a bit too far. By

<P>
   IOWA-STRAW-POLL (Des Moines, Iowa) _ From state fairs to ice
cream shops, nine Republican presidential candidates have been
scouring this state for votes, set off by something that,
technically, has no direct bearing on who will capture the
nomination: a straw poll. The poll at Iowa State University in Ames
on Saturday was designed as a scheme for the Iowa Republican Party
to enrich itself. Not once in its two-decade history has the event
predicted a presidential victor. But like it or not, the straw poll
has transformed into what most presidential campaigns agree is the
most consequential political event thus far in the unusually
fast-paced run up to 2000. By Richard L. Berke.

   FORBES-CAMPAIGN (Ames, Iowa) _ Using what his campaign calls a
``Wal-Mart strategy,'' Steve Forbes has held over 180 events in
Iowa and spent millions to woo voters in the state. Some voters
there say they like his business experience and the fact he's a
billionaire. He's built a strong Iowa organization, and that's what
counts in the nearly 25-year-old Iowa straw poll. By Leslie Wayne.

   CLINTON-DEFENSE _ President Clinton's legal defense fund has
raised a total of $6.3 million in 18 months, but the flow of checks
has slowed considerably in recent weeks, causing supporters to
worry that they will not be able to pay off the Clintons' entire
debt before the president leaves office. By Don Van Natta.

   RUSSIA-OIL (Moscow) _ In November 1997, British Petroleum began
its acquisition of a 10 percent stake in the Russian oil company
Sidanko with a signing ceremony at No. 10 Downing Street. Eighteen
months after the smiles and handshakes, BP, now BP Amoco PLC, is
embroiled in a bankruptcy proceeding and a takeover fight that
threatens to destroy Sidanko and BP Amoco's investment in it. The
situation puts the very future of direct foreign investment in
Russia at risk. By Neela Banerjee.

CITY WORKS ON NEW DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The tiny city of San Fernando, in L.A.'s San
Fernando Valley, has officially entered the DreamWorks SKG
sweepstakes, city officials have announced.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando officials, acting on the instructions of City
Council members, sent a packet of material that invites the
5-year-old studio to move its operations to the Northeast Valley
municipality. ``We understand we're a long shot, but we wanted to
make sure that DreamWorks knows we're interested,'' said City
Administrator John Ornellas.
</P>
<P>
   The packet identifies several possible sites, which Ornellas
would not identify publicly, and stresses the city's proximity to
the region's media centers. But officials at DreamWorks, which
bailed out of the Playa Vista project July 1, continue to insist
they have no plans to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are consolidating operations at our animation campus in
Glendale, our headquarters at Universal Studios and our music
business in Beverly Hills,'' said spokesman Andy Spahn. ``It's nice
to be viewed so positively by so many different communities, but we
are not currently looking for alternate sites.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles City Council voted July 20 to develop a package
of incentives to lure DreamWorks to the North Hollywood
Redevelopment Area. The city of Lancaster is offering 47 acres of
free land near Fox Field; the city of Palmdale has held discussions
with developers about luring DreamWorks; officials with Burbank and
Santa Clarita have written letters to the studio; and Glendale
officials have said they'd like DreamWorks to expand next to the
animation campus.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks, founded in 1994 by entertainment moguls Steven
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, was offered more
than $70million in incentives by the city of Los Angeles to build a
$250million studio project as the centerpiece of the Playa Vista
development. The studio has achieved moderate success in some of
its films, including ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Haunting.''

Australian geologists have discovered the fossil remains of complex
life on Earth that are at least 2.7 billion years old _ as much as
a billion years older than any other evidence has ever suggested.
<P>
   The discovery of the ancient molecular fossils should help to
paint an entirely new picture of evolution on the early Earth, the
scientists said, and suggests that these microbes were probably the
first to generate oxygen into the Earth's atmosphere and thus
provide the crucial fuel for all advanced living things _ from
plants to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the earliest clear evidence for complex life on Earth
has come from fossil molecules about 1.6 billion years old. But the
Australian team, reporting Friday in the American journal Science,
declares flatly that ``the molecular fossils we report are the
oldest preserved biological molecules in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This age should provide a new calibration point for molecular
clocks and the universal tree of life,'' the team says.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian scientists, headed by Jochen J. Brocks of the
University of Sidney, found their evidence in a drill core that
brought up samples of shale from a depth of nearly 1,000 feet in
the iron-bearing Hammersley Range of Northwestern Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used the most meticulous chemical techniques
available to make certain that their fossils were uncontaminated by
more recent biological molecules that might have migrated into the
rock core.
</P>
<P>
   And what they found were concentrations of two types of vitally
important fossil ``biomolecules:''
</P>
<P>
   _ One contained traces of fatty molecules called steranes that
could only have been produced by a type of widespread primitive
organism called eukaryotes _ one-celled animals containing a
nucleus and a surrounding membrane _ as opposed to the even simpler
and more primitive organisms called prokaryotes, which have no
nucleus and may have existed on Earth as long as 3.5 billion years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ The other fossils were methylhopanes, chemicals that are
produced only by a class of organisms called cyanobacteria _
sometimes also known as blue-green algae. Cyanobacteria were the
first living things known to exist by photosynthesis and were also
the most important producers of oxygen that made life possible for
more advanced organisms, including the plants and animals of today.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian discovery may be enormously important for
shedding light on the long and shadowy period of Earth's history
known as the Archean age, between the planet's formation some 4.5
billion years ago and the Proterozoic age that began some 2.5
billion years ago, said Andrew H. Knoll, a Harvard evolutionary
biologist who published a commentary on the Australian report
appearing Friday in Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyanobacteria are the microscopic heroes of Earth history,
life's great ecological liberators and source of the oxygen that
transformed our planetary surface,'' Knoll said.
</P>
<P>
   And while the evidence for the existence of cyanobacteria as far
back as 2.7 billion years seems strong, Knoll said, ``We can make
only limited inferences about the overall biology'' of the
Australian fossils.
</P>
<P>
   To Norman H. Sleep, a Stanford geophysicist who has long
pondered the possibility of life having arrived on the early Earth
aboard bombarding asteroids from distant reaches of space, the new
fossil evidence suggests that life may well have arrived even
earlier than 2.7 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finding shows that you have a tree of life that
essentially starts very, very early in the history of Earth,'' he
said in an interview. ``By 2.7 billion years ago, it appears that
the eukaryotes were already major players on the stage. As for the
2.7 billion number, I'd consider that late rather than early, for
there are subtle hints of earlier impacts from space that might
well have introduced life to our planet.''

UNMASKING PHONY `VIETNAM VETS'
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MICHAEL TAYLOR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  DALLAS _ Jug Burkett's cozy office high up in a big
glass-and-steel tower looks more like the cluttered, haphazard digs
of a college professor than the lair of a successful stockbroker.
<P>
   Strewn about the floor, piled crazily on a chair, slopping over
the edge of a credenza, teetering on top of his desk are stacks and
stacks of file folders containing Xeroxed personnel records from
the Vietnam War and tattered news clippings.
</P>
<P>
   On Burkett's walls, chockablock with his MBA diploma and
certificates attesting to his knowledge of financial arcana, are
plaques from the Vietnam Veterans of America and the Veterans Land
Board and a framed letter and photograph of Burkett on the podium
with former President George Bush for the dedication of the Texas
Vietnam Veterans Memorial nearly 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This office is the working headquarters of a guy who invests
other people's millions in the stock market _ and it's his
commissions that help bankroll his singular crusade.
</P>
<P>
   B.G. Burkett _ his parents nicknamed him Jug, in honor of a
favorite golf pro _ has spent the past 13 years unmasking hundreds
of men around the country who have claimed to be Vietnam veterans,
Vietnam heroes, Vietnam-post-traumatic-stress-psychos, the guys you
read about in the papers (``Viet Vet Kills 14 in Post Office
Rampage``) and see on the median strip of busy streets, wearing
signs over their tattered fatigues that proclaim, ``Vietnam Vet _
Will Work for Food.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett has found, to put it simply, that most of these men are
frauds and that their fraudulent claims have been swallowed whole,
and without question, by reputable news organizations, politicians,
generals, police departments and federal agencies, all willing _
depending on the case at hand _ to free someone from prison, offer
them veterans benefits or simply go easy on them when they land in
trouble. The result is that for more than 25 years, many Americans
have thought of Viet vets as jobless, homeless, addicted, suicidal
or deranged ``victim-heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point, and perhaps the one for which Burkett is best
known: In the early 1990s, Joseph Yandle, a man serving life
without parole in Massachusetts for his part in a murder-robbery,
began a campaign, soon picked up by the Boston Globe, to have his
sentence commuted.
</P>
<P>
   His was the classic story, embraced and portrayed by the media
in endless permutations until it became the stuff of legend. Yandle
said he was at the infamous 1968 siege at Khe Sanh, surrounded and
attacked for 77 days. ``Man, I was scared to death. I still get
shaky today just thinking about it,'' Yandle told Boston Globe
columnist Mike Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   Khe Sanh was one of the war's bloodiest battles _ hundreds of
Marines were killed _ but the only killing Yandle was intimately
familiar with was the June 1972 slaying of 65-year-old shopkeeper
Joseph Reppucci in a Boston liquor store.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yandle and veterans groups convinced the Globe and,
later, Mike Wallace of the CBS News program ``60 Minutes'' and
then-Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, that Yandle was fit to be
released. Prompted by the support of the Vietnam Veterans of
America, Weld recommended Yandle's release, and in October 1995,
after 23 years behind bars, Yandle walked free.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted about three years. In the spring of 1998, Burkett
managed to convince Wallace and others that Yandle was a fake.
Yandle apologized publicly and was returned to prison.
</P>
<P>
   For years, before the Yandle campaign and during it, Burkett had
been quietly doing research for a book on phony Vietnam veterans.
He had seen the occasional stories about Yandle and, unlike others
looking into the saga, he had obtained copies of Yandle's military
records from the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett was able to prove that Yandle had never been in combat.
In fact, he had been assigned as a supply clerk in a Marine brigade
on Okinawa, Japan. He wasn't even sent overseas until September
1968, six months after the Khe Sanh siege was over.
</P>
<P>
   All this relentless research burbles up in Burkett's 692-page
book, ``Stolen Valor,'' which he wound up having to publish himself
(Verity Press, at its Web site of www.stolenvalor.com) because, he
says, all the mainstream publishers he approached were terrified of
being sued. To date, he says (and a check of court records appears
to confirm it), nobody has sued him over the book. Small wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, who served as an Army lieutenant in Vietnam during the
war _ he stresses he was no hero and simply did his job as an
ordnance officer _ has investigated more than 2,000 cases and found
that some 1,500 were frauds on either a large or a small scale.
Some men were never in the service, many were in the armed forces
but never left the United States or never got the medals they
claimed, and a few were in Southeast Asia but were far from any of
the hot spots in Vietnam, where the war killed more than 58,000
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Burkett helped an Oregon newspaper uncover Republican
U.S. Rep. Wes Cooley's false claims of Army service in the Korean
War. Burkett also exposed actor Brian Dennehy's phony claims, in
various interviews, of having been wounded as a Marine in Vietnam.
Records showed the actor had spent his 1959-63 stint as a peacetime
Marine, playing football for the Corps on Okinawa. Dennehy later
gave a public apology.
</P>
<P>
   Lest Burkett sound like some wild-eyed zealot, seeking phonies
at every turn of a Memorial Day parade, he likes to point out that
he fell into this avocation by accident and, now that his book is
out, wonders how much longer he is going to be called upon as the
nation's expert in tracking down military records. (He is in
constant demand as a speaker and recently gave a seminar to
wide-eyed FBI agents who apparently had had little experience
rummaging through the labyrinth of decades-old military records.)
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Burkett has picked up a few enemies: ``There had
been some threats, and the brokers and secretaries were afraid of
being killed, so they moved me way down the hall to this office.''
But his fans think he's on to something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jug Burkett is doing something truly from the heart
and something that is truly important,'' says Vietnam veteran James
Webb, author of the Vietnam War novel ``Fields of Fire'' and a
former secretary of the Navy. ``What he is trying to do, at
considerable risk to himself, is to say that this service means
something, and by letting just anyone stand up and claim these
honors, you're diminishing the real value of those who did serve.''
</P>
<P>
   In the military, the book has become something of a cult
classic, according to Army Capt. Robert Bateman, who teaches
military history at West Point. For years, there had been tales in
the Army of ``wannabes and fakers,'' Bateman said, ``something that
a lot of veterans knew, but it was usually anecdotal. Now, with
this book, we have the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett's quest for that evidence started in 1986, when he was
asked to help raise funds from private donors for the Texas Vietnam
Veterans Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so difficult. The universal attitude was, `Why should
we give money for these bums?' That came from everybody. `Vietnam
veterans? Aren't those the guys who are unemployed and on drugs?
Aren't those the guys who lost the war?' It was endless,'' he says.
``I'd say, `Well, I'm a Vietnam veteran,' and they'd say, `but you
seem so normal.'''
</P>
<P>
   By fits and starts, Burkett learned how to investigate. His
first stop was the U.S. Department of Labor, where an economist
dredged up some figures showing that Vietnam veterans, as a group,
had the lowest unemployment rate in the nation of any group listed
in the department's tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every statistical category that we looked at,'' he says,
``Vietnam veterans were superlative _ their desertion and court
martial rates were much lower (than in prior wars) _ and when I
started looking at individual cases, I'd find vets who were
valedictorians or football stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after years of scrambling for money, Burkett's group
got their memorial. But at the dedication ceremony, despite the
hundreds of ``normal-looking'' vets in the audience _ suits,
jackets, neckties on some _ the television news teams immediately
gravitated toward ``the guys in fatigues and boony hats, the
bearded bums. Very few of those guys were real veterans, but it's
automatic and it's photogenic. Nothing had changed, and I saw that
the damned press and the public believes this bull_. So now I had a
purpose and a system and I decided I was going to create a book, so
I started researching the gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett candidly admits he's not a writer. So he found, in his
own backyard, Glenna Whitley, a veteran journalist and senior
editor at D, a monthly magazine about Dallas and Fort Worth. The
project, it would turn out, had a profound effect on her.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people who had never served in the military _ a
growing number in this country, given that the draft ended on June
30, 1973 _ Whitley had only a vague and disconnected notion of a
war in Southeast Asia that was tearing the nation apart when she
was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   Researching the book made her spend time, she said, ``with the
real citations _ learning about a man who received the
Distinguished Service Cross at the cost of his life, and finding
out that some phony had modeled his citation on that one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was real people dying real deaths. And they've been
tarred and feathered by this terrible image of what's come out of
the Vietnam War.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitley, 43, is of a generation that, as she said, learned about
the war largely through their TV sets. People younger than Whitley
have, for the most part, only the faintest of clues when it comes
to understanding the military, and they don't really care about it
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons, Burkett and others say, is that the
``homeless vet'' you see begging on the street may well be a fake,
and he's spreading the widely publicized lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who always hit me up on the streets, I ask them,
`What was your MOS?' (military occupational specialty),'' says
Charles Moskos, a Northwestern University professor who specializes
in military sociology. ``They give me a blank look.''
</P>
<P>
   Moskos, now 65, comes from a 1950s generation of young men to
whom military service was a given. Of the 750 people in his
graduating class at Princeton, he says 500 went into the service.
(He was drafted into the Army and did his hitch as a combat
engineer in peacetime Germany.) Last year, he said, 12 Princeton
seniors went into the service.
</P>
<P>
   As for Burkett, he still gets calls from cops seeking advice on
how to run records, or even from skeptical wives and girlfriends
who suspect their men may be playing a bit loose with the truth
about their exploits in ``the 'Nam.'' But he'd like it if some of
this eased up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people think I'm obsessed, but I'm not,'' he says,
shortly before rushing off to the Xerox machine to make copies of a
sheaf of military records. ``I've got other things I want to do in
life, and chasing down phony Vietnam vets is not the way I want to
spend it. I had something I wanted to say, but I can't continue
being the enforcer of this thing around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, maybe I'll do a book on all the heroes of
Vietnam. Who knows? Probably wouldn't sell more than 2,000.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES &AMP; SHORT STORIES: Hungary for capitalism
 &HT;    (Eds: Eighth in a series. Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe
Murray reported from Eastern Europe during a visit 10 years ago,
just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. This summer he returned to
write about the changes that have led three former Eastern Bloc
countries _ Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland _ to become the
newest members of NATO. At the end of the series, CoxNet will
compile some of these columns into our weekly Focus page, good for
running as a Perspective-type page or op-ed feature.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ The day I arrived the Goodyear blimp was flying
overhead. A nice change from having to fly red banners, as required
in the bad old days of communism.
</P>
<P>
   When I was here 10 years ago, Hungary had already squeezed out
of the grip of Soviet rule, had opened its borders with Austria and
was tumbling the giant statues of Lenin and other communist
demi-gods.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, the statues are still around, some 40 of
them that have been gathered together at Statue Park on the edge of
the city, gigantic memorials that serve as grim, granite reminders
of the era of totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that now they're standing their ground for
capitalism, Statue Park being a privately owned, money-making
concern that profits through paid admissions.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Hungary has taken to the free-market economy in
every way that it can.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other former Soviet bloc countries, Hungarians
didn't lose the will to work during the years of communism, and
it's not unusual for individuals to hold two and three jobs.
</P>
<P>
   With average income at about $1,000 a month, that's what it
takes to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't yet gotten the hang of customer service. If you
walk into a shop and look around, see nothing that you want and
start to leave without making a purchase, whatever it is that the
clerk is muttering in Hungarian, you can bet it isn't, ``Have a
nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   English is prevalent here but German remains the second language
of Hungary, bordering as it does with Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary has different neighbors in every direction: Slovakia to
the north, Ukraine to the northeast, Romania to the east,
Yugoslavia, Croatia and Solvenia to the south, along with Austria
to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there's a bit of Hungary in every adjoining country,
having had much of its territory taken away after World War I.
That's why you'll find Hungarian minorities throughout Central and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For minorities inside Hungary, there are the Romas _ what we
call Gypsies. Everybody has to dislike somebody, and the Hungarians
have the Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   A not-uncommon attitude: ``I'm not a racist. I just hate
Romas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ongoing question: Whether it would be better to segregate Roma
children and educate them separately.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought the world was safe for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Education is highly prized here. It's their version of the class
system, to the point that Hungarians don't always recognize the
importance of experience in the field. Given the choice of getting
an advanced degree or advancing in their present job, they'll
choose the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary invented the Rubik's Cube. Most people don't know that.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary claims Dracula as one of theirs as well, never mind what
the Romanians say. Transylvania was once a part of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Note of caution: When hungry in Hungary, don't order the
Transylvania mixed grill, not if you're looking for a light repast.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pancake-like stack of fried meat, no telling what, topped
off with a generously thick filet of pure hog fat, grilled to a
golden brown. Evidently, there is no Hungarian word for
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out with whom you drink, too.
</P>
<P>
   One of the favorite scams is for a couple of attractive young
women to approach a male tourist and suggest that they step into a
nearby bar to have a few drinks and see what happens next.
</P>
<P>
   After any number of rounds, what happens is that the women
disappear and you find you're stuck with an inflated bar bill that
may amount to as much as $500.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, you're being escorted to a nearby ATM
machine by a burly bartender who will tell you with a straight face
_ not counting his broken nose _ that those women were strangers to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies, no doubt.

TEENAGER GRABS TWO-SHOT PGA LEAD

<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Against a backdrop of adult millionaires
squabbling over an issue that everyone agrees should not have been
made public, leave it to a teenager to put up a round of golf that
everyone feels was not possible.
</P>
<P>
   After all, wasn't Sergio Garcia still shellshocked from his
British Open debacle? Wasn't he sporting so many wounds from that
89-83 beating that he would barely find his way around this
7,401-yard beast called Medinah Country Club?
</P>
<P>
   If so, nobody told El Nino, the 19-year-old Spaniard who
reminded everyone at the opening round of the 81st PGA Championship
that golf is the main meal here, that the Ryder Cup controversy is
only table whine. Garcia made the turn at 2 under par, shaved
strokes at the 11th, 14th, and 15th, then closed out a brilliant,
course record-tying 6-under 66 with a 4-foot birdie putt at 18 to
take a two-shot lead over a trio of competitors _ 45-year-old Jay
Haas, lefthander Mike Weir, and unheralded J.P. Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Play was suspended at 7:57 (CST) with 15 players still on the
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I showed that the British Open was a mistake,'' said
Garcia, the youngest player to lead this championship since it
switched to stroke play in 1958. ``Hopefully you won't ask me
anymore about the British Open.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, request granted. Never heard of Carnoustie. Tell us about
Medinah.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia smiled widely, perhaps the first bright face seen during
this week of pay-for-play pettiness. ``I just played great, hit a
lot of fairways, a lot of greens, and made a couple putts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A simple plan that Garcia followed splendidly, but some others
had it down pretty well, too, as steady rain throughout the day _
there was a 47-minute delay late in the afternoon due to lightning
_ softened greens that had been thought to be erratic. Instead,
they rolled nicely and were inviting.
</P>
<P>
   And Haas, a quiet, unassuming man who has been on the PGA Tour
for more years (22) than Garcia has been on earth, was the first to
accept the invitation. Off in the sixth group, he birdied the
opening hole, made the turn in 35, then made four birdies coming
home to shoot 68.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' said Haas, ``you just don't get that many
opportunities in major championships. I have to think that I can
still compete out here. At times I can.''
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Haas was joined at 68 by the pride of
Sarnia, Ont. _ Weir _ and Hayes made it three by early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A four-player group at 3-under 69 consists of two men who honed
their talents in Japan (Brian Watts and Brandt Jobe), one who
followed in the shadows of David Duval at Georgia Tech (Stewart
Cink), and a last-minute replacement who got the call as he sat in
the fitness trailer (Jerry Kelly, via the University of Hartford).
</P>
<P>
   Also at 3 under, though he will have to resume at the 16th tee
this morning at 8:45, is a player who perhaps should be held up as
a Ryder Cup poster boy in this tenuous time of badwill (Corey
Pavin).
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, back in 1991-95, Pavin's short-drive,
big-heart game served as a blueprint for US Ryder Cuppers, but as
this major championship has been overshadowed by one testy press
conference after another, so, too, has the spirit of that biennial
competition been battered.
</P>
<P>
   The marquee American names were not asked about their rounds as
they completed the opening 18. They were asked to resume this
nonsense of ``He Said, He Said.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is too bad because there were some good efforts turned in.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably by Duval, who opened with a birdie, survived a
bogey-bogey stumble at Nos. 15 and 16, and shot 70. Ironically, it
was the same score shot by two of his colleagues in this Ryder Cup
controversy _ Tiger Woods and Tom Lehman _ as 14 players posted
2-under totals. One was 54-year-old Hale Irwin, who showed that he
is playing on more than just memories of his US Open victory here
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Senior Tour's best player bogeyed the 18th hole to put a
damper on the three birdies he had made, then stepped to the side
and watched his playing partner, Garcia, convert his sixth birdie
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' quipped Irwin to reporters, ``I didn't intimidate
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Hale. Though your resume is a monster in achievement, it
doesn't measure up to a monster called Carnoustie. And if that
diabolical place could not shake the spirit of this Young Man Who
Would Be Seve, then nothing can.
</P>
<P>
   For which observers of this somber event should be thankful. It
was, after all, a performance that helped put golf back into a golf
tournament.

CHELSEA'S ROCKY ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE; BILL'S CONFESSION  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
   (PLEASE NOTE: The following book excerpt _ one of three from the
No. 1 New York Times best seller ``Bill and Hillary: The
Marriage,'' by Christopher Anderson _ is available for oneshot
purchase from The New York Times Syndicate. For purchase
information, contact sales executive Debra Weydert by phone, (732)
390-4480, or fax, (732) 390-4697. This article has been transmitted
twice _ into the ``a'' general news and ``l'' lifestyle files.)  
 &HT;    
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chelsea brushed her newly permed hair away from her face, then
turned to wave goodbye to her mother before leaving the White House
to spend the evening with friends.
 &HT;    Hillary Rodham Clinton smiled back bravely. ``Have fun,'' the
first lady said wanly as the Stanford coed, shadowed by her
ever-present Secret Service detail, stepped into the elevator that
would take her downstairs to a waiting bulletproof sedan.
 &HT;    There was some comfort in having Chelsea home from Stanford
University for the summer. Although a continent apart, the two
women had nonetheless been riding the same emotional roller coaster
for the better part of seven months _ seven months during which the
most important man in their lives swore to them and to the country
that he had never had sexual relations with a 22-year-old White
House intern named Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    At Stanford, the curtain around the first daughter had been
drawn tightly. No fewer than 23 Secret Service agents, most chosen
for their youthful appearance so they could blend in with the
Stanford student body, zealously guarded Chelsea's privacy.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, Hillary had called her daughter every
other day to try to boost her spirits and reassure her that none of
the stories about her father was true.
 &HT;    It was nothing new to Chelsea; for as long as she could
remember, she was taught that the world was divided into two camps:
those who adored her father and those who wanted to destroy him.
 &HT;    The indoctrination of Chelsea Clinton had begun in earnest when
she was only 6 years old. Before then, safe within the confines of
the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Hillary could ``monitor''
whatever the little girl saw or heard about her father.
 &HT;    But once she reached school age and learned to read, the
Clintons took steps to prepare Chelsea so, in Hillary's words, she
would ``not be surprised or overwhelmed if she heard someone say
something nasty about her father.''
 &HT;    Daddy was going to run for governor again, Hillary announced one
night over dinner.
 &HT;    ``If he wins,'' she told a wide-eyed Chelsea, ``we could keep
living in this house ...''
 &HT;    But first, she went on, there would be a campaign during which
Daddy's enemies might say ``terrible things'' about him. ``They
might even lie,'' she went on, ``just so people will vote for them
instead of Daddy.''
 &HT;    Hillary later recalled that Chelsea ``struggled'' with the idea
that a politician might lie.
 &HT;    ``Why would they do that?'' she asked again and again.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' Hillary said. ``Why don't we play a
game. You be Daddy and tell me why we should vote for you for
governor.''
 &HT;    Chelsea paused for a moment before suddenly turning serious.
 &HT;    ``I'm Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``I've done a good job and I've
helped a lot of people. Please vote for me.''
 &HT;    Pleased with herself, Chelsea waited for her parents to shower
her with praise. Instead, her father leaned forward, scowled and
wagged a bony finger in her face.
 &HT;    ``Well, Bill Clinton,'' he said. ``I think you have done a lousy
job. You've raised taxes, and you haven't helped people at all.
Why, you are a very mean man, and I am NOT voting for the likes of
YOU.''
 &HT;    With that Chelsea dissolved into tears.
 &HT;    ``Why would anybody say things like that?'' she wanted to know.
 &HT;    Her tears aside, this strange drill continued over the dinner
table for weeks. Like two lawyers playing devil's advocate to
prepare their star witness for cross-examination, Bill and Hillary
peppered Chelsea with questions and insults until she was numb.
 &HT;    ``Our role-playing,'' Hillary would later explain, ``helped
Chelsea to experience, in the privacy of our own home, the feelings
of any person who sees someone she loves being personally
attacked.''
 &HT;    But in the end there was no way to shield a teen-age Chelsea
from the endless stream of sordid revelations that threatened her
father's presidency and, more important, her parents' marriage.
 &HT;    On May 19, 1998, she collapsed with severe stomach pains and was
rushed to the campus hospital. After a battery of tests ruled out
appendicitis, ulcers or pelvic inflammatory disease, doctors came
to the inevitable conclusion that the pains were brought on by
stress.
 &HT;    Aware that any sign of doubt or weakness on Chelsea's part might
undermine the first family's business-as-usual profile, the White
House issued a press release claiming Chelsea was simply suffering
from the flu. Over the next few months, Chelsea would be rushed to
the hospital suffering from stress-induced stomach pains at least
three more times.
 &HT;    When she returned to the White House in June, Chelsea was
stunned to discover that she too, like the public, had been fooled
by her parents' display of unity. Hillary was not only giving her
husband the silent treatment, she was refusing to cooperate in
shaping his defense.
 &HT;    Amid reports of oral sex in the Oval Office and Monica
Lewinsky's semen-stained blue Gap dress that surfaced in July,
Chelsea sided with her mother. And like the first lady, Chelsea now
refused to speak to her father at all.
 &HT;    .....
 &HT;    On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Bill made the long and lonely journey
from the Oval Office to Hillary's bedroom. There was no longer any
way he could keep the truth from her. It had all been true.
 &HT;    Although he still insisted that he had never actually had sex
with Lewinsky _ according to Clinton's definition sex meant only
intercourse _ he had crossed the line. Bill would not go into the
details, but he admitted that he had lied all along.
 &HT;    As the first lady sat on the edge of her bed in stunned silence,
the president of the United States got down on his knees and,
weeping, begged her forgiveness.
 &HT;    Much of what transpired next between Bill and Hillary Clinton
was plainly audible to Secret Service agents and household staff
members down the hall.
 &HT;    In the past, Hillary had thrown books and an ashtray at the
president _ both hitting their mark. This time, he would later tell
one of his oldest political confidants, Hillary rose to her feet
and slapped him across the face _ hard enough to leave a red mark
that would be clearly visible to Secret Service agents when he left
the room.
 &HT;    ``You stupid, stupid, stupid bastard,'' Hillary shouted.
 &HT;    Her words, delivered at the shrill, earsplitting level that had
become familiar to White House personnel over the years, ricocheted
down the corridor. ``My God, Bill, how could you risk everything
for that?''
 &HT;    But it was not in the nature of Bill Clinton to remain silent in
the face of his wife's fury. He fought back, loudly arguing, as he
would to the grand jury, that he had not slept with Monica Lewinsky
and therefore had not committed adultery. What he did with Monica
Lewinsky _ including fellatio, fondling and phone sex _ was not, by
Clinton's narrow definition, sexual activity.
 &HT;    ``I did not lie to you about that!'' he could be heard shouting
through the door. ``I said I didn't have sex with that woman, and I
didn't!''
 &HT;    The screaming continued for a few moments, and then seemed to
end as abruptly as it had begun. Spent emotionally and physically,
Hillary sank back onto the bed. ``How,'' she asked numbly, ``are we
going to tell Chelsea?''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chelsea brushed her newly permed hair away from her face, then
turned to wave goodbye to her mother before leaving the White House
to spend the evening with friends.
 &HT;    Hillary Rodham Clinton smiled back bravely. ``Have fun,'' the
first lady said wanly as the Stanford coed, shadowed by her
ever-present Secret Service detail, stepped into the elevator that
would take her downstairs to a waiting bulletproof sedan.
 &HT;    There was some comfort in having Chelsea home from Stanford
University for the summer. Although a continent apart, the two
women had nonetheless been riding the same emotional roller coaster
for the better part of seven months _ seven months during which the
most important man in their lives swore to them and to the country
that he had never had sexual relations with a 22-year-old White
House intern named Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    At Stanford, the curtain around the first daughter had been
drawn tightly. No fewer than 23 Secret Service agents, most chosen
for their youthful appearance so they could blend in with the
Stanford student body, zealously guarded Chelsea's privacy.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, Hillary had called her daughter every
other day to try to boost her spirits and reassure her that none of
the stories about her father was true.
 &HT;    It was nothing new to Chelsea; for as long as she could
remember, she was taught that the world was divided into two camps:
those who adored her father and those who wanted to destroy him.
 &HT;    The indoctrination of Chelsea Clinton had begun in earnest when
she was only 6 years old. Before then, safe within the confines of
the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Hillary could ``monitor''
whatever the little girl saw or heard about her father.
 &HT;    But once she reached school age and learned to read, the
Clintons took steps to prepare Chelsea so, in Hillary's words, she
would ``not be surprised or overwhelmed if she heard someone say
something nasty about her father.''
 &HT;    Daddy was going to run for governor again, Hillary announced one
night over dinner.
 &HT;    ``If he wins,'' she told a wide-eyed Chelsea, ``we could keep
living in this house ...''
 &HT;    But first, she went on, there would be a campaign during which
Daddy's enemies might say ``terrible things'' about him. ``They
might even lie,'' she went on, ``just so people will vote for them
instead of Daddy.''
 &HT;    Hillary later recalled that Chelsea ``struggled'' with the idea
that a politician might lie.
 &HT;    ``Why would they do that?'' she asked again and again.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' Hillary said. ``Why don't we play a
game. You be Daddy and tell me why we should vote for you for
governor.''
 &HT;    Chelsea paused for a moment before suddenly turning serious.
 &HT;    ``I'm Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``I've done a good job and I've
helped a lot of people. Please vote for me.''
 &HT;    Pleased with herself, Chelsea waited for her parents to shower
her with praise. Instead, her father leaned forward, scowled and
wagged a bony finger in her face.
 &HT;    ``Well, Bill Clinton,'' he said. ``I think you have done a lousy
job. You've raised taxes, and you haven't helped people at all.
Why, you are a very mean man, and I am NOT voting for the likes of
YOU.''
 &HT;    With that Chelsea dissolved into tears.
 &HT;    ``Why would anybody say things like that?'' she wanted to know.
 &HT;    Her tears aside, this strange drill continued over the dinner
table for weeks. Like two lawyers playing devil's advocate to
prepare their star witness for cross-examination, Bill and Hillary
peppered Chelsea with questions and insults until she was numb.
 &HT;    ``Our role-playing,'' Hillary would later explain, ``helped
Chelsea to experience, in the privacy of our own home, the feelings
of any person who sees someone she loves being personally
attacked.''
 &HT;    But in the end there was no way to shield a teen-age Chelsea
from the endless stream of sordid revelations that threatened her
father's presidency and, more important, her parents' marriage.
 &HT;    On May 19, 1998, she collapsed with severe stomach pains and was
rushed to the campus hospital. After a battery of tests ruled out
appendicitis, ulcers or pelvic inflammatory disease, doctors came
to the inevitable conclusion that the pains were brought on by
stress.
 &HT;    Aware that any sign of doubt or weakness on Chelsea's part might
undermine the first family's business-as-usual profile, the White
House issued a press release claiming Chelsea was simply suffering
from the flu. Over the next few months, Chelsea would be rushed to
the hospital suffering from stress-induced stomach pains at least
three more times.
 &HT;    When she returned to the White House in June, Chelsea was
stunned to discover that she too, like the public, had been fooled
by her parents' display of unity. Hillary was not only giving her
husband the silent treatment, she was refusing to cooperate in
shaping his defense.
 &HT;    Amid reports of oral sex in the Oval Office and Monica
Lewinsky's semen-stained blue Gap dress that surfaced in July,
Chelsea sided with her mother. And like the first lady, Chelsea now
refused to speak to her father at all.
 &HT;    .....
 &HT;    On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Bill made the long and lonely journey
from the Oval Office to Hillary's bedroom. There was no longer any
way he could keep the truth from her. It had all been true.
 &HT;    Although he still insisted that he had never actually had sex
with Lewinsky _ according to Clinton's definition sex meant only
intercourse _ he had crossed the line. Bill would not go into the
details, but he admitted that he had lied all along.
 &HT;    As the first lady sat on the edge of her bed in stunned silence,
the president of the United States got down on his knees and,
weeping, begged her forgiveness.
 &HT;    Much of what transpired next between Bill and Hillary Clinton
was plainly audible to Secret Service agents and household staff
members down the hall.
 &HT;    In the past, Hillary had thrown books and an ashtray at the
president _ both hitting their mark. This time, he would later tell
one of his oldest political confidants, Hillary rose to her feet
and slapped him across the face _ hard enough to leave a red mark
that would be clearly visible to Secret Service agents when he left
the room.
 &HT;    ``You stupid, stupid, stupid bastard,'' Hillary shouted.
 &HT;    Her words, delivered at the shrill, earsplitting level that had
become familiar to White House personnel over the years, ricocheted
down the corridor. ``My God, Bill, how could you risk everything
for that?''
 &HT;    But it was not in the nature of Bill Clinton to remain silent in
the face of his wife's fury. He fought back, loudly arguing, as he
would to the grand jury, that he had not slept with Monica Lewinsky
and therefore had not committed adultery. What he did with Monica
Lewinsky _ including fellatio, fondling and phone sex _ was not, by
Clinton's narrow definition, sexual activity.
 &HT;    ``I did not lie to you about that!'' he could be heard shouting
through the door. ``I said I didn't have sex with that woman, and I
didn't!''
 &HT;    The screaming continued for a few moments, and then seemed to
end as abruptly as it had begun. Spent emotionally and physically,
Hillary sank back onto the bed. ``How,'' she asked numbly, ``are we
going to tell Chelsea?''

 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He was an adulterer and a liar, they were saying. And worse: a
fool. In the face of rumors that he had been unfaithful to his
wife, the charismatic young Democratic front-runner with the
Kennedy smile angrily denied the gossip, and to prove he was
innocent dared the press to shadow his every move.
 &HT;    The Miami Herald did just that, and in a matter of days reported
that a young woman other than the candidate's wife had spent the
weekend at his home. Confronted with photographs of himself and a
young blonde named Donna Rice cavorting aboard the aptly named
yacht Monkey Business, Gary Hart announced on May 7, 1987, that he
was withdrawing from the race for the presidency.
 &HT;    It was no small irony that with Hart out of the picture, more
pressure was put on Bill Clinton to run _ despite the fact that, in
the words of one Clinton advisor, ``Bill made Hart look like Billy
Graham.''
 &HT;    To further compound the irony, Hillary, backed by Dick Morris,
was pushing hardest for Bill to fulfill his dream and run for the
presidency. Hillary had been clearly energized by the prospect of
Bill's becoming the youngest president in history _ younger even
than his idol JFK.
 &HT;    Only 10 days after Hart's withdrawal, Bill sought advice from
another source: his childhood friend and lover Dolly Kyle Browning.
 &HT;    During yet another tryst, this time at the Hyatt Hotel at
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, Dolly broached the subject of her own
sexual addiction _ and Bill's _ for the first time.
 &HT;    ``At first Billy denied it,'' she recalled. ``He just didn't see
how a person could be `addicted' to sex. But then when I asked why
he felt compelled to have sex, if sometimes he wanted to get away
from his partner right after having sex, if his extramarital sex
was affecting his sex life with `The Warden,' if sex was in any way
jeopardizing his career _ then he understood.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, it was that last question concerning the
impact on his career that Bill found most intriguing. When he told
Dolly that he was being pressured to run for president, she
cautioned him that a run against Republican Vice-President George
Bush could be ``suicide.'' She added, ``There's entirely too much
trash in your recent past.''
 &HT;    ``Like what?'' he answered without hesitating.
 &HT;    ``Bill, please,'' she said. ``Be serious. Look where you are
right now ... Get real.''
 &HT;    According to Dick Morris, the political demise of Gary Hart had
filled Bill with ``a tremendous terror.'' That spring and early
summer, Clinton contacted a number of friends and political
contacts throughout the country and casually brought up sex as a
campaign issue. What was the American public willing to tolerate?
Was adultery, if proven, an insurmountable obstacle to getting
elected?
 &HT;    At one point, he even grilled Arkansas Gazette editor John
Robert Starr _ the man who popularized the term ``Slick Willie'' _
on the ``Gary Hart Factor.''
 &HT;    ``Well, you haven't done anything like that, have you?'' Starr
asked Bill.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have.''
 &HT;    Starr was stunned. ``You mean,'' he said, ``since you've been
married to Hillary?''
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' Bill replied. ``Do you want to know about it?''
 &HT;    ``It,'' Starr thought. ``Do you want to know about it? And I,''
he recalled, ``to my eternal regret, said no.''
 &HT;    Betsey Wright wasn't hopeful about Bill's chances for surviving
a presidential run in 1988. She conducted an investigation of her
own, ferreting out the names of the women Bill was alleged to have
been involved with.
 &HT;    Once she had assembled a dossier on Bill's rumored affairs,
Wright sat him down in her living room. Before they went over each
name, she begged him to tell her the whole truth _ ``I've got to
know the truth, Bill'' _ about his relationship with each woman.
 &HT;    There were at least a dozen women on the list, including
Gennifer Flowers, Dolly Kyle Browning, Juanita Broaddrick, Susan
McDougal, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Deborah Mathis and former
Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen. He did not tell Wright about
the countless one-night stands or the hookers.
 &HT;    They then ran down the list a second time, to determine which of
the women he had had affairs with might talk to the press.
 &HT;    When it was over, Wright concluded that he should not run _ if
for no other reason than to spare his wife and daughter.
 &HT;    Convincing Bill was one thing. But when Hillary discovered
Betsey Wright had talked her husband out of running that year, she
accused the governor's chief of staff of overstepping her bounds.
Hillary pressed her for details, but Wright would only say that
Bill had in fact been ``seeing'' other women _ lots of other women.
 &HT;    ``Hillary,'' she said, ``he admitted it.''
 &HT;    But what Wright did not know was that five years earlier Hillary
had hired private investigator Ivan Duda to trail her husband. Back
then, on the eve of Bill's 1982 comeback election as governor, Duda
had come up with a list of eight women he had been sneaking away to
meet at all hours of the day and night. Of the eight, she accepted
the fact that Bill was probably sleeping with Dolly Kyle Browning
and Gennifer Flowers.
 &HT;    Wright could not have anticipated Hillary's response. Rather
than expressing anger at her husband, she looked at Wright and
asked, ``Who is going to find out? These women are all trash.
Nobody is going to believe them.''
 &HT;    But Wright stood her ground, insisting that the risk was too
great in the wake of the Gary Hart Monkey Business scandal.
 &HT;    ``Now is not the time,'' Wright said. ``The climate is all
wrong. Bush is too strong. Bill has got to wait until next time
...''
 &HT;    On July 15, the ballroom at Little Rock's Excelsior Hotel was
filled with reporters, camera crews, and political supporters
waiting to hear Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton announce his
candidacy for president.
 &HT;    Instead Bill walked to the podium and, with Hillary at his side
fighting back tears, dropped a bombshell.
 &HT;    ``I need some family time, I need some personal time,'' he
explained. ``Politicians are people too. I think sometimes we
forget it, but they really are. The only thing I or any other
candidate has to offer in running for president is what's inside.
That's what sets people on fire and gets their confidence and their
votes, whether they live in Wisconsin or Montana or New York. That
part of my life needs renewal.
 &HT;    ``The other, even more important reason for my decision is the
certain impact that this campaign would have had on our daughter
... I've seen a lot of kids grow up under these pressures and a
long, long time ago I made a promise to myself that if I was ever
lucky enough to have a child, she would never grow up wondering who
her father was.''
 &HT;    Bill conceded that it had been a painful decision. ``You know,''
he said to his friend Max Brantley, ``is there a point in a
person's life, a political person's life, when the things you've
done in the past are forgotten?''
 &HT;    While her husband waxed remorseful in private, Hillary fumed. It
was not so much that her husband had been unfaithful _ this had
always been a painful but bearable part of their life together _
but that, for the time being at least, his adultery had cost them
their dream.

Marriage,'' by Christopher Anderson _ is available for oneshot

information, contact sales executive Debra Weydert by phone, (732)

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chelsea brushed her newly permed hair away from her face, then
turned to wave goodbye to her mother before leaving the White House
to spend the evening with friends.
 &HT;    Hillary Rodham Clinton smiled back bravely. ``Have fun,'' the
first lady said wanly as the Stanford coed, shadowed by her
ever-present Secret Service detail, stepped into the elevator that
would take her downstairs to a waiting bulletproof sedan.
 &HT;    There was some comfort in having Chelsea home from Stanford
University for the summer. Although a continent apart, the two
women had nonetheless been riding the same emotional roller coaster
for the better part of seven months _ seven months during which the
most important man in their lives swore to them and to the country
that he had never had sexual relations with a 22-year-old White
House intern named Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    At Stanford, the curtain around the first daughter had been
drawn tightly. No fewer than 23 Secret Service agents, most chosen
for their youthful appearance so they could blend in with the
Stanford student body, zealously guarded Chelsea's privacy.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, Hillary had called her daughter every
other day to try to boost her spirits and reassure her that none of
the stories about her father was true.
 &HT;    It was nothing new to Chelsea; for as long as she could
remember, she was taught that the world was divided into two camps:
those who adored her father and those who wanted to destroy him.
 &HT;    The indoctrination of Chelsea Clinton had begun in earnest when
she was only 6 years old. Before then, safe within the confines of
the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Hillary could ``monitor''
whatever the little girl saw or heard about her father.
 &HT;    But once she reached school age and learned to read, the
Clintons took steps to prepare Chelsea so, in Hillary's words, she
would ``not be surprised or overwhelmed if she heard someone say
something nasty about her father.''
 &HT;    Daddy was going to run for governor again, Hillary announced one
night over dinner.
 &HT;    ``If he wins,'' she told a wide-eyed Chelsea, ``we could keep
living in this house ...''
 &HT;    But first, she went on, there would be a campaign during which
Daddy's enemies might say ``terrible things'' about him. ``They
might even lie,'' she went on, ``just so people will vote for them
instead of Daddy.''
 &HT;    Hillary later recalled that Chelsea ``struggled'' with the idea
that a politician might lie.
 &HT;    ``Why would they do that?'' she asked again and again.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' Hillary said. ``Why don't we play a
game. You be Daddy and tell me why we should vote for you for
governor.''
 &HT;    Chelsea paused for a moment before suddenly turning serious.
 &HT;    ``I'm Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``I've done a good job and I've
helped a lot of people. Please vote for me.''
 &HT;    Pleased with herself, Chelsea waited for her parents to shower
her with praise. Instead, her father leaned forward, scowled and
wagged a bony finger in her face.
 &HT;    ``Well, Bill Clinton,'' he said. ``I think you have done a lousy
job. You've raised taxes, and you haven't helped people at all.
Why, you are a very mean man, and I am NOT voting for the likes of
YOU.''
 &HT;    With that Chelsea dissolved into tears.
 &HT;    ``Why would anybody say things like that?'' she wanted to know.
 &HT;    Her tears aside, this strange drill continued over the dinner
table for weeks. Like two lawyers playing devil's advocate to
prepare their star witness for cross-examination, Bill and Hillary
peppered Chelsea with questions and insults until she was numb.
 &HT;    ``Our role-playing,'' Hillary would later explain, ``helped
Chelsea to experience, in the privacy of our own home, the feelings
of any person who sees someone she loves being personally
attacked.''
 &HT;    But in the end there was no way to shield a teen-age Chelsea
from the endless stream of sordid revelations that threatened her
father's presidency and, more important, her parents' marriage.
 &HT;    On May 19, 1998, she collapsed with severe stomach pains and was
rushed to the campus hospital. After a battery of tests ruled out
appendicitis, ulcers or pelvic inflammatory disease, doctors came
to the inevitable conclusion that the pains were brought on by
stress.
 &HT;    Aware that any sign of doubt or weakness on Chelsea's part might
undermine the first family's business-as-usual profile, the White
House issued a press release claiming Chelsea was simply suffering
from the flu. Over the next few months, Chelsea would be rushed to
the hospital suffering from stress-induced stomach pains at least
three more times.
 &HT;    When she returned to the White House in June, Chelsea was
stunned to discover that she too, like the public, had been fooled
by her parents' display of unity. Hillary was not only giving her
husband the silent treatment, she was refusing to cooperate in
shaping his defense.
 &HT;    Amid reports of oral sex in the Oval Office and Monica
Lewinsky's semen-stained blue Gap dress that surfaced in July,
Chelsea sided with her mother. And like the first lady, Chelsea now
refused to speak to her father at all.
 &HT;    .....
 &HT;    On Aug. 13, a Thursday, Bill made the long and lonely journey
from the Oval Office to Hillary's bedroom. There was no longer any
way he could keep the truth from her. It had all been true.
 &HT;    Although he still insisted that he had never actually had sex
with Lewinsky _ according to Clinton's definition sex meant only
intercourse _ he had crossed the line. Bill would not go into the
details, but he admitted that he had lied all along.
 &HT;    As the first lady sat on the edge of her bed in stunned silence,
the president of the United States got down on his knees and,
weeping, begged her forgiveness.
 &HT;    Much of what transpired next between Bill and Hillary Clinton
was plainly audible to Secret Service agents and household staff
members down the hall.
 &HT;    In the past, Hillary had thrown books and an ashtray at the
president _ both hitting their mark. This time, he would later tell
one of his oldest political confidants, Hillary rose to her feet
and slapped him across the face _ hard enough to leave a red mark
that would be clearly visible to Secret Service agents when he left
the room.
 &HT;    ``You stupid, stupid, stupid bastard,'' Hillary shouted.
 &HT;    Her words, delivered at the shrill, earsplitting level that had
become familiar to White House personnel over the years, ricocheted
down the corridor. ``My God, Bill, how could you risk everything
for that?''
 &HT;    But it was not in the nature of Bill Clinton to remain silent in
the face of his wife's fury. He fought back, loudly arguing, as he
would to the grand jury, that he had not slept with Monica Lewinsky
and therefore had not committed adultery. What he did with Monica
Lewinsky _ including fellatio, fondling and phone sex _ was not, by
Clinton's narrow definition, sexual activity.
 &HT;    ``I did not lie to you about that!'' he could be heard shouting
through the door. ``I said I didn't have sex with that woman, and I
didn't!''
 &HT;    The screaming continued for a few moments, and then seemed to
end as abruptly as it had begun. Spent emotionally and physically,
Hillary sank back onto the bed. ``How,'' she asked numbly, ``are we
going to tell Chelsea?''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chelsea brushed her newly permed hair away from her face, then
turned to wave goodbye to her mother before leaving the White House
to spend the evening with friends.
 &HT;    Hillary Rodham Clinton smiled back bravely. ``Have fun,'' the
first lady said wanly as the Stanford coed, shadowed by her
ever-present Secret Service detail, stepped into the elevator that
would take her downstairs to a waiting bulletproof sedan.
 &HT;    There was some comfort in having Chelsea home from Stanford
University for the summer. Although a continent apart, the two
women had nonetheless been riding the same emotional roller coaster
for the better part of seven months _ seven months during which the
most important man in their lives swore to them and to the country
that he had never had sexual relations with a 22-year-old White
House intern named Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    At Stanford, the curtain around the first daughter had been
drawn tightly. No fewer than 23 Secret Service agents, most chosen
for their youthful appearance so they could blend in with the
Stanford student body, zealously guarded Chelsea's privacy.
 &HT;    Throughout the spring, Hillary had called her daughter every
other day to try to boost her spirits and reassure her that none of
the stories about her father was true.
 &HT;    It was nothing new to Chelsea; for as long as she could
remember, she was taught that the world was divided into two camps:
those who adored her father and those who wanted to destroy him.
 &HT;    The indoctrination of Chelsea Clinton had begun in earnest when
she was only 6 years old. Before then, safe within the confines of
the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Hillary could ``monitor''
whatever the little girl saw or heard about her father.
 &HT;    But once she reached school age and learned to read, the
Clintons took steps to prepare Chelsea so, in Hillary's words, she
would ``not be surprised or overwhelmed if she heard someone say
something nasty about her father.''
 &HT;    Daddy was going to run for governor again, Hillary announced one
night over dinner.
 &HT;    ``If he wins,'' she told a wide-eyed Chelsea, ``we could keep
living in this house ...''
 &HT;    But first, she went on, there would be a campaign during which
Daddy's enemies might say ``terrible things'' about him. ``They
might even lie,'' she went on, ``just so people will vote for them
instead of Daddy.''
 &HT;    Hillary later recalled that Chelsea ``struggled'' with the idea
that a politician might lie.
 &HT;    ``Why would they do that?'' she asked again and again.
 &HT;    ``I'll tell you what,'' Hillary said. ``Why don't we play a

governor.''

 &HT;    
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He was an adulterer and a liar, they were saying. And worse: a
fool. In the face of rumors that he had been unfaithful to his
wife, the charismatic young Democratic front-runner with the
Kennedy smile angrily denied the gossip, and to prove he was
innocent dared the press to shadow his every move.
 &HT;    The Miami Herald did just that, and in a matter of days reported
that a young woman other than the candidate's wife had spent the
weekend at his home. Confronted with photographs of himself and a
young blonde named Donna Rice cavorting aboard the aptly named
yacht Monkey Business, Gary Hart announced on May 7, 1987, that he
was withdrawing from the race for the presidency.
 &HT;    It was no small irony that with Hart out of the picture, more
pressure was put on Bill Clinton to run _ despite the fact that, in
the words of one Clinton advisor, ``Bill made Hart look like Billy
Graham.''
 &HT;    To further compound the irony, Hillary, backed by Dick Morris,
was pushing hardest for Bill to fulfill his dream and run for the
presidency. Hillary had been clearly energized by the prospect of
Bill's becoming the youngest president in history _ younger even
than his idol JFK.
 &HT;    Only 10 days after Hart's withdrawal, Bill sought advice from
another source: his childhood friend and lover Dolly Kyle Browning.
 &HT;    During yet another tryst, this time at the Hyatt Hotel at
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, Dolly broached the subject of her own
sexual addiction _ and Bill's _ for the first time.
 &HT;    ``At first Billy denied it,'' she recalled. ``He just didn't see
how a person could be `addicted' to sex. But then when I asked why
he felt compelled to have sex, if sometimes he wanted to get away
from his partner right after having sex, if his extramarital sex
was affecting his sex life with `The Warden,' if sex was in any way
jeopardizing his career _ then he understood.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, it was that last question concerning the
impact on his career that Bill found most intriguing. When he told
Dolly that he was being pressured to run for president, she
cautioned him that a run against Republican Vice-President George
Bush could be ``suicide.'' She added, ``There's entirely too much
trash in your recent past.''
 &HT;    ``Like what?'' he answered without hesitating.
 &HT;    ``Bill, please,'' she said. ``Be serious. Look where you are
right now ... Get real.''
 &HT;    According to Dick Morris, the political demise of Gary Hart had
filled Bill with ``a tremendous terror.'' That spring and early
summer, Clinton contacted a number of friends and political
contacts throughout the country and casually brought up sex as a
campaign issue. What was the American public willing to tolerate?
Was adultery, if proven, an insurmountable obstacle to getting
elected?
 &HT;    At one point, he even grilled Arkansas Gazette editor John
Robert Starr _ the man who popularized the term ``Slick Willie'' _
on the ``Gary Hart Factor.''
 &HT;    ``Well, you haven't done anything like that, have you?'' Starr
asked Bill.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have.''
 &HT;    Starr was stunned. ``You mean,'' he said, ``since you've been
married to Hillary?''
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' Bill replied. ``Do you want to know about it?''
 &HT;    ``It,'' Starr thought. ``Do you want to know about it? And I,''
he recalled, ``to my eternal regret, said no.''
 &HT;    Betsey Wright wasn't hopeful about Bill's chances for surviving
a presidential run in 1988. She conducted an investigation of her
own, ferreting out the names of the women Bill was alleged to have
been involved with.
 &HT;    Once she had assembled a dossier on Bill's rumored affairs,
Wright sat him down in her living room. Before they went over each
name, she begged him to tell her the whole truth _ ``I've got to
know the truth, Bill'' _ about his relationship with each woman.
 &HT;    There were at least a dozen women on the list, including
Gennifer Flowers, Dolly Kyle Browning, Juanita Broaddrick, Susan
McDougal, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Deborah Mathis and former
Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen. He did not tell Wright about
the countless one-night stands or the hookers.
 &HT;    They then ran down the list a second time, to determine which of
the women he had had affairs with might talk to the press.
 &HT;    When it was over, Wright concluded that he should not run _ if
for no other reason than to spare his wife and daughter.
 &HT;    Convincing Bill was one thing. But when Hillary discovered
Betsey Wright had talked her husband out of running that year, she
accused the governor's chief of staff of overstepping her bounds.
Hillary pressed her for details, but Wright would only say that
Bill had in fact been ``seeing'' other women _ lots of other women.
 &HT;    ``Hillary,'' she said, ``he admitted it.''
 &HT;    But what Wright did not know was that five years earlier Hillary
had hired private investigator Ivan Duda to trail her husband. Back
then, on the eve of Bill's 1982 comeback election as governor, Duda
had come up with a list of eight women he had been sneaking away to
meet at all hours of the day and night. Of the eight, she accepted
the fact that Bill was probably sleeping with Dolly Kyle Browning
and Gennifer Flowers.
 &HT;    Wright could not have anticipated Hillary's response. Rather
than expressing anger at her husband, she looked at Wright and
asked, ``Who is going to find out? These women are all trash.
Nobody is going to believe them.''
 &HT;    But Wright stood her ground, insisting that the risk was too
great in the wake of the Gary Hart Monkey Business scandal.
 &HT;    ``Now is not the time,'' Wright said. ``The climate is all
wrong. Bush is too strong. Bill has got to wait until next time
...''
 &HT;    On July 15, the ballroom at Little Rock's Excelsior Hotel was
filled with reporters, camera crews, and political supporters
waiting to hear Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton announce his
candidacy for president.
 &HT;    Instead Bill walked to the podium and, with Hillary at his side
fighting back tears, dropped a bombshell.
 &HT;    ``I need some family time, I need some personal time,'' he
explained. ``Politicians are people too. I think sometimes we
forget it, but they really are. The only thing I or any other
candidate has to offer in running for president is what's inside.
That's what sets people on fire and gets their confidence and their
votes, whether they live in Wisconsin or Montana or New York. That
part of my life needs renewal.
 &HT;    ``The other, even more important reason for my decision is the
certain impact that this campaign would have had on our daughter
... I've seen a lot of kids grow up under these pressures and a
long, long time ago I made a promise to myself that if I was ever
lucky enough to have a child, she would never grow up wondering who
her father was.''
 &HT;    Bill conceded that it had been a painful decision. ``You know,''
he said to his friend Max Brantley, ``is there a point in a
person's life, a political person's life, when the things you've
done in the past are forgotten?''
 &HT;    While her husband waxed remorseful in private, Hillary fumed. It
was not so much that her husband had been unfaithful _ this had
always been a painful but bearable part of their life together _
but that, for the time being at least, his adultery had cost them
their dream.

 &HT;    They then ran down the list a second time, to determine which of
the women he had had affairs with might talk to the press.
 &HT;    When it was over, Wright concluded that he should not run _ if
for no other reason than to spare his wife and daughter.
 &HT;    Convincing Bill was one thing. But when Hillary discovered
Betsey Wright had talked her husband out of running that year, she
accused the governor's chief of staff of overstepping her bounds.
Hillary pressed her for details, but Wright would only say that
Bill had in fact been ``seeing'' other women _ lots of other women.
 &HT;    ``Hillary,'' she said, ``he admitted it.''
 &HT;    But what Wright did not know was that five years earlier Hillary
had hired private investigator Ivan Duda to trail her husband. Back
then, on the eve of Bill's 1982 comeback election as governor, Duda
had come up with a list of eight women he had been sneaking away to
meet at all hours of the day and night. Of the eight, she accepted
the fact that Bill was probably sleeping with Dolly Kyle Browning
and Gennifer Flowers.
 &HT;    Wright could not have anticipated Hillary's response. Rather
than expressing anger at her husband, she looked at Wright and
asked, ``Who is going to find out? These women are all trash.
Nobody is going to believe them.''
 &HT;    But Wright stood her ground, insisting that the risk was too
great in the wake of the Gary Hart Monkey Business scandal.
 &HT;    ``Now is not the time,'' Wright said. ``The climate is all
wrong. Bush is too strong. Bill has got to wait until next time
...''
 &HT;    On July 15, the ballroom at Little Rock's Excelsior Hotel was
filled with reporters, camera crews, and political supporters
waiting to hear Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton announce his
candidacy for president.
 &HT;    Instead Bill walked to the podium and, with Hillary at his side
fighting back tears, dropped a bombshell.
 &HT;    ``I need some family time, I need some personal time,'' he
explained. ``Politicians are people too. I think sometimes we
forget it, but they really are. The only thing I or any other
candidate has to offer in running for president is what's inside.
That's what sets people on fire and gets their confidence and their
votes, whether they live in Wisconsin or Montana or New York. That
part of my life needs renewal.
 &HT;    ``The other, even more important reason for my decision is the
certain impact that this campaign would have had on our daughter
... I've seen a lot of kids grow up under these pressures and a
long, long time ago I made a promise to myself that if I was ever
lucky enough to have a child, she would never grow up wondering who
her father was.''
 &HT;    Bill conceded that it had been a painful decision. ``You know,''
he said to his friend Max Brantley, ``is there a point in a
person's life, a political person's life, when the things you've
done in the past are forgotten?''
 &HT;    While her husband waxed remorseful in private, Hillary fumed. It
was not so much that her husband had been unfaithful _ this had
always been a painful but bearable part of their life together _
but that, for the time being at least, his adultery had cost them
their dream.

 &HT;    Country boy consoles city
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I admit that I'm inclined to brag on my
country-gone-to-town cousin, the head honcho preacher at the big
Peachtree Road United Methodist Church in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Don Harp, better known locally as Donald Jr., grew up
like the rest of us in the south Fayette County farming community
of Inman. He chopped and picked cotton on his daddy's farm, cut
collards and turnip greens to truck to the market in Atlanta, got
up before school to milk the cow and bring in stove wood.
</P>
<P>
   If he didn't grow up to farm land tended by his family since
Indian times, we thought he might be at least a Class AA baseball
player. He was a fearless and promising catcher, even before he
went off to Young Harris College and prospered under the tutelage
of a youthful professor-coach named Zell Miller.
</P>
<P>
   After college, and a bout with polio, he spent a year farming
with his dad. On weekends when the collard crop thinned out, he
played baseball with amateur teams. ``Got me into some bad
fights,'' remembers Doug Cobb, one of his pitchers now retired from
teaching and coaching in Clayton County.
</P>
<P>
   I was apprehensive a few years ago when the Methodist hierarchy
decided to move Donald Jr. to Peachtree Road. ``Don't go,'' was my
advice. The Peachtree Road church is close kin to the elite Capital
City and Piedmont Driving clubs in Atlanta's social structure. I
thought it a perilous assignment for a country boy from Inman,
where most of us haven't worked our way up to membership in the
Griffin Moose Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get me wrong. Our family has points of pride. While we
haven't produced a governor or anyone that high up, Uncle Harry was
mayor of Fayetteville for a stretch, and so far we've never had
anyone in jail or in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I was surprised when the congregation warmed to
stories about growing up on a farm, and how a small boy was
impressed by such things as the firm but diplomatic way our
grandmother could make Uncle Russ and Uncle Harry, her bachelor
brothers-in-law, stop cussing each other when they got into
arguments while washing squash and cucumbers for the market.
</P>
<P>
   For several years I've been bragging about the success my
formerly country cousin has enjoyed in transplanting his down-home
style to citified, upscale North Atlanta. I've also pointed out
that whenever he personally served communion to Deion Sanders,
Deion almost always made two or three interceptions and ran kicks
back for touchdowns. I often mention that he performed Lewis
Grizzard's only marriage that didn't end in divorce. (I don't think
I'm necessarily compelled to add that Lewis died the next day.)
</P>
<P>
   Donald Jr. maintains a strong interest in our little Methodist
church in Inman, where his great-great-grandfather was a founder,
and where his mother played the piano every Sunday forever. When we
got a new preacher, he asked me to drive Doug Burrell up to
Peachtree Road for a get-acquainted lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The day before we were to go, we heard about the citywide
service of hope and remembrance in the wake of the Atlanta office
massacre and other killings. We called and offered to postpone, but
Donald Jr. said come ahead.
</P>
<P>
   On the way up, we dialed WSB to check traffic. Our host was
being vilified by Neal Boortz for something he'd said in his Sunday
sermon about the country having too many handguns in circulation. I
half-expected Donald Jr. to call in an offer to meet Mr. Boortz in
the parking lot, or maybe threaten to turn things over to Cousin
Kenny. Then I remembered he would naturally follow the advice of a
late and beloved Fayetteville lady who was quick to caution about
getting into what I can paraphrase as urological contests with
polecats.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, he told us his Peachtree Road church had planned its
own service for the shooting victims and their families. When Mayor
Bill Campbell heard about it, he called to ask that the service be
expanded citywide. Television and all the news agencies were
coming. CNN was going to carry it nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will you say?'' I asked my preacher cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm working on,'' he replied. ``It's tough. What
can you say at a time like this?''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, while I concentrated on a slice of
chocolate cake, the two preachers fell into shop talk. They were
talking about theology. ``I learned most of my theology growing up
in Inman,'' Donald Jr. told Doug Burrell. I think I know what he
meant. Basically, Inman theology says ``Do what's right, and do it
right now.'' Our grandmother said it her way. Some of our uncles
sometimes added a ``dammit'' for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   In more eloquent words, that was the Rev. Don Harp's message to
his city and to his country in Atlanta's service of hope and
remembrance, as Christian, Jew, Muslim and Hindu came together
before one God, saying the same things, even when the words were
different. Mayor Campbell said afterward that hour at Peachtree
Road can mean more to the city than the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Watching on TV, I felt a lot better about the city of Atlanta,
and the people of Atlanta, than I have in a long time. Through the
tears, we got a glimpse of a city greatly changed, and also of what
it can become.

 &HT;    Right to own guns gets harder to embrace with each attack
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Now some misfit has pumped 70 rounds into
children at a day-care center in Los Angeles. It's depressing. I
think I'll sell my guns,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' asked my friend. ``I was just thinking about going
out and buying a gun. Maybe I'll take one of those classes so I can
carry one with me everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   His reading of the latest shooting spree was that gun violence
has become so pervasive that he might need a gun to protect
himself.
</P>
<P>
   As a lifelong gun owner, I wince with every report of another
shooting spree. I've been wincing a lot lately.
</P>
<P>
   I know that America's growing anti-gun legion will use the
latest warped act of gun violence to call for more gun
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I know that guns in the right hands represent no
more threat to society than chocolate-chip cookies, I also know
that far too many wrong hands hold guns.
</P>
<P>
   Why America is experiencing a growth market in wrong hands and
guns, I don't know. I doubt that anyone knows.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and pro-gun enthusiasts hold all
guns blameless. Their solution for the escalation of gun violence
lies in the vigorous prosecution of people who use guns to commit
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, except it is fantasy to believe that the United
States will ever produce a population so law-abiding, loving and
rational that the misuse of firearms would no longer be a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Short of divine intervention, which we cannot count on, violent
and unstable criminals will always be with us.
</P>
<P>
   Vigorous prosecution of people who blast holes in their fellow
citizens is a great idea. But vigorous prosecution cannot bring
shooting victims back to life or ever make them whole again if they
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of banning guns in the United States is somewhere
between nil and none. That option is a nonstarter.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, America has an estimated 192 million privately
owned guns and a population only slightly higher _ approximately
270 million. The genie is out of the bottle. There's no putting it
back.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, in order to win acceptance of the freshly
penned Constitution of the United States, America's revolutionary
founders added the Bill of Rights, a document specifically designed
to curb the powers of government and ensure individual liberties
important to the citizens of this new nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights states: ``A
well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free
state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be
infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   The founders understood how important guns in the hands of
citizens were to winning their revolutionary war. The gun right was
important to these new U.S. citizens not only to fight off foreign
invaders but also to keep any new government from becoming as
despotic as the deposed British crown.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Amendment was not intended to give citizens the right
to use guns when they go hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gun champions often claim that certain guns ``do not have a
legitimate hunting purpose.'' So what? From a constitutional point
of view, those observations are meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting has nothing to do with the right to keep and bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   The gun question Americans need to ask is whether the founders
could have been right then and wrong now. Have technology and
events passed the amendment by?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is enough wiggle room in the Second Amendment to
require the registration of guns and the testing and licensing of
gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, my friend may feel the need to keep and bear
his own gun.

 &HT;    When gravity will do, you don't neeed glue
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Short ends and offcuts today, headed by a gentleman
who is making a coffee table and wants ``a piece of glass set into
the top.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes a silicone sealant might be the thing to use, but
``I'm wondering if the silicone will dry clear enough or if it will
be noticeable when I'm finished. Also, will it adhere to both
materials _ wood and glass? Anything else I need to watch out for
when combining glass and wood?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. If you glue the glass to the wood, you need to watch out
for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Wood moves. To the best of my knowledge, glass does not. If you
glue them together over any significant distance, either the glass
or the wood is going to crack.
</P>
<P>
   The gentleman already has the basic idea when he said he intends
to set the glass into the tabletop. That's all you do _ route a
ledge around the opening deep enough to set the glass flush with
the table top and just the right size to let it drop into place
easily but not shift around too much. He'll need to use a fairly
thick piece of glass _ ordinary window glass would be much too thin
and likely to break if someone sets a glass down hard on it.
</P>
<P>
   Since gravity will hold the glass in place, there is no need to
give it the full frame-and-panel treatment as you would with a
window pane or mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Paint is the answer
</P>
<P>
   Here's one we've addressed fairly recently, but with it being
summertime, it's probably worth going into again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking of building some Adirondack chairs and wondering what
type of wood to use. Teak is too expensive. I was told red oak is
quite durable outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Teak is not only brutally expensive, it's brutal on tools. The
first coffee table I built was made of teak. It came out nicely,
but I used up every saw blade I had.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of woods that theoretically hold up well
outdoors. Most of them are somewhat weak for seating, however. The
fact is that most wood is going to get rather rough and unsightly
if left in the weather, no matter how durable it may be.
</P>
<P>
   It needs to be finished, and the only truly protective finish
for outdoor use is paint. Thus, any furniture I'm likely to build
for outdoors is probably going to be something like pine or maybe
poplar, since there is no point in spending extra money for
handsome wood.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid pressure-treated pine, however, It is most unpleasant to
work, and I'm not sure I'd want to sit on it, either.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the merger
</P>
<P>
   Some interesting developments regarding our recent discussions
of adequate and inadequate equipment, especially the latter.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow on the Internet reports he has bought a Kity table saw
and somehow thinks he can perhaps upgrade it by getting a Delta
contractor's saw and marrying the two.
</P>
<P>
   The Kity, if memory serves, is a European saw made of stamped
parts and intended, I would assume, as a portable builder's saw. It
is definitely not a sturdy piece of equipment for cabinetmaking.
However, the idea of somehow merging it with a Delta contractor's
saw would take a mechanical Dr. Moreau, and you know how his
experiments turned out.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite amazing how folks of a certain mindset, once they
realize they have made a regrettable purchase, dream up cockamamie
schemes like this rather than biting the bullet and buying
something they can be certain will fill their needs.

 &HT;    KISS fans remain loyal through years
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You can understand why KISS once held a
nation of teen-age boys in its black-fingernailed grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The group rocked with a brain-rattling loudness, singing about
cold gin, fast chicks and Dr. Love. They seemed perpetually juiced
on testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   And that Kabuki-inspired makeup! It made them look like
superheroes, albeit really, really mean superheroes who belched
fire and spat blood ...
</P>
<P>
   Now Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Peter Criss and Ace Frehley are
powdering 50-year-old faces. And their most devoted followers are
pushing middle age with no sign of surrendering their allegiance to
the KISS army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything wrong with holding on to your youth a
little bit,'' says fan David Torjak. ``If I'm 29 and I want KISS
dolls, I'm going to buy KISS dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Wayne Lansberry, a 37-year-old father of two: ``When I
don't want to listen to Dave Matthews, I'll crank on the KISS....
My wife doesn't particularly like me jamming all those records, but
the kids love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents who encourage their kids to listen to KISS? Horrors! But
the band that warned Mom and Pop to lock up their daughters has
changed its tune. Now in its 26th year, the group is increasingly
puckering up to the cultural mainstream:
</P>
<P>
   _ Some of their rockingest tunes have joined the Muzak playlist.
</P>
<P>
   _ The group played the Super Bowl at Pro Player Stadium earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Warriors of KISS _ a team of wrestlers led by a grappler
named the Demon _ will make its WCW debut this fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ And how's this for wholesome: KISS even posed for a ``Got
Milk?'' ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``KISS might be unexpected in a milk ad, but that's why we chose
them,'' says spokeswoman Mia McWilliams.
</P>
<P>
   The band invades movie theaters today with the opening of
``Detroit Rock City,'' a comedy about four teen-agers' quest for
tickets to a 1978 KISS concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City'' undoubtedly will spark memories for fans.
In 1979, an 8-year-old Jim Brogan saw KISS from a front-row seat at
the Philadelphia Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   And last month Brogan and his girlfriend dropped $1,400 on a
pilgrimage to see Paul Stanley perform the lead role in ``Phantom
of the Opera'' in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say I'm obsessed, and maybe I am,'' Brogan
says. ``They've just been a part of my life, all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But why? ``I've been asking myself that for years,'' he says.
``They're not the best musicians in the world, and they know it. To
me, they just wrote stuff that was catchy and had a groove.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, they knew the value of a good makeup brush.
``It's true escapism,'' Brogan explains. ``You're not thinking it's
Gene Simmons up there. You're thinking it's a creature walking
around and making music.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogan lives inside a KISS shrine. His bedroom is decorated with
KISS candles, a clock, mousepad, mirror and trash can. His KISS
comic collection is stashed under his bed, the quartet's four solo
album covers from 1978 look down on his bed, and a dozen KISS
action figures, still in their packaging, hover above his bathroom
door.
</P>
<P>
   All of which initially looked pretty odd to girlfriend Kristina
Parker. Raised in a Southern Baptist household, she grew up
thinking that KISS ``was pretty much Satan, pretty much the epitome
of all evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she has a grudging respect for the band members as
individuals. ``It's the music that I don't care for,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That puts her in good company, says Horacio Ochoa, who wears a
vintage KISS pin to his job at a music store. About the size of a
coffee mug, the pin sparks conversations. Shoppers ``ask me if I'm
a real KISS fan,'' says the 23-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   He's actually not wild about the group's music, but ``just the
idea of them I find interesting.'' Interesting enough that he's
purchased some of the group's ``Psycho Circus'' action figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to sound terrible, but they truly understand
the meaning of commercialism and exploitation of a trademark,''
says Tim ``Loud'' Mitchell, who has seen 17 KISS concerts.
</P>
<P>
   These are heady times for ``Love Gun'' lovers, says the
35-year-old Mitchell. ``You're getting the original article,'' not
the interim, makeup-free musicians who played with Simmons and
Stanley in the '80s and early '90s while Frehley and Criss were on
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Maher, 30, says he endured his share of teasing in the '80s
for being part of the KISS cult, but nowadays, ``everyone goes
around saying they were (KISS fans).''
</P>
<P>
   As a wise rock critic once noted, one of the best reasons to
love KISS is because ``it's fun to rub the fact that you still like
them in the faces of all those people who, for 15 years, told you
that you'd outgrow them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I going to be 76 years old and listening to `Love Gun'?''
Brogan says. ``I don't know. ... It hasn't stopped yet.''

 &HT;    Doctor, Doctor: Twin African-Americans doubly good at treating
patient emergencies
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Patients come into Atlanta emergency rooms with a
range of problems: heart attacks, fevers, broken bones, headaches.
</P>
<P>
   At three of the city's ERs, doctors work overtime to make sure
their patients don't acquire an additional complaint: double
vision.
</P>
<P>
   There's no infection lurking in the emergency departments of
Grady Memorial, Crawford Long and Emory University hospitals. But
there is a potential problem. It keeps administrators poring over
personnel records and paying close attention to shift schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Its name is T.K. Jasper. Or more precisely, their names: doctors
Travis Kendal and Travan Kennard Jasper _ Emory emergency
physicians, assistant professors and identical twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night, somehow, we got put on the same schedule for
Grady,'' said Travan, the elder by 37 seconds. ``We had a good time
that night. They had never seen the two of us together before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people still don't know there are two of us,'' added
Travis. ``One nurse thought I was making it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, who turned 30 last month, joined the emergency
medicine department of Emory University School of Medicine in June
1998. They arrived trailing the same brilliant resume: Stanford
University biology degrees, University of Chicago Medical School,
University of Michigan residency. But their recruitment by Emory,
which oversees Grady and Crawford Long in addition to its own
hospital, offered more than the marquee value of identical twins
with identical training doing an identical job. It added two more
African-American physicians to a local cluster that is striking in
a mostly white profession and a very white specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the largest contingent of African-American faculty in
any predominantly white institution in the country,'' said Dr. Leon
L. Haley Jr., chief of the Emergency Care Center at Grady. ``There
may be more at Howard University or at King-Drew Medical Center in
Los Angeles. But there are 35 African-American faculty in emergency
medicine across the country, and we have 11 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the jobs in Atlanta put the Jaspers in the unusual
position, for once, of not being unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the only African-Americans in our residency program in
the last two years of our training,'' Travis said. ``When we went
to University of Chicago, it was 132nd out of 133 medical schools
for its percentage of minorities _ less than 1 percent, and our
arrival raised it to 3 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For once,'' said Haley, also African-American, ``they don't
have to be trailblazers, because the road has been blazed for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still double takes, though. ``We've been doing
genetics lectures to middle school students in a summer program,''
Travis said. ``So if Travan starts the lecture, for instance, he'll
make an excuse and leave the stage, and I'll walk on and take over.
And then at the end he'll walk back on, too. They are always
surprised, and I can't ever believe they didn't notice.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be hard to tell the two apart. They cut each other's hair
and shave in the same style, a goatee with a wisp under the lower
lip. They have the same taste; on a recent morning, having dressed
in separate houses, they both wore white-on-white shirts,
earth-toned geometric ties with gold tie bars, chino trousers and
soft-soled shoes (Travis' were Timberlands; Travan's were Bass).
Until recently, they both owned white sedans and black sport
utility vehicles _ Travis a Mercedes and a Jeep, Travan a Lexus and
a Ford Expedition. They call each other ``T.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are differences. They are both single but keep their
private lives separate. ``People always want to know if we date the
same women,`` Travis said, rolling his eyes. ``It's not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   They both wear wire-framed glasses, but Travis' are
copper-colored while Travan's are closer to gold. Their voices are
alike, but Travan's speech includes a bit more slang, Travis' a bit
more formal. Travan is half an inch taller; Travis has a chicken
pox scar in one eyebrow and a tiny freckle in the bow of his upper
lip.
</P>
<P>
   Detecting the differences requires close scrutiny. The Jaspers
are used to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always gotten a lot of stares, a lot of questions and
sometimes a fair amount of attention,'' Travis said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaspers, who have no siblings, were born in Richmond, Va.
Their mother and stepfather are hairstylists, and their grandfather
owns a small business. They were the first in their family to
finish college. They were co-valedictorians in high school, got the
same SAT scores before college, scored within one point of each
other on their graduate school admission exams and received
residency evaluations that were never more than 2 percentage points
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they deny being competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me a story about why they tended to follow each
other's career,'' said Dr. Arthur Kellermann, who heads the medical
school's emergency department and recruited both Jaspers in
separate interviews. ``They said that since their mother had
trouble telling them apart, she would reward or punish them both
for something one of them did. It programmed them from an early age
to look out for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   As in their mother's raising of them, being not-distinguishable
has both rewards and pitfalls. Their credit records get mixed up.
When they applied to residency, the three- to-seven year stretch of
training after med school, several programs assumed they'd received
duplicate applications and threw one out. To get residency
assignments, a nationwide computerized system known as
``matching,'' the Jaspers resorted to the type of application used
by couples who want to be in the same location. Otherwise, they
would have been competing against each other _ on the basis of
identical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard people (in other residency programs) say, `We liked
them, but we couldn't figure out how to handle twins,''' said Dr.
Steven Dronen, the residency program director for emergency
medicine at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it as two for the price of one _ though of course
we paid them two salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Twin physicians in emergency medicine is a slightly risky
proposition. Because it moves so quickly, emergency depends on
spoken commands; unlike most hospital medicine, not much is written
down until afterward. The pitfall of doctors who look alike could
be that a nurse, replying to one physician's order, could give a
test or medication to the other's patient.
</P>
<P>
   To combat that, Michigan kept the Jaspers on different shifts.
Emory has assigned them mostly to separate hospitals, Travis at
Emory University and Travan at Crawford Long; both work at Grady,
but, except for one slip, never at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The system isn't perfect. ``When we were residents, there was an
elderly lady with altered mental status,'' Travis said. ``She came
in with all her family members, and after a few hours she was fine.
I walked off to do something, and while I was gone, my brother
walked through the department in regular clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to her relatives, `Dr. Jasper just walked by in
street clothes; he must be leaving,' and then I walked up again,
still in my white coat. And they said, `You know, we think Mom's
having problems again. ...'''
</P>
<P>
   The high visibility of being young, black, bright and noticeable
has an extra resonance at Grady; many of its patients are
African-American, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't as fortunate as some others growing up, so if
things had been different, we would have been the people who go to
Grady,'' Travan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I came to Atlanta, I hoped I'd spend most of my time
at Grady. You know, I'd done all this hard work, and now it's time
to give back to the community I came from, and hopefully not only
take care of them, but be a role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people ask me, I can say, `I know exactly what you're going
through. I came from a household that had some of the things you're
dealing with in your household.' I have a lot of patients who say,
`It's so nice to see you doing this. Keep going.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They just urge me on.''

 &HT;    When gravity will do, you don't neeed glue
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Short ends and offcuts today, headed by a gentleman
who is making a coffee table and wants ``a piece of glass set into
the top.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes a silicone sealant might be the thing to use, but
``I'm wondering if the silicone will dry clear enough or if it will
be noticeable when I'm finished. Also, will it adhere to both
materials _ wood and glass? Anything else I need to watch out for
when combining glass and wood?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. If you glue the glass to the wood, you need to watch out
for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Wood moves. To the best of my knowledge, glass does not. If you
glue them together over any significant distance, either the glass
or the wood is going to crack.
</P>
<P>
   The gentleman already has the basic idea when he said he intends
to set the glass into the tabletop. That's all you do _ route a
ledge around the opening deep enough to set the glass flush with
the table top and just the right size to let it drop into place
easily but not shift around too much. He'll need to use a fairly
thick piece of glass _ ordinary window glass would be much too thin
and likely to break if someone sets a glass down hard on it.
</P>
<P>
   Since gravity will hold the glass in place, there is no need to
give it the full frame-and-panel treatment as you would with a
window pane or mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Paint is the answer
</P>
<P>
   Here's one we've addressed fairly recently, but with it being
summertime, it's probably worth going into again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking of building some Adirondack chairs and wondering what
type of wood to use. Teak is too expensive. I was told red oak is
quite durable outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Teak is not only brutally expensive, it's brutal on tools. The
first coffee table I built was made of teak. It came out nicely,
but I used up every saw blade I had.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of woods that theoretically hold up well
outdoors. Most of them are somewhat weak for seating, however. The
fact is that most wood is going to get rather rough and unsightly
if left in the weather, no matter how durable it may be.
</P>
<P>
   It needs to be finished, and the only truly protective finish
for outdoor use is paint. Thus, any furniture I'm likely to build
for outdoors is probably going to be something like pine or maybe
poplar, since there is no point in spending extra money for
handsome wood.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid pressure-treated pine, however, It is most unpleasant to
work, and I'm not sure I'd want to sit on it, either.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the merger
</P>
<P>
   Some interesting developments regarding our recent discussions
of adequate and inadequate equipment, especially the latter.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow on the Internet reports he has bought a Kity table saw
and somehow thinks he can perhaps upgrade it by getting a Delta
contractor's saw and marrying the two.
</P>
<P>
   The Kity, if memory serves, is a European saw made of stamped
parts and intended, I would assume, as a portable builder's saw. It
is definitely not a sturdy piece of equipment for cabinetmaking.
However, the idea of somehow merging it with a Delta contractor's
saw would take a mechanical Dr. Moreau, and you know how his
experiments turned out.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite amazing how folks of a certain mindset, once they
realize they have made a regrettable purchase, dream up cockamamie
schemes like this rather than biting the bullet and buying
something they can be certain will fill their needs.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN - BUDAPEST _ The statues of Lenin and other
communist demi-gods are still around, some 40 of them that have
been gathered together at Statue Park. The difference is that now
they're standing their ground for capitalism, Statue Park being a
privately owned, money-making concern that profits through paid
admissions. So it is that Hungary has taken to the free-market
economy in every way that it can. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED

 &HT;    Doctor, Doctor: Twin African-Americans doubly good at treating
patient emergencies
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Patients come into Atlanta emergency rooms with a
range of problems: heart attacks, fevers, broken bones, headaches.
</P>
<P>
   At three of the city's ERs, doctors work overtime to make sure
their patients don't acquire an additional complaint: double
vision.
</P>
<P>
   There's no infection lurking in the emergency departments of
Grady Memorial, Crawford Long and Emory University hospitals. But
there is a potential problem. It keeps administrators poring over
personnel records and paying close attention to shift schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Its name is T.K. Jasper. Or more precisely, their names: doctors
Travis Kendal and Travan Kennard Jasper _ Emory emergency
physicians, assistant professors and identical twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night, somehow, we got put on the same schedule for
Grady,'' said Travan, the elder by 37 seconds. ``We had a good time
that night. They had never seen the two of us together before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people still don't know there are two of us,'' added
Travis. ``One nurse thought I was making it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, who turned 30 last month, joined the emergency
medicine department of Emory University School of Medicine in June
1998. They arrived trailing the same brilliant resume: Stanford
University biology degrees, University of Chicago Medical School,
University of Michigan residency. But their recruitment by Emory,
which oversees Grady and Crawford Long in addition to its own
hospital, offered more than the marquee value of identical twins

African-American physicians to a local cluster that is striking in
a mostly white profession and a very white specialty.

   ``We have the largest contingent of African-American faculty in
any predominantly white institution in the country,'' said Dr. Leon
L. Haley Jr., chief of the Emergency Care Center at Grady. ``There
may be more at Howard University or at King-Drew Medical Center in
Los Angeles. But there are 35 African-American faculty in emergency
medicine across the country, and we have 11 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the jobs in Atlanta put the Jaspers in the unusual
position, for once, of not being unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the only African-Americans in our residency program in
the last two years of our training,'' Travis said. ``When we went
to University of Chicago, it was 132nd out of 133 medical schools
for its percentage of minorities _ less than 1 percent, and our
arrival raised it to 3 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For once,'' said Haley, also African-American, ``they don't
have to be trailblazers, because the road has been blazed for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still double takes, though. ``We've been doing
genetics lectures to middle school students in a summer program,''
Travis said. ``So if Travan starts the lecture, for instance, he'll
make an excuse and leave the stage, and I'll walk on and take over.
And then at the end he'll walk back on, too. They are always

earth-toned geometric ties with gold tie bars, chino trousers and
soft-soled shoes (Travis' were Timberlands; Travan's were Bass).
Until recently, they both owned white sedans and black sport

   But there are differences. They are both single but keep their
private lives separate. ``People always want to know if we date the

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _WACO, Texas _ Even though I know that guns in
the right hands represent no more threat to society than
chocolate-chip cookies, I also know that far too many wrong hands
hold guns. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN - BUDAPEST _ The statues of Lenin and other
communist demi-gods are still around, some 40 of them that have
been gathered together at Statue Park. The difference is that now
they're standing their ground for capitalism, Statue Park being a
privately owned, money-making concern that profits through paid
admissions. So it is that Hungary has taken to the free-market
economy in every way that it can. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I admit that I'm inclined
to brag on my country-gone-to-town cousin, the head honcho preacher
at the big Peachtree Road United Methodist Church in Atlanta. (Jim
Minter is a former editor of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED FOR SATURDAY

   GEEWAX-Y2KCOLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ With the days growing shorter in
1999, investors soon will have to place their bets on Y2K, the
software bug that some believe will cause massive computer
disruptions Jan. 1. Will they put their money in the mattress or
the market? (Geewax, Cox News Service). FOR SUNDAY

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The little-heralded movie ``Dick,'' a Watergate
put-on, turned up in theaters just in time to join the national
celebration of the 25th anniversary of Richard Nixon's disgraced
exit from the presidency. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for
Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ It is not possible to cast aside, at
least in scientific terms, the illogical world of ethnic supremacy
which nurtures the blind hatred that drove Buford Furrow to open
fire on a Los Angeles Jewish community center. (Andy Glass is a
columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington bureau.) MOVED

   BLIND-ARTIST _ ATLANTA _ When the Atlanta College of Art
accepted Gene Allcott as a student in the '70s, it was something of
a leap of fate: He was legally blind. But not only did the
nerdy-looking artist with thick glasses graduate, he captivated a
loyal Atlanta following with his whimsical portraiture _ painted in
bold, incandescent colors with an infectious zest for life. A
tireless self-promoter, he made greeting cards and T-shirts to
support himself, even as his work was being sought by wealthy
collectors. Since his death in 1992, at 39, of a freak accident,
his reputation has continued to pick up steam. Now the Atlanta
College of Art is presenting a retrospective, through Sept. 4. His
sister, an editor at Reader's Digest, is writing a brochure _
filled with memories from his acquaintances _ and there will be a
tribute on Friday, Aug. 27. (Brock, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   TV-LIFETIME _ The host of one show speculates out loud about
trying on a showgirl's scanty G-string and the effect on her

and soothing talk of spiritual phenomena. It's the start of another
new season of original programming on Lifetime, which seemingly is
amending its slogan to ``Television for All Different Sorts of
Women.'' With two new women's cable networks poised to enter the
marketplace, the mother of them all, Lifetime, is trying to cement
its hold on the female viewing audience that advertisers so love.
In the next week, Lifetime introduces two new series and kicks off
the second seasons of its original sitcom ``Oh Baby'' and the
Emmy-nominated drama ``Any Day Now.'' We preview the two new series

not only helping patients who need heart valves, but it's making

   TWIN-DOCS _ Identical twins Travis and Travan Jasper were born
37 seconds apart. In high school they were co-valedictorians; they
went to the same college, medical school, and residency program,
where they both chose emergency medicine as a specialty. Now they
both teach at Emory University School of Medicine and work in
emergency departments in the Emory system, though never in the same
one at the same time to cut down risky confusion. Their story's
already unusual, but it has an extra component: They're
African-American, working in one of the whitest specialties in
medicine. With pictures of the docs in the ER and out of their
white coats, together. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.

   SHOOTING-JEWS _ WEST PALM BEACH _ Three hours after a
37-year-old gunman told police he shot three small children at a
Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles as ''a wake-up call to
America to kill Jews,'' President Clinton awarded seven Medals of
Freedom in the East Room of the White House to Americans who have
contributed greatly to this country. Three of the recipients were
Jewish. The message the Jewish community hears is simple,
straightforward and ancient. No matter how much you succeed, no
matter how hard you work to serve your country, there will always
be a man with a gun around the corner, saying: You may live in this
country, but you are not of it. Though one of the wealthiest and
most influential minorities in the country, Jews maintain a
wariness bred from a heritage of persecution. Despite their medals,
their money and their acceptance, it never quite goes away.

   BAPTIST-HONORED _ He doesn't like to talk about himself or give

him were in a panic and moving to the suburbs. And yet the Rev.
Cameron Alexander _ a leader in the National Baptist Convention and
a force on Atlanta's political scene _ has managed to transform
Antioch North Baptist Church into a mega-church with 9,000 members.
It has been 30 years since he started his work at Antioch North,
and on August 14 the Rev. Jesse Jackson and other religious and
secular leaders will celebrate his achievements during a program at
the World Congress Center. (Blake, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   WEST BARNSTABLE, Mass. _ From the high pulpit, the Rev. Reed
Baer gazes down upon a congregation with a lineage beginning before
the Pilgrims landed.
</P>
<P>
   From the hard wooden benches and ancient family pews known as
``sheep pens,'' the West Parish flock listens as the spiritual
shepherd challenges the faithful to ``live up to the vision of our
founders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a very personal feeling in this old church. The way
it's laid out. The sense that the congregation is a caring
community. The connection to history,'' observes Gary Morris, a
young businessman sitting near the back with his wife, Meg, and
their infant son, Ian. ``You can't help thinking back to a time
when church was a much bigger part of people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are Sundays in the oldest continuously operating
Congregational Church in America, where the Sabbath is heralded by
the pealing of a bell made by Paul Revere.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1717, worshippers have assembled in this steepled, wooden
meeting house on Cape Cod. The congregation traces its roots back a
century more, however, to a group of religious reformers led by
Henry Jacob. These so-called Separatists first met secretly outside
London in 1616, four years before the Pilgrims came to the New
World and settled in nearby Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Jacob called his new church ``Congregational.'' While
Puritans wanted to reform or ``purify'' the Church of England,
Separatists wanted to break away completely. Believing that each
congregation could perform all church functions and choose its own
leaders, the Congregationalists were among the Separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Jacob died in 1624, about 30 of his followers
came to Massachusetts with their new pastor, the Rev. John Lothrop.
Lothrop led the Congregationalists to found Barnstable in 1639. The
settlement grew and divided into East and West Parishes as the
1700s began. The West Parish Meeting House opened its doors in
1717.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed over the centuries in this historic church. The
``tithingman'' no longer sits beneath the high pulpit wielding a
long pole with a feather on one end and an iron ball on the other.
If a man dozed off during the service, the tithingman would rap his
head with the ball. A sleepy woman would be tickled under the nose
with the feather.
</P>
<P>
   Sermons lasted two hours back then, pointed out Baer, compared
to about 15 minutes nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining West Parish, pioneer members had to credibly
testify to their redemption. Testimony of a conversion experience
is no longer required for admission. The ``sheep pens'' are no
longer deeded to prominent families; anyone can now sit in these
family pews. While early members sang psalms without musical
instrumentation, today's congregation is accompanied on hymns by a
pipe organ.
</P>
<P>
   However, the church clings to a heritage of independence. West
Parish still has its own covenant, promising not only ``to walk
together in Christian love'' but also to ``forswear all pettiness,
gossip and slander,'' and members agree to abide by its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders are still elected. Before being hired about a
year ago, Rev. Baer was required to preach a trial sermon and then
leave the church while the congregation voted.
</P>
<P>
   Approval was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   The parish has about 280 members, plus another 110 children who
aren't counted until their confirmation in about the ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come for many different reasons,'' said Baer. Some are
following a family tradition. Others are on a spiritual search.
Many come for their children, he said. They grew up in the church,
drifted away as young adults, then returned to give their offspring
the same religious grounding their parents gave them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A precious few come for the preaching,'' said the minister
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps personifying how the Lord works in mysterious ways, the
reverend himself took a roundabout route to the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a recovering lawyer,'' he explained. ``This is my first
church.''
</P>
<P>
   A practicing attorney for 12 years near Boston, Baer was a
deacon and Sunday school teacher in a Congregational church and the
father of two young children when his wife was diagnosed with
breast cancer. The crisis caused both to examine their lives.
</P>
<P>
   After considering teaching, ``I began to realize that I was
called to the ordained ministry,'' said Baer. ``I believe there is
more need in the world for my work in the church than there was for
my work as a lawyer. It seems there are plenty of lawyers to make
the world go around.''
</P>
<P>
   After his wife died, he graduated from theological school. He
has since remarried, and his second wife had a son several weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of a visitor, he reflected on history and religion
in this historic community he now calls home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Separatists and Puritans viewed themselves as living
in exile, as conducting an experiment in the wilderness _ which it
was, literally,'' he explained. ``Some would view the church today
as also in a time of exile. We are no longer in a churched society.
While as recently as the '50s, being a church member was part and
parcel of the American experience, today church is increasingly an
option that many in our society don't take up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church no longer has the power and influence it once
wielded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   On page 365 of the Pilgrim Hymnal is the song ``Faith of Our
Fathers,'' with its stirring chorus, ``Faith of our fathers, Holy
Faith. We will be true to thee 'til death.''
</P>
<P>
   But the founding fathers of West Parish might be surprised at
the wide-ranging faith of their spiritual heirs on Meeting House
Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worship doesn't have to be pious _ as long as you believe in
the basics,'' said Faith Chapman, who defined the basics as belief
in Jesus Christ as Savior. ``God is either male or female, if we
are created in God's image.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Chapman and her husband, Sid, are a retired couple from
Connecticut and regular church-goers since their marriage in 1955.
They like the liberal leanings of Congregational theology.
</P>
<P>
   So does Meg Morris, who was raised a Catholic but grew to
dislike the religion's formality and structure and rules regarding
women. During their courtship, she and Gary often rode a tandem
bicycle past the historic church while training for a race. They
decided to get married there and continued to come to services
after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I look forward to Sundays,'' said Meg. ``And for our son,
I think it's important that he grow up with that connection with
church and God and for him to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Diamond grew up Jewish, and says he still ``doesn't
believe in Jesus the way others in the congregation do.''
</P>
<P>
   While describing himself as ``not the most religious person in
the world,'' the young dentist said he believes it's important that
his children grow up with values and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to church for the family time together,'' he said. ``And
I enjoy the sermons.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Trisha, was raised as a Lutheran. She said she came to
West Parish after seeing other Cape Cod churches spurn a young
woman who was eight months pregnant with twins and wanted to stand
before an altar to marry the father. West Parish did not spurn
them, and the couple were wed in the historic Congregational
meeting house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't turn sinners away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a caring church _ a friendly church _
regardless of who ministers it,'' said Jane Clingham, who has been
a member for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each minister comes in and cooperates with the congregation,
but each has his own ideas and goals, too,'' said Silja Emrich, who
joined West Parish in 1957. ``Each leaves his own mark, and with
each we've learned and grown.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a cross, a gilded rooster on a weather vane sits atop
the steeple of the West Parish Meeting House. Brought over from
England in 1723, the rooster is a symbol dating back to the Last
Supper, according to parish historian Bob Russell.
</P>
<P>
   When Jesus told his disciples that they would soon desert him,
Peter protested. Jesus said, ``Truly I tell you, this very night
before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.'' When
the prediction came to pass, Peter heard a cock crow and broke down
and wept.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Russell explained, the crowing rooster has been a
reminder for Christians to stand up for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Like the crowing rooster, the covenant has been part of West
Parish longer than any current member can recall. Although
associated with the United Church of Christ, each Congregational
parish has its own such set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   The covenant provides clues to what the congregation was
concerned about at the time of adoption, said Baer. Thus West
Parish decided ``pettiness, gossip and slander'' were of such
magnitude that the covenant should require members to agree to give
up such actions ``in our dealings with one another and with all
people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly when this covenant was adopted, said Baer,
and time may be nearing for the congregation to consider revisions.
</P>
<P>
   It is a process even older than this historic meeting house,
dating back to Henry Jacob, who decreed Congregational churches are
constituted ``by a free mutual consent of believers joining and
covenanting to live as members of a holy society together in all
religious and virtuous duties as Christ and his Apostles did
institute and practice in the Gospel.''

testify to their redemption. Testimony of a conversion experience
is no longer required for admission. The ``sheep pens'' are no
longer deeded to prominent families; anyone can now sit in these
family pews. While early members sang psalms without musical
instrumentation, today's congregation is accompanied on hymns by a
pipe organ.
</P>
<P>
   However, the church clings to a heritage of independence. West
Parish still has its own covenant, promising not only ``to walk
together in Christian love'' but also to ``forswear all pettiness,
gossip and slander,'' and members agree to abide by its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders are still elected. Before being hired about a
year ago, Rev. Baer was required to preach a trial sermon and then
leave the church while the congregation voted.
</P>
<P>
   Approval was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   The parish has about 280 members, plus another 110 children who
aren't counted until their confirmation in about the ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come for many different reasons,'' said Baer. Some are
following a family tradition. Others are on a spiritual search.
Many come for their children, he said. They grew up in the church,
drifted away as young adults, then returned to give their offspring
the same religious grounding their parents gave them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A precious few come for the preaching,'' said the minister
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps personifying how the Lord works in mysterious ways, the
reverend himself took a roundabout route to the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a recovering lawyer,'' he explained. ``This is my first
church.''
</P>
<P>
   A practicing attorney for 12 years near Boston, Baer was a
deacon and Sunday school teacher in a Congregational church and the
father of two young children when his wife was diagnosed with
breast cancer. The crisis caused both to examine their lives.
</P>
<P>
   After considering teaching, ``I began to realize that I was
called to the ordained ministry,'' said Baer. ``I believe there is
more need in the world for my work in the church than there was for
my work as a lawyer. It seems there are plenty of lawyers to make
the world go around.''
</P>
<P>
   After his wife died, he graduated from theological school. He
has since remarried, and his second wife had a son several weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of a visitor, he reflected on history and religion
in this historic community he now calls home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Separatists and Puritans viewed themselves as living
in exile, as conducting an experiment in the wilderness _ which it
was, literally,'' he explained. ``Some would view the church today
as also in a time of exile. We are no longer in a churched society.
While as recently as the '50s, being a church member was part and
parcel of the American experience, today church is increasingly an
option that many in our society don't take up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church no longer has the power and influence it once
wielded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   On page 365 of the Pilgrim Hymnal is the song ``Faith of Our
Fathers,'' with its stirring chorus, ``Faith of our fathers, Holy
Faith. We will be true to thee 'til death.''
</P>
<P>
   But the founding fathers of West Parish might be surprised at
the wide-ranging faith of their spiritual heirs on Meeting House
Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worship doesn't have to be pious _ as long as you believe in
the basics,'' said Faith Chapman, who defined the basics as belief
in Jesus Christ as Savior. ``God is either male or female, if we
are created in God's image.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Chapman and her husband, Sid, are a retired couple from
Connecticut and regular church-goers since their marriage in 1955.
They like the liberal leanings of Congregational theology.
</P>
<P>
   So does Meg Morris, who was raised a Catholic but grew to
dislike the religion's formality and structure and rules regarding
women. During their courtship, she and Gary often rode a tandem
bicycle past the historic church while training for a race. They
decided to get married there and continued to come to services
after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I look forward to Sundays,'' said Meg. ``And for our son,
I think it's important that he grow up with that connection with
church and God and for him to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Diamond grew up Jewish, and says he still ``doesn't
believe in Jesus the way others in the congregation do.''
</P>
<P>
   While describing himself as ``not the most religious person in
the world,'' the young dentist said he believes it's important that
his children grow up with values and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to church for the family time together,'' he said. ``And
I enjoy the sermons.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Trisha, was raised as a Lutheran. She said she came to
West Parish after seeing other Cape Cod churches spurn a young
woman who was eight months pregnant with twins and wanted to stand
before an altar to marry the father. West Parish did not spurn
them, and the couple were wed in the historic Congregational
meeting house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't turn sinners away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a caring church _ a friendly church _
regardless of who ministers it,'' said Jane Clingham, who has been
a member for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each minister comes in and cooperates with the congregation,
but each has his own ideas and goals, too,'' said Silja Emrich, who
joined West Parish in 1957. ``Each leaves his own mark, and with
each we've learned and grown.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a cross, a gilded rooster on a weather vane sits atop
the steeple of the West Parish Meeting House. Brought over from
England in 1723, the rooster is a symbol dating back to the Last
Supper, according to parish historian Bob Russell.
</P>
<P>
   When Jesus told his disciples that they would soon desert him,
Peter protested. Jesus said, ``Truly I tell you, this very night
before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.'' When
the prediction came to pass, Peter heard a cock crow and broke down
and wept.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Russell explained, the crowing rooster has been a
reminder for Christians to stand up for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Like the crowing rooster, the covenant has been part of West
Parish longer than any current member can recall. Although
associated with the United Church of Christ, each Congregational
parish has its own such set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   The covenant provides clues to what the congregation was
concerned about at the time of adoption, said Baer. Thus West
Parish decided ``pettiness, gossip and slander'' were of such
magnitude that the covenant should require members to agree to give
up such actions ``in our dealings with one another and with all
people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly when this covenant was adopted, said Baer,
and time may be nearing for the congregation to consider revisions.
</P>
<P>
   It is a process even older than this historic meeting house,
dating back to Henry Jacob, who decreed Congregational churches are
constituted ``by a free mutual consent of believers joining and
covenanting to live as members of a holy society together in all
religious and virtuous duties as Christ and his Apostles did
institute and practice in the Gospel.''

STORIED CHURCH PROVIDES A BAPTIST HISTORY LESSON IN LONDON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When I went looking for the church of Charles Haddon
Spurgeon, one of the greatest Baptist preachers of all time, I
didn't expect it to be so easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   I took a bus from Oxford to London early one recent Sunday, a
spur-of-the-moment decision inspired by a final lecture in a church
history course I was taking at Oxford University's Regents Park
College.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Karen Bullock, theology professor at Southwestern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, had talked about
Spurgeon and the ``Down Grade Controversy,'' a dispute over the
Bible that split British Baptists in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   It resembled the strife-filled, damaging controversy I have been
covering for 20 years that has split some very well-meaning people
in the giant Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that, I had heard the name ``Spurgeon'' spoken in the
same breath with other great preachers for as long as I could
remember.
</P>
<P>
   I had to find Spurgeon's old church. But I didn't know where it
was located in London.
</P>
<P>
   I learned from a telephone information operator that there was a
Metropolitan Tabernacle at Elephant and Castle, a major stop on
London's subway, or Underground. On blind faith, I traveled to
Elephant and Castle on the Bakerloo line.
</P>
<P>
   I asked an Underground attendant if we were near the
Metropolitan Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just walk out the front door,'' he said. ``It's right there.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. When I emerged from the Underground station, I
looked across the street and saw a large building with signs
reading ``Spurgeon's Church'' and ``Come Worship in Our Crowded
Sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   The church began in 1650 in a time of Baptist persecution, and
there were pioneering pastors before Spurgeon. But when he arrived,
in 1853, crowds became so large that services were moved to large
rented buildings, including one on The Strand in London's theater
district.
</P>
<P>
   The huge Metropolitan Tabernacle then was built on a site said
to be the spot where the Southwark martyrs, dissenters who were
forerunners of Baptists, were burned in the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   All but the impressive columned portico of the church and its
basement was destroyed by fire in 1898. It was rebuilt. But in
1941, an incendiary bomb dropped by German planes again destroyed
everything but the church entrance and basement, requiring a second
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the congregation dwindled, but today, under
leadership of the Rev. Peter Masters, who preaches in the same
conservative style as Spurgeon, the Metropolitan Tabernacle is on
the rise again, part of the Reformed Baptist movement.
</P>
<P>
   The end of Spurgeon's life was fraught with anguish, as he was
involved in the ``Down Grade Controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   It began when Spurgeon wrote about Baptists who ``downgraded''
the authority of the Bible, the decline of prayer meetings and the
worldliness of Baptist ministers who attended theater and sometimes
sponsored entertainment in their churches.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Baptist Union attacked Spurgeon and accused him
of smearing all preachers. In 1887, he withdrew from the Baptist
Union, which was still the major organization of Baptists in
England.
</P>
<P>
   Both Spurgeon's conservative brand of worship and the more
liberal form practiced by the Baptist Union have declined in
numbers. Today, there are about 139,000 members of the Baptist
Union in England, 39,000 in Wales and 16,000 in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists might learn from their British cousins. Some
conservative U.S. Baptists blame the membership decline among
Baptists in the British Isles on the rise of liberalism. But could
it have been caused by the controversy itself?
</P>
<P>
   The 15.5 million-member Southern Baptist Convention is still the
nation's largest non-Catholic church group. But in 1998, the
denomination, which has been in conflict for two decades, recorded
a membership decline of 162,000. It was the first decline since
1926.
</P>
<P>
   Some Southern Baptists have opted to remove ``Baptist'' from
their church name. They say it drives away some who don't want to
be involved with the modern conservative-moderate ``Down Grade
Controversy'' that has split the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   If Spurgeon could counsel Southern Baptists today, I think he
would tell them to resolve their disputes and focus on teaching
Jesus' profound thoughts about loving one's neighbor, even if you
disagree with him.

   It looks just like ordinary yoghurt. It even tastes like it. But
a new line of yoghurt due to be launched in Russia this autumn
contains bacteria with an illustrious pedigree _ they were taken
from the saliva and guts of some of the Soviet and Russian space
program's most distinguished astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The yoghurts are being touted by their makers as a health food.
And although Western microbiologists see no particular reason why
bacterial cultures taken from astronauts should be any healthier
than standard cultures, the space connection certainly provides a
unique selling point.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 25 years, microbiologists at the Institute of
Biomedical Problems in Moscow, working in a small lab at the
Baikonur launch site in Kazakhstan, have been culturing strains of
bacteria from astronauts and using them to make yoghurt.
</P>
<P>
   The stresses of space flight can upset astronauts' immunity,
allowing potentially dangerous bacteria to oust benign inhabitants
of astronauts' guts, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. In
the early 1980s, microbiologists attached to the Soviet space
program began developing the yoghurts as a remedy to these
problems, giving them to astronauts as they prepared for space
flights. The yoghurts were also sent into space to help control
urinary tract infections that occurred on the Mir space station in
1989 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Nadezhda Lizko, who led the yoghurt project, says that most
Soviet and Russian astronauts have contributed to the biomedical
institute's bank of cultures. ``They are big fans of our yoghurt,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the harsh financial reality of today's Russia, however, the
yoghurts have become more than a natural remedy for sickly
astronauts-they are now a potential money-spinner for the
biomedical institute. Lizko and her team have diversified their
range of products to include fruit-flavored yoghurts, cottage
cheese and traditional Russian cheeses studded with garlic and
herbs. From the autumn, the researchers hope to produce 2 tons of
dairy products a day at a lab in the Kaluga region, north of
Moscow. Although samples haven't been collected since 1993, Lizko
has 1,000 cultures of astronaut's gut bacteria _ enough to sustain
the business indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   She claims that astronauts make ideal culture donors for live
yoghurts. ``They are under constant and strict observation of a
whole range of medical specialists,'' Lizko says. ``The slightest
change in their physical condition is instantly noticed. We only
collect cultures that are proven able to withstand extreme
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Pariza, a microbiologist at the University of Wisconsin
in Madison, agrees that astronauts are in exemplary physical
condition. However, he says there's no evidence that their cultures
would produce a healthier yoghurt. &QL;

   Nadezhda Lizko, who led the yoghurt project, says that most
Soviet and Russian astronauts have contributed to the biomedical
institute's bank of cultures. ``They are big fans of our yoghurt,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the harsh financial reality of today's Russia, however, the
yoghurts have become more than a natural remedy for sickly
astronauts-they are now a potential money-spinner for the
biomedical institute. Lizko and her team have diversified their
range of products to include fruit-flavored yoghurts, cottage
cheese and traditional Russian cheeses studded with garlic and
herbs. From the autumn, the researchers hope to produce 2 tons of
dairy products a day at a lab in the Kaluga region, north of
Moscow. Although samples haven't been collected since 1993, Lizko
has 1,000 cultures of astronaut's gut bacteria _ enough to sustain
the business indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   She claims that astronauts make ideal culture donors for live
yoghurts. ``They are under constant and strict observation of a
whole range of medical specialists,'' Lizko says. ``The slightest
change in their physical condition is instantly noticed. We only
collect cultures that are proven able to withstand extreme
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Pariza, a microbiologist at the University of Wisconsin
in Madison, agrees that astronauts are in exemplary physical
condition. However, he says there's no evidence that their cultures
would produce a healthier yoghurt. &QL;

   An Australian company is so confident that its new SecurePage
software can thwart attempts to change the content of websites that
it is set to challenge hackers to crack it.
</P>
<P>
   Launching the package at the Internet World Australia exhibition
last week, Bahram Boutorabi, chief executive of Creative Digital
Technology of Sydney, said that none of the company's skilled
software developers had yet been able to alter sites that used the
system.
</P>
<P>
   The ``cracking'' of Web pages, in which pages are replaced by
adulterated copies designed to embarrass or annoy the host, is an
increasing problem. A number of prominent sites, including those of
the U.S. Army and Air Force, have recently fallen victim to
electronic pranksters.
</P>
<P>
   SecurePage works by encrypting a copy of every page on a site.
This master version is continually compared with the pages
available on the Internet. If any of the content changes without
authorization, the software kicks in and restores the original
using the master as the source. Because the master is encrypted
using a triple-strength version of the U.S. government's DES
algorithm, breaking the code would require an inordinate amount of
time and computer power.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Schneier of Counterpane Systems, a computer security
consultancy in Minneapolis, says SecurePage sounds like a good
idea, but he already sees where hackers might break in.

an equals sign to a 'does not equals' sign, they could break the

LUNACY RULES IN `BOWFINGER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' is neither the funniest movie ever made nor the
sharpest in Steve Martin's wild-and-crazy canon. But it has two
things going for it that no other comedy banging around theaters
currently has.
</P>
<P>
   One is Eddie Murphy. The other is Mind Head.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, for those who live on the planet Xenon, is the awesomely
gifted comic whose famed characterizations have spanned a
linguist-veterinarian (``Dr. Doolittle''), a bulky academic (``The
Nutty Professor'') and an apple-green bendable toy (Gumby,
``Saturday Night Live'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bowfinger,'' a manic goof on Hollywood, he plays two more:
A paranoid, egomaniacal movie star named Kit Ramsey and a
look-alike dork with an orthodontic grin, Jiff. Both are welcome
additions to Murphy's rubber-faced oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   Mind Head, meanwhile, is Kit Ramsey's psychic balm _ a
glistening New Age think tank where disciples wear white pyramids
on their heads and chimes tinkle liquidly in the background. At
Mind Head, which looks like the bastard child of Scientology and
intense crystal therapy, Kit calms himself by reciting the three
``Happy Premises'': One, there are no aliens out to get him. Two,
there is no giant foot ``trying to squash me.'' And three, ``Even
though I feel as though I might ignite, I probably won't.''
</P>
<P>
   This is loopy stuff, and that's what makes it so delicious: It's
a treat watching Murphy wrap his face around some of the words
coming out of his mouth. Frank Oz (who helmed 1997's sweetly funny
``In &AMP; Out'') directed ``Bowfinger,'' but the film's out-there
humor has more to do with Martin's script than Oz's Muppets-honed
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue is hyper-articulate, riffing and weird; Kit's first
scene has him attacking a screenplay because it contains 1,458
instances of the letter ``K'' (which means that ``KKK appears in
this script 486 times!''). We're used to hearing Martin speak his
own lines _ in ``The Man With Two Brains,'' for instance, or ``L.A.
Story'' _ but it's a wild incongruity when Murphy does it. The
results are inspired.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of the film, it's lopsided but scattered with
hilarity. Martin is Bobby Bowfinger, a permanently down-on-his-luck
director whose career, thus far, has included work on such
cinematic masterworks as ``The Yugo Story'' and ``A Bucket of
Blondes!!''
</P>
<P>
   Determined to direct a science-fiction epic called ``Chubby
Rain'' (in which aliens invade Earth via precipitation, ``making
the raindrops chubby''), Bowfinger tries to sign the industry's
hottest action star. Namely, Kit Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   When the star declines _ he actually shoots the script with a
revolver _ Bowfinger plows ahead anyway, filming entire
Kit-centered scenes without the actor's knowledge. Imagine Kit's
horror when strangers walk up to him and start spouting dire
warnings about ``pod people'' and extraterrestrial crusades. ``When
you left Phoenix, it wasn't because you wanted to raise soybeans!''
yells one such intruder. ``You've come down from Kentucky with your
damned aliens!''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is a marvel in these scenes, and he's disarming when he
materializes as the squinty Jiff. Even if ``Bowfinger'' had nothing
else to recommend it, it would still feature Murphy's most
satisfying performance since ``The Nutty Professor'' _ and the
second, after ``Holy Man,'' in which he dodges cars on a whizzing
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's self-centered-loser routine will seem familiar at best,
tired at worst, to anyone who knows his films, but ``Bowfinger'' is
so breathlessly odd that there's enough else to occupy us.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Baranski (``Bulworth''), playing a long-suffering
actress, is the brightest spot in a game cast that also includes
Terence Stamp as a wondrously oily Mind Head therapist and the
ever-doe-like Heather Graham as an eager starlet. But the film
belongs to Murphy _ and to Martin's screenplay, in which erudite
lunacy rules supreme. In a summer of baked-goods gross-outs, this
is fine news indeed.

THIS AMBULANCE NEEDS HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you tied a tourniquet to stop the gangrene from setting in?
Got a broken leg? Broken arm? Broken neck? Has a bloody park
shooting or drive-by left you badly wounded?
</P>
<P>
   If yes, then you're probably in need of medical attention. But
if the choices are dying or letting junkie paramedics Jimmy and Tom
take you to the hospital, you're better off with the former _ the
latter'll get you killed anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In that fine medical tradition of ``MASH'' and ``Hospital,''
Scott Ziehl's seedy ``Broken Vessels'' makes a strong case in favor
of on-the-job surveillance for Los Angeles paramedics _ if not for
our protection then for our sadistic entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   They defibrillate the strong-hearted, curse at the wounded and
leave the ailing for dead. The film's small consolation is that
there's more substance abuse than patient abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we supposed to be saints 'cause we wear these jumpsuits?''
Jimmy (Todd Field) half-comically asks Tom (Jason London), whose
coke 'n' heroin 'n' glue-induced downward spiral has him vomiting
in aquariums and behind sofas. London's Khaki purity gets a nicely
frayed makeover that eventually plays reluctant Trapper John to
Field's insinuating Hawkeye.
</P>
<P>
   Field has a quiet menace that makes Jimmy the paramedic from
hell without turning him into a monster. The only person more
in-and-out of it is Jimmy's wastoid of a neighbor (murmured and
flitted with something approaching eloquence by Susan Traylor).
</P>
<P>
   Written by Ziehl, David Baer and John MacMahon as a 12-step
cautionary tale, ``Vessels'' moves like the pitch-black-comedy
``Cops'' or ``Two Smack Fiends in an Ambulance,'' a bruising parody
given snapshots of force in its marriage of life-threatening
seriousness to fevered absurdity and cinematography under the
influence. The film's sickest joke is that for Jimmy this paramedic
thing is just a temporary gig. He really wants to work for the
LAPD.

MALKOVICH LIVES UP TO THE PART IN `OGRE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Ogre'' is a chilling study of delusions and moral
blindness in a self-proclaimed innocent who becomes a dedicated
servant of his Nazi captors. He's a simpleminded Frenchman with a
special, disturbing affinity for children who uses his gift in a
hellish manner.
</P>
<P>
   The film was directed by Volker Schlondorff, whose 1979
Oscar-winning ``The Tin Drum'' dealt with similar themes in a story
equally full of mythological overtones, though in a more grotesque
and surreal style. Both pictures (which the director co-wrote with
Jean-Claude Carriere) view Naziism through central figures who are
child-men convinced they have a special destiny.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Tin Drum,'' the hero literally refuses to grow up;
here, the main character, Abel, though an adult, is more like a
hulking boy _ a loner and a naif with a menacing (and unhinged)
side, and no great shakes at adult relationships.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1925 and Abel, an orphan, is a misfit student at a strict
French boarding school. Facing another severe beating for breaking
the rules, he angrily wishes that the school would burn down.
Immediately, a fire erupts in the chapel. Abel believes he has been
favored by the fates, even though his best friend is killed in the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The adult Abel (John Malkovich) works as an auto mechanic, but
his quiet life ends abruptly when a child he unwisely has
befriended falsely accuses him of sexually molesting her. It's
1939, and the judge sends Abel to the army instead of prison. He's
captured by the Germans and sent to a POW camp in East Prussia.
</P>
<P>
   The camp is located near the elaborate hunting lodge used by
Field Marshal Hermann Goering (Volker Spengler), Hitler's
designated successor. Abel winds up a servant and handyman there.
</P>
<P>
   The corpulent and corrupt Goering counts himself a master hunter
and relishes tracking and shooting stags in his forested domain _ a
fairy-tale setting infected by madness. This Goering is a barbed
portrait of the decay that results from nearly unlimited power, but
Spengler (a stalwart of R.W. Fassbinder's films) borders on
overplaying the blackly comical aspect. Abel's next assignment
takes him even deeper into the woods.
</P>
<P>
   At a castle that's both home to a German nobleman (Armin
Mueller-Stahl) and a military school where Aryan youth are molded
into SS officers, Abel's rapport with students and horses is
noticed. As he listens to the school doctor extol the Nordic racial
type, Abel admires the rigorous physical training these handsome
boys undergo.
</P>
<P>
   He is awarded a privileged position: In a robe and on horseback,
he patrols the countryside with a pack of attack dogs, seeking
``recruits'' _ willing or not _ among peasant children to fill the
school's declining ranks. He believes he is doing these youngsters
a great service. Thus he earns his nickname among the common folk,
The Ogre, and prepares the audience for the film's powerful ending.
</P>
<P>
   Schlondorff has said he built the film around Malkovich, and the
actor lives up to the responsibility. His fine performance never
permits us to oversimplify the character. His Abel retains a kind
of virtue despite his various services to the Third Reich; he has a
child's sensibility that makes him unable to see evil around him
for what it is. He is simply fascinated with the machinery, the
spectacle, of Goering's lodge and the SS school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he clings fiercely to the notion of innocence and the need
to protect it; hence his identification with animals and children.
</P>
<P>
   The director's films, despite their sometimes dreamlike content,
generally avoid extravagant flourishes; they are tightly controlled
and distanced. Here, Schlondorff alternates between black and
white, color and sepia, which are employed carefully to recount
what he calls a ``realist fairy tale.'' (He used those word for the
film's source novel, ``The Erl King'' by Michel Tournier, which won
the Prix Goncourt, France's top literary prize.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ogre,'' by the way, was filmed in 1996 (Schlondorff's most
recent release in this country was last year's unsuccessful
``Palmetto''). That it's taken so long to arrive should tell you
something about the state of art film distribution these days.

SOME THRILL SEEKERS ARE IN OVER THEIR HEADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every so often sea-loving adventurers should check in with Dodge
Morgan just for the heck of it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the entrepreneur-cum-world record setting
sailor-cum-newspaper publisher _ and philosopher always _ became in
1986 the first solo United States sailor to circumnavigate the
globe without stopping, Morgan's byline pops up all over the marine
world.
</P>
<P>
   From his 30-acre island off the coast of Harpswell, Maine,
Morgan, 67, writes regularly for Points East, a Portland magazine
that is one of the best on sailing in New England. He is planning
to launch a new, homemade, 35-foot steamboat called Quiet Presense
this month at Handy Boat in Falmouth Foreside, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   With 150,000 miles of blue water sailing past his stern, Morgan
recently has weighed in with authority on the matter of Coast Guard
rescues for boats in trouble. What most disturbs him is the clash
of a new culture of thrill-seeking adventurers with the cold, sober
realities the ocean can suddenly impose on recreational boaters,
or, as Morgan puts it, ``those who go to sea for the hell of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Morgan set out from Portland, Maine, on a Ted Hood
60-footer, American Promise, which suffered damage to the
self-steering gear in an October Atlantic storm, forcing it to put
into Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Having restarted the record attempt from there a few days later,
Morgan sailed around the globe nonstop, returning to Bermuda 159
days later to claim a world record. He is still the only American
to have made such a passage.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a team of sailors from the Naval Academy sailed
American Promise to Morgan's home waters in Maine. And though she
has been fully restored and fitted out as a training vessel, Morgan
enjoyed seeing the young sailors sail his record-setting boat, but
declined an invitation to board her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like,'' he quipped a few years ago, ``seeing your first
love in the hands of a bunch of midshipmen.'' He has never
reboarded Promise since dropping her at Annapolis a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan is dead serious about the necessity of self-reliance
at sea. He was critical of a Naval Academy team that was sailing
Promise a few years ago when a collision with a coal barge resulted
in her sinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every boating accident,'' he said at the time, ``is due to
human error.''
</P>
<P>
   What especially troubles Morgan about the modern boating scene
is the mentality of thrill seekers who have ``been trained on
bungee jumping and sky diving _ activities that offer the thrills
without the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Boating is different, he says. From the time the sailor or
powerboater casts off from shore, he must assume full
responsibility for whatever happens, right down to drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The skipper) has to assume,'' says Morgan, ``that the radio
won't transmit and the lifeboat won't inflate, that the Coast Guard
won't come _ and take care of the boat no matter what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan mentions the case of a sailor who called for a Coast
Guard rescue three days out of Bermuda recently. ``He wanted to
abandon his boat,'' says Morgan, ``because of sea-sickness.'' On
every one of his 27 passages from Maine to the West Indies, he has
found at least one boat along the way that has been abandoned by
its crew.
</P>
<P>
   The dangerous combination, he says in his argument against Coast
Guard offshore rescues, ``is a culture that celebrates adventure
seeking and the ease of taking a boat offshore.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety seminars, he notes, emphasize rescue procedures, such as
electronic emergency signals and helicopter rescues, rather than
individual responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is often too late,'' Morgan writes in a recent editorial
published in Soundings, ``that the sailor learns that the sea is
not an ersatz adventure or virtual experience. Too late to learn
that the vessel at sea is an oasis of independence and no place to
apply our land-oriented culture of `my mistakes are really someone
else's responsibility.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan scoffs at a culture that puts warning signs on snow
blowers reading ``DO NOT PLACE HANDS AND FEET IN BLADE AREA'' and
health hazard signs on cigarette packs.
</P>
<P>
   Another contribution to dangerous unpreparedness at sea is the
modern technology that can make hulls stronger, simplifies
sail-handling systems and self-steering gears, and gives skippers
simple, push-button navigation ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can lull anyone into complacency and trick many without
credentials into the ultimate trouble,'' says Morgan. The following
logical connections, he says, are essential to sailors: ``It is
truism that sailing in heavy weather is inevitable for anyone who
sails and that sailing through a storm is inevitable for any sailor
who goes offshore. . . . The boat under way becomes one's total
existence, a world isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan also scoffs at the ``absurdity of using the sea as a race
course'' and recalls that when he returned to Chebeague Island in
Maine after his world rounding with Promise, the locals were not
particularly impressed. ``They've made their living at sea for
generations, and every family has lost a member at sea,'' he says.
``They don't quite understand people using the sea for play.''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as people these days ``go to sea for the hell of
it,'' he adds, they should at least understand their fundamental
responsibility. ``The sea does have a way of culling out fools,''
says the ever-irascible Dodge Morgan, ``but from what I can see,
there also seems to be an inexhaustible supply of them.''

DRAMA PAR FOR THE COURSE

<P>
   Oh, those crazy golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, they will be hiring baseball umpires union boss
Richie Phillips and demanding even more money from the PGA, the
country clubs, product manufacturers, and spectators.
</P>
<P>
   It's never about the money. Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Tiger Woods and David Duval split $1.4 million in
a made-for-television match. Now the golfers are talking about the
Ryder Cup and charitable contributions.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is airing the PGA Championship this weekend from the Medinah
Country Club near Chicago, and the network's announcing team is all
over the latest golf dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Host Jim Nantz had his own take on the Woods-Duval showdown. ``I
thought the event got totally misrepresented by a lot of people in
the media,'' Nantz told reporters. ``It was one of those topics
that everybody in the world thought they were qualified to have an
opinion on, and really it was nothing more than two of the
top-ranked players in the world going and playing a round of golf.
I watched it and enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Nantz said, he thought the match was a great idea.
</P>
<P>
   Nantz was less passionate about the Ryder Cup contributions.
``The issue is whether the players will get a charitable
contribution for particpating in the Ryder Cup, where they could
donate $100,000 to a charity of their choice,'' Nantz said. ``The
players just want a chance to make a charitable donation; it's not
something the players are walking around in a fury about.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS golf analyst David Feherty also downplayed the story.
``There are a lot of players that would pay to be on the Ryder Cup
team,'' he said. ``What the PGA does with the money is a different
story. A lot more should be donated to charity. I think the players
are right that there should be some sort of contribution; but in
terms of personal gain, it's the one pure sport event of the year
that players go out there and play for something other than
money.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the subplots over this weekend is the Ryder Cup points.
Another is the course at Medinah. Broadcasting the event is tough,
largely because CBS will be doing live coverage Saturday and Sunday
between 1:30 and 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike other sports, we are on air for the entire time,'' said
CBS producer Lance Barrow. ``There are no halftimes or timeouts. In
this sport we go on air until we go off air, no matter what time it
is. It includes our people in the truck, our announcers, but more
importantly our technical people who are running up and down the
golf course with cameras on their backs and microphones.''
</P>
<P>
   And Medinah is an extremely long course. ``There are scenarios
in golf that you don't deal with in other sports,'' Nantz said.
``You have more than 100 golfers on 100 acres of the course, all
firing at the same time. There are a lot of different stories
spread out all over the place, and the coordination . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``What's very deceiving about Medinah is we are all gawking at
the 7,401 yards and saying, `It just keeps getting longer and
longer.' But a lot of that extra space is in the par-5s. An extra
100 to 200 yards has been stacked in those par-5s, and they are
going to be better suited to a guy like Justin Leonard, who's a
great wedge player and will know how to handle championship
pressure and keep his ball in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nantz said the long course doesn't necessarily mean that a
long-ball hitter will win. ``You look at the history of Medinah and
all the winners here have been noted for being grinders,'' he said.
``They have been guys who could keep it in play and not guys
hitting ridiculous drives.''

<P>
   BEDFORD, Mass. _ Antonia Silva-Hale left the rutted roads, palm
trees and sugarcane fields of the Dominican Republic when she was
just 10. But in her heart, the island country was always her home.
</P>
<P>
   Her family moved several times, always seeking to better their
educations and improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, at age 29, Silva-Hale, living in the United States,
completed medical school in Missouri. Young, single, and the
youngest of a protective family, she found herself looking for a
second home.
</P>
<P>
   A friend suggested the military _ an instant family providing a
good job, housing, and medical patients _ a structured, predictable
world within a world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had come from a very sheltered environment,'' she said. ``I
didn't even know how to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   She walked into the nearest Air Force recruiting office and
signed up. Quickly she rose, becoming assistant professor of
medicine, and then a colonel, the first woman from the Dominican
Republican to reach that rank in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Boston's Dominican Festival is honoring Silva-Hale as
a role model for other women, naming her Woman of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an example for Latino women because she has got this
important position,'' said Dominico Cabrale, president of the
Dominican festival, which will be held in Jamaica Plain this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very happy and proud for what she's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Dominican community is growing in numbers and
visibility. About 8,000 Dominicans lived in the area in 1990, when
the last census was taken. Although there are no official tallies,
community leaders say the population has jumped to anywhere from
20,000 to 100,000, including undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, Dominicans have been stereotyped as violent or
criminally minded, several said. ``But a lot of people do good
things and go in silence,'' said Maria Contreras, executive
director of Soldiers of Health, a health care program in Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   She described Silva-Hale as ``very humble, intelligent and
dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Just over 5 feet and barely 115 pounds, Silva-Hale doesn't
immediately look like the type who would have a commanding military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   However, the petite physician, who is Aerospace Medicine Flight
Commander at Hanscom Air Base is one of only 270 women who
currently hold the rank in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Silva-Hale, 44, is thrilled by the Woman of the Year Award,
which makes plain that ``remembering where you come from is what
it's all about,'' she said. ``If you forget that, you'll get lost
along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born in San Pedro de Macoris, a poor, rural village
about 40 miles east of Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   The village also was home to two other Dominican heroes whose
photos adorn her office walls: baseball stars Pedro Martinez and
Sammy Sosa. ``By being good players who also behave well, they've
made it easier for people to notice other Dominicans who are doing
good things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Silva-Hale also hopes to inspire others _ as a Dominican who
used education to hit her own sort of homerun.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, her parents were high school teachers
with high aims for their four children. Even as a preschooler, she
sat in the back of a crude one-room schoolhouse, watching an aunt
teach. ``That's how I learned my first letters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she was about 5 years old, her father moved to Santo
Domingo to get an engineering degree, and the family followed.
``The biggest picture in the house was a photograph of my father in
his graduation gown,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But her mother was unsatisfied with opportunities in the
Dominican Republic. ``She said, `This is not going to cut it. We've
got to get these kids educated.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When civil war erupted in 1965, the family moved again, this
time to San Juan, Puerto Rico. There Silva-Hale earned a bachelor's
degree in science, graduating magna cum laude, and then a doctorate
in medicine at the University of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   She chose medicine, she said, ``because it seemed like the
toughest thing to tackle. Why go the easy way?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, she completed her postgraduate education with a
residency in internal medicine at St. Louis University Medical
Center, in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   She married Douglas Hale a few years later and they have three
children: Julia, 9, Douglas, 8, and David, 6. Her mother, Ramona
Silva, 72, also lives with the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very idealistic, which permeates everything she does,''
said Hale, a transplant surgery fellow at Beth Israel-Deaconess
Hospital. ``She's a big booster of medicine as a career, and
shepherds students through the process.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hanscom, Silva-Hale supervises a staff of about 35 people and
also provides direct patient care to about 150 pilots and their
families. She still makes house calls on the base. ``Our goal,''
she said, ``is to keep the flyers flying.''
</P>
<P>
   The times she treasures most are small moments when she can
treat a minor illness or allay someone's fears. She vividly
remembered one woman she treated several years ago who was
agonizing about whether she had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Silva-Hale examined the woman and concluded she had a minor skin
irritation, perhaps a wart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the look of relief on that lady's face,''
she said. ``It's simple things that make it all worthwhile.''

NOT-SO-UGLY AMERICANS FACE PRISON ON DRUG CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BROKEDOWN PALACE 
Directed by: Jonathan Kaplan 
Screenplay by: David Arata 
Starring: Claire Danes, Kate Beckinsale, Bill Pullman, Jacqueline
Kim, Lou Diamond Phillips, Daniel Lapaine, Tom Amandes 
Running time: 99 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (brief strong language and drug-related material) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Brokedown Palace'' is yet another in the sad little sub-genre
of films about young Americans imprisoned abroad, usually on
drug-related charges. The thing that sets it apart from such films
as ``Midnight Express'' and last year's ``Return to Paradise'' is
that its protagonists are innocent, female, and embodied in
uncommonly compelling fashion by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale.
They play recent high school grads whose only crime is a disastrous
naivete that begins when they tell their parents that they're going
to Hawaii, but go to Thailand, instead.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly have they been sweet-talked by the same Australian bloke
who gives them air tickets to Hong Kong, where he promises them
various treats, than they find themselves arrested at Bangkok
airport. Two tins of cocaine are found in one of their backpacks.
The number is escalated to six by the time the bureaucracy is
finished grinding out its paperwork. But that's the least of their
troubles. A stern judge sentences them to 33 years apiece in
prison. They're marched off to a women's correctional institute
whose nickname gives the film its name. The Aussie dealer, of
course, is nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Their only hope, after frantic phone calls home and many letters
to government officials, is an expatriate lawyer of apparently
rumpled decency named Hank the Yank (Bill Pullman), who owes a lot
of his success to his Thai wife (acted with unstereotyped freshness
by Jacqueline Kim). Meanwhile, they sit and stagnate. A few
well-meaning souls tell them that they at least have each other.
But they're not altogether consoled by this circumstance. Part of
the reason has to do with a mild romantic competition between the
two for the slick Aussie's attentions.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from that, Danes' Alice is annoyed at Beckinsale's Darlene
for having signed a confession in Thai that she couldn't even read
and simply assumed was her statement, not a document admitting
guilt. Darlene, meanwhile, sharply reminds Alice that she should
have checked the contents of her backpack, in which the drugs were
found. In addition, we gather from Alice's conduct that she's got
something of a chip on her shoulder, justified in the case of
Darlene's insurance broker father, who callously blames Alice for
everything bad, past and present, that ever happened to his
daughter. Also feeding Alice's anger is the fact that she grew up
motherless. And part of it is an underclass thing.
</P>
<P>
   With her thrusting glances and impulsive body language, Danes'
Alice personifies loose cannon behavior that's both defensive,
aggressive and anti-social. Beckinsale wears the clean-scrubbed,
together look of a young woman for whom the system has always
worked, and who thus busies herself writing letters to authorities.
The chemistry between them is dimensioned and complex and part of
the reason has to be the direction of Jonathan Kaplan, who after
``Heart Like a Wheel'' and ``The Accused,'' is indisputably at the
forefront of male directors of women. The film's most piercing
moment isn't an action moment, but one where the women are visited
by three American pals from back home. ``You're in college?,''
Darlene asks, jolted to realize how her own life has dead-ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokedown Palace,'' filmed in authentic-looking locales in the
Philippines, is reasonably interesting as a detective story, too.
It unfolds credibly when it turns out that Pullman's lawyer
actually is conscientious about doing his job. Thanks to his wife's
savvy, he's not unaware of the ins and outs of local drug
trafficking and weak links in the chain of Thai law enforcement.
But mostly ``Brokedown Palace'' works as well as it does because it
gives two high-powered actresses a chance to play off one another.
It's reasonably subtle in making the point that their privileged
white American status works against them in the context of another
culture. It pretty much avoids self-pity, although it certainly
makes the point that the prison plumbing isn't all it might be and
that the cockroaches are tougher than the guards. Frankly, though,
this type of film is beginning to suffer from a certain
overfamiliarity. It also gives off a whiff of xenophobia. It may
just be that ``Midnight Express'' should be made mandatory viewing
in US passport offices.

DALY'S DISSERVICE TO OUR DAUGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sisters! If Mary Daly won't let our sons into her Boston College
classroom, she shouldn't teach our daughters either.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair to BC's male students. And it's a disservice to BC
women. They can't learn what they need to know about the elements
of today's patriarchal and sexist world in her cloister.
</P>
<P>
   Banning men from Daly's classroom fails women in a big way. It
does as little to stamp out sexism as forced busing of
schoolchildren does to stamp out racism.
</P>
<P>
   Daly is most often described as a ``renowned radical feminist
philosopher.'' Some people consider her a prophet, others call her
a nut. There is no question this is one strong-minded, even
single-minded, woman _ now locked in a bitter legal dispute with BC
over its demand that she resign from her tenured teaching job for
refusing to allow men to attend her classes.
</P>
<P>
   The professor wants to teach her class on ``Feminist Ethics''
only to women. She took the position that she would rather resign
than admit male students. In a recent court ruling, Middlesex Judge
Martha B. Sosman said BC has adequate cause to fire Daly, citing
her defiance of college policy that all courses be open to male and
female students.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of personal experience and plenty of anecdotal
evidence, I agree with Daly's underlying premise: Sexism _
discrimination on the basis of sex, most notably against women _
remains a fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do about it?
</P>
<P>
   Studies prove that from grade school to graduate school, males
dominate the classroom. Statistics also show that more graduates of
women's colleges earn advanced degrees, especially in math and
science, than do women from co-ed schools. And no one needs studies
or statistics to conclude that women talk differently about just
about everything when men are not present.
</P>
<P>
   That information is often marshaled to buttress the case for
Daly's women-only classroom policy. But what we still need to do is
change the overall reality for women at BC and elsewhere _ not
create one tiny, protected piece of turf where a feminist teacher
teaches feminist ethics only to females. Daly may nurture her
female students and empower them within the narrow confines of her
classroom. What happens when they step outside her door to confront
the Heights and the world beyond?
</P>
<P>
   What might have made some sense in the late 1970s, when Daly
first started banning men, is harder to justify 20 years later. As
a way to remedy the much more subtle sexism of the 90s, it just
doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Women today have much more access to position. How to exercise
the power that comes with that position _ that is the piece of the
equation that still eludes many of us. We can't exercise power only
against each other and consider ourselves successful. So we must
include men in our lesson plan. We have to speak up with men in the
room, not just with women. We have to push, achieve, excel, and
compete woman-to-man, not just woman-to-woman.
</P>
<P>
   This silly fight over Daly's women-only classroom also lets BC
look reasonable, all the while obscuring some truths about the
college. Women were first admitted to the school in 1970; today, 54
percent of BC graduate and undergraduate students are female. At
the same time, women account for 33 percent of BC's 427 tenured
faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that BC's student body is more diverse than
people often think. But there is still a lingering perception of an
old boy network made up of old boys. The term ``BC crowd'' gives
rise to a stereotypical image of mostly white men who left the
Heights for other heights of power and influence in Boston. The
image is intensified by the jock concerns of the BC crowd, such as
the rallying behind a football stadium or new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The power base at BC is still very, very male. And Daly is
making it very, very easy for those powerful men to tear her down.
Fighting to maintain a women-only class makes her sound
old-fashioned and rigid.
</P>
<P>
   I would love to have a teacher like Mary Daly explain the facts
of life to my son. But I would hate to have a teacher like Mary
Daly offer a false reality to my daughter.
</P>

   Spacecraft of the future could consume themselves to make extra
fuel, say researchers in the United States. Scientists from three
companies _ including aerospace firm Lockheed Martin and Thiokol
Propulsion, the company that makes boosters for the space shuttle _
are studying ways to turn spacecraft parts into a usable fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The first to be considered are communications satellites, which
are useless once their fuel runs out because they can no longer
make the minor positional adjustments _ called station keeping _
that keep them in their orbital slots. A satellite that uses parts
of its own structure as fuel would be lighter at launch, as it
would not have to carry so much onboard propellant.
</P>
<P>
   This would mean that rocket-launching companies could carry
larger payloads into orbit and allow satellites to burn their own
body parts to boost themselves into higher orbits.
</P>
<P>
   The research, which is funded by the U.S. Air Force, is being
managed by Physical Sciences Incorporated, a technological
consultancy based in Andover, Mass. Project leader Prakash Joshi
confirms that studies are under way to develop what he calls ``dual
function structural propellant materials'' _ but the company
declines to elaborate on the nature of the substances under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the researchers are studying novel kinds of
thermoplastic composite materials which can offer a combination of
structural strength during launch and then be chemically converted
or burnt off in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   At present, spacecraft such as the space shuttle use materials
such as aluminum and graphite for their major body parts _ for
example, boosters and external fuel tanks. But these are, in
effect, ``dead weight'' that requires fuel to be carried aloft.
Although the shuttle's solid rocket boosters parachute back to
Earth for retrieval and reuse, the huge external tank is simply
jettisoned when the craft reaches orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to look at new materials which you could use to
build a spacecraft and which could be consumed in orbit when their
strength is no longer needed. Most of the strength of the
spacecraft is needed during launch because of the G-forces, but
once it gets up there you don't need a massive structure to hold
the spacecraft together,'' Joshi says.
</P>
<P>
   If suitable materials can be identified, Joshi's team will
develop a prototype component to demonstrate that auto-cannibalism
is viable. The next step will be to decide how to incorporate the
new materials into a spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that in order to take advantage of this material you
will have to design spacecraft a lot differently from the way you
do now,'' Joshi says. Possibilities might include burning off body
parts in situ to create thrust in a particular direction. Another
method might be to use a central ``recycling plant'' with
mechanical, chemical or solar systems to convert the structures
into fuel _ although this would carry a weight penalty. &QL;

   However, the researchers are studying novel kinds of
thermoplastic composite materials which can offer a combination of
structural strength during launch and then be chemically converted
or burnt off in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   At present, spacecraft such as the space shuttle use materials
such as aluminum and graphite for their major body parts _ for
example, boosters and external fuel tanks. But these are, in
effect, ``dead weight'' that requires fuel to be carried aloft.
Although the shuttle's solid rocket boosters parachute back to
Earth for retrieval and reuse, the huge external tank is simply
jettisoned when the craft reaches orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to look at new materials which you could use to
build a spacecraft and which could be consumed in orbit when their
strength is no longer needed. Most of the strength of the
spacecraft is needed during launch because of the G-forces, but
once it gets up there you don't need a massive structure to hold
the spacecraft together,'' Joshi says.
</P>
<P>
   If suitable materials can be identified, Joshi's team will
develop a prototype component to demonstrate that auto-cannibalism
is viable. The next step will be to decide how to incorporate the
new materials into a spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that in order to take advantage of this material you
will have to design spacecraft a lot differently from the way you
do now,'' Joshi says. Possibilities might include burning off body
parts in situ to create thrust in a particular direction. Another
method might be to use a central ``recycling plant'' with
mechanical, chemical or solar systems to convert the structures
into fuel _ although this would carry a weight penalty. &QL;

<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ His nickname, ``Big Cat'', conjurs the image
of a sabre-toothed mauler, deftly sizing up its prey, ready to
pounce, to shred Oh, how that would suit the Patriots. How they
could use a big, agile, menacing Andy Katzenmoyer to step in at
middle linebacker and be the predator of their prayers.
</P>
<P>
   New England opens its 1999 NFL exhibition schedule Friday night
when the Redskins visit Foxboro Stadium, and the 21-year-old
Katzenmoyer will start at an unfamiliar position _ the sideline.
With barely two weeks of practice under his belt, and already one
position change into his career, he will begin the night looking at
veteran Marty Moore fill in for the injured Ted Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   For now, ``Big Cat'' will have to do what predators do best . .
. watch and wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way yes, but in a way no,'' he said Thursday when asked
if he was slightly relieved not to be starting this early into his
apprenticeship. ``No, because I've always been the starter.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he'll be that here, too. There really isn't much doubt
about that. The Patriots used the 28th pick in this year's draft to
bring him here, and that was before Johnson, the club's starting
middle linebacker the last four years, tore up his left biceps
tendon last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for Katzenmoyer to be groomed in the exhibition
season and then plugged into Johnson's spot for the Sept. 12 opener
against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious? Yes. Practical? We'll see, perhaps as early as Friday
night, when he's expected to sub for Moore and get ample playing
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditioning-wise, I'm fine,'' said Katzenmoyer, who in the
fall of 1996 became the first freshman linebacker to start at Ohio
State, only to follow that up by winning the Butkus Award as the
college game's top linebacker as a sophomore. ``The speed game,
it's hard to prepare for that _ you've just got to go out there and
just interact with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mingling on the gridiron has never been much of an issue for
Katzenmoyer. Raised in Westerville, Ohio, at the outer edge of the
OSU campus, he didn't take up the game until age 12. Two years
later, he was a 230-pound freshman, playing two ways _ running back
and linebacker _ for Westerville South High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be physical,'' said Katzenmoyer, recalling the advice of his
high school coach, Rocky Pentello. ``Just run down the field, try
to run through people. Be mean, nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   The message became Katzenmoyer's, as well as Westerville's,
mantra. By his sophomore year, he recalled, upwards of 100 students
turned out for the varsity squad. The next year, the number had
dwindled to 40. His senior year, only 32 showed up for fall
practice. The problem wasn't shrinking enrollment, but rather
shrinking violets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost intimidiating for some guys, I guess,'' recalled
Katzenmoyer. ``It was just the nature of our team. We were a big
physical team, and we just loved to hit and make plays. Some guys
didn't like that, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, social interaction has proven a trickier playing
field for Katzenmoyer. He all but became a Sports Illustrated
whipping boy for his lack of tenacity in the classroom. The
magazine referred to him as a ``noted classroom slacker'' just two
months ago when it noted that his summer school curriculum at OSU
included a course entitled ``AIDS: What Every College Student
Should Know.'' Turned off, in part, by SI's portrayal of him in a
feature the previous summer, he went virtually the entire '98
football season without talking to the media, and ultimately issued
only a terse written statement in February when he decided to leave
OSU a year early and turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Katzenmoyer was charged with drunken driving
in Columbus, his blood .033 over the limit at .133. He pleaded no
contest, the incident ultimately costing him a $300 fine, his
driver's license (suspended for six months), and a heap of bad
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I made some mistakes in college,'' Katzenmoyer
said. ``And (Sports Illustrated) decided to point that out to the
whole world. That's fine. I can't do anything about that. I just
hope kids growing up now can learn from my mistakes and not get in
trouble. The whole thing . . . it was just a bad time in my life.
But everything has moved on since then.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, with his name on a four-year, $3.5 million contract,
things are moving at warp speed. With Johnson considered a given at
middle linebacker, the coaching staff figured Katzenmoyer for an
outside spot heading into training camp. Even then, he would have
to knock veteran Tedy Bruschi out of the spot. All that was tossed
to the wind last Saturday afternoon when Johnson's biceps rolled up
like a window shade during the club's intrasquad scrimmage at
Foxborough. The very next morning, head coach Pete Carroll had
Bruschi making Johnson's calls in the huddle and Katzenmoyer
holding down Johnson's ``Mike'' position.
</P>
<P>
   ``His head's got to be spinning right now,'' said Steve Nelson,
the former Patriots great who, as a rookie in 1974, also had to
make a quick transition from college to the pro game. ``He'll be
fine, physically, but that college-to-pro adjustment takes time.
The kid's had, what, two weeks before his first preseason game? In
'74, heck, we reported on June 22 and practiced for six weeks, and
then we had six exhibition games to get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson played his college ball at North Dakota State, a Division
1-AA program, and then started every game at middle linebacker his
rookie year. It wasn't until the following season, he recalled,
that he began to feel comfortable at the spot.

what it used to be. He struggles mightily to keep his corn,
soybeans and wheat pristine _ free of chemicals and
laboratory-tinkered genetics. When he succeeds, his crops earn
organic status and fetch a premium price. But keeping his fields
unspoiled by high-tech agriculture is a chore without end. Anson

   CAUCUS: The voters in Lamoni, Iowa, are popular folks.
Presidential candidates pass through, knocking on doors, attending

getting her calls returned by a campaign. That's because she's the

straight owner of a gay club in town. The ex-Marine is brash,
sprinkling conversation with four-letter words and politically
incorrect statements. But slowly, lesbians _ a long-ignored segment
up north _ have come to trust him. Two women even held a wedding
there. And he finds himself spending more time at his gay club than

   BOGGS. Of the greatest 3,000-hit baseball players in history,
Wade Boggs may have the most human story of them all. It wasn't
just Boggs' career that played out on a public stage. His life also
earned tabloid headlines. He had a much-publicized affair in the
'80s. His mom died in a tragic car accident. And then, after
seemingly disappearing from the public eye in the '90s, he won his
only world championship with the Yankees two years ago. Finally, at
the end of a long road, Boggs smacked a home run for his 3,000 hit
last weekend, becoming the first member of the club to get more

   BEDFORD, Mass. _ Antonia Silva-Hale left the rutted roads, palm
trees and sugarcane fields of the Dominican Republic when she was
just 10. But in her heart, the island country was always her home.
</P>
<P>
   Her family moved several times, always seeking to better their
educations and improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, at age 29, Silva-Hale, living in the United States,
completed medical school in Missouri. Young, single, and the
youngest of a protective family, she found herself looking for a
second home.
</P>
<P>
   A friend suggested the military _ an instant family providing a
good job, housing, and medical patients _ a structured, predictable
world within a world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had come from a very sheltered environment,'' she said. ``I
didn't even know how to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   She walked into the nearest Air Force recruiting office and
signed up. Quickly she rose, becoming assistant professor of
medicine, and then a colonel, the first woman from the Dominican
Republican to reach that rank in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Boston's Dominican Festival is honoring Silva-Hale as
a role model for other women, naming her Woman of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an example for Latino women because she has got this
important position,'' said Dominico Cabrale, president of the
Dominican festival, which will be held in Jamaica Plain this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very happy and proud for what she's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Dominican community is growing in numbers and
visibility. About 8,000 Dominicans lived in the area in 1990, when
the last census was taken. Although there are no official tallies,
community leaders say the population has jumped to anywhere from
20,000 to 100,000, including undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, Dominicans have been stereotyped as violent or
criminally minded, several said. ``But a lot of people do good
things and go in silence,'' said Maria Contreras, executive
director of Soldiers of Health, a health care program in Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   She described Silva-Hale as ``very humble, intelligent and
dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Just over 5 feet and barely 115 pounds, Silva-Hale doesn't
immediately look like the type who would have a commanding military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   However, the petite physician, who is Aerospace Medicine Flight
Commander at Hanscom Air Base is one of only 270 women who
currently hold the rank in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Silva-Hale, 44, is thrilled by the Woman of the Year Award,
which makes plain that ``remembering where you come from is what
it's all about,'' she said. ``If you forget that, you'll get lost
along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born in San Pedro de Macoris, a poor, rural village
about 40 miles east of Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   The village also was home to two other Dominican heroes whose
photos adorn her office walls: baseball stars Pedro Martinez and
Sammy Sosa. ``By being good players who also behave well, they've
made it easier for people to notice other Dominicans who are doing
good things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Silva-Hale also hopes to inspire others _ as a Dominican who
used education to hit her own sort of homerun.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, her parents were high school teachers
with high aims for their four children. Even as a preschooler, she
sat in the back of a crude one-room schoolhouse, watching an aunt
teach. ``That's how I learned my first letters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she was about 5 years old, her father moved to Santo
Domingo to get an engineering degree, and the family followed.
``The biggest picture in the house was a photograph of my father in
his graduation gown,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But her mother was unsatisfied with opportunities in the
Dominican Republic. ``She said, `This is not going to cut it. We've
got to get these kids educated.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When civil war erupted in 1965, the family moved again, this
time to San Juan, Puerto Rico. There Silva-Hale earned a bachelor's
degree in science, graduating magna cum laude, and then a doctorate
in medicine at the University of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   She chose medicine, she said, ``because it seemed like the
toughest thing to tackle. Why go the easy way?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, she completed her postgraduate education with a
residency in internal medicine at St. Louis University Medical
Center, in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   She married Douglas Hale a few years later and they have three
children: Julia, 9, Douglas, 8, and David, 6. Her mother, Ramona
Silva, 72, also lives with the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very idealistic, which permeates everything she does,''
said Hale, a transplant surgery fellow at Beth Israel-Deaconess
Hospital. ``She's a big booster of medicine as a career, and
shepherds students through the process.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hanscom, Silva-Hale supervises a staff of about 35 people and
also provides direct patient care to about 150 pilots and their
families. She still makes house calls on the base. ``Our goal,''
she said, ``is to keep the flyers flying.''
</P>
<P>
   The times she treasures most are small moments when she can
treat a minor illness or allay someone's fears. She vividly
remembered one woman she treated several years ago who was
agonizing about whether she had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Silva-Hale examined the woman and concluded she had a minor skin
irritation, perhaps a wart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the look of relief on that lady's face,''
she said. ``It's simple things that make it all worthwhile.''

   ``Chuck Fairbanks came to me before a preseason game against
Green Bay that second year,'' said Nelson, referring to the
Patriots' former coach and general manager. ``And he said to me,
`You're not improving like I think you should . . . you have to
start picking up your play.' Let me tell you, that gave me some
kind of push. It was coming from Fairbanks _ the coach and GM _ it
wasn't like it was some idle thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, for the most part, has been impressed by his rookie
wannabe. He likes Katzenmoyer's size, agility, and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a little spark every day,'' said Carroll. ``I think you
should be excited about what this guy brings.''
</P>
<P>
   By the coach's account, the only downside has been what he has
perceived as a lack of itensity from the highly-touted rookie.
Carroll expected more overt, demonstrable fire and passion from the
``Big Cat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personality trait that can transfer into a skill,''
said Carroll. ``It's not (totally) necessary . . . there are a lot
of guys who can play who are really quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer, apparently, is one of them. He refers to himself as
``a quiet guy, no matter what the situation is, I just let my
actions speak for me, instead of, you know, talking.''
</P>
<P>
   So where's the intensity that Carroll wants?
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, he told me that, too, but I really don't know what
he means by it,'' said Katzenmoyer. ``I'm a quiet person. I keep to
myself a lot. I'm not a yeller and a screamer, but that's doesn't
mean I'm not intense.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within that understated demeanor, though, there is a true
confidence. In the days when he was talking to Sports Illustrated,
Katzenmoyer said, ``Every 10 or 15 years, a new breed of athlete
comes along: bigger, faster, stronger. I see myself as a new breed
of athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday to expound on that thought, Katzenmoyer said, ``I
think you see that as part of the evolution of every sport. You've
had it in baseball with (Mark) McGwire and (Sammy) Sosa, and you
have that in football, too. There's always going to be change, no
matter what the sport. The style of the game is definitely
different today than even in the '80s. It's a matter of the natural
evolution of people. People are getting bigger, stronger, and
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks into his pro career, is he still feeling that way _
bigger, stronger, and faster than the next NFL guy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I guess it's going to be a process
to feel out. I'll probably know better in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Columbus, the Buckeyes' head coach, John Cooper, has
little doubt about Katzenmoyer's upside. He also doesn't think
there will be much of an adjustment period for his former star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is not any different in pro football than in
college,'' said Cooper. ``You line up, take care of the gap, and
tackle the ballcarrier. I don't think there's a hell of a lot
secret to the game. I can't see that he'd be overwhelmed by
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is proof that the leap doesn't have to be great. A
second-round pick out of Colorado in 1995, he started 12 games for
the Patriots that season. The next fall, Zach Thomas, a fifth-round
pick out of Texas Tech, started all 16 games at middle linebacker
for the Dolphins and since has made himself a mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard, what happened to Ted Johnson,'' Thomas said
Thursday. ``He's a great linebacker, one of the best run-blockers
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A rookie stepping into the spot, said Thomas, shouldn't feel
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, having to learn a whole new system, things like
that,'' recalled Thomas. ``But there really isn't any pressure on a
rookie because they're expecting you to make mistakes. They know
that's just going to happen. If you're a rookie, and you play up to
your ability, that's great. And if you don't, and your season's
mediocre, then it's OK, you can only get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adjustment is the game's a lot faster, runners are
quicker, everything is different. But the advantage is you have
more studying here, and that really helped me. When I was in
college, class and studying took a lot out of the day, just to do
your work in school, but here, you go to class to learn football.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Ohio, a Columbus sports cafe, the Rush Creek Sports
Bar &AMP; Grill, is clearing out a wall to hang Katzenmoyer
paraphernalia. David Davis, the bar's president and CEO, got to
know Katzenmoyer when the pride of Westerville _ a dry town _ was a
star junior on the high school team. When Katzenmoyer made it to
the all-state game in Canton, it was Rush Creek that sponsored his
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll tell you what kind of kid we're talking about here,''
said Davis. ``We paid for his trip there, including whatever
expenses were allowed, but we added a little extra money for
expenses _ not a big deal, just some spending money. The next day,
he politely told me, `No, you can't do that,' and returned the
money. He didn't want it to jeopardize anything with NCAA
eligibility. He's really a bright, honorable kid.''
</P>
<P>
   By Davis's account, Katzenmoyer is intelligent and sincere,
contrary to images that may have been gleened from media accounts
and interpreted from his media boycott in '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the brightest kids you'll ever meet,'' said Davis. ``I
mean this with all sincerity _ he's a rare find. The people of
Boston have a really good jewel.''

STUDENTS IMPROVE IN MCAS ESSAYS, TEACHERS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- This summer, nearly 800 Massachusetts teachers spent
three weeks doing what they normally dread during the school year:
correcting tests.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't just another algebra quiz, this was the essay
portion of the state MCAS exam, and, anecdotally at least, teachers
say there has been a marked improvement in student performance over
the first year of the assessement test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buzz going around the room from day one, was that people
felt good about it; that they were much improved over last year,''
said Adele Stock, humanities coordinator at Hopedale Junior/Senior
High School, who was a ``table leader'' overseeing teachers who
corrected 10th-grade exams.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Education officials are pleased with the early
positive signs, but warn that until the test results are officially
tallied within the next month or so, there should be no rush to
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can come out of the scoring with an impression, but it's
very shaky to draw conclusions,'' said Jeffrey Nellhaus, the
department's director of assessment and evaluation. ``But we are
pleased to see how many teachers enjoyed the scoring experience and
want to become ambassadors for the program.''
</P>
<P>
   The multiple choice portion of MCAS is currently being scored at
Advance System Measurement and Evaluation Inc., a Dover, N.H. hired
by the Education Department to oversee and conduct testing.
</P>
<P>
   A special MCAS-only division has been set up and employees work
under tight security checking off right and wrong answers eight
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Advance is a nationally known testing center that helps states
design, develop and score specialized assesement tests. Although
the state of Kentucky fired the firm in 1996 after detecting
scoring miscalculations in school ranking, Nellhaus said
Massachusetts has had no problems with Advance.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, hundreds of teachers like Stock answered a
communique from the Education Department looking for essay scorers.
The state paid each teacher $500 for correcting 100 tests each day
for three days at three sites across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight with guards from Advanced Systems positioned
all around the test sites. Teachers were not allowed to drink or
eat or even talk during the correction process, and used yellow
sticky-notes to convey opinions about essays to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, though, there would be a joyous outburst over a
particularly ``funny or erudite'' essay, Stock said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a large mix of educators as well, the scorers said.
From English teachers to shop teachers, guidance counselors,
principals and librarians, all were involved in the process and all
were willing to suspend their own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful having different people from different
disciplines give up their own standards and use the standard of the
state, which was very appropriate,'' said Bess Blunt, an 8th-grade
English teacher at the Hawthorne Brook Middle School in Townsend.
``Everyone brought their own perspectives to the table, but what
was really stressed, was leave your own standards at the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teachers said they wanted to be involved in the process
to not only see firsthand how the state was handling the correction
process, but to bring information about what makes a great essay _
or a bad essay _ back to their principals and students.
</P>
<P>
   Several teachers who corrected or oversaw the process for 30 to
40 percent of the MCAS essays taken by 4th-, 8th- and 10th-graders
agreed the students seemed better prepared, knew how to structure
an essay and were more focused than in 1998, the first year the
controversial exam was issued.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the fourth-grade essay asked students to describe a
great day in their lives; the 8th-grade essay wanted students to
discuss whether community service should be an elective or
mandatory activity; and 10th-graders had to select a scene or
episode in literature and explain what the situation appears to be,
and what it really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of kids who had a great time at Riverside
Park,'' laughed Mary Anne Rohde, a reading specialist at the West
Brookfield Elementary school who corrected 4th-grade essays two
years in a row. ``But even those were better than last year's where
we had a lot of 4th-graders writing `we left the house, and then,
and then and then. . .' This year they were written as essays, not
just a list of what happened and who was there.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests were graded on a scale of 1-6, and teachers were
trained for two days on the rubrics and criteria used to judge the
quality of the work. An essay that scored a 6, for example, would
have rich topic development, careful and/or subtle organization and
an effective and rich use of language.
</P>
<P>
   An essay that scored a one would have little topic development,
poor organization, few details and little or no awareness of the
audience or task.
</P>
<P>
   Each test was read and scored by two teachers. If there was a
disparity in their scores, a ``table leader'' would also read the
essay, discuss it with the original readers and all would have to
be in agreement over the score then reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were much better overall,'' said Rohde. ``I think the
kids know it's more serious.''

MARKETING BLITZ AIMS TO PUT FORBES ON THE MAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ He has hawked goods for General Electric, Xerox,
and Apple Computer. And now Rick Segal is putting his most potent
marketing tools to work for his latest product: Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-story, suburban office building here, Segal, in his
trademark bow tie and owlish horned-rim glasses, oversees a
marketing and technical team of 12 dedicated solely to Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   They are busy, he says, ``branding'' each of the Republican
presidential candidate's proposals, and they are conducting highly
detailed market research to find out what kind of people support
Forbes, how much money they earn, and how much education they have.
They are even engaging in a little political espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Forbes campaign, health care is not called health care
anymore. Instead, it is ``The Steve Forbes Medical Savings
Account.'' Education is now known as ``The Steve Forbes Power to
Parents Plan.'' Social matters fall under ``America's Moral
Compass,'' and foreign policy is referred to as ``Freedom's
Passport.'' The marketing involves more than just putting clever
labels on policy notions; the campaign has also refined the art of
targeting Forbes's message to the most receptive voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Forbes can be successful at packaging these proposals as
products or offerings that people want to buy, it may be easier for
voters to support him,'' said Segal, 42, Forbes's senior media
adviser for Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   All candidates have political consultants, pollsters, and other
advisers who test messages with focus groups and broader surveys.
But Segal and his team are a different breed. Segal, though he
dabbled in politics as a young man, came to the campaign from
Hensley Segal Rentschler, an award-winning marketing firm here. He
is leading Forbes's campaign by using cutting-edge marketing
methods and Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has been aiming to boost Forbes's support for the
straw poll of GOP presidential candidates in Iowa Saturday. In the
long run, it is an open question of whether these tactics will help
Forbes; he lags in the polls despite launching the campaign's first
major TV ad blitz and spending millions of his own money. But the
Forbes approach could well become commonplace as campaigns become
more technologically savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his shallow support now, Forbes might be the most
serious threat to the front-running candidacy of Texas Governor
George W. Bush, if only because the heir to the Forbes magazine
publishing fortune has the means and the zeal to sustain his
campaign through the last primary. He has paid more than half a
million dollars for the Internet marketing work to Segal's firm.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, 52, is pursuing a dual strategy: promoting himself and
his ideas, and attacking Bush as a tax-and-spend liberal
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   What is unique is the aggressiveness with which Segal is using
the Internet to sell Forbes. He plans to make the Web the principal
point of contact for many potential supporters, and, to that end,
has placed banner advertising on Web sites such as E-Trade and the
New York Times, inviting people to visit www.forbes2000.com.
</P>
<P>
   Once at the Web site, people are asked to fill out
questionnaires describing what sort of activities and organizations
they are involved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows us to send out highly targeted messages,'' said
Segal.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who are attracted to Forbes for his flat-tax proposal,
for example, would receive electronic mail about his economic
plans. Voters who are more interested in his antiabortion message
would receive e-mail about his social positions.
</P>
<P>
   The profiling, Segal hopes, might also help the campaign
encourage people to turn out at campaign events such as the Iowa
straw poll. The campaign has sent e-mail to people who have visited
the Web site instructing them to look through their address book,
Rolodex, and greeting card list and identify relatives and friends
in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But Segal can be even more specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can plug in, `Do I have a flat-tax supporting Rotary Club
member in southern Iowa,' '' said Segal, and the program could
provide him with a list of people he might contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of anything that sophisticated on candidates'
Web sites,'' said Darrell M. West, a professor of political science
at Brown University. ``Most of the candidate Web sites are nothing
more than bulletin boards for one-way information.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Forbes said his approach is not designed to
control voters' access to campaign information, but to learn more
about what voters want to know and give it to them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this on the business side,'' Forbes said. ``People
want in and out, they want something fast, specific, and then they
want to go on to the next thing. They don't want to tarry around.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes compared his unconventional, business-inspired campaign
to Alfred Sloan's battle against Henry Ford in the automobile
world. Sloan took over the bankrupt General Motors when Ford was
running the best and cheapest car-production line. But Sloan needed
to find a new way of taking on Ford.
</P>
<P>
   So Sloan began offering customers new models each year and
different color cars to choose from. ``Ford said, `Here's the one
model and you can have any color as long as it's black _ take it or
leave it,' '' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is create a whole new customer base,
expand the universe,'' Forbes said of the 2000 race. ``If we play
by the usual rules and the usual universe, we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Segal and the Forbes campaign have taken yet another page out of
the business playbook. Just as airlines provide frequent flyer
miles and MCI encourages its customers to sign up friends and
family for its long distance service, the Forbes campaign is
employing incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers who sign people up for their cyber ``precincts'' will
be eligible to win Forbes paraphernalia, such as baseball caps,
T-shirts, and mousepads. There is a Top 10 list, showing who has
recruited the most supporters to their team.
</P>
<P>
   Segal also brings to the Forbes campaign another trait valued
highly in business: an instinct for cutthroat competition.
</P>
<P>
   To cite one example, Segal monitors all of the other campaign
Web sites, and has even signed up as a supporter to receive e-mail
from other campaigns. One day, he got a note from Arizona Senator
John McCain's campaign, notifying him that McCain would be on a
radio talk show in Arizona. The host was conducting a poll to see
whom his listeners supported, Forbes or McCain. The e-mail urged
Segal to call in and vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Segal, however, sent out his own e-mail to all of Forbes's
supporters and encouraged them to vote for Forbes, the winner of
the 1996 Arizona primary. McCain won by a sliver, rather than the
expected landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Segal said, his marketing work is for ``people making
money.'' Even though Forbes is spending money, not making it, Segal
could not be happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most exciting thing I've ever done,'' he said.
``It's a hoot!''

BOXER SEEKS ANOTHER PROBE OF FUEL PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., has asked the
Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether the major oil
companies are trying to drive smaller suppliers in California out
of business through pricing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said Thursday she suspected the price of fuel was being
manipulated by the large companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going after the independent dealers, and the
independents are the last line of defense the consumer has for
cheap gas,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC already is investigating the oil suppliers after several
price spikes in San Francisco and San Diego led to a mountain of
consumer complaints in the spring of 1998. This week, Boxer said
that from July 31 to Aug. 4, the price of wholesale ``unbranded''
gasoline was greater than that of ``branded'' gasoline, and she is
asking that to be explored, too.
</P>
<P>
   Branded gasoline is the supply from refineries that is sold
according to contracts to the major oil companies, and the
unbranded gasoline _ typically less expensive _ is excess fuel that
is sold to independent dealers.
</P>
<P>
   During the period July 31 to Aug. 4, wholesale unbranded gas in
California reached a high of $1.18 per gallon, with branded
gasoline selling for about $1.07 per gallon, said Rob Schlichting,
an analyst with the California Energy Commission. He said that on
Aug. 9, unbranded fuel had dropped to $1.10 per gallon and the
branded variety remained at $1.07.
</P>
<P>
   The major oil refiners denied the pricing reflected
anti-competitive practices.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of unbranded prices being higher than branded
gasoline is ``a very temporary anomaly that occurs during periods
of very tight supply and it is evidence only that the marketplace
is working,'' said Mike Libbey, a spokesman for the Chevron Corp.
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The average daily refinery production in California for the week
ending Aug. 6 was 959,000 barrels per day, which is 7.5 percent
below the production of the same week one year ago, Schlichting
said. It was somewhat less than that one week earlier, when
production was reduced at Mobil Corp.'s Torrance refinery due to an
explosion, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said she has requested that FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky
expand his investigation in California because of the very unusual
circumstances surrounding the price inversion _ that it came just
before this week's major price spike at the pump, and last occurred
in March, again before a price increase.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline in California is some of the costliest in the nation.
Suppliers attribute recent increases in prices at the pump to
tightening world oil supplies, several refinery accidents in the
state and increases typically associated with higher demand during
the summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you found Kmart charging more than Saks Fifth Avenue, you
would question it and that is what is going on in the oil
industry,'' Boxer said Thursday in a telephone conference call.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has subpoenaed documents on pricing practices at the
major companies doing business in California. Separately, the state
attorney general is looking into the prices for any evidence of
anti-competitive forces.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Mangles, a spokeswoman for the Western States Petroleum
Association in Glendale, an oil company trade association, said of
Boxer: ``It seems like the senator keeps trying to create a problem
so that she can push a solution that really isn't necessary. The
market is working. When you have government interference you
typically have adverse effects.''

THE GREAT WHITE WAY IN FALL, WINTER FASHION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Accent marks needed over e in boucle and e in appliqued) 
 
By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fashion, almost by definition, should include an element of
excitement. That said, what's the big deal with all the white in
stores now?
</P>
<P>
   Well, two words ... fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   White is a given for summer, when it so successfully reflects
light and keeps us cooler. Even for spring, whites in nubby boucle
fabrics and other lightweight wools herald a symbolic reawakening
after the dreariness of winter.
</P>
<P>
   But this fall, department store clothing racks look as if a
blizzard has struck, and with the clothes on the racks in August,
it is difficult to describe these as winter whites.
</P>
<P>
   In cities where the past decade has witnessed a dourness in
dress akin to urban camouflage, out-of-season white is as rare as
whooping craneson Seventh Avenue. Hence its element of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   The trend to white began more than a year ago when Michael Kors
sent out a bright white and very ladylike reefer coat for the staid
Paris fashion house Celine. Fashion editors and groupies snapped up
the design, even though it drew dirt like a magnet.
</P>
<P>
   This year more designers followed Kors' lead, so many that women
are likely to look like snow bunnies from Labor Day until they open
their Valentines.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of designers included whites and off-whites _ from
cream to palomino blonde _ in their collections, in fabrics that
ranged from paper-weight quilted silks and nylons to felted wools
as thick and heavy as army surplus blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Felted wools have flat surfaces and are usually sewn with their
cut edges to the outside, as one sews Ultrasuede. Felt was
traditionally a serviceable student and sportswear fabric, popular
decades ago for uniform jumpers and treated to repel water in
British outdoor gear.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, there were those appliqued poodle circle skirts,
and from the late '60s through the mid-'70s, at the height of the
hippie era, felt garments included vests, skirts and coats accented
with felt appliques and naif embroidery. Think Heidi clothes and
you have the idea. Ready or not, these styles are also making a
comeback this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the upscale designer whites, especially those from Ralph
Lauren and Donna Karan, are thick and woolly, designed to be
layered and even worn with white buck shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Whites from Helmut Lang look more high-tech, almost like space
suits. White is a clean-slate way to greet the millennium, even if
you don't plan to board a spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers hedged their bets for fall and winter, mixing
white with other colors or neutrals.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways with white is adding it to black, where its
pristine starkness adds snap to the black. For that reason, adding
a couple of white separates or a coat is a fine way to update all
the black most women already have in their closets.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Jacobs added a wool jacket and turtleneck over black velvet
pants and black leather boots, an especially elegant look for day.
</P>
<P>
   At Emporio Armani, a short black bolero jacket with long sleeves
topped a blonde tummy-teaser sweater worn over off-white pants.
</P>
<P>
   The whites with the most impact, however, are those worn only
with other whites, especially in the city. Environments that
sometimes call for urban survival gear are surprising places to
find women _ and even men, this year _ decked head-to-ankle, if not
head-to-toe, in white.
</P>
<P>
   One of the softest, yet richest ways to wear white will be with
furs, either full-blown fur coats or simple accessories such as fur
hats, muffs, collars or purses.
</P>

CANADA REOPENS GATE TO ITS IMMIGRANT PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Too often the story of Canada is told as
the history of the original colonizers, the French and the British,
Canada's ``two solitudes,'' whose deep antagonisms have kept the
country politically off-balance since the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   Although any visitor to any Canadian city would recognize that
this is a nation built of comers from every part of the earth, the
immigrant experience has never been celebrated with quite the same
fervor as in the United States. It has not defined the national
psyche nearly as much as the old quarrels between Quebec and ``the
rest of Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as part of a push to promote greater awareness of country's
polyglot past, Canada has reopened Halifax's Pier 21 immigrant
processing complex as the first national historic site
commemorating the human waves that made Canada one of the two most
multiethnic societies in the world, along with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century, Pier 21 served as Canada's major port
of entry for immigrants, refugees, and war brides. As immigrant
patterns changed, the hulking structure was abandoned and stood
derelict for nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In July, however, the rat-infested ruins were resurrected as a
gleaming multimedia center telling the immigrant tale through video
screens, interactive computer links, and the more typical displays
of old photographs and artifacts. The timing has coincided with
continued migration, in airplanes from such hot spots as Kosovo or,
illegally, in evasive ships from China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada has has not focused much on its immigrants,'' said Ruth
Goldbloom, president of the society that led the effort to
refurbish Pier 21 as a museum and exhibition center. ``But we felt
if we didn't start capturing these people's stories now, it would
never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1928 to 1971, roughly 1 million immigrants and refugees
entered Canada through Pier 21. Although billed as ``Canada's Ellis
Island,'' the facility probably had a greater impact on this
country's small population than the more-famous New York immigrant
center had upon the much larger United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pier 21 officials, one of every five living
Canadians has a blood connection to the site _ either they or some
relative passed through its portals.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Dalla Riva of Montreal fearfully disembarked at Pier 21 in
autumn 1953, at age 7, and remembers well the chaotic clamor of
unfamiliar languages echoing through the vast processing hall. With
its forbidding facades and smoke-belching ships riding the greasy
tide, Halifax was not the Canada he'd imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Back in northern Italy, where his family had boarded the SS
Omland with as much fear of the unknown as hope for the future,
Dalla Riva envisioned a vast snowy forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd thought we'd be living pioneer-style in the bush,'' he
said after visiting the harborside structure. ``But we simply
boarded a train for Ontario, where my father would work in the
steel mills of Hamilton. It was the typical immigrants' tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not entirely typical: Dalla Riva would escape the drudgery
of feeding furnaces to win glory as a Canadian football great,
playing tight end for the Montreal Alouettes in the 1970s, and is
today an executive with BGL Brokerage, a Montreal customs firm.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like so many foreign-born Canadians, he still recalls the
footsteps he took down the gangplank as his most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pier 21 was a kind of magic door for immigrants. You were
coming into a land where anything was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the brick-and-steel structure, with its slatted benches
and quarantine wards, newcomers waited in long lines with squawling
infants, their frayed identity papers and their possessions stuffed
in cardboard suitcases or burlap sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I was on this pier I was so seasick and
frightened,'' recalled Rozina Chute, 61, who arrived as a refugee
from Romania in 1956 and last month paid an emotional visit to the
pier. ``My family had $5 and my father's carpenter tools. Not much
for a new life.''
</P>
<P>
   The reopening of Pier 21 as a historic site points to the
increasing pride of Canadians in their immigrant past. Until a push
by a Halifax-based community group, the complex was forgotten, just
another decaying harborfront relic. That it was the last
immigration ``shed'' still standing in Canada seemed nothing worth
memorializing.
</P>
<P>
   But now thousands of visitors are streaming through its gates
daily as the pier rapidly becomes one of the old port city's prime
attractions. Said Mary Tulle, director of marketing for Pier 21 and
the granddaughter of an immigrant who passed through its gates from
Lebanon: ``This was Canada's front door. The soul of our country is
seeped into these old bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some ugly blotches on that soul.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate Jews trying to escape Hitler's Germany were denied
entry to Canada by Prime Minister Mackenzie King, a hard line that
condemned many to death in concentration camps. Barred also, until
the 1960s, were most Asians along with those deemed
``feeble-minded,'' ``loathsome,'' or, perhaps worst of all,
sympathetic to communism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for a country that until the 1920s remained much more
ethnically homogenous than the United States _ dominated mainly by
descendants of the original English, Scots, and French colonizers _
the doors were flung remarkably wide. The country desperately
needed laborers and farmers, and after World War II, especially,
was ready to welcome most transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed by the real warmth of Canadians,'' said Alex
Deloukadis, who brought his young family from Greece in 1951,
settling in Montreal. ``I thought I was coming to the frozen edge
of the Earth. I hardly spoke a word of English. Yet this strange
country said, `Now this is your country, too.' I've never stopped
being amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   He was one of 93,578 individuals to pass through Pier 21 that
year. Most were trundled aboard Canadian National Railway trains
waiting just outside the immigration hall for passage to points
west _ to the factories of Montreal, the mines of northern Ontario,
the farms of Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalie Silberman Abella, today an Ontario judge, was among the
thousands of Jewish refugees finally admitted in the terrible wake
of World War II. Her parents were survivors of the Nazi death camp
Treblinka.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every immigrant who landed at Pier 21 has two stories: the
story they came from and the story they started when they landed in
Canada,'' she said at the dedication of the new interpretive
center.
</P>
<P>
   The $6.2 million restoration project, sponsored equally by the
Canadian government and private donations, has transformed the
battered ruins of Pier 21 into a multimedia showpiece dedicated to
the immigrant experience in Canada. There are photographs and
videotaped oral histories as well as poignant displays of passports
and other paraphernalia, from ticket stubs to a tattered teddy
bear.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most powerful is the memory book in which visitors,
many of them immigrants who entered through Pier 21 decades ago,
can jot down impressions or memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a day goes by that I do not give thanks to Canada,'' wrote
Georg Zichirman, a Romanian native, 34 years after his arrival at
the pier. Others, including retired football player Dalla Riva,
have made regular pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
   It's sometimes surprising what immigrants remember most clearly
about their first few days in the new land.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the vastness of the country, of course,'' said Dalla
Riva. ``But I was really stunned by the sliced white bread. I'd
never heard of such a thing. It was soft, and with not too much
flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Most immigrants arrived at Pier 21 aboard immense steamships,
such as the Beaverbrae, the Regina Calgaric, the Conte Biancamano,
the Arosa Kulm, the Lady Nelson, the Nelly, and the Nieuw
Amsterdam. Others came crammed aboard tiny vessels.
</P>
<P>
   But most immigrants interviewed recalled not so much the
difficulty of their voyage but the sheer joy of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bleak as the immigration hall was, as confused and
frightened as I must have been, the instant that official stamped
`landed immigrant' onto my pass card is seared into memory as the
greatest moment of my life. I'd been accepted and could breathe
free,'' said Joseph Panetta, who arrived from Malta in 1949 and now
lives in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything that sets immigrants apart from
native-born Canadians or Americans, it's probably the intensity of
our patriotism,'' Panetta said. ``I see my whole life as striving
to be worthy of my adopted homeland.''

UNDERRATED GERRY FORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We make too much of Richard Nixon. And too little of
Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   In our politics, journalism, history, and pop culture, Nixon is
celebrated, plumbed, defamed, psychoanalyzed, defended, found
wanting, and periodically reinvented. This week's 25th anniversary
of Nixon's being driven from office via the 1974 impeachment threat
triggered the usual media landslide: grainy footage of the jowly
hero/villain, eyebrows gloomy, wattles wattling, the furtive
glances, the excruciating body language.
</P>
<P>
   Good old Gerry Ford, on the other hand, is almost an
afterthought in national politics. Yet, if you measured a
president's greatness by the degree of improvement in the country's
well-being during his stewardship, Ford's was a far greater reign
than Nixon's, or that of a number of other contemporary presidents,
for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Did Ford hand over to his successor a country that was in far
better shape than when he'd received it? Without a doubt. President
Clinton did not overstate the case when he hung a Medal of Freedom
around Ford's neck Wednesday. ``America was stronger, calmer, and
more self-confident'' thanks to Ford, the accidental vice president
who became president, assumed power after Nixon flew off the lawn
in that dramatic helicopter liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our long national nightmare is over,'' said Ford simply on
that momentous August afternoon. Said Clinton: ``America was, in
other words, more like Gerald Ford himself . . . (he) represents
what is best about politics and what is best about America.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaming and modest _ ``Im not a Lincoln, I'm a Ford'' was his
gagline _ the Michigander who had spent a quarter century in the
House Representatives smiled broadly. Along with a half-dozen other
worthies, Ford gracefully accepted the honor, which was spawned in
a different time.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton impeachment drive was a mockery of the serious and
bipartisan Watergate impeachment that drove Nixon out. A
second-term president, reelected in a landslide 49-state victory
(``Massachusetts _ the one and only!''), Nixon walked the plank at
swordpoint after Senator Barry Goldwater told him: ``Go.'' By
contrast, the Monica-driven Clinton saga was tragedy reprised as
farce.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was a creature of the consensus-building, cooperation,
coalitions, and compromises that characterized the postwar
Congress. When he was picked by Nixon to replace the corrupt
then-vice president Spiro Agnew, one of the first persons Ford
phoned was his colleague, golfing buddy and occasional sparring
partner, Tip O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   His was not the rancorous House that Newt built. Getting along
with the other side was a trait much prized then, but now despised
by the rule-or-ruin claque who took up Gingrich's fang-and-claw
approach to demonizing the opposition into the enemy, cultural,
religious, regional, whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth recalling, with a shake of the head, that the
current majority leader of the US Senate, Trett Lott, was then a
tyro Republican congressman who voted to exonerate Nixon. Since
Lott led the charge to impeach Clinton, we can only assume that the
congressman regards Monicagate as far more perilous to the
Constitution than Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his sagacity in appealing to the regional, cultural,
racial, and class divisions that cleave America still, Nixon was
able to thread his way through the political underbrush to the
highest office in the land. That says something about the people
who elected him, first narrowly in riot-torn 1968, then
overwhelminglhy in '72.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, I argue, is the quintessential American politician
precisely because he so accurately mirrored both sides of our civic
nature, the sunny side, that wants to spread peace, light, and the
fruits of democracy, and our darker angel, the one who chisels the
tax man, wants traffic tickets fixed rather than paid, and in his
heart of hearts says ``screw the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The devil is so much more fun than the blandly good, the
regular, the predictable. And because Gerry Ford was so bland,
regular, and predictable, he did not sufficiently provide the
entertainment level that Americans had come to expect and then
demand of their presidents, beginning with Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, the most athletic of all the presidents since Teddy
Roosevelt, was lampooned on ``Saturday Night Live'' as a buffoon, a
clumsy, oafish, boring Middle American, bonking onlookers with golf
balls, falling down on ski slopes, knocking his noggin into
microphones. As we've seen recently, television comedians are
better at telling their audience where we have been, not where we
are going. Jay Leno had to have been the most dumbfounded man in
America when the Clinton impeachment failed. His writers were the
next-to-last to know.
</P>
<P>
   Ford seems unruffled by the wraithlike grip Nixon still holds
over the media. Had he not pardoned Nixon, Ford probably would have
been reelected, just as Jimmy Carter probably insured his own
defeat when he refused to bomb Iran after the US hostages were
seized. Though you'd never believe it from what you read and hear,
presidents sometimes do what they think is the right thing, even
when they know it will cost them dearly.

AT 36,000 FEET, AGGRAVATION UNDER PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 15, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I were typing this at 36,000 feet, you couldn't read it.
</P>
<P>
   Because my elbows would be in the short ribs of the passengers
to the left and right of me, my fingers would be forced into an
unnatural position, and my normal difficulties with spelling and
grammar would be aggravated to the point of indecipherability.
</P>
<P>
   Shoehorning this bod into your basic airline coach seat is a
losing proposition over any length of time. So when word came that
United Airlines will add 5 or 6 inches of legroom for frequent
fliers and suckers _ I mean (itals)passengers(unitals) _ paying
full coach fare, I'm all ears.
</P>
<P>
   Or feet, knees, elbows, and thighs. I admit up front _ I never
(itals)sit(unitals) up front, but I routinely (itals)admit(unitals)
up front _ that this column is not for everyone. Only the large
need read on. The president of United, a man named Rono Dutta,
discovered that business travelers make up only 9 percent of his
customers, but they account for 36 percent of sales, and they want
more seat for their dough.
</P>
<P>
   Rono, I have some more figures for you: 6-2, 225, and 15. That's
height, weight, and shoe size for Cap'n Dave, the frequent flier
often found in a funk. Who among us has not sat glumly at the end
of a long aisle in coach, knowing the overhead bin is already
overflowing, watching some late-arriving widebody of a passenger
waddle down the aisle, sweatily lugging the carry-ons, scanning the
seat numbers, steering unerringly for the vacant middle seat in
your row? Then you have to cough up the mumbled greeting, the wan
smile, and endure the knowing winks of your luckier neighbors as
some 18-wheeler of a traveler takes a deep breath and oozes into
the seat next to you.
</P>
<P>
   If God meant us to fit together like this, he'd have equipped us
with standardized legs and arms that fit together like stackable
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   It has somehow escaped the geniuses who run the other airlines
that the knee bone's connected to the thigh bone, the thighbone
connects to the hipbone, etc., etc. As a possessor of the
traditional allotment of bones, joints, sinews, muscles, etc., it
has been my distinct displeasure to groan inwardly every time I
descend the skyway into the fuselage of an airplane plainly
configured by the Lilliputian Ergonomics Corp. Don't they have any
big people in aircraft design? Where are the size-challenged? The
fat folks? And the bigfeet? Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Because we oversize types are certainly not represented in the
brainstorming that goes on when these morons get together and some
birdbrain asks: ``So, gang, how many more seats can we get into
this 747 if we take out six more toilets and make everybody in
coach scrunch up another 6 inches?''
</P>
<P>
   So discomforting is a coach seat on international flights that I
now routinely ask the agent _ no, not ask, (itals)beg, beseech, and
implore(unitals) _ for a little extra legroom. An aisle seat, for
starters? Perhaps _ be still my heart _ a little something leggy in
the emergency exit aisle? What? All booked in coach? You'll have to
bump me up to business class? Oh, joy!
</P>
<P>
   On a flight over the Atlantic in May, I'd settled for the front
row of coach at the ticket agent's suggestion. Sure, it was
slightly better on the legroom. She just never told me that because
the tray table had to be stowed inside my armrest, I'd have a whole
22 inches in which to stuff my butt. For six (itals)hours!(unitals)
I bet the International War Crimes Tribunal has rules requiring
better treatment than that. I concluded Aer Lingus must be used to
dealing with skinny or runty passengers in coach. What does
Ireland's rugby team do when it goes on tour? Call SwissAir?
</P>
<P>
   These management consultants and market researchers who tell the
airline chiefs what they want to hear _ ``Take out four more
toilets and add three rows of benches in coach, J.P., and that'll
be $97,000 for the advice'' _ all fly first, or at least business
class. So what do they know?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of paying for all these studies as to the root causes of
air rage, why don't the airlines simply make every executive fly
coach? Anthropologists explained this long ago: Simian creatures
crammed together in uncomfortable settings over long periods of
time, fed indifferent food, liquored up with copious amounts of
alcohol, and treated to inane or lying public address announcements
interrupting a violent, explosion-filled in-flight movie, tend to
behave rather badly.
</P>
<P>
   Pile onto those provocations the certain knowledge that nobody
within sight of you paid the same price you had to pay. Some of
them are flying for free _ they sold their earlier reservations for
freebies to compensate for the overbooking that is now routine.
Some people in seats just as crummy as yours paid half what you
paid, or twice what you paid, simply because their number came up
differently in the roulette wheel of airline pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone ever get to ask the airline executive: What is so
hard to understand about the resentment and rage people feel, when
your pricing structures are so arbitrary, unfair, and designed to
infuriate? United is taking a small step in the right direction _
lengthwise, spending $30 million to space out six to 11 rows at the
front of coach on 450 domestic jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   The new Economy Plus section will still not accommodate those of
us routinely assigned to steerage. The scheme is a lot like the
Republicans' tax reform plan: It actually helps the haves, and only
pretends to help have-nots. But anytime a coach passenger can go
from 31 inches between rows to 35 or 36, I'm for it. Rono, I've got
news for you and other airline executives, all of whom fly first
class because they simply could not bear it back there with the
sweaty proletariat: Give' em an inch, or 6, and they'll take your
air miles.

GUNS THAT ARE EASIER TO GET THAN DRIVER'S LICENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let us do away with the terms of denial, phrases like ``another
senseless shooting'' or ``random mass shootings.'' The damning of
the perpetrators can no longer end merely with ``loner'' and
``madman.'' We just might get some action around gun violence if we
call it for what it really is:
</P>
<P>
   A riot.
</P>
<P>
   Riots have often forced this nation to deal with reality. For
example, the riots of 1967, dubbed ``the long, hot summer,''
resulted in President Johnson's Kerner Commission report. The
report called for many measures that resulted in programs to foster
opportunity and equality for African-Americans. Many
African-Americans who today are in their 40s and 50s were direct
beneficiaries of those programs.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, when Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy
were assassinated, President Johnson spoke out even further, this
time against guns. Johnson, in an act of leadership rarely seen on
Capitol Hill today, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``On occasions before, I have spoken of the terrible toll
inflicted on our people by firearms: 750,000 Americans dead since
the turn of the century. This is far more than have died at the
hands of our enemies in all the wars we have fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told the Congress and the nation of the brutal
loopholes in our laws. Two million guns were sold in the United
States last year. Far too many were bought by the demented, the
deranged, the hardened criminal, and the convict, the addict, and
the alcoholic. We cannot expect these irresponsible people to be
prudent in their protection of us, but we can expect the Congress
to protect us from them. . . . So today, I call upon the Congress,
in the name of sanity, in the name of safety _ and in the name of
an aroused nation _ to give America the Gun Control Law it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   After the assassinations, Johnson did get some gun- control
measures passed. But this country has watched the loopholes become
bullet holes. For instance, in that ``long, hot summer'' _ the
summer that forced a president and Congress into a bipartisan panic
to find ways to keep the ghettos from exploding _ 84 people died.
In death toll alone, that is not all that much hotter than the
temperature we're experiencing right now.
</P>
<P>
   The spree of multiple shootings in offices and schools has left
at least 50 people dead and 36 others wounded in the last year. The
school shootings of the last two years have left 31 dead and 73
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
   These, of course, are the more spectacular outbreaks in a nation
where more than 30,000 people will die by year's end from gunfire.
The death toll has been declining in recent years, but the decline
is of the barest note to the rest of the developed world, which has
far lower rates of gun killing. It is even less noteworthy when the
latest siege of killings suggest an America where even the least
bit of frustration on the part of the deranged makes the rest of us
feel more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be an accident that at least three of the mass
shootings, the one Tuesday at a Jewish community center in Los
Angeles, the one-man killing spree near Chicago, and the horror at
Columbine High School (not to mention the Oklahoma City bombing)
were partially or fully inspired by racist and anti-Semitic hate.
The killers might have acted alone, but they were nurtured, if not
overtly encouraged, by hate groups who swear they don't advocate
murdering Jews and people of color but have to know in their heart
that someone in their midst will be infused with just enough hate
to pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not we actually have any more rage in our society is
subject to debate, but it is no accident that so many of the
killings involve people with histories of mental illness. We have
so drastically slashed institutions and services that mental health
is the hardest thing for many people to obtain coverage for. With
guns being easier to obtain than driver's licenses, we have too
many lit matches looking for spilled kerosene. The shooting at the
Jewish community center happened in Los Angeles, but the guts of
the gun came from Maine. In that respect, it was a coast-to-coast
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Kerner Commission report said the riots of 1967 came at a
time of ``rising expectations'' but continued poverty in ghettos.
Today's riot comes at a time when the economy is booming, but many
people still feel threatened by financial insecurity and a
multicultural society. That might help explain why most mass
shootings are done by straight white males raised on the
anti-affirmative action politics of the 1980s. Their victims could
be anyone, but they are driven by the paranoia of losing their
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   We keep calling these shootings senseless, but when they add up,
a lot makes sense. This has been a riot that politicians and the
gun lobby have tried to blind us to. The death toll by now should
be so visible that in the name of sanity, in the name of safety,
and in the name of an aroused nation, America gets the Gun Control
Law it needs.

GEEKFEST MARKS THE SUMMER OF '99 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MESQUITE, Texas _ Even if the frenetic, violent and rapid-fire
world of online death-match gaming is not your cup of tea, you'd
have to admit that the scene last weekend at QuakeCon 99 was pretty
cool.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people traveled sometimes thousands of miles to
attend, and half of them brought along their own computers. In a
huge convention center ballroom, they set up their systems on
tables and jacked into a computer network that had more than 700
machines linked by a mile and a half of cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough computer power in this room to run the New York
Stock Exchange,'' one of the network engineers boasted. And given
that gamers usually own the most muscular PCs around, with the
fastest processors and tons of memory, that probably was not an
exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Those who made the pilgrimage to Mesquite, near Dallas, were the
hardiest of the hard core. ``No, I don't have a hotel room,'' I
overheard one gamer say to another late Friday night. ``I didn't
drive this far to sleep. Keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   What they kept playing _ Friday morning until midafternoon
Sunday _ was the early test version of Quake III Arena, the next
product from id Software, whose offices were less than a mile away.
Although Q3A, as it's called, won't be available for a while, the
test version is in great shape and has been drawing raves from
players _ even though it has only three playing levels and a subset
of the full version's features.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy _ we're running a huge event like this on a
test version,'' said John Carmack, an id co-founder. ``We'll be
releasing the game relatively soon.''
</P>
<P>

dows-, Macintosh- and Linux-based computers at
www.quake3arena.com.)

   &QL; 
DEATH-MATCH IS THE THING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past games in id's best-selling Quake series, there will
be no monsters to blast in the single-player aspect of the game.
Instead, Quake III Arena is all about death-match play _ battling
the computer-generated images of other people who connect to the
game over a network or across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This is what has made id's Doom and then Quake series of games
so enduringly popular _ playing against other humans. By focusing
on this aspect in Q3A, id hopes to expose more people to
death-match play. The single-player part of the game will involve
action against computer-simulated players known as ``bots,'' which
will be considered as training for eventually getting online.
</P>
<P>
   This year's QuakeCon had two main components. In the ``Bring
Your Own Computer'' area, open 24 hours a day, more than 500 people
played against each other.
</P>
<P>
   In separate spaces nearby, clusters of computers were used for
tournaments. The largest group of PCs contained Advanced Micro
Devices' new 600-megahertz Athlon chip, which is a serious
challenger to Intel Corp.'s Pentium III processors. Here, a
500-person tournament was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, a cluster of Apple's Power Mac- &QL; 
intosh G3s were used to conduct smaller contests, including a
tournament for media people. (Yes, I played. No, I didn't win. In
fact, I was seriously humiliated _ 47 to minus 5 _ by a player who
went on to play in the media tourney finals, where he was soundly
beaten.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MOST GAMERS ARE NICE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first-person-shooter genre of computer games has gotten some
nasty press lately, because the killers in the Columbine High
School massacre were fans of id's Doom and Quake games. But at
QuakeCon, I found in person what I'd experienced from dealing with
the online Quake community _ that the vast majority of fans of the
game are exceptionally nice people.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Will Barton, a 17-year-old who had driven all
the way by himself from Wytheville, Va. Soft-spoken, clean-cut and
technically savvy, he'd assembled his own computer just to bring
along.
</P>
<P>
   Barton got knocked out of the tournament early, but still had a
good time. He worked as a volunteer, got to rub shoulders with some
of the stars of the convention and came away with a nifty T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks, he'll start his freshman year at Virginia Tech,
but forget about that milestone. Playing Quake III Arena in a room
full of hundreds of other ``Quake geeks'' is what he'll remember
most about the summer of 1999.

`TWIN' EXPLORES LONELINESS, IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TWIN FALLS IDAHO 
Directed and written by: Michael and Mark Polish 
Starring: Mark and Michael Polish, Michele Hicks, Lesley Ann
Warren, Patrick Bauchau, Jon Gries, Garrett Morris, William Katt 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too many films play like something David Lynch shot on a bad
day. But ``Twin Falls Idaho'' plays like something Lynch might
shoot on a good day, assuming he ever has one again. It's bizarre,
shadowy, enticingly eerie and more moving than it would have been
if its makers had merely intended to settle for a freak show.
Instead, it's something more poetic, more tantalizingly original.
It's the best twin movie since ``Dead Ringers,'' but while that
movie was murderous, this one is about a pair of gentle conjoined
twins doing their best to stay alive in a world they have not found
to be filled with embrace, starting when their horrified mother
dumped them early on.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 25 years later, Blake and Francis are back in town, holed
up in the Platonic essence of seedy hotels, figuring out how to
handle the reunion they had planned with her, and gathering their
strength for it. To pass the time, they decide to celebrate their
birthday by ordering the services of a prostitute. The woman named
Penny can't handle their condition, and flees. But she forgets her
purse, returns, settles down, becomes curious about their permanent
bond and the subtle and profound ways they communicate, and sticks
around. Soon, she falls in love with Blake, the stronger of the
two, whose healthy heart is keeping Francis alive by pumping for
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when somebody finally comes between the brothers is
mesmerizing, not just morbidly, but philosophically, as issues of
bonding and identity and completeless are plumbed. Eventually and
not surprisingly, it is revealed that Penny, driven by guilt over
abandoning her own handicapped son, has intimacy issues. While the
twin characters are rare, the prostitute's role could easily have
degenerated into cliche. But so delicately and urgently does
newcomer Michele Hicks play it, and with so convincing a degree of
emotional involvement, that she becomes as much a reason to be
drawn into the film's gravitational field as the hypnotically
fascinating twins.
</P>
<P>
   Played by real (although not conjoined) twins Mark and Michael
Polish, they fill the screen with poignancy, reserve, and mystery.
Obviously the real-life brothers are attuned to those extra nuances
of communication available to twin siblings and few others. Their
heightened sensitivity is an element in the film's steady pull on
us. As makers of the film as well as its stars, they put on screen
an impressive level of craftsmanship. Their film, deliberately
drained of color, is a thing of oddly sheltering gloom. Wearing its
measured pace and carefully controlled tonal palette in such a way
as to conjure up a protective armor of the psyche, it's not unlike
the retro narrow-lapeled, three-button, touchingly formal double
that suggests a carapace for the fragile, vulnerable creatures
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Without succumbing to bathos, the film makes incisive dramatic
use of the fact that the only time the brothers can venture forth
freely into the rest of the world is on Halloween night, which they
do. There's a painful meeting with their long-unseen mother (Lesley
Ann Warren), and Penny's back story is filled in by a world-weary,
humane physician (Patrick Bauchau). But the Polish brothers and
Hicks' presence as an unanticpated extension of their circumscribed
lives are rightly at the center of the hauntingly unforgettable,
nocturnally tender ``Twin Falls Idaho.'' In its dreamlike way, it
says more than any film this year about identity and isolation. So
pared-down yet so vivid is its flavor that you look to paintings _
Edward Hopper's, say _ rather to than other films for ways to
describe the way ``Twin Falls Idaho'' speaks its language of
loneliness.

BOSTON'S `BLAIR WITCH' CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though perhaps not top-of-mind these days, there is a venerable
Boston-Hollywood money axis. Back when the Bank of Boston was known
as The First (before it became ``Terry Murray's ATM''), the Hub was
an early and generous lender to the emerging movie studios. Not for
nothing was former bank officer William Thompson a key figure in
David McClintick's classic 1982 Hollywood expose, ``Indecent
Exposure.'' But I digress.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bain Capital of Copley Square bought a Hollywood
company called Live Entertainment. At the time, Live was best known
for the identity of its former owner: Jose Menendez, the
shotgun-impaired father of miscreant offspring Lyle and Erik.
Majority shareholder Bain changed Live's name to Artisan
Entertainment and installed Mark Curcio, the head of Bain's Los
Angeles consulting office, as chief executive officer. Geoff
Rehnert in Bain's Boston office monitors the Artisan investment.
Earlier this year, Rehnert was floating his name as a possible
Republican challenger for Ted Kennedy's Senate seat, before he came
to his senses. His former Bain Capital colleague, Mitt Romney, rode
into that same valley of political death in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we care about all this? Because earlier this year Artisan
forked over $1 million for the rights to distribute a small-scale
independent film called ``The Blair Witch Project.'' The company
spent several hundred thousand dollars upgrading the film print and
pumped $15 million into marketing and distribution. The rest is
what passes for history in Bill Clinton's America: Artisan stood
back as ``Blair Witch'' (initial production cost, $30,000;
projected box office take: $100 million) turned the Summer of Stars
Wars into the summer of slacker horror hype. The Boston-Hollywood
connection appears to be back in business.

   Boston University is flogging two books by Dr. Christopher
Reaske, its vice president for development and alumni relations, on
the university's home page, www.bu.edu. That might be
understandable if the books dealt with education, but in fact
Reaske is pumping two books he wrote in the 1980s _ ``The Compleat
Clammer'' and ``The Compleat Crab and Lobster Book,'' which are
back in print. The BU Web site leads you directly to pictures of
Dr. Reaske (not the kind of doctor who can cure you; he's a PhD in
literature) knee-deep in tidewater, and of course to the Amazon and
Barnes &AMP; Noble sites, where you can buy Dr. R's contributions to
clam-und-crabology.
</P>
<P>
   Reaske's virtual Vanity Fair also quotes from a lengthy article
in the university-sponsored newspaper, headlined: ``Knee-Deep Veep:
Alumni and development VP Reaske's shellfish books back on the
shelves.'' Choice excerpts: `` . . . when he's not raking in the
clams for BU, Reaske is digging for real bivalves _ in East Coast
tidal flats, usually on Shelter Island, N.Y., his favorite vacation
spot.'' And: ``A few weeks before Reaske began to write the book,
he observed terns diving for fish and noted their smooth, symphonic
efficiency as they hunted. `Observing these beautiful birds made my
principal goal in this book come clear _ to convey a sense of
``doing it right,'' to explain that there are time-proven ways to
gather clams efficiently and to do so in harmony with nature,' he
writes. With a little practice, one can use a clam rake `almost
like a dancing partner.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Reaske says he didn't know that his books, which he calls
``legitimate academic works,'' were being teased off the BU site:
``I haven't had any involvement with this.'' Deflecting the bullet
aimed at his boss, BU's associate vice president for university
relations, David Lampe, says it was his decision to hype the books
on the Web site; ``I thought it had news value. It's just like any
other university, when faculty produce books of general interest,
you do what you can to promote them. Nobody's misusing any
resources here.''

MILDEW MAY BE UNDER TUB CAULK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 15, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I put a bead of white silicone caulk between the tile and my
tub, and it works very nicely. However, there is mildew on it that
I cannot get rid of, even when using bleach and water to kill it.
What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD SHAMES, Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah, the mildew that will not die. I think it is because the
mildew is growing under and through the caulk, not on top of it.
Or, the black marks are not mildew. That's not much of a help
because still nothing seems to take it off. OK, if that is the
case, dig out the old silicone, treat the joint with bleach to kill
any mold that might be still there and to keep it from growing
through the caulk. Rinse thoroughly, and install new caulk. Or,
instead of caulk, sandless grout, which will give better
performance, I feel, than caulk. If caulk worked for you, that's
cool.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know that some wall-to-wall carpet lumps up in humid
weather as it unstretches, then flattens out again in dry weather.
My nylon carpet humps up permanently. How can I get it to flatten
out?
</P>
<P>
   MARIAN HATCH, Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Some nylon wall-to-wall carpeting will stretch and unstretch
more than other materials. You could have it restretched, which
will make it flat for a while, but probably not permanently. Better
yet is to replace it with wool, which I think is the best material
for any kind of carpeting except indoor-outdoor carpeting, unless
you are allergic to wool. If not, go for it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The siding on my house is Texture 1-11, the plywood panels
grooved to look like vertical board siding. I don't like it, and I
don't want to paint it anymore. Could I have stucco put on that
siding? If you had your druthers, what would you do?
</P>
<P>
   ARA AYKANIAN, Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, the responsibility rests heavily on the handyman's aging
shoulders. But that is OK because the handyman has his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   First off, stucco, while a good product, is not very common
today, and there is only one stucco company that I know of that
does it in this area. And, some houses simply don't look very good
stuccoed; yours may be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   As for my druthers, that's an easy one. I suggest you install
white cedar shingles, and let them weather to that Cape Cod silver
so typical of New England. You say the window and door frames
(casings) are set on the Texture 1-11; that means that the Texture
1-11 is not only siding but also sheathing, the skin of the house
on which siding is usually attached.
</P>
<P>
   With this setup, all you have to do is put up Tyveck, the
standard material for installing under shingles or clapboards. You
can pry up the casing a bit so you can slip Tyvek under it for
further weatherproofing. Then put on the shingles. Since the window
and door casings are sitting on the Texture 1-11, the shingles will
butt up against them nicely. If not, install a wood molding around
the window and door casings to bring them out a little further for
proper shingle-butting.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like the way the white cedar shingles weather,
apply one coat of a bleaching oil.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You mentioned putting wedges under clapboards to open them up
to allow water vapor to escape, with the aim of preventing peeling
of paint. I have a lot of blistering paint, but where can I get
those wedges? I tried Home Depot, which claimed it has none.
</P>
<P>
   TOM SCOTT, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I know they exist, because a caller informed me that they are
plastic, not aluminum as I once said. I checked a few catalogs
without success. Try Home Depot, and find a clerk who knows his
merchandise. Or, check a local well-stocked hardware store or
lumber yard.
</P>
<P>
   And if all else fails, you can make your own wedges from white
or red cedar shingles. Cut a wedge an inch long, an inch wide and
1/8 to 316 inch thick, and slip it under the clapboard, every 16
inches or so. You will need a lot of them, but if they work, your
Herculean labor is rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My chimney has a 2-foot-deep well at the bottom, just below
the outside cleanout door. It keeps filling with water, and I have
to bail it out fairly frequently. I have a chimney cap on top, to
keep out rainwater. The water must be from condensation of burning
wood, although I use well-cured hardwood in my stove. How can I let
that water drain out?
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS McQUILLAN, Manomet, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I was going to suggest you fill the 2-foot well and let the
water drain out the clean-out door set slightly ajar. But that well
is there for a purpose, to collect ashes from the wood burner; if
there were no well, ashes could conceivably build up until they
block the inlet from the stovepipe, causing a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, install a weep hole at the bottom of that well, with
a thin plastic tube running from the well through the chimney and
outdoors. This way the liquid will run out without staining the
outside of the chimney with soot, creosote, and other pollutants.
</P>
<P>

WITH `MORRIS MATH,' NET PICKS DON'T ADD UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chip Morris knows something about technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As manager of T. Rowe Price's $6.8 billion Science &AMP; Technology
fund, he has picked enough good technology stocks to generate an
average annual return of 33 percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't found an awful lot of Internet stocks to buy. As
he told shareholders early this year, ``In our view the current
valuation of virtually every Internet-related company grossly
exceeds any reasonable expectation of future economic returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris could make that statement because he has a method of
putting a value on Internet stocks, even those that don't make a
dime. The system allows him ``to slice through the BS'' surrounding
the stocks, as he puts it. It also lets him know when the stocks
have fallen far enough to be attractive _ a good thing to know
given the recent tumble in Internet shares.
</P>
<P>
   The method is pretty straightforward. To start, Morris and his
colleagues make an earnings estimate for each Internet company
based on the assumption that it will someday be as profitable as
its real-world competitors. In other words, an on-line bookstore
will earn profit margins comparable to an existing bookstore; an
Internet media company will be roughly as profitable as a
traditional media company.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Morris calculates a price/earnings ratio for each
company. Then he looks at projected five-year growth rates. Putting
the two figures together he arrives at a number, which goes by the
offputting name, ``price/earnings ratio to growth rate multiple.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds complicated, but the idea is pretty basic: It's a way
of calculating how much investors are paying for projected growth,
or even more simply, it's a way of comparing apples to apples.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Morris picked some pretty good apples _ stock
market leaders including Microsoft, Cisco, GE and Wal-Mart. On the
Internet side, he picked American Online, Amazon.com, Yahoo and
eBay, the blue chip names of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   At mid-year, when Internet stocks were still soaring, what he
found was illuminating.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the stock market as a whole was selling for a
multiple of 2. The lower the multiple, the cheaper the stock. The
top companies _ the Microsofts and Ciscos _ were selling for about
2.5. At 2.4, America Online was roughly as expensive as the quality
traditional companies. At 3.3, Amazon.com was more expensive; at
5.7 and 6.1 respectively, Yahoo and eBay were off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us a reality check,'' says Morris about the exercise.
It also confirmed his basic intuition that most Internet stocks
were unrealistically priced.
</P>
<P>
   Morris blames much of the Internet mania on overly exuberant
investors. ``There is a difference between investment and
gambling,'' he wrote to shareholders recently. ``Today the feeling
among some investors is that the casino opens at 9:30 a.m. and
closes at 4 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticizes investors for what he considers a perversion
of Peter Lynch's famous dictum: buy what you know. ``People visit a
Web site, think it's really cool and decide to own the company,''
he wrote. ``They don't know the company's profit potential and they
aren't asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is just as tough on Wall Street for cranking out a steady
stream of Internet IPOs, many of them of dubious quality.
</P>
<P>
   But Morris is not anti-Internet. Not even close. He has bought
some Internet stocks and would be happy to buy more when the price
is right. That day may not be that far off.
</P>
<P>
   When Morris runs the numbers these days, he finds that Internet
stock prices have moved closer to the pack. America Online and
Amazon are no more expensive today than GE and Cisco. Yahoo and
eBay are still pricey, but, according to Morris, ``The gap is a
helluva lot smaller than it was a few months ago. If some of these
stocks trade off another 30 percent, things could get
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is talking about stocks he could buy and hold for three
to five years. He is not interested in short-run swings and
suggests such movements are almost impossible to forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I am confident of is that by the end of September,
these stocks will have moved 20 to 30 percent from their current
valuations,'' he says. ``I just don't know in which direction.''

CRAY ENJOYS BALANCE IN HIS BLUES CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Young upstarts in the blues world include Susan Tedeschi, Jonny
Lang, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Stalwarts include B. B. King and
Buddy Guy. And somewhere in the middle is Robert Cray, the
so-called ``Crown Prince of the Blues,'' though he doesn't trumpet
any one label for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I am,'' Cray says. ``I'm just still out
there doing it. This is our 25th anniversary tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The modest Cray is just pleased to see the blues movement
chugging along so well. ``There are more blues bands than there
have ever been,'' he says. ``There are more places to play _ and
there are blues festivals everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   With his glassy-smooth delivery, Cray is a bluesman's bluesman.
He is perhaps the genre's finest modern songwriter _ and he goes
overboard to please on his exquisite new album, ``Take Your Shoes
Off,'' his first for Salem-based Rykodisc Records.
</P>
<P>
   The new disc has some of the sweetest soul-blues singing since
the '60s heyday of the Stax/Volt label in Memphis, which featured
the likes of Otis Redding and O.V. Wright. ``That was one of the
greatest eras in music history,'' says Cray.
</P>
<P>
   The new disc is produced by Steve Jordan, who also drums with
Keith Richards' X-Pensive Winos. Jordan proved to be a nut for
getting a sweet soul sound. ``I've never seen anyone so dedicated
to sound,'' says Cray. ``He did a lot of tuning of the drums and
really worked with getting the right placement of the
microphones.''

   Jordan also brought in Willie Mitchell _ the famed Memphis
figure who wrote and produced hits for Al Green on the Hi Records
label. ``Willie came in, all dressed in gold. I had never met him
before,'' says Cray. ``It was like meeting a great like Muddy
Waters. He was really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Cray notes, Mitchell is ``one of those guys still making
records and still writing songs, but according to big business,
they're supposed to be dead.'' Mitchell, now in his 60s, wrote a
horn arrangement on Cray's album (for the song ``Love Gone to
Waste'') that sounds timeless.
</P>
<P>
   As does another tune, ``24-7 Man,'' penned by soul veteran, Mack
Rice of ``Mustang Sally'' fame. And, for further immersion into
Southern soul, Cray covered Solomon Burke's 1964 tune, ``Won't You
Give Him (One More Chance).''
</P>
<P>
   The album has six Cray originals, ranging from the erotic ballad
``All the Way'' to a song of lost love, ``It's All Gone.''

   Bits and Pieces: Fresh from their craziness at Woodstock '99,
the Red Hot Chili Peppers perform in Moscow's Red Square Saturday.
(Will bassist Flea perform nude like he did at Woodstock?) It will
be taped by MTV and air sometime in October . . . John Paul Jones,
the Led Zeppelin bassist, will release a solo album, ``Zooma,'' on
Sept. 14, then tour in October . . . Spice Girls founder Bob
Herbert died Monday in a car accident in London, at age 57. He had
recruited (then managed) the Spice Girls through an ad in a trade
magazine three years ago. . . . Dick Latvala, the Grateful Dead
archivist who compiled the excellent ``Dick's Picks'' CDs, died
last Friday at age 56, 10 days after suffering a heart attack.
Another tough loss for Deadheads.

VINCE GILL, DWIGHT YOAKAM: COUNTRY COUSINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are not linked geographically _ one lives in Los Angeles,
the other in Nashville _ but they could be soul brothers. At the
very least, Vince Gill and Dwight Yoakam are country music's
Renaissance men. Gill can sing with Patty Loveless one minute, with
Barbra Streisand the next. No problem. And Yoakam is as adept at
acting in films as he is at cranking out a honky-tonk tune.
</P>
<P>
   Each has a distinct, personal vision that always comes across as
sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Examples:
</P>
<P>
   --Yoakam just scored a hit with a seemingly uncharacteristic
remake of Queen's rock tune ``Crazy Little Thing Called Love.'' But
the Kentucky-born singer gave it an honest hillbilly interpretation
that would have made Elvis Presley proud.
</P>
<P>
   --While known for aching country ballads, bluegrassy folk, and
rockabilly, Gill showed he can go pop as well by recording a duet
with Streisand, ``If You Ever Leave Me'' (a Richard Marx tune),
which will be on Streisand's next CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge thrill. We recorded the song separately, but I
was in the room while she was singing. She still has an amazing
voice,'' says Gill.
</P>
<P>
   As for Yoakam's remake of the Queen song, he first did it for a
Gap commercial. He didn't feel compromised by that, because he
feels that the Gap, unlike some major corporations, actually cares
about music.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Yoakam and Gill are still best known for their
adherence to country tradition. They are country gentlemen with a
twist, but no other contemporary male artists have done more to
keep authentic country music alive.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's most recent album, ``The Key,'' not only pays homage to
his banjo-picking Oklahoma father, Stan, in ``The Key to Life,''
but adds the signature song ``Kindly Keep It Country.'' And there's
a duet with Loveless (``My Kind of Woman / My Kind of Man'') that
resurrects memories of the historic country duets between Conway
Twitty and Loretta Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a lot of people are jumping up and down about playing real
hard-core, traditional music these days,'' says Gill. ``It's kind
of a struggle, but that doesn't make it not a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want folks to know that I respect country music,'' Gill
adds. ``You don't often hear a lot of it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam, who has met Gill only a couple of times, at awards
shows, despite the seeming compatibility between the two, feels the
same way. Only in Yoakam's case, he is most indebted to the West
Coast, Bakersfield, Calif.-based honky-tonk sound pioneered by Buck
Owens and Merle Haggard. Yoakam has been living on the West Coast
for years, after migrating from Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buck and Merle are monumental influences and we all stand on
their shoulders,'' says Yoakam. ``It's important to educate the
public and make them aware of those artists.'' (Yoakam will perform
with Owens on New Year's Eve at the Crystal Palace in Bakersfield.)
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam and Gill also view this summer's tours in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touring has become a sanctuary for me, a haven,'' says Yoakam,
referring to the need for an alternative to his time-consuming film
projects, which haven't stopped since he appeared in ``Sling
Blade'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really feeling inspired this summer. I'm just looking
forward to playing,'' adds Gill, who has endured a messy divorce
and is getting his life back on track. ``It's odd, because I've got
a bunch of pals who are really struggling right now, but my life
has turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill has also been invited back to host the Country Music
Association awards in Nashville in the fall. He's become the
perennial host, almost like a Supreme Court justice being appointed
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, once you've got the naked pictures of the (country)
executives, then you can pretty much call your own shots,'' Gill
says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Catch Gill in concert while you can, because he's planning to
take next year off. ``There comes a time when you've got to pull
back,'' says Gill, whose vast array of '90s hits has included
``When I Call Your Name,'' ``One More Last Chance,'' and ``Whenever
You Come Around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking a year off may seem like a long time, but when you're
done with it, it's not that long at all,'' says Gill, 41, sounding
like the country pragmatist that he is. And the first thing he'll
do on that year off? ``Probably throw away my shaving kit,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Once Yoakam's tour is done, he'll head right back to finish the
film he's directing and starring in, ``South of Heaven, West of
Hell.'' It's an independent film for which he also wrote the
script. He describes it as a ``gothic Western'' set in 1907. It
also stars Bridget Fonda (Yoakam's real-life girlfriend), Natalie
Canerday (who played Yoakam's girlfriend in ``Sling Blade''), Billy
Bob Thornton (also from ``Sling Blade''), and hippie icon Peter
Fonda, Bridget's father.
</P>
<P>
   What role does Yoakam play in the movie?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of a cast-adrift marshal who is not quite certain of who
he is and how he ended up where he ended up,'' says Yoakam.
</P>
<P>
   So he's not a villain, as in ``Sling Blade''?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm playing a drifting good guy this time,'' he concludes.

SOMETIMES ALL YOU CAN DO WITH A FLICKERING MONITOR IS GET RID OF
IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My son recently gave me a hand-me-down Windows 95 computer so
we can communicate by e-mail. I like it a lot, but I am having a
hard time looking at the monitor for very long. It seems to be
flickering, but it's something I can really only see out of the
corner of my eye. How can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like the computer hasn't properly identified the kind
of monitor you have, or it's a very old and/or cheap monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Using beams of electrons, monitors actually draw an image on the
screen line by line, but it happens so quickly that it appears to
be one big picture to you. The faster it draws the image _ known as
the refresh rate _ the better it looks. The refresh rate is
expressed in hertz.
</P>
<P>
   (Some older models draw the image by painting every other line
on the screen. The electron beams then go back and pick up the
remaining lines on a second pass. This is called interlacing, and
it can also lead to nasty flickering. Most modern monitors are
non-interlaced, in which all the lines are painted in a single
pass.)
</P>
<P>
   If it draws the image at a refresh rate of under 72 hertz,
you're apt to detect a flickering. This can cause eyestrain and
ultimately lead to a headache.
</P>
<P>
   You can change the refresh rate in the Windows display
properties control panel. Right-click on the open desktop, and
choose Properties. Click on the Settings tab, and then click the
Advanced button.
</P>
<P>
   What happens from here depends on how your video drivers are set
up, or what version of Windows you have. In most cases, you'll
click on the Adapter tab, where you'll see a drop-down titled
Refresh Rate. If your monitor is properly supported in Windows, and
if it's capable of higher refresh rates, you should have options in
this box that let you set the refresh rate at 72 hertz or higher.
</P>
<P>
   If you have only a couple of choices, none of them above 72
hertz, your monitor may not be properly recognized.
</P>
<P>
   You should see a Monitor tab at the top of this dialog box.
Choose it and see if the system has identified your monitor
correctly. If not, click the Change button and follow the
instructions to set up your monitor.
</P>
<P>
   If the monitor is correctly identified and you still don't have
access to higher refresh rates, it's likely that this is an older
model and you may want to consider replacing it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently bought a new computer that came with Windows 98. I
had been using Windows 3.1. Try as I might, I can't get used to
using My Computer to see what's on the hard drive. I want the old
File Manager back. Is there some way I can use File Manager on my
new machine? What files would I have to copy from Windows 3.1?
</P>
<P>
   A: None. The File Manager is still present in Windows 98 _ it's
just not obvious.
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft introduced Windows 95, the company knew that
people had grown accustomed to the File Manager _ even though it's
a pretty klunky way to work with files. Microsoft decided to leave
the program in the operating system, but not point to it with a
shortcut.
</P>
<P>
   You can invoke the File Manager by going to Start, Run and enter
WINFILE, then hit Enter.
</P>
<P>
   The old Program Manager is there, too, but it likely won't have
any program groups in it. From Start/Run, enter PROGMAN.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been thinking about getting a new iMac to replace my
aging Apple Performa, but I really like my printer, and I
understand the iMacs don't have a traditional printer port. Is
there a way I can use my old printer with an iMac?
</P>
<P>
   A: Check with the maker of your printer. Many manufacturers have
come out with adapters and drivers that let you plug an older
printer into the Universal Serial Bus port on a newer Macintosh.
</P>

`BOWFINGER' FALLS SHORT IN SLAP-HAPPY SNAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BOWFINGER 
Directed by: Frank Oz 
Screenplay by: Steve Martin 
Starring: Martin, Eddie Murphy, Heather Graham, Christine Baranski,
Jamie Kennedy, Terence Stamp, Robert Downey, Jr., Adam
Alexei-Malle, Kohl Sudduth 
Running time: 96 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sex-related material and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' isn't quite the deliriously slap-happy farce it
wants to be, but Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy generate just enough
laughs to keep you watching it. Nominally, it's a comedy about a
desperate band of wannabes trying to make a movie. At bottom, it's
Hollywood celebrating yet again the quality it most reveres, namely
chutzpah, garnished with delusion. ``Ed Wood'' did it better, and
with more sweetness and inventiveness, but Martin has his moments
as a would-be producer facing a now-or-never time in what he
laughably calls his professional life. Murphy, who apparently
experiences claustrophobia at the idea of limiting himself to
playing only one role, chips in by playing two characters here.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, as underachiever Bobby Bowfinger, staring his 50th
birthday in the face and realizing he's actually got to make a
movie if he's going to keep on calling himself a producer, is best
in the early going. Summoning his con man energies, he takes a
script called ``Chubby Rain,'' written by his Iranian accountant,
and heads off to Le Dome with high hopes and low everything else,
including a fake ponytail. Dropping the name of a hot-ticket action
star, he catches the ear of Robert Downey's studio exec, who says
he'll greenlight the script if Bowfinger can deliver it with the
star attached. Bowfinger, of course, can barely con his way into
the exalted one's presence.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he does get in to see the A-list icon, he's tossed
out of the guy's limo. But the hustling Bowfinger, who can't bear
to return empty-handed to his tribe of wannabes waiting for him at
home, has a plan. With a camera spirited out of a studio by a gofer
who wants to be a cinematographer, Bowfinger plans a series of
candid camera guerrilla assaults on Murphy's Kit Ramsey,
photographing him, then fabricating a film around the bits of
unauthorized footage. In other words, he plans to deliver an action
film the star doesn't know he's in. It's a funny enough notion, fed
by the fact that the star is something of a paranoiac basket case.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Ramsey is not merely leery of white people; he's afraid of
aliens. Whenever the people in Bowfinger's movie come flying out of
the bushes at him, they do get reaction shots. That the shaky
action hero seeks counseling and refuge in an upmarket
self-actualization temple called Mind Head allows Martin to take a
few not-so-veiled shots at Scientology. And there is something to
be said for Christine Baranski's stagy leading lady, who accosts
the panicked star on the street in the style of Irma Vep, and
Heather Graham's ingenue, who literally steps off the bus from the
Midwest in full Dorothy mode except for the Ruby Slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is funny at first in her wide-eyed but purposeful way of
sleeping with everyone on the set in an effort to figure out where
the power is so she can link to it. But she and the other
characters are written so thinly, with no back stories or
deviations from their single-function existences, that the film
begins to evaporate. Comely as Graham may be in her tight pink
toreador pants and midriff-baring tops, there are only so many ways
for her to run after Murphy's star waving her hands and sending him
into yet another fleeing mode. Eventually, the star gets so spooked
that he checks into Mind Head's sleek sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the film, Bowfinger is forced to find a double for
Ramsey, in much the same way the real-life Ed Wood pressed his
dentist into service when Bela Lugosi died during the filming of
``Plan 9 from Outer Space.'' Enter Murphy again, inverting his
``Holy Man'' character, giving the sagging film a lift. Murphy's
slow reaction shots as a sweet nerd with buck teeth and a shy smile
are the best thing in ``Bowfinger,'' especially when he's told to
cross a busy eight-lane freeway and not to worry because the
drivers are all stunt men.
</P>
<P>
   The scramble that ensues is a metaphor for the film within a
film _ and for ``Bowfinger'' itself. It plays like a string of
loosely (sometimes very loosely) connected bits, held together by
the desperation of the band of losers who will do anything to
sustain the belief that they're part of the world of moviemaking.
But even losers have more idiosyncrasy and personality than this
bunch. ``Bowfinger'' makes you wish Martin had run the script
through his word processor a few more times. It could have been a
lot funnier. It's not frantic enough and the characters don't have
enough character.

SWEETWATER, THE GROUP THAT COULDN'T SURVIVE WOODSTOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SWEETWATER 
A True Rock Story 
Starring: Amy Jo Johnson, Michelle Phillips, Kelli Williams,
Frederic Forrest, Adam Ant 
Directed by: Lorraine Senna 
On: VH1 
Time: Sunday at 9 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody, as far as I know, has done a doctoral study on the bad
brown acid that journeyed through the mudpits of the original
Woodstock. And we can still look forward to an in-depth profile of
the 1969 concert's Port-a-San man, a deconstructive literary
analysis of ``Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag,'' and maybe a
fashion retrospective featuring the carnival couture of Mr. Wavy
Gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the 30th anniversary of the legendary ``three days
of peace and music,'' VH1 is providing us with its own unique
Woodstock-related project. Called ``Sweetwater: A True Rock
History,'' it's a ``fact-based'' made-for-TV movie about the first
rock group to perform at the legendary festival. Taking the stage
for their flute-heavy version of ``Motherless Child'' that August
day, Sweetwater was on the brink of fame and fortune, the object of
bidding wars among record labels hungry for the next Janis Joplin
and Grace Slick. But only a few months later, the 7-person fusion
band dropped completely out of sight, another sad tumble off the
ladder of pop stardom, another American almost-was. What every
happened to Sweetwater and, to borrow the title of a VH1
docu-series, where are they now?
</P>
<P>
   It's actually not a bad premise for a movie, as Tom Hanks knew
when he wrote and directed ``That Thing You Do!'' The story
presents an opportunity to reimagine the ironies of 1960s rock
stardom from an enlightened 1990s perspective, now that the
mystique of fame has been thoroughly disassembled. It also gives
filmmakers a chance to stretch beyond the plot arc of 99.9 percent
of all celebrity profiles _ the heady rise, the drunken fall, and
the sober resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a impressive lead performance by Amy Jo Johnson, the
young actress who plays Julie on ``Felicity,'' ``Sweetwater'' fails
to break on through to the other side of cliche. It takes some
strong raw matter _ Johnson, buoyant musical scenes, and an
electrified pace _ and hammers it into the overly familiar shape of
a cautionary melodrama. It's the same old shape as the channel's
own ``Behind the Music'' series, as well as ``The E! True Hollywood
Story,'' an easy-to-read shape that fails to capitalize on the
deeper truths that fictionalization can provide. Even worse, the
movie compounds its cliches by tacking on a present-day framing
device about a newly sober TV reporter (played tensely by Kelli
Williams of ``The Practice'') whose career hinges on her success in
creating a segment on the Sweetwater story.
</P>
<P>
   And so ``Sweetwater'' jumps from dynamic re-stagings of the
band's ecstatic performances in a sunny park and at Whiskey a Go
Go, to hokey pathos and ridiculous, screenplay-driven coincidences.
At the center of the story is Nansi Nevins, Sweetwater's unstable
lead singer. Amid the band's infectious rhythms, Nevins sings
soulfully and dances angelically, but offstage she stuggles with an
unsupportive mother and the temporary consolations of booze. This
being a paint-by-numbers rock story, Nevins is of course having an
affair with the leader of the band, Alex Del Zeppo, and, of course,
he breaks her heart by succumbing to the groupie temptations of the
road. Waiting in the wings at Woodstock, Alex and Nansi take about
60 seconds of screen time to transform their troubled relationship
into a warm friendship, and then they go onstage to lose themselves
in the music. In one particularly silly scene, Janis Joplin is
briefly seen swigging from a bottle of Southern Comfort, which she
hands to Nevins while mumbling, ``It's the only thing they can't
take away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock turned out to be the zenith for Sweetwater: In
December of 1969, Nevins was injured in a car accident and the
tracheotomy that saved her permanently damaged one of her vocal
cords. The band proceeded into oblivion without her, while she hit
bottom after an unsuccessful solo career. Johnson manages to
maintain some dignity during these tired drunk scenes, but she is
at her best as the innocent Nansi, who simply walks onstage and
begins singing with the band after a dare from a friend. Johnson
also sings her own songs with authority. (According to the real
Nevins' comments on the Sweetwater website, VH1 couldn't use her
voice because ``Amy Jo's speaking voice didn't match my singing
voice.'') As the present-day Nevins, Michelle Phillips _ who had
her ups and downs with the Mamas and the Papas _ brings needed
grace to some trite older-wiser business. (Phillips lip-syncs to
the real Nevins at the end of the movie.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweetwater'' is notable as the first in what will be a regular
series of made-for-TV movies by VH1. It doesn't bode well. As the
TV archive of rock history, the channel needs to work harder at
finding material that's less formulaic and safe, two qualities that
aren't generally identified with rock and roll.

KISS THIS BRAINLESS `DETROIT' GOODBYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DETROIT ROCK CITY 
Directed by: Adam Rifkin 
Screenplay by: Carl V. Dupre 
Starring: Edward Furlong, Giuseppe Andrews, James DeBello, Sam
Huntington, Melanie Lynskey, Nick Scotti, Shannon Tweed, Miles
Dougal, Natasha Lyonne, Lin Shaye and KISS (Gene Simmons, Paul
Stanley, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss) 
Running time: 96 minutes 
Rated: R 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No rock band pushes as much merchandise as KISS. To the already
hefty product line must now be added ``Detroit Rock City,'' a
sweet-tempered but on the whole lame and clumsy film about four
kids in 1978 who decide to break out of Cleveland and floor it all
the way to Detroit to attend a KISS concert there. Although we
glimpse the zigzag makeup mavens at the end, the film (Gene Simmons
is one of its producers) isn't so much about KISS as about kids
breaking out of the confines of adult authority, although the kids
in the film are hardly up to speed when it comes to mapping out new
frontiers of wildness. Their getaway car is a
borrowed-without-permission Volvo belonging to one of their moms.
</P>
<P>
   Not the hissing gargoyle mom of the most baby-faced of the four,
Jam (Sam Huntington). Lin Shaye (the dog-owning lady of ``There's
Something About Mary'') has a fit when she discovers a KISS record
hidden in a Carpenters record jacket. Denouncing the band as
satanic, she banishes her son to a Catholic boarding school. She
exists, in short, to serve as a speed bump, over which Jam and his
three equally innocent and naive buddies (Edward Furlong, James Di
Bello, and Giuseppe Andrews) roll once they break Jam out of the
boarding school with the help of hallucinogens. The film does take
a long time getting them to Detroit, where they are faced with the
need to score four tickets, having become separated from the ones
they had.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Jam, who has all he can do to overcome his
mother's domination, the others fan out in search of sex as well as
tickets, and find it in some pretty contrived and sexist ways.
Repeatedly, the actors bring more to the table than the script
gives them to play. This is especially true in the case of Furlong,
a talented young actor who must endure the film's most painfully
embarrassing scene, when he parades onstage in a club for male
strippers, hoping to win the money for a scalper's concert ticket.
Most of the Detroit scenes were actually filmed in Toronto, which
subtracts a certain gritty veracity. Sitting through ``Detroit Rock
City'' is a little like watching The History Channel with a
wallbanging soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The few scenes that appear to have been shot in Detroit
presumably are more faithful to history than to geography. The
carful of kids from Cleveland enters Detroit via the city's Belle
Isle Bridge, which they could only have reached from Ohio by
driving underwater. Unlike the rest of the film, that would have
been worth seeing. There aren't many films that can be thought of
as loud, moronic, and quaint, but ``Detroit Rock City'' is one of
them. It's strictly for rabid KISS completists and audiences
exhausted from rising to the level of mental effort demanded by
``Austin Powers,'' ``Big Daddy,'' and ``American Pie.'' In all
other respects, ``Detroit Rock City'' gives brainlessness a bad
name.

EMPIRE STATE EXHIBIT IS RICH IN ART WITH A COMMON TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 15)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KRIS WORRELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ When most people think about folk art, they
think of Grandma Moses and her Northeast landscapes. Or they think
of Howard Finster, the Georgia preacher-turned-artist. Or maybe
they think of those wooden cutouts people stick in their front
yards.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much more to folk art than Grandma M. and lawn
ornaments, and you don't have to be a Southerner to appreciate it.
New York's rich folk-art history is evident in the exhibition
``Empire State Mosaic: The Folk Art of New York,'' on display at
the New York State Historical Association's Fenimore Art Museum in
Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which runs through the end of the year, offers more
than 100 examples of work by New York state folk artists from the
18th to 20th centuries, arranged chronologically to provide
historical context.
</P>
<P>
   ``We define `folk art' as works of art created by people who
have no formal art training and who work in a style that is
deceptively simple,'' said Paul D'Ambrosio, chief curator for the
state historical association and the curator of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Folk art is the art of common people, done in an uncommon way.
Folk artists tend to use bold color and unconventional materials,
such as wood, metal, plastic, beads and found objects. There is
often a whimsical, almost childlike quality to their work, which
may be why some folk art is also called ``primitive'' or ``naive.''
Folk painters, for example, do not depict the world realistically
but more often two-dimensionally, showing a lot of detail in their
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes some folk paintings important historical
documents,'' D'Ambrosio said.
</P>
<P>
   One such example, called the ``Van Bergen Overmantel,'' is the
earliest known American genre painting and the only known scene of
everyday life among the Dutch of 18th-century New York. Painted on
wood, it hung over the mantel in Marten Van Bergen's Hudson Valley
farmhouse in the early 1700s. The painting shows the entire family,
their servants and slaves, their Native American neighbors and the
impressive Catskills in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The New York folk art style reflects the diverse ethnic and
racial cultures of the region. The 17th and 18th centuries were
dominated by the art of the Iroquois, Dutch and Germans. The
Iroquois created beautiful wood and bone carvings and detailed
beadwork. The Dutch made ornamental ironwork such as door-knockers
and weather vanes. The Germans painted furniture and decorated
family records such as birth certificates. The English were known
for their needlework, portraiture and landscapes. All contained a
strong sense of place and a robust spirit of commerce that was
reflective of the prosperity these groups experienced in their new
country.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Grandma Moses brought folk art to international
attention with her carefully wrought ``memory paintings'' of rural
scenes from her childhood. In 1957, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller
Folk Art Center, a museum named in honor of the wife of John D.
Rockefeller Jr., opened in Williamsburg, Va. The Museum of American
Folk Art in New York opened in 1964 and expanded the definition of
folk art with such exhibitions as ``Twentieth-Century Folk Art and
Artists'' (1970), ``Tattoo'' (1971) and ``Occult'' (1973).
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, hip alternative rock acts like R.E.M. and
Talking Heads featured paintings by Howard Finster on their album
covers and brought folk art into the realm of popular culture. The
art of common people was being embraced by, well, common people.
</P>
<P>
   While 20th-century folk art addresses some of the same themes
that concerned earlier folk artists _ religion, the rural life and
nature _ it has changed in significant ways. For starters, modern
folk art usually isn't created to fulfill a consumer demand, as
cigar-store Indians or handmade quilts were. ``It's more personal
or idiosyncratic,'' D'Ambrosio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twentieth-century folk art is more about an artist expressing
himself or herself: their hopes, their experiences, their region.
It tends to be more intense emotionally,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the most vibrant and compelling pieces in the show is a
large painting of Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio by Malcah Zeldis,
an acclaimed Jewish folk artist who lives and works in New York
City. Painted in bold strokes and bright colors, it shows the
famous couple sitting together on a bed, DiMaggio holding flowers
for his wife while Monroe's image is reflected in a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I identified with her, as many women do, because she had such
a difficult childhood and she was a vulnerable woman,'' said
Zeldis, speaking during a telephone interview. ``I admired him. I
thought he was the best man she had. It was a very beautiful and
sad romance.''
</P>
<P>
   Another theme of 20th-century folk art, particularly from New
York artists, is the idea of the rural landscape giving way to a
concrete metropolis. Ralph Fasanella was a master at expressing the
energy, hopes and frustration of people living in the confines of a
city. Born in New York City to Italian-immigrant parents, Fasanella
worked as a union organizer before turning to painting as a way of
raising the awareness of the working class regarding their own
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``May Day'' (1948) is Fasanella's homage to the workers movement
of the 1930s. Thousands of marchers, carrying banners for equality
and freedom, parade through New York's Union Square, past a
reviewing stand and shrine to labor heroes that includes Jefferson,
Lincoln, Roosevelt, Douglass and Ronald Reagan (who was president
of the Screen Actors Guild at the time).
</P>
<P>
   The marchers head toward a more humane, egalitarian society,
which Fasanella portrays as a beautiful, open park where people of
all races hold hands, the New York Giants win and the cigars are
cheaper. The vivid color, intricate detail and patterns within
patterns make ``May Day'' a rich and layered visual narrative.
</P>
<P>
   The show features a number of folk-art sculptures as well,
including ``Marla,'' a smiling girl made from metal that artist and
ex-sheet-metal worker Irving Dominick modeled after his 10-year-old
granddaughter. ``Empire State Building'' (1984), by Gregorio
Marzan, is a likeness of that famous edifice made from Popsicle
sticks and silver and purple foil. There's even a ``Trout Box,'' a
long, carved box by Michael Lavery, who belongs to the Hermitage
Artists, a group of homeless men in Troy who support themselves by
creating and selling their art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not be the best artists in the world,'' Zeldis said,
``but we are authentic.''

THE SIMPLE SUSPENSE OF `MUSCLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MUSCLE MEMORY 
By William G. Tapply 
St. Martin's Press, 257 pp., $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With her ``husky voice'' and ``warm, shy smile,'' Kaye Fallon, a
nice, wholesome schoolteacher, is magnetically attractive to men.
To students and friends and also her unhappily estranged husband,
Mick, a former pro basketball player with a bad temper, a gambling
jones, and a ton of debt. So when Kaye is murdered _ bludgeoned
with a 6-pound replica of Rodin's ``The Thinker'' _ Mick Fallon
makes a plausible suspect.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to praise ``Muscle Memory'' _ William G. Tapply's
16th Brady Coyne mystery and among the most smoothly crafted of the
many I've read _ without, unfortunately, slightly compromising the
reading experience. But one can't fairly describe the novel without
mentioning the central crime, which comes as a powerful jolt after
some 45 pages of silky, leisurely buildup and sharp
characterization.
</P>
<P>
   But not to worry. Tapply, a Cambridge, Mass. author who has
become a master of the serial crime novel, has created a book that
offers a wealth of pleasures. Not the least of them _ and something
that will appeal explicitly to other writers while pleasing other
readers perhaps less consciously _ is the polished economy of
Tapply's prose. The book is short, 257 rather large-print pages,
but replete. Here he is, for example, writing in the voice of his
protagonist Coyne, a Boston lawyer with a Copley Square practice
and an appetite for trout fishing and difficult criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I like to sit on a boulder in the middle of a
stream, watch the insects flutter over the water, try to spot the
gray shadow of a trout lurking in the currents. . . . And when I
locate a trout I'd like to catch, I want to feel I've got all the
time in the world to study his habits, divine his weaknesses, cast
to him, change flies, shift my position, cast again.''
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Tapply, a published fishing and outdoors writer as
well as Coyne's chronicler, evokes the natural world with limber,
effortless-sounding sentences. On the other, at the same time that
he ripens Coyne's sensibility, he metaphorically explores the
lawyer's obsessive drive as a sleuth and catcher of villains.
Virtually every flowing phrase of ``Muscle Memory'' impels the
story or deepens character and, quite often, both.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a fine story, simple in conception but taut with
suspense from the moment of Kaye's killing in a spasm of offstage
violence _ we hear about the murder, we don't see it enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Coyne is a casual drinking buddy of Mick's when the lawyer
offers to represent him in the divorce suit filed by his wife. Mick
is angry and bitter and dishonest, too, so when Kaye is murdered,
however much the aggrieved husband protests his innocence, he's
hard to believe. Coyne's task, of course, is to find the real
killer. What distinguishes ``Muscle Memory'' is the convincing way
Tapply produces so many disturbingly suspicious suspects _ a
smitten student of Kaye's who works at a Jiffy Lube, a widower who
lives across the street from her, a roaming handicapped neighbor,
the principal of the regional high school where she taught. In
Coyne, Tapply has fashioned a good man who can see the potential
for evil in almost everyone, a quality essential to his work. And
it is this conviction, I suspect _ that we're all capable at least
of nasty crimes of passion _ that allows Tapply to spread suspicion
around so widely and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   What few flaws there are in the novel are mainly problems of
omission, disappointed expectations that only readers familiar with
the Coyne series could notice. For example, the Boston cityscape,
which has often enriched the books enormously, is scarcely
noticeable despite being the setting for much of the action.
</P>
<P>
   And although this is a niggling complaint, why does Tapply
elaborate in minute detail what Coyne wears when he dashes out of
his harborside apartment to meet a homicide detective? ``I hastily
pulled on a pair of jeans, a cotton shirt, socks, sneakers,
windbreaker. I patted my pockets for cigarettes, keys, and wallet,
then took the elevator down to the lobby.'' This reads like a goofy
mail-order catalog entry or else a parody of the kind of fiction
Tapply otherwise handles with coolly controlled lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the lawyer-sleuth on his little balcony, smoking,
thinking, taking in the harborscape, smelling the ``mingled
low-tide aroma of seaweed, diesel fuel, mud, and salt.'' Tapply
then concludes the paragraph: ``The dolorous dong of the bell-buoy
out at the mouth of the harbor echoed in the damp night air.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few writers of crime fiction have managed to generate
prose this leanly poetic in the service of their hard-boiled
stories. Tapply does it all the time in ``Muscle Memory.''

BELL ATLANTIC SLEUTH FIND THE FADE IN CELLULAR

<P>
   WESTBOROUGH, Mass. _ Thousands of folks love to drive around New
England looking for the hot spots. Eugene Giordano, on the other
hand, racks up 3,000 miles a month looking for the dead spots.
</P>
<P>
   As wireless telephone companies serving the region battle for
best-coverage boasting rights and try to reduce customer gripes
about scratchy and dropped calls, Giordano pilots one of Bell
Atlantic Mobile's key weapons: a Ford Taurus station wagon
outfitted with $250,000 worth of electronics and a porcupine-quill
array of antennas on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of eight long days each month, Giordano drives a
1,700-mile route, plus another 1,300 miles deadheading back to his
Westborough laboratory, where he spends the rest of his time
analyzing and reporting data. As he drives, an on-board computer
makes thousands of calls from eight wireless phones housed in
gun-metal-grey boxes behind the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   With Global Positioning System receivers charting the car's
location every second, a laptop computer mounted on the dashboard
records and displays how well calls get through, how many calls
each carrier drops and where, and where Bell and its five rivals
have patchy or missing coverage.
</P>
<P>
   All six wireless companies serving Greater Boston routinely send
technicians on patrol to test their cell networks' calling
strength. But Bell Atlantic, with 6.2 million customers around the
country, has been among the most aggressive at marketing its tests
as a selling point to prospective customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic has really tried to define network quality and
network coverage as a differentiator for them,'' said Mark
Lowenstein, a leading wireless-industry analyst with The Yankee
Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While wireless calling remains ``the most competitive sector in
the telecom industry,'' Lowenstein said, ``prices have rapidly
converged, so the cost difference between one carrier and another
is not significant.''
</P>
<P>
   However, customers count on being able to make and get calls
from a carrier throughout their region. That makes network coverage
an increasingly important buying point for the 33,000 Americans who
sign up for cell phones every day.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bell's local rivals, for example, Omnipoint has four
two-person teams of ``drive testers'' who are out ``all the time''
checking on network reliability and even developing seasonal tweaks
to account for lost coverage in warm months when foliage grows
dense, spokeswoman Karin Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what Bell Atlantic is doing is anything more
than what we're doing here,'' said John Redman of Nextel, which
made a special blitz of the Boston Marathon route earlier this year
to ensure the 325 radio-cell phone units it donated for calling in
race updates would have uninterrupted service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Wireless, Cellular One, and Sprint PCS also do the same
rolling surveillance as Bell Atlantic Mobile, both to measure
performance and identify where they need to add towers or rent
antenna space on rivals' towers to fill service gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, to ensure clear reception and enough
channels to serve demand, wireless companies need a broadcasting
site every 4 miles along a highway, many more in cities such as
Boston and Cambridge and fewer in light-traffic rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   For wireless companies, knowing exactly where new towers are
needed from on-the-road tests, and not just pins on a map, is also
economically vital. Local zoning boards throughout New England have
been toughening tower siting rules in response to complaints about
unsightly antenna proliferation and largely unproven but, among
some people, hard-to-shake fears that cell towers' electromagnetic
radiation is a public health menace.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, American Tower Inc. of Boston paid nearly
$381,000 per tower for each of 2,100 sites owned by Vodafone
AirTouch PLC, which American Tower will lease back to AirTouch and
use to install rivals' antennas. ``Towers are becoming a very
valuable commodity,'' Lowenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   In forested parts of Massachusetts, including one spot east of
Interstate 495 in Bolton, AT&AMP;T has pioneered cell towers camoflaged
as tall, if sickly looking, pine trees. The towers have rubber bark
and antenna-disguising branches made of a special plastic that lets
radio waves pass through unimpeded and, seen at 65 m.p.h., blend
into the tree line.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has 380 cell sites around the region bounded by
southwestern Maine, Worcester, and Cape Cod, more than two-thirds
of which have been erected on structures including buildings, water
towers, and church steeples.
</P>
<P>
   In coming years, said Richard B. Enright, northeast network
engineering director for Bell Atlantic Mobile, the company will
spend over $100 million beefing up coverage in spottily served
areas such as Cape Cod, along Route 2 west of Concord, and on Route
3 in Plymouth. Earlier this week it added coverage in the
Massachusetts Turnpike extension tunnel under the Prudential
Center, using a coaxial cable system already installed in the three
harbor tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular networks operate by constantly determining which tower
is in the best location to serve a given telephone in use. As the
connection to one tower weakens, network computers decide which
tower should ``take the handoff,'' then transfer the call to the
next cell down the road, ideally with the caller hearing _ if
anything _ only a sudden improvement in clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano's testing regimen regularly helps engineers determine
whether various towers' coverage should be extended or shortened in
certain directions to ensure the most efficient distribution of
calls among towers, although such ``tweaking'' can only go so far,
said Bell network manager Gian DaGama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any wireless carrier that tells you they're not going to have
dropped calls or other problems is really misleading you,'' said
Nextel's Redman.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano's job has nice perks, such as the chance to sightsee in
the rolling mountains of New Hampshire and Worcester County, and
the seashores of southern Rhode Island and Cape Cod. But he spends
many hours slogging along considerably less scenic, traffic-clogged
roads including I-495 and Route 128 and the streets of downtown
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He is also treated to a mind-boggling cacophony of
computer-generated chatter from the Comarco Wireless Technologies
testing system. During every 150-second-long simulated conversation
during a test session, computer-driven voice modules in the car and
at the Westborough lab speak a script of pre-recorded nonsense
phrases designed to include hard-to-decipher phonetic sounds and
different male and female voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken leg is a rare dish,'' one phone might say. ``Fill the
ink jar with sticky glue,'' the lab computer responds. ``He smokes
a big pipe with strong content,'' adds another voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will drive you crazy if you listen too hard to all of it,''
Giordano said with a laugh as he cruised up I-495 toward a ``dead
spot'' near the Route 2 interchange in Harvard that Bell Atlantic
is trying to fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind the driving,'' said Giordano, but when he is
parked running tests, he does find that ``I seem to be a target''
for police officers who want to know what he is doing _ and
sometimes ask whether he is an FBI agent or a spy.
</P>
<P>
   And if he happens to stop along a highway to check cellular
coverage, he said, ``Traffic slows down to a crawl because they all
think I'm a state trooper,'' thanks to the 13 antennas on the roof.

IS IT REVOLUTION OR JUST PARANOIA? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Md. and Miss.)  
 
By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Texas _ Houston is home to former President Bush and a
lot of staunch political conservatives. But is it also a mecca of
the Socialist Workers Party?
</P>
<P>
   That's a concern of officials at Crown Central Petroleum Corp.
The Baltimore refiner claims a local union leader who has protested
the lockout at Crown's Pasadena refinery is using Crown to foment
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Other union members, they contend, meet at a socialist bookstore
each week to talk about causes ranging from Crown to opposing the
war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of left-wing political leanings can be found in
Madison, Wis., or Berkeley, Calif., but Pasadena, Texas?
</P>
<P>
   It was admittedly strange, said Crown spokesman Bruce Hicks,
when company officials first learned that Dean Cook, a long-time
Crown employee and one of the leaders of the lockout protest, is a
member of the Socialist Workers Party. Hicks said other members of
the union local also have attended party functions.
</P>
<P>
   Cook couldn't be reached for comment, but union leaders say the
union's protracted battle with Crown has nothing to do with
worldwide socialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nonsense,'' said a laughing Tom Gentry, president of
the Paper, Allied-Industrial,Chemical and Energy Local 4-227.
``Heck, I haven't heard anyone preaching much revolution lately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of tickled that some character from Crown with his
foot on workers' necks is talking about a socialist revolution,''
Gentry said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
VERBAL BATTLES CONTINUE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the two sides continue to try to negotiate a new
agreement, they also continue to wage a war of words.
</P>
<P>
   Crown long has portrayed the workers as something other than a
local out for higher pay. When the refiner locked out its 260
workers three years ago in the midst of labor negotiations, it said
it did so after what it believed to be acts of sabotage by
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The union has countered by saying Crown is guilty of a long list
of ills from racial discrimination to violating pollution laws.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said the strangest people have showed up at the rallies by
workers. The protesters at rallies to keep the lockout alive as a
public issue have included union leaders representing catfish
workers and black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't figure out why the catfish farmers were showing
up,'' Hicks said, but then it began to make sense: The link is the
Socialist Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   Edward M. Parker, manager of corporate security for Crown, who
flew from his office in Baltimore to discuss suspicions of the
left-wing political activity in Pasadena, believes Cook doesn't
really want to end the struggle at Crown because he sees it as part
of a larger struggle against capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Drexler, director of special projects for the
international PACE union in Nashville, Tenn., and leader of the
refinery workers campaign against Crown, said Cook is no longer on
the union's payroll and has no official role in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler said he is aware Cook has penned articles for the
Militant, the weekly newspaper of the Socialist Workers Party, but
said he doesn't care if Cook is or isn't a party member. After all,
it's not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler added that he isn't in contact with unions representing
workers in catfish processing plants or black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah White, a service representative for the United Food and
Commercial Workers Union Local 1529 in Indianola, Miss., laughed
when asked if members of the Socialist Workers Party have a
presence in the union representing catfish workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The who?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
UNUSUAL TACTICS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's unusual for a company to launch a public offensive, as
Crown has done. Normally in a situation where both the company and
the union have filed lawsuits against one another, the company
avoids any comment.
</P>

   But in this case, Hicks said Crown feels the need to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pilloried by lawsuits and we've been pilloried by
demonstrations,'' he said. Initially, Crown ignored the union's
campaign, but ``we've had enough,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   To the union, though, Crown's remarks suggest it's feeling the
sting of the union's campaign.

   Crown wouldn't be harking back to the witch hunts of the 1950s,
Drexler said, if the company wasn't feeling some pressure.

<P>
   Q. I have $175,000 in Series H. bonds, which pay an interest
rate of 6 percent. I use this interest income to live on,
supplementing pension and Social Security income for my husband and
myself. We are ages 70 and 69. The bonds will mature in about a
year. While I could renew them, the current interest rate is about
4 percent. I need the $10,000. What suggestions do you have for
obtaining a return in that $10,000 range? I read a lot about
Vanguard. Can you enlighten me? We have other investments which we
do not touch, and we hope they will continue to do well.
</P>
<P>
   D.L., Allentown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you certainly could maintain that $10,000 income stream
if you went to a portfolio of Vanguard's fixed-income funds. In
fact, you could improve on it a bit. But before you take the
plunge, you should understand that you would be moving from
government-guaranteed investments into the open market and, even if
you invest conservatively in the bond market, you face an element
of risk.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a pretty good idea of what I'm talking about if you
look at this year's results for the fund I would suggest as the
core of a fixed-income fund portfolio with Vanguard: its GNMA fund.
So far this year, the fund has lost 1.1 percent. Why? Not only
because interest rates have risen this year, but because investors
are afraid that they will rise higher still.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, long-term investors in this fund take the attitude
that share prices will rise and fall periodically, but the monthly
income checks will keep rolling in, and that's why they bought the
fund in the first place. Currently the fund offers a yield of 6.73
percent, which would represent an income stream of $11,777 if you
put your entire position there.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than do that, I suggest you hedge your bets, putting
only about half of the money in the GNMA fund, dividing the balance
between fixed-income holdings that are both more and less risky. At
the most conservative end, you might put a quarter in Vanguard's
Prime Money Market fund, which currently pays 4.82 percent. And at
the riskier end, an investment in Vanguard's High-Yield Corporate
Bond fund now yields 9.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to follow those suggestions, the portfolio average
yield at current rates would be 6.89 percent, giving you an income
stream of $12,071 a year.
</P>
<P>
   If you take that course, my suggestion would be that for a time
you simply take withdrawals representing $10,000 a year, leaving
the additional yield in the account to eventually build a buffer
against those market swings I mentioned at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   If you're unhappy with the riskier end of the spectrum, you
could change the allocation, reducing the reliance on the high
yield (or junk bond) fund and adding to the money market or GNMA
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, let me end where I began. Before you make a move, get a
copy of the prospectuses and annual reports of these funds, read
the sections on risk carefully, and look back to the years when
they did not do well. If you're comfortable with the idea that you
can live with the market swings of well-managed funds in these
markets, then go ahead. Otherwise, seek out relatively short-term
CDs, which offer the best rates available.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 45 years old and have about $145,000 in an IRA invested
in Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth fund. For the past four
years it has done well; however, with the year 2000 around the
corner, I feel it might be a good time to get more aggressive. If
you agree with me, which Vanguard funds do you think will do well
with the turn of the millennium?
</P>
<P>
   J.B., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the time to be more aggressive was four years ago.
Vanguard's LifeStrategy Moderate Growth is a balanced fund, holding
about a third of its assets in the bond market. It's the kind of
fund that some people use for the last half-decade before
retirement, having reached an age where they want to reduce their
reliance on the stock market because of its inherent risk. Other
people who are drawn to balanced funds are very cautious and want
to hedge their stock-market bet, no matter how old or young they
are.
</P>
<P>
   I agree that if you are somewhere between 15 and 20 years away
from your anticipated retirement age, you probably would be well
served in the long run by taking a more aggressive investment
stance, moving into all-stock funds such as Vanguard Windsor II,
Vanguard Index 500, and Vanguard Index Value.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not all that enthusiastic about your timing. The recent
faltering of the market may be tied to high interest rates and the
prospect of more of the same, but it may also be that the market
has come so far in the last four years that it has run ahead of
itself. Prices at this point don't seems to me to be reflecting
current earnings or dividends or even next year's earnings or
dividends, but rather the anticipated earnings and dividends
several years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I started by saying I'm not all that enthusiastic
about your timing. If nothing changes for the balance of this year,
my guess is that the stock markets are likely to enter the third
millennium in a state of exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, I would propose a three-pronged strategy.
First, for the next six or eight months, I would do nothing. If the
markets at that point seem stable and if earnings have been
catching up with the stock prices, I'd begin with modest transfers
into Windsor II and Index Value. Only in the third stage, perhaps
two or three years from now, when stocks might have reached what
analysts call a neutral stance _ in neither a bull nor a bear
market _ would I turn to fairly heavy reliance upon Vanguard Index
500. You could then treat that as your core holding _ perhaps
representing 50 percent of your retirement portfolio _ until about
five years before retirement, when you could look again to balanced
offerings such as Vanguard's LifeStrategy Moderate Growth or its
Balanced Index funds.
</P>
<P>
   Another suggestion I would make is to put any ongoing
contributions you make to the IRA into funds that will get you into
different market sectors. You might start with Vanguard's Mid-Cap
and Small Cap Index Funds and, if it reopens by the time you're
ready, its Health Care Fund, as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 32 years old, and my husband is 34. He is self-employed,
and, despite many New Year's resolutions, he has not put anything
away for retirement. (Please feel free to comment on this.) I have
been putting some money away over the years, and I'm wondering if
you can tell me what shape we're in and where we might be by age
55. We would probably like to retire with an income of about
$50,000. I currently put $80 a week into a 401(k) plan, and my
employer matches it by 50 percent. The money is invested 30 percent
each in Fidelity Advisor Growth Opportunities and Invesco
Industrial Income and 40 percent in Invesco Total Return. I have a
total of $7,500 in the account so far. I also have saved $27,500 in
other mutual fund accounts. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   A.T., Canton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. So you want me to scare the old man into action, eh? Well,
let's go through the numbers, and my guess is that they will do the
job without requiring much of a bawling out from me.
</P>
<P>
   If you continue at your current pace and your portfolio produced
average returns over 23 years (I used your age, since you're the
one doing all the saving), you would accumulate $828,477, a tidy
enough sum. You could then transfer it to a fixed-income portfolio,
and, if that portfolio produced average returns of 6.5 percent, it
would provide you with an income stream of $53,851 a year. Q.E.D.?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. There are two additional factors that wreck those
pleasant visions. Both relate to inflation. If inflation runs at an
average 3.5 percent during those 23 years, you will need $110,305
to buy what $50,000 buys today _ meaning that your income stream
would represent less than half of what you target. Second, when you
retire at an early age, such as 55, you need to think hard about
the effects that inflation will have on your finances in the later
years of retirement. Thus you will not only want a fixed-income
portfolio to supply your living expenses, but also some
supplemental savings that would remain in growth instruments, such
as your stock funds, so as to provide extra capital to buffer you
against that inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In short, you can't do it alone; you've got to get hubby
involved. Why not suggest he start with a SEP-IRA, which would be
funded through automatic monthly withdrawals from his checking
account. You could perhaps begin with an amount that's small enough
that it doesn't make much of a dent in his cash flow, ideally
raising it later as his earnings improve or as the realities of
financing his retirement sinks in and he becomes willing to
sacrifice a little comfort today in exchange for comfort in
retirement.

   BETHLEHEM, Pa. _ The debate leading the Kansas Board of
Education to abolish the requirement for teaching evolution has
about the same connection to reality as the play ``Inherit the
Wind'' had to the actual Scopes trial. In both cases complex
historical, scientific and philosophical issues gave way to the
simplifying demands of the morality play.
</P>
<P>
   If the schoolchildren of Kansas and other states are to receive
a good science education, however, then we'll have to forgo the fun
of demonizing each other, take a deep breath and start making a few
distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, the action of the Kansas board makes that much more
difficult. Not only are teachers there now discouraged from
discussing evidence in support of Darwin's theory, results
questioning it won't be heard either.
</P>
<P>
   For example, let's look at three claims of evidence for
Darwinian evolution often cited by high school textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   First, as the use of antibiotics has become common, mutant
strains of resistant bacteria have become more common, threatening
public health. Second, dark-colored variants of a certain moth
species evaded predation by birds because their color matched the
sooty tree trunks of industrial England. Third, the embryos of
fish, amphibians, birds and mammals look virtually identical in an
early stage of development, becoming different only at later
stages.
</P>
<P>
   A relevant distinction, however, is that only the first example
is true. The second example is unsupported by current evidence,
while the third is downright false. Although light- and
dark-colored moths did vary in expected ways in some regions of
England, elsewhere they didn't. Further, textbook photographs
showing moths resting on tree trunks in the day, where birds
supposedly ate them, run afoul of the fact that the moths are
active at night and don't normally rest on tree trunks.
</P>
<P>
   After learning about the problems with this favorite Darwinian
example, an evolutionary scientist wrote in the journal Nature that
he felt the way he did as a boy when he learned there was no Santa
Claus.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the embryos is an object lesson in seeing what you
want to see. Sketches of vertebrate embryos were first made in the
late 19th century by Ernst Haeckel, an admirer of Darwin. In the
intervening years, apparently nobody verified the accuracy of
Haeckel's drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent scientists declared in textbooks that the theory of
evolution predicted, explained and was supported by the striking
similarity of vertebrate embryos. And that is what generations of
American students have learned.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, an international team of scientists decided
to check the drawings' reliability. They found that Haeckel had,
well, taken liberties: The embryos are significantly different from
each other. In Nature, the head of the research team observed that
``it looks like it's turning out to be one of the most famous fakes
in biology.'' What's more, the embryonic stages shown in the
drawings are actually not the earliest ones. The earliest stages
show much greater variation.
</P>
<P>
   If I were teaching a high school biology course, I certainly
would want my students to understand Darwin's theory of evolution
by natural selection, which explains antibiotic resistance and a
lot of other things. I would want them to know the many
similarities among organisms that are interpreted in terms of
common descent, as well as to understand the laboratory experiments
that show organisms changing in response to selective pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But I would also want them to learn to make distinctions and ask
tough questions. Questions we might discuss include these:
</P>
<P>
   If it's so difficult to demonstrate that small changes in modern
moths are the result of natural selection, how confident can we be
that Darwinian selection drove large changes in the distant past?
</P>
<P>
   If supposedly identical embryos were touted as strong evidence
for evolution, does the recent demonstration of variation in
embryos now count as evidence against evolution?
</P>
<P>
   If some scientists relied for a century on an old, mistaken
piece of data because they thought it supported the accepted
theory, is it possible they might even now give short shrift to
legitimate contrary data or interpretations?
</P>
<P>
   Discussing questions such as these would help students see that
sometimes a theory actively shapes the way we think, and also that
there are still exciting, unanswered questions in biology that may
require fresh ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that Kansas students won't get to take part in such
a discussion. We should make sure that the students of other states
do.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions run very deep on the subject of evolution, and while
the morality play generally casts religious people as the ones who
want to limit discussion, some scientists on the ``rational'' side
could fit that role too. But if we want our children to become
educated citizens, we have to broaden discussion, not limit it.
</P>
<P>
   Teach Darwin's elegant theory. But also discuss where it has
real problems accounting for the data, where data are severely
limited, where scientists might be engaged in wishful thinking and
where alternative _ even ``heretical'' _ explanations are possible.

showing moths resting on tree trunks in the day, where birds
supposedly ate them, run afoul of the fact that the moths are
active at night and don't normally rest on tree trunks.
</P>
<P>
   After learning about the problems with this favorite Darwinian
example, an evolutionary scientist wrote in the journal Nature that
he felt the way he did as a boy when he learned there was no Santa
Claus.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the embryos is an object lesson in seeing what you
want to see. Sketches of vertebrate embryos were first made in the
late 19th century by Ernst Haeckel, an admirer of Darwin. In the
intervening years, apparently nobody verified the accuracy of
Haeckel's drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent scientists declared in textbooks that the theory of
evolution predicted, explained and was supported by the striking
similarity of vertebrate embryos. And that is what generations of
American students have learned.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, an international team of scientists decided
to check the drawings' reliability. They found that Haeckel had,
well, taken liberties: The embryos are significantly different from
each other. In Nature, the head of the research team observed that
``it looks like it's turning out to be one of the most famous fakes
in biology.'' What's more, the embryonic stages shown in the
drawings are actually not the earliest ones. The earliest stages
show much greater variation.
</P>
<P>
   If I were teaching a high school biology course, I certainly
would want my students to understand Darwin's theory of evolution
by natural selection, which explains antibiotic resistance and a
lot of other things. I would want them to know the many
similarities among organisms that are interpreted in terms of
common descent, as well as to understand the laboratory experiments
that show organisms changing in response to selective pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But I would also want them to learn to make distinctions and ask
tough questions. Questions we might discuss include these:
</P>
<P>
   If it's so difficult to demonstrate that small changes in modern
moths are the result of natural selection, how confident can we be
that Darwinian selection drove large changes in the distant past?
</P>
<P>
   If supposedly identical embryos were touted as strong evidence
for evolution, does the recent demonstration of variation in
embryos now count as evidence against evolution?
</P>
<P>
   If some scientists relied for a century on an old, mistaken
piece of data because they thought it supported the accepted
theory, is it possible they might even now give short shrift to
legitimate contrary data or interpretations?
</P>
<P>
   Discussing questions such as these would help students see that
sometimes a theory actively shapes the way we think, and also that
there are still exciting, unanswered questions in biology that may
require fresh ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that Kansas students won't get to take part in such
a discussion. We should make sure that the students of other states
do.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions run very deep on the subject of evolution, and while
the morality play generally casts religious people as the ones who
want to limit discussion, some scientists on the ``rational'' side
could fit that role too. But if we want our children to become
educated citizens, we have to broaden discussion, not limit it.
</P>
<P>
   Teach Darwin's elegant theory. But also discuss where it has
real problems accounting for the data, where data are severely
limited, where scientists might be engaged in wishful thinking and
where alternative _ even ``heretical'' _ explanations are possible.

   On the Russian space station Mir, flight engineer Sergei Avdeyev
has been in orbit since Aug. 13, 1998. He has now outlasted three
Russian prime ministers: Sergei Kiriyenko, appointed by President
Yeltsin in March 1998 and fired in August of the same year; Yevgeny
Primakov, appointed in September 1998 and fired in May 1999; and
Sergei Stepashin, appointed last May and fired on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin' new prime minister-designate _ and, if we are to
believe the president, heir apparent _ is Vladimir Putin. Will he
be welcoming Avdeyev, when the cosmonaut returns to Earth? This, as
they say, is a good question.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's seemingly impulsive decision has reminded historians
of the behavior of Czar Nicholas II in the final years of the
Russian Empire. Then too, premiers were replaced in a kaleidoscopic
manner and with no apparent logic. With a major war between the
government and Islamic secessionists brewing in Russia's south, the
similarities are indeed troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Is Yeltsin's decision to sack a loyal prime minister a coldly
calculated maneuver or, as even some of his former supporters are
saying, ``sheer madness?''
</P>
<P>
   Similar questions were first asked in March 1998, when the
president abruptly dismissed another loyalist, Viktor Cernomyrdin.
At the time, most Russian and foreign observers preferred to see
that as a rational move. Not so today. Just about everyone is sick
and tired of the political puppet show.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, amazingly and ironically, the president of Russia has
become the country's greatest destabilizing factor. Confrontation,
unpredictability and destabilization are the main ingredients of
Yeltsin's political style. Still, one might expect, so close to the
end of his final term in office, that he would modify that style
out of concern for his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   It is not happening because the president is desperate. Yeltsin
is desperate because he does not know how to impose his will on
Russia's future. Protecting his cronies and members of his family
from possible prosecution after he goes may well be on his mind,
but it is only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is casting about for a strategy that will make him
relevant during his final year. And no such strategy is available.
Therefore, his convulsive moves may be not as dangerous as they
first look. More and more, they just look ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   His designation of Putin _ virtually unknown to the people,
faceless and with no trace of charisma _ as the man who could
``lead Russia into the next century,'' is a case in point. Putin's
chances of being elected president in a free and fair election are
zero. And Yeltsin's capacity to engineer a scenario that would push
him through in some other way is not that great either.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Russian society is weak and the Russian
political establishment cowardly; even so, neither are likely to
allow Yeltsin to extend his era beyond the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's main concern has always been with power politics and
personnel reshuffles rather than policy making. His supporters in
Russia and in the West have always admired his unfailing political
instincts. It is those instincts, they say, that have saved Russia
from a return to the past.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that Yeltsin's failed policies and erratic
behavior have become Russia's main problem. The country is being
saved by its amazing resilience.
</P>
<P>
   After the economic collapse in August 1998, there were
predictions of all kinds of disaster _ riots, famine, perhaps
military dictatorship. It didn't happen. Primakov was no miracle
worker but he was able to restore sanity to the political process,
and both the economy and the people responded positively to his
quiet therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is now the most popular politician in Russia. If the
elections were held today he would be chosen overwhelmingly.
Yeltsin clearly wants no part of this scenario; he is rocking the
boat. The challenge for the State Duma, or parliament, is to steer
a course to two crucial destinations _ parliamentary elections in
December and presidential elections in July.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma refuses to approve Putin's nomination, Yeltsin can
dissolve the group, throwing the political calendar into disarray.
So, no matter how disgusted they are, the Duma members will
probably say yes to Yeltsin once again. The real work of solving
the country's multiple problems will have to be done by the next
president and a new parliament.

 By RUTH CONNIFF  
 c.1999 The Progressive  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for
Women, is probably the most visible representative of feminism in
the United States. She's always in the hot seat _ called upon to
account for everything from feminists' ``coziness'' with the
Clinton administration to the perception that feminists are a bunch
of man-bashing radicals.
</P>
<P>
   In her own life, Ireland has been through a lot of changes. She
writes in her autobiography, ``What Women Want'' (Dutton 1996),
about her seven-year career as an airline stewardess, as well as,
years later, breaking the ``glass ceiling'' by becoming one of the
first women to make partner in a corporate law firm.
</P>
<P>
   We met for a couple of hours in her corner office at NOW's
national headquarters in Washington, D.C.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUTH CONNIFF: You tell a story in your book about a bomb threat
while you were working as an airline stewardess. The pilot asked
you to stay on the plane to cook him a steak.
</P>
<P>
   PATRICIA IRELAND: Right, everyone else got off, while the plane
was about to be exploded at any moment, as far as we could tell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You decided to turn off the grill and get off the plane too,
and to tell the pilot to cook his own steak. Was that a turning
point for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah. There were those little progressions. I don't think
anything radicalized me as much as being a stewardess. It was what
made those blinders fall from my eyes. ... Why in the world was I
standing in an airplane that might be blown up at any minute while
this guy was sitting in the crew lounge safe and waiting for his
steak? Get serious!
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of moments like that. That one just struck
me particularly because it was so outrageous. Because planes WERE
being blown up. It wasn't like it was a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   I came up in school when all of these movements were out there:
the free-speech movement, the civil-rights movement, the
women's-rights movement. The anti-war movement was very big when I
was in college. And I was an armchair supporter. I thought, ``Yeah,
that's great, I agree with that.'' But I was never active at all.
It really wasn't until something touched me personally that I
recognized you have to learn to fight back. And if you have a
movement, you're more likely to have success.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get from stewardess to corporate lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because (at the airline) I discovered the disparity in the
benefits that the women got vs. what the men got _ it had been
totally illegal for years. And yet nobody among us had known our
rights. I didn't even have to file a lawsuit. I just had to go to
the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   Just as now, women who are being pushed off public assistance
don't know that they still should and can get food stamps and child
care. Years ago we didn't know it was illegal for the company to
have this benefit package that covered men's families but not
women's. And nobody challenged it.
</P>
<P>
   So when I figured out how many years the company had gotten away
with that _ how much money women and their families had been ripped
off for the corporate bottom line _ I just figured I wanted to go
to law school and know more about how to enforce those rights.
</P>
<P>
   All through law school I took courses I thought I'd use _ law
and the poor, civil rights and the law, women's rights and the law,
social policy and the law. I got my lowest grades in corporate law.
I never took securities law. And I really thought I was going to do
international law work, and especially international human-rights
work.
</P>
<P>
   Then I discovered that to get to do international law I would
have to move to Washington or go out to L.A. I really loved Miami,
so that was private international law _ private business
transactions. I looked at all my friends who were going into Legal
Services or becoming public defenders, and I just figured I would
be very frustrated by doing that. Also I found, much to my
surprise, that in representing a lot of these corporations that
needed affirmative-action plans, I could go in as their lawyer, and
they knew I was on their side, and without a big fight I could get
them to do things I could not possibly have gotten them to do as a
plaintiffs' counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You and other feminists have been accused of not wreaking
havoc or taking shots at President Clinton. Barbara Ehrenreich
wrote an op-ed in The New York Times accusing you of being too cozy
with him. And I went to a press conference at the Democratic
Convention where Gloria Steinem and other prominent feminists said,
``We've got to vote for him because he's the only one who can undo
the welfare legislation he just signed.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. But we were never part of that. And we never endorsed
him. I was arrested in front of his White House protesting the
welfare repeal. And one of the things I was peeved at Barbara about
was for saying I had gone to the Democratic Convention and danced
the macarena. I never went inside the Democratic Convention. I went
there to see if we could get some demonstrations going on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I went to Chicago because we had meetings with
Clinton administration officials who were trying to negotiate on
what they could do to settle us down about welfare. They wanted to
meet with us and hear from people we had gathered together about
the tie between domestic violence and poverty. They were in the
process of writing the rules on welfare: Could you get a temporary
exemption for women in poverty because of horrendous violence in
their lives? How did you deal with women who were stalked or
attacked in the workplace and therefore couldn't keep a job?
</P>
<P>
   We didn't endorse Clinton, we took him on full force over the
poverty issue and over lesbians and gays in the military, and yet
because we go in the door and negotiate about these issues,
suddenly we're ``in his camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't NOW pull its punches when it came to the sexual
accusations against Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Go back and look at the web and some of the transcripts.
I have called him everything on television. I've said we weren't
defending him, that his actions were indefensible. You know, I've
been very hard-edged about what he's done.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are we better off with Clinton than we would have been with
Bush or Dole?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. And at the same time, I really think Clinton has got a
very serious problem. Clinton is beyond what even the worst of the
culture of men usually behave like. When I was a stewardess, the ad
campaigns were ``We really move our tails for you'' and ``Fly me.''
I saw some of the worst of the worst of guys when they were away
from their families and thought they could do anything they wanted.
And when I first heard this story, I could not imagine even the
most outrageous pilot or passenger I knew dropping trousers and
asking for a blow job. What is that about?
</P>
<P>
   So I think he's got a serious problem. And that's why, again,
we're so focused on trying to get more candidates we can trust into
the political pipeline. I think I've been pretty hard on Clinton.
But it isn't what some of the reporters wanted to hear or see. I
think what they wanted was to say, ``Oh, the feminists are
defending Clinton.'' And, true, the real news would be if all the
feminists agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You caused some problems for Janet Reno when she arrived in
Washington by revealing that you played softball with her.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, yes _ I really thought that was most amusing. I was
trying to put forward a different image from the one that got
across. Of course, every softball team I know and every soccer team
_ I wouldn't say they're all lesbian, but ... that was an amusing
little sidelight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does Reno play softball a lot? Are you still playing against
her?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. We played when we were both much younger, in a women's
law league _ all women lawyers. It was great. It was one of those
things for some of us who missed Title IX, and didn't get to play
sports in high school and college. The first time I could look out
there and go, ``Hmmm, they're not covered in right field, that's
where this ball is going,'' and I was able to hit it where I wanted
to _ that felt like a real accomplishment! Especially for someone
who had no sports skills growing up. It's just a fun thing. And
Reno was a heck of a player. I mean, she was scary.
</P>
<P>
   I remember I was playing first base when she was batting, and
when she was running the bases you definitely did not want to make
the mistake of being on the baseline. She was just an aggressive,
physical player. And I admired that, at the same time as it scared
me. When I met her, I just thought: Wow, who is this tall, strong,
aggressive player? Turned out to be Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about how Monica Lewinsky ended up? Was she
exploited or not?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think she's very young. I think you don't show your thong
bikini underwear to your employer without giving a signal of some
sort that you'd welcome a sexual advance. And I don't think anybody
tried to coerce her into anything, except Ken Starr and his merry
band of men.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time I fear that she will live to regret this,
although she seems temporarily to be riding high. Part of what
happens with any young woman who comes to see her only value as her
sexual appeal and her conventional attractiveness, who is so
obsessed with her body being too large, and trying to fill that
insecurity with attention from men, is that the ageism of the
culture catches up to her.
</P>
<P>
   You are only sexually attractive, conventionally, for a very
brief period in an otherwise long life. And if you don't have
something else about yourself that you value _ forget about whether
the rest of the world values it, but just start with yourself _ you
don't have anything to fall back on. When the next boss or series
of bosses are looking at the younger and younger women, what is she
going to have to feel good about herself? What does she value in
herself? And what does she have to offer of value that she's going
to present to the world? I worry about that. In that sense, I think
she has made some really big mistakes that are going to catch up to
her.

   Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for
Women, is probably the most visible representative of feminism in
the United States. She's always in the hot seat _ called upon to
account for everything from feminists' ``coziness'' with the
Clinton administration to the perception that feminists are a bunch
of man-bashing radicals.
</P>
<P>
   In her own life, Ireland has been through a lot of changes. She
writes in her autobiography, ``What Women Want'' (Dutton 1996),
about her seven-year career as an airline stewardess, as well as,
years later, breaking the ``glass ceiling'' by becoming one of the
first women to make partner in a corporate law firm.
</P>
<P>
   We met for a couple of hours in her corner office at NOW's
national headquarters in Washington, D.C.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUTH CONNIFF: You tell a story in your book about a bomb threat
while you were working as an airline stewardess. The pilot asked
you to stay on the plane to cook him a steak.
</P>
<P>
   PATRICIA IRELAND: Right, everyone else got off, while the plane
was about to be exploded at any moment, as far as we could tell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You decided to turn off the grill and get off the plane too,
and to tell the pilot to cook his own steak. Was that a turning
point for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yeah. There were those little progressions. I don't think
anything radicalized me as much as being a stewardess. It was what
made those blinders fall from my eyes. ... Why in the world was I
standing in an airplane that might be blown up at any minute while
this guy was sitting in the crew lounge safe and waiting for his
steak? Get serious!
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of moments like that. That one just struck
me particularly because it was so outrageous. Because planes WERE
being blown up. It wasn't like it was a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   I came up in school when all of these movements were out there:
the free-speech movement, the civil-rights movement, the
women's-rights movement. The anti-war movement was very big when I
was in college. And I was an armchair supporter. I thought, ``Yeah,
that's great, I agree with that.'' But I was never active at all.
It really wasn't until something touched me personally that I
recognized you have to learn to fight back. And if you have a
movement, you're more likely to have success.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get from stewardess to corporate lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because (at the airline) I discovered the disparity in the
benefits that the women got vs. what the men got _ it had been
totally illegal for years. And yet nobody among us had known our
rights. I didn't even have to file a lawsuit. I just had to go to
the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   Just as now, women who are being pushed off public assistance
don't know that they still should and can get food stamps and child
care. Years ago we didn't know it was illegal for the company to
have this benefit package that covered men's families but not
women's. And nobody challenged it.
</P>
<P>
   So when I figured out how many years the company had gotten away
with that _ how much money women and their families had been ripped
off for the corporate bottom line _ I just figured I wanted to go
to law school and know more about how to enforce those rights.
</P>
<P>
   All through law school I took courses I thought I'd use _ law
and the poor, civil rights and the law, women's rights and the law,
social policy and the law. I got my lowest grades in corporate law.
I never took securities law. And I really thought I was going to do
international law work, and especially international human-rights
work.
</P>
<P>
   Then I discovered that to get to do international law I would
have to move to Washington or go out to L.A. I really loved Miami,
so that was private international law _ private business
transactions. I looked at all my friends who were going into Legal
Services or becoming public defenders, and I just figured I would
be very frustrated by doing that. Also I found, much to my
surprise, that in representing a lot of these corporations that
needed affirmative-action plans, I could go in as their lawyer, and
they knew I was on their side, and without a big fight I could get
them to do things I could not possibly have gotten them to do as a
plaintiffs' counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You and other feminists have been accused of not wreaking
havoc or taking shots at President Clinton. Barbara Ehrenreich
wrote an op-ed in The New York Times accusing you of being too cozy
with him. And I went to a press conference at the Democratic
Convention where Gloria Steinem and other prominent feminists said,
``We've got to vote for him because he's the only one who can undo
the welfare legislation he just signed.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. But we were never part of that. And we never endorsed
him. I was arrested in front of his White House protesting the
welfare repeal. And one of the things I was peeved at Barbara about
was for saying I had gone to the Democratic Convention and danced
the macarena. I never went inside the Democratic Convention. I went
there to see if we could get some demonstrations going on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I went to Chicago because we had meetings with
Clinton administration officials who were trying to negotiate on
what they could do to settle us down about welfare. They wanted to
meet with us and hear from people we had gathered together about
the tie between domestic violence and poverty. They were in the
process of writing the rules on welfare: Could you get a temporary
exemption for women in poverty because of horrendous violence in
their lives? How did you deal with women who were stalked or
attacked in the workplace and therefore couldn't keep a job?
</P>
<P>
   We didn't endorse Clinton, we took him on full force over the
poverty issue and over lesbians and gays in the military, and yet
because we go in the door and negotiate about these issues,
suddenly we're ``in his camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't NOW pull its punches when it came to the sexual
accusations against Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Go back and look at the web and some of the transcripts.
I have called him everything on television. I've said we weren't
defending him, that his actions were indefensible. You know, I've
been very hard-edged about what he's done.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are we better off with Clinton than we would have been with
Bush or Dole?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. And at the same time, I really think Clinton has got a
very serious problem. Clinton is beyond what even the worst of the
culture of men usually behave like. When I was a stewardess, the ad
campaigns were ``We really move our tails for you'' and ``Fly me.''
I saw some of the worst of the worst of guys when they were away
from their families and thought they could do anything they wanted.
And when I first heard this story, I could not imagine even the
most outrageous pilot or passenger I knew dropping trousers and
asking for a blow job. What is that about?
</P>
<P>
   So I think he's got a serious problem. And that's why, again,
we're so focused on trying to get more candidates we can trust into
the political pipeline. I think I've been pretty hard on Clinton.
But it isn't what some of the reporters wanted to hear or see. I
think what they wanted was to say, ``Oh, the feminists are
defending Clinton.'' And, true, the real news would be if all the
feminists agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You caused some problems for Janet Reno when she arrived in
Washington by revealing that you played softball with her.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, yes _ I really thought that was most amusing. I was
trying to put forward a different image from the one that got
across. Of course, every softball team I know and every soccer team
_ I wouldn't say they're all lesbian, but ... that was an amusing
little sidelight.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does Reno play softball a lot? Are you still playing against
her?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. We played when we were both much younger, in a women's
law league _ all women lawyers. It was great. It was one of those
things for some of us who missed Title IX, and didn't get to play
sports in high school and college. The first time I could look out
there and go, ``Hmmm, they're not covered in right field, that's
where this ball is going,'' and I was able to hit it where I wanted
to _ that felt like a real accomplishment! Especially for someone
who had no sports skills growing up. It's just a fun thing. And
Reno was a heck of a player. I mean, she was scary.
</P>
<P>
   I remember I was playing first base when she was batting, and
when she was running the bases you definitely did not want to make
the mistake of being on the baseline. She was just an aggressive,
physical player. And I admired that, at the same time as it scared
me. When I met her, I just thought: Wow, who is this tall, strong,
aggressive player? Turned out to be Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about how Monica Lewinsky ended up? Was she
exploited or not?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think she's very young. I think you don't show your thong
bikini underwear to your employer without giving a signal of some
sort that you'd welcome a sexual advance. And I don't think anybody
tried to coerce her into anything, except Ken Starr and his merry
band of men.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time I fear that she will live to regret this,
although she seems temporarily to be riding high. Part of what
happens with any young woman who comes to see her only value as her
sexual appeal and her conventional attractiveness, who is so
obsessed with her body being too large, and trying to fill that
insecurity with attention from men, is that the ageism of the

</P>

   Contrary to widespread public opinion, the danger of a nuclear
confrontation between the United States and Russia has not receded.
It's no secret that Russia's instability makes the rest of the
world less secure. In response to its military weakness, President
Boris Yeltsin in April approved ``a blueprint for the development
and use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons,'' which would modernize
some of the tactical and short-range weapons Russia removed from
its arsenal several years ago. Russia and the United States had a
joint plan to address Y2K's potential nuclear command-and-control
problems; but the project has been put on hold.

<P>
   Parents always wonder how much influence they have on their
children. Two recent books have interesting things to say on that
question. But because they go into much depth, neither seems likely
to reach a general readership. And that's too bad.
</P>
<P>
   Seen together, they open a dialogue on how much parenting
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stranger in the Nest'' by David Cohen, a University of Texas
psychology professor, looks at the nature vs. nurture question and
comes down pretty hard for nature _ though he does suggest that
events in the womb also can play a role in development. Backed up
by scientific studies, his book carries pages of chapter notes and
bibliography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hand Me Down Dreams,'' a book by Mary Jacobsen, a
Massachusetts social worker and psychotherapist, is heavier on
nurture. She suggests children often find themselves unknowingly
living out the dreams of their parents. She applies ideas commonly
accepted in family systems therapy and offers pages of tips for
readers on how to change.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, on the other hand, sees family behavior as less powerful.
He views parents as ``witnesses to the miracle of child
development,'' rather than the ones who make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me,'' he said, ``that parenting is about managing
behavior. While a kid is developing his intelligence and his
personality, parents are managing behavior. Keeping a lid on the
nasty inclinations and trying to promote potentials by giving
opportunities. ... Then the child moves out of the nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A parent's ability to impose their agenda on their child is
rather limited, it turns out.''
</P>
<P>
   If most of what a child becomes is biology _ genetics and
prenatal, as Cohen argues, then both parental and peer influence
are not all we've thought, though they can have a strong effect at
least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that parents need not be blamed every time a
child does something horrible.

CITY SEEKS TO BROADEN TREATMENT FOR HEROIN ADDICTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco is pushing to become the first
city in the nation to make methadone treatment for heroin addicts
widely available.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would allow physicians to prescribe methadone, a
federally regulated synthetic narcotic currently available only
through a handful of specialized clinics in the city.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco public health officials and Gavin Newsom, a member
of the Board of Supervisors, are leading the drive. They say the
change would make it more convenient for addicts to get treatment
for their substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 of the estimated 13,000 to 15,000 heroin users in the
city are enrolled in a methadone program, a treatment method that
federal studies have shown to be a highly effective way to help
heroin addicts kick the habit or at least function better in
society.
</P>
<P>
   Federal studies also have shown that addicts on methadone are
less likely to commit crimes and more likely to work than if they
were still using heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Only Baltimore, Connecticut and New York City have tried
methadone programs like the one San Francisco is contemplating, but
on a smaller scale. The program San Francisco is looking at would
be much broader in scope by enlisting physicians trained in
administering methadone.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, New Zealand, Canada and some European nations have
incorporated physician-based methadone treatment into their
mainstream health care practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that methadone works; that's incontrovertible. That's
not even part of the debate,'' Newsom said.
</P>
<P>
   What is at the heart of the debate is how methadone should be
distributed. Currently, only nine clinics in the city dispense it.
City officials say a close look at federal drug-control statutes
reveals that individual physicians could do the same _ with special
permission.
</P>
<P>
   What is missing, supporters of the plan say, is an
institutionalized framework to make it work. The city's plan would
permit physicians _ in both the private and public sectors _ to
prescribe methadone through the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   The department would oversee training and help participating
doctors through the inevitable federal inspections. Additionally,
the city would help get federal and state funding to help subsidize
the treatment, which can cost from $4,000 to $5,000 per year per
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Garcia, the deputy health director who oversees
substance abuse services, said federal authorities must approve the
details of the plan, but she is optimistic and hopes to see the
program running within a year.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco already spends about $900,000 of its own money on
methadone treatment. Garcia said another $4 million to $8 million
would be needed to serve another 1,000 people who couldn't afford
treatment under the proposed physician-based system.

HOUSTON SEEKS NEW SLOGAN, NICKNAME FOR 2012 OLYMPIC BID 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston, the city that's hard to define, is once again trying to
define itself.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the city has come up with the ironic slogans
``Houston's Hot'' and ``Houston: Expect the Unexpected'' with its
sense of unintended irony.
</P>
<P>
   But none are the instant-recognition monikers such as ``The Big
Apple,'' or ``Tinseltown,'' or ``The Big Easy'' or even ``The Big
D.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Houstonians trying to lure the 2012 Summer Olympic Games
are hoping to come up with a slogan that defines the fourth-largest
city in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It's no easy task, said Chuck Carlberg, president of the Rives
Carlberg advertising firm. Although Houstonians really like living
here, he said, at times they have trouble defining themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's population is seemingly always in flux. About 75
percent of its residents come from other cities. One in 10 has
lived in Houston less than four years, while almost half have lived
here less than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always trying to get a sense of who we are,'' Carlberg
said. ``And I'm not sure anyone has gotten it, yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Houston 2012 Foundation met recently at the
George R. Brown Convention Center to try and ``get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlberg, whose company is providing promotional consulting,
wants the group to focus on Houston being a frontier.
</P>
<P>
   That brings a sense of Houston being a rough-and-ready town of
the Old West, he said, but it also captures the idea that Houston
is a city of the new frontier. The city has been a pioneer in
several fields, including space, medicine, technology, energy and
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   So Carlberg tossed out two proposals for the group.
</P>
<P>
   The first, with its unintentional reference to the Kennedy
administration, was ``Houston: The Spirit of the New Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   The second was ``Houston: Where the Frontier Spirit Is Alive and
Kickin'.'' Neither won rave reviews, especially the latter, which
had no supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some foundation members are sensitive to Houston getting its
image too closely aligned with the Wild West. Yes, Houston has the
world's largest rodeo, but they don't want the city to be
identified simply as that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be careful not to cast ourselves as country
hicks,'' said foundation President George DeMontrond.
</P>
<P>
   Jordy Tollett, head of the Greater Houston Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau, which spends about $2 million annually to promote Houston,
expressed a similar concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that it's bad, but people might not think we're as
sophisticated as Dallas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, also seeking the 2012 Summer Games, was on everyone's
mind. The group wants to get its logo in place first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I want to get the Texas concept before they do,''
DeMontrond confided.
</P>
<P>
   Most agreed that having an association with Texas is important
to the effort, especially should Houston become the choice of the
U.S. Olympic Committee. At that point, the city would have to lobby
the International Olympic Committee for the final selection.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People in South America, Central America, Canada _ when they
think of Texas, it's very positively,'' said City Councilwoman
Martha Wong. ``We ought to take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The group sent the proposal back to the drawing board, endorsing
the notion of bringing the frontier concept into the logo. Two
slogans may eventually emerge, one for the USOC effort and one for
the IOC drive.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they will ``get it,'' maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only slogan that seems to have any staying power in Houston
is the age-old ``Bayou City,'' which could fit half the cities on
the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But it's better than a combination of the previous two,
``Houston: Unexpectedly Hot.''

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LARRY ROBISON STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every parent in America who has more than one child has uttered
the words, ``Let me hear the other side of the story,'' before
passing judgment on who was guilty and who was innocent of whatever
infraction is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Robison, the mother of convicted killer Larry Keith
Robison, is working overtime to make sure that the world _ or at
the very least the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and the
governor's office _ hears her son's side of the story in an attempt
to win clemency from his date with execution next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robison has been twice convicted _ by separate juries
before different judges _ of fatally shooting Bruce Gardner on Aug.
10, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner wasn't the only one to die by Robison's hand that day.
Robison killed four other people, including a boy on his 11th
birthday, before taking a shower, changing clothes and leaving the
scene in Gardner's car. He stole Gardner's wallet, making it
difficult for police to identify the body and trace the stolen car.
He even changed the license plates on the car to evade capture.
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction, Robison accepted the death penalty
sentence as ``God's will'' and was initially ambivalent about his
attorneys' efforts to appeal his sentence. In a 1990 interview with
the Fort Worth Star-Telegram from his Death Row confines, he again
admitted to the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Robison says her son has been mentally ill all his adult
life but couldn't get treatment. The family tried repeatedly to
have him institutionalized for schizophrenia but was unsuccessful
because he didn't exhibit any signs of violent behavior, his mother
says. Lock him away forever, she pleads, but don't kill my boy.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, counters Melissa Estes, a Fort Worth native and
graduate of the University of Texas who practices law in Oregon.
Gardner was Estes' cousin. Although she no doubt understands a
mother's desire to save her son, she takes issue with people who
want to discount the decisions made by 24 jurors who agonized over
all the testimony and evidence before rejecting the defense
strategy of Robison's mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robison was never diagnosed as mentally ill until after he
committed these murders, and then only by defense expert witnesses
as a defense tactic,'' Estes wrote in a letter rebutting recent
Star-Telegram columns by Molly Ivins and Bob Ray Sanders that
called for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Estes says that through court testimony it was learned that
Robison in fact was institutionalized, even jailed, on several
occasions, but it was for illegal drug use, not schizophrenia.
``Robison's defense attorneys selected a defense other than `a
drug-induced killing spree,' which didn't help Karla Faye Tucker.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll remember that Tucker was executed last year for her part
in a grisly 1983 pick-ax murder. Her defense strategy of ``I didn't
know what I was doing because of the drugs I took'' didn't cut it
with her jury.
</P>
<P>
   Robison admitted to using LSD, amphetamines, marijuana,
tranquilizers, PCP and other illegal drugs. Medical experts
testified that long-term drug abuse such as Robison's could cause
symptoms of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, defense attorneys testified that Robison heard
voices, a symptom of his mental illness. In a taped conversation
that was transcribed and published in the Star-Telegram, Robison
admitted to a friend that the voices were an invention.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most strident capital punishment supporter balks at the
idea of executing an innocent man. There is no question in anyone's
mind that Robison is guilty of these heinous crimes, the details of
which I have deliberately omitted because they are too graphic to
review over your morning orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke screen that is being raised to stop his appointment
with the needle next Tuesday is whether Robison is mentally ill to
the point that he knew not what he was doing that hot August day at
two cottages near Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four jurors and numerous appeals courts heard both sides
of the story, they reviewed every shred of evidence and testimony
provided, and they said Larry Keith Robison must face the
consequences for his actions. Next Tuesday. In Huntsville. Let God
provide the mercy.

GUN LAWS FOR A SAFER AMERICA?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   News of those shootings in Los Angeles had barely hit the
airwaves before the anti-gun crowd was exploiting this new tragedy
to advance their political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only hope that this latest incident will intensify our
resolve to make America a safer place,'' President Clinton said,
adroitly avoiding any specific mention of the gun-control measures
he's been promoting since the Columbine High School shootings in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't have to be specific. Everybody knew what he meant
when he spoke of the need to ``make America a safer place.''
</P>
<P>
   The insistence that more gun laws will make America safer is the
essence of the gun-control crusade. But it's a flawed premise
because the people we are trying to keep the guns away from will
always be able to get their hands on guns.
</P>
<P>
   We can restrict, regulate and even outlaw guns until the cows
come home, but the sad fact remains: People who are bent on
wreaking death and destruction on their fellow humans are no more
likely to be stymied by laws against guns than they are by laws
against assault and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The only certain result of ever-increasing gun control is that
law-abiding citizens find it ever more difficult to arm themselves
in defense of their lives and property. Law-abiding citizens will
obey gun laws just as conscientiously as they obey other laws;
criminals will violate gun laws just as relentlessly as they
violate any law that attempts to deter criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the biggest problem with the constantly intensifying
_ to borrow Clinton's word _ campaign to banish firearms: The
Constitution of the United States guarantees the citizenry's right
to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   The folks who want to rid society of guns obviously wish that
the founders had not adopted this guarantee in the form of the
Second Amendment to the defining document of our great nation _
just as those who loathe the media wish there were no First
Amendment guaranteeing freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Just as those who distrust the justice system wish that the
Constitution's authors had not devised a Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,
Seventh or Eighth Amendment to protect the rights of people accused
of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   As I always note when writing about this subject, I am not a
``gun nut.'' I'm not even a gun owner, and I have no plans to
become one.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bill of Rights is the Bill of Rights. These rights were
not intended to go with the flow, as it were, becoming targets for
restriction or even eradication whenever it might seem fashionable
to attack them.
</P>
<P>
   I howl in indignation when opponents of the First Amendment
attempt to undermine its guarantees of free speech, press and
religion. It would be hypocritical for anyone who opposes
governmental tampering with the First Amendment to sit idly by
while anti-gun forces try to destroy the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake about it: They can wail all they want to
that they're only pushing for reasonable restrictions on guns, but
their ultimate goal is abolishing Americans' right to ``keep and
bear arms.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Tuesday's tragedy at and near the Jewish community center
in California, does anyone seriously believe that the white
supremacist wacko who perpetrated that shooting spree could have
been rendered harmless by any gun law? It appears that the weaponry
that felon Buford Furrow was hauling around the countryside was in
his possession illegally. What new law would prevent such a
homicidal maniac from committing murder and mayhem?
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: It is much easier to pass gun laws than to
address the challenging problems of evil and violence in our
society. Every time some crazed gunman shoots up a schoolyard or a
workplace, we react by passing some more gun laws, dutifully
reinforcing our commitment to ``intensify our resolve to make
America a safer place.''
</P>
<P>
   But one more gun law _ or 100 more gun laws _ will do nothing to
make America safer, because such laws do nothing to address the
underlying evil that causes these horrifying acts of violence.

 &HT;    BARAK'S MILITARY STYLE UNDER FIRE IN OFFICE
 &HT;    700&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Aug. 15 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ During his campaign, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak touted his reputation as Israel's ``Number 1 soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some Israelis are chafing at the military outlook of their
new commando-in-chief. To their surprise, Barak has kept the peace
process on hold and sidelined the country's most famous doves.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 57, won in a landslide in the May elections. Israel's
most decorated soldier, he promised to bring unity to the divided
country and to restart the peace process with the Arabs, which
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu left in a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks into the job, his standing with average Israelis is
still intact. But, he has alienated some within his own Labor Party
with the tight lid he keeps on his policies and the clique of
former army colleagues around which he centralizes power.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, he has brought new faces and a new _ possibly
risky _ approach to the six-year-old Oslo peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the picture now is Barak's Labor Party rival Shimon
Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Barak gave him an ill-defined
new ministry post. According to newspaper reports, Peres needs
office space and is ``taciturn'' at meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Peres is an idealistic peacemaker and party politician. He wrote
a book about the ``New Middle East,'' where Arabs and Jews would
learn to trust each other and work together.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is a military man and systems engineer. He talks little
about trust, but rather ``separation.'' He is skeptical of the
Peres approach, spelled out in the 1993 Oslo Accords, of exchanging
concessions with the Arabs in step-by-step confidence building
moves.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of most in the region, Barak did not immediately
resume land transfers to the Palestinians. Instead, he has sought
to restructure the next phase, the Wye River Memorandum that Israel
signed in October.
</P>
<P>
   The goodwill many Palestinians offered Barak upon his taking
office has now deteriorated and small-scale terror attacks are
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Before continuing the land transfers, Barak wants a better
picture of what concessions Israel may have to make later in the
process. That demand shows the difference between the military
approach of Barak and the diplomatic approach of Oslo's creators
like Peres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel put down a down payment without knowing the final
price,'' said political scientist Shmuel(CQ) Sandler, at Tel Aviv's
Bar-Ilan University. ``Military people like to see the real price.
They like substance. Politicians are more liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's harder line on Wye is consistent with the Israeli
apprehension about giving up land. Even some Oslo architects, in
light of difficulties that have occurred in implementing the plan,
have backed Barak's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Those who back the new prime minister say he reflects the
pragmatic approach of his mentor, slain prime minister, and fellow
general, Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Others say he differs from Rabin by defying Israel's old
political order.
</P>
<P>
   The debate crystallized two weeks ago when Barak snubbed a
leader of Israel's old political elite.
</P>
<P>
   He passed over Yael Dayan, an accomplished member of parliament
in Barak's Labor Party and the daughter of legendary general Moshe
Dayan, for one of his last minister posts. He gave the job to

<P>
   Dayan confronted Barak on the floor of the parliament and
accused him of arrogance. Referring to a famous commando raid, in
which Barak was photographed poised on the wing of a hijacked
airliner, she told him he was metaphorically still on that wing,
looking down on his party colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dayan remains hopeful that Barak's methods will not damper
public opinion about how he delivers in the job, especially in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our favorite democratic sort of behavior, but I would
be careful in defining it as something that will bring opposition
to the results. His results will be judged on their own,'' she said
in an interview with Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Others have been tougher in their criticism, often keying on his
commando background.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't listen, bears grudges and, perhaps most important
of all, we learned that there is no one who can stop this
general,'' wrote political columnist Chemi Shelev in the Israeli
daily Ma'ariv.
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Nahum Barnea, in the daily Yedioth Aharanot, said
Barak fails to understand that, in politics, ``There is no squad
commander to map out the goal . . . no repeated shooting practices,
no training. You learn as you go.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Critics warn that Barak will need the help of those he is now
alienating.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Peres, Barak moved aside Yossi Beilin, an Oslo
architect and a Peres prodigy. Beilin failed to get the foreign
minister post he coveted. Instead, he was made justice minister, a
job with little influence over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Another dove and Labor Party stalwart, Avraham Burg, got no
ministry post. Against Barak's wishes, he then set out on his own
and won the job as parliamentary speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barak has given key jobs to those with military and
intelligence backgrounds like his. Danny Yatom, who ran Israel's
spy agency, the Mossad, is chief of staff in the prime minister's
office. Zvi Stauber, who worked in military intelligence under
Barak, is the key foreign policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel's second highest-ranking job, defense minister, Barak
chose to do it himself. He holds that job with the prime minister's
post, as did Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Eiran, who was a senior aide to Rabin and a regional
campaign chairman for Barak, sees other resemblances between the
two men. Like Rabin, Barak eschews party formalities and cares
little about public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All his life, he was a military man. Very practical. He
doesn't like the traditional political nonsense and debating
everything so openly,'' Eiran said. ``He doesn't want to waste time
on nonsense.''

GETTING THE PHONE ALL LINED UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am a newcomer to the Net and have only one
phone line. Are there any ways of receiving my phone calls while
I'm on the Net?
</P>
<P>
   _ Busy Signal
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BUSY: Who needs a phone? When I'm surfing, I just listen to
the voices I hear in my head and do whatever they say. At least,
that's what my attorney has advised me to say.
</P>
<P>
   One of those voices belongs to Al Gore. Maybe you've heard Al
babbling about the lack of ``infrastructure'' when he's not taking
credit for inventing the Internet, cold fusion and string cheese.
What he's trying to say in his own adorably English-impaired way is
``wires.'' And most of us just don't have enough wires for all we
want to do.
</P>
<P>
   Well, don't count on seeing the country completely rewired any
time soon. Our government can barely decide how big congressional
pay raises should be without coming to a complete standstill. And
if they get any more involved in this project, we'll wind up with
an over-spec'd network built from substandard hardware installed by
the lowest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we make do with the wires we have and count on
industry to come up with new ways to squeeze the most out of them.
The easiest path for you, Busy, is to get a second phone line. The
good news is that most existing residential phone wiring can
already accommodate one. Sure, a phone guy will come out to pretend
he's still got an important job. He'll tighten a few screws, and
then he'll have the guys downtown open the circuit. You can buy
some dual phone jacks and take care of the inside wiring yourself.
The four-conductor cable carries one line on the green and red
wires and the second on the yellow and black. It's really hard to
mess it up.
</P>
<P>
   The next step up is DSL, which is geek-ese for a digital phone
line. The existing copper wiring in your house carries both a
high-speed, continuous Internet connection (as fast as 1.5 megabits
per second vs. a top speed of 53K on a modem) and regular voice
calls for as little as 40 bucks a month, depending on your area.
The downside is you'll have to lay out a couple of hundred for
hardware, and you have to live within a prescribed distance from
the phone company office.
</P>
<P>
   If they offer you ISDN _ another form of digital line _ instead,
take a pass. More expensive, more complicated and slower. See about
a cable modem if they have them in your town. Still expensive, but
under the right conditions it can be faster than DSL. They'll
probably give you a break on HBO, too.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Epson ink-jet cartridges cost $25 at Wal-Mart.
Hewlett-Packard sells ink in bottles. Epson cautions against
refilling cartridges. Is there really a reason not to refill?
</P>
<P>
   _Ink-A-Dinka-Doo
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DINKA: Definitely! You'd cut into Epson's profit margin.
Let's face it, though. Most people are just too klutzy to try
refilling. Ink winds up all over your hands and the new upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, if you do things wrong, you could wind up gumming up the
printer beyond all hope the night before you're supposed to have
that quarterly report ready. Are a few extra bucks worth taking
that chance? Buy your cartridges.
</P>

 &HT;    BARAK'S MILITARY STYLE UNDER FIRE IN OFFICE
 &HT;    700&AMP;ADD

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ During his campaign, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak touted his reputation as Israel's ``Number 1 soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some Israelis are chafing at the military outlook of their
new commando-in-chief. To their surprise, Barak has kept the peace
process on hold and sidelined the country's most famous doves.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 57, won in a landslide in the May elections. Israel's
most decorated soldier, he promised to bring unity to the divided
country and to restart the peace process with the Arabs, which
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu left in a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks into the job, his standing with average Israelis is
still intact. But, he has alienated some within his own Labor Party
with the tight lid he keeps on his policies and the clique of
former army colleagues around which he centralizes power.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, he has brought new faces and a new _ possibly
risky _ approach to the six-year-old Oslo peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the picture now is Barak's Labor Party rival Shimon
Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Barak gave him an ill-defined
new ministry post. According to newspaper reports, Peres needs
office space and is ``taciturn'' at meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Peres is an idealistic peacemaker and party politician. He wrote
a book about the ``New Middle East,'' where Arabs and Jews would
learn to trust each other and work together.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is a military man and systems engineer. He talks little
about trust, but rather ``separation.'' He is skeptical of the
Peres approach, spelled out in the 1993 Oslo Accords, of exchanging
concessions with the Arabs in step-by-step confidence building
moves.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of most in the region, Barak did not immediately
resume land transfers to the Palestinians. Instead, he has sought
to restructure the next phase, the Wye River Memorandum that Israel
signed in October.
</P>
<P>
   The goodwill many Palestinians offered Barak upon his taking
office has now deteriorated and small-scale terror attacks are
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Before continuing the land transfers, Barak wants a better
picture of what concessions Israel may have to make later in the
process. That demand shows the difference between the military
approach of Barak and the diplomatic approach of Oslo's creators
like Peres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel put down a down payment without knowing the final
price,'' said political scientist Shmuel(CQ) Sandler, at Tel Aviv's
Bar-Ilan University. ``Military people like to see the real price.
They like substance. Politicians are more liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's harder line on Wye is consistent with the Israeli
apprehension about giving up land. Even some Oslo architects, in
light of difficulties that have occurred in implementing the plan,
have backed Barak's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Those who back the new prime minister say he reflects the
pragmatic approach of his mentor, slain prime minister, and fellow
general, Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Others say he differs from Rabin by defying Israel's old
political order.
</P>
<P>
   The debate crystallized two weeks ago when Barak snubbed a
leader of Israel's old political elite.
</P>
<P>
   He passed over Yael Dayan, an accomplished member of parliament
in Barak's Labor Party and the daughter of legendary general Moshe
Dayan, for one of his last minister posts. He gave the job to
another woman further down on the Labor Party hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Dayan confronted Barak on the floor of the parliament and
accused him of arrogance. Referring to a famous commando raid, in
which Barak was photographed poised on the wing of a hijacked
airliner, she told him he was metaphorically still on that wing,
looking down on his party colleagues.

 &HT;    LABASTIDA: PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANT RESISTS IMAGE AS MEXICO'S
HEIR-APPARENT
 &HT;    1000&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Aug. 14 And Thereafter.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico _ By all counts, Francisco Labastida
should breeze into his party's nomination for Mexico's next
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   He describes exquisitely detailed plans for fighting poverty and
managing the economy. A veteran administrator, he's already thrice
been a cabinet minister and is widely perceived as his party
elite's favorite son. He also counts on loyalists who vow to
deliver thousands of votes.
</P>
<P>
   But what Labastida needs most, perhaps, is someone like James
Carville, the acid-tongued American campaign consultant who put
Bill Clinton in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great reputation and prestige. I wish we could get
him,'' said Labastida, who, despite his powerful connections, has
slipped behind in some polls with less than three months to go
before Mexico's historic Nov. 7 presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   The primary is the first for this country's Revolutionary
Institutional Party, or PRI, the dominant political entity here.
After only two weeks of campaigning, the election is already one of
the most unusual Mexican political events in years. It's considered
a dress rehearsal for an even more competitive presidential
election in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 70 years, Labastida's party _ the PRI _ has
controlled Mexico's presidency. But the party has never held a
primary to democratically elect its nominee. The sitting president
has always hand-picked his successor in a ritual known as the
``dedazo, or ``big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, in response to demands for democracy within the
party, candidates have to win voters by aggressively campaigning on
the road, and in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico keeps no party registration lists, so any citizen with a
voter credential will be allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is assured of triumph,'' said the soft-spoken and
sleekly gray Labastida, interviewed as his campaign bus rolled last
weekend through the humid streets of this city, the capital of
Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the campaign, many Mexicans found
Labastida's claim disingenuous. In a country where rumors of
conspiracy run deep, many felt that Labastida, 56, was the
guaranteed victor because he was a member of President Ernesto
Zedillo's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   In his own mild way, Labastida bristles at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president doesn't have an official candidate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An economics graduate of Mexico's National Autonomous
University, Labastida has worked in government jobs since 1968. He
was secretary of energy and state-run industries before becoming
governor of Sinaloa state from 1987 to 1993. He most recently was
Zedillo's agricultural minister and then interior secretary, a job
that put him in charge of fighting crime and smoothing political
unrest in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned two months ago to pursue the nomination. His
recently named campaign manager is Esteban Moctezuma, also resigned
from Zedillo's cabinet to direct Labastida's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these ties, Labastida has jokingly been called ``son
of the big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he was taken by surprise by the first barrage of
television ads from his chief rival, Roberto Madrazo, that
exploited that perception.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's ads called on Mexicans to end the ``dedazo'' by giving
it a ``madrazo'' _ a ``punch'' in Mexican slang.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, who stepped down as governor of Tabasco state to run
for the nomination, is appealing to ``PRIistas'' who yearn for more
nationalistic, populist policies rather than Zedillo's free-market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The audacious ads stunned Labastida's campaign, which denounced
them as unethical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that the country doesn't want a climate of
violence or attacks,'' Labastida said, remarking on Madrazo's
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But some polls show Madrazo's two-fisted style is yielding
results. In a poll conducted by the Mexico-based Indemerc-Lou
Harris group, PRI sympathizers preferred Madrazo over Labastida by
7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida claims other surveys show he's in first place, but he
admitted he needs to counterattack to fend off Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to confront a reality,'' he told Cox Newspapers.
``People know the face of Labastida as a public functionary and
don't know what he has accomplished during his career. And now I
have to make that happen . . . I think my main defense is to speak
the truth and speak with facts about what we've done and what we
could do to achieve change in our country without tearing it
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   During his tour of Chiapas he tried to strike a balance,
admitting the Mexican government had failed to do enough for one of
the country's poorest and most socially polarized states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chiapas' poverty is a wound that hurts me as a human being,
and challenges me as a presidential aspirant,'' he said. But the
answer, he said, is not ``force,'' a reference to the government's
five-year-old conflict with Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are circulating that Labastida may approach the
politically savvy Carville for advice on sharpening his campaign,
although Labastida's managers say they haven't taken such a step
yet. Carville, who has worked on foreign campaigns before, is known
for his ability to distill candidates into strong messages for the
media.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Labastida's television ads are mostly testimonials from
people in Sinaloa praising his abilities as governor. On the
campaign trail, Labastida prefers to stick to speeches on education
and the economy rather than personally questioning his opponents'
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   And because he was a key member of Zedillo's administration, it
would be awkward for Labastida to tap into anti-free market
sentiment as deeply as Madrazo has dared.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Sergio Aguayo said Labastida is handicapped by
his unwillingness or inability to sell himself, a new concept in
politics here, and by the shock of having to wrestle with his PRI
brethren.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very conventional,'' Aguayo said. ``He doesn't really
convince people. Maybe talking to them in person he can, but not in
groups . . . He is Mexico's Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Chiapas, however, Labastida showed that he attracts his share
of the party faithful, who sent scores of leaders to greet the
candidate from PRI-affiliated organizations, Indian villages and
unions representing workers as diverse as shoeshine boys and
accountants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided to go with Labastida. We have a policy within
our organization that everyone will comply with our decision. It's
all or nothing,'' said Luis Rey Garcia, secretary general of the
PRI-affiliated Revolutionary Federation of Workers of Chiapas,
which boasts more than 10,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   PRI unions and neighborhood groups have for decades provided
solid backing for the party's candidates, dispatching voters in
bloc in exchange for government largess.
</P>
<P>
   The groups' collective strength has waned, but Labastida and his
rivals will still compete for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be like this in every state,'' Labastida
said, almost embarrassed by the reception he received from PRI
groups in Chiapas. ``It's like this here because I began to visit
the state in 1971, making plans for development, supervising
projects for potable water, education and health.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is going through a profound transformation,'' he
added. ``And we will have to compete vote for vote. There are no
certain results.''

 &HT;    PARTIAL ECLIPSE OF DEMOCRACY? RUSSIA'S CAMPAIGN SEASON A BAD
OMEN FOR DOMESTIC REFORMS, U.S. RELATIONS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (k) Commentary categories.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The end of the world is near, warned some superstitious
Russians, who trusting in the country's mystical folklore saw a bad
omen in the final solar eclipse of this millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Russia survived the cosmic phenomenon; it is coping, too, with
last week's(CQ) Kremlin phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, and his inner circle of political
operatives and business tycoons produced yet another shock by
naming ex-spy Vladimir Putin as Russia's fifth prime minister in
the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a former domestic security chief, also was handpicked as
the 68-year-old Yeltsin's successor in next year's presidential
elections, signaling a new phase in Russia's post-Soviet evolution
_ the open fight to succeed its only democratically elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   At work in Russia isn't some strange alignment of the stars, but
gritty, down-to-earth politics that has slowed progress on key
issues with the United States _ namely arms control and reviving
the Russian economy. The campaign season has begun, with national
parliamentary elections scheduled for December and the vote for
president to take place next summer when Yeltsin's term ends.
</P>
<P>
   Political foes called the president nuts for his latest
government overhaul. It was a record, even for Yeltsin. He fired
the previous prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, after less than
three months on the job and replaced him with a virtual unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to remain in the game as Yeltsin enters his last year
as president, the Kremlin settled on Putin, 46, the loyal head of
the country's domestic intelligence agency. For the first time,
Yeltsin expressly designated the man he wants to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt move came a week after Yeltsin rival Yuri Luzhkov,
62, the ambitious Moscow mayor and presidential aspirant, cut a
deal with Russia's regional leaders to create a new and powerful
political coalition.
</P>
<P>
   And just about every political party in Russia is attempting to
convince Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime minister and foreign
minister, to enter the fray on their team as either a parliamentary
or presidential candidate. He rose in public opinion polls last
year after declaring he had absolutely no interest in running the
country, only to be fired by Yeltsin in May.
</P>
<P>
   Never in its history has Russia had a peaceful transition of
power from one democratically elected leader to another. The
elections will be a crucial test of how firmly the country has
embraced democracy since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, the signs are not good.
</P>
<P>
   As in its communist past, Russia's political leadership is being
determined by a power elite and behind closed doors. There is no
history of a party system to groom candidates and promote them
before the public eye. The press is only nominally free, controlled
by big businessmen with their own political alliances and ready to
use their publications and television stations as propaganda tools
_ a factor that helped Yeltsin win re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsing Putin as his heir on national television, Yeltsin
stressed the need for free and fair elections, but made clear his
desire to anoint the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, despite the uproar over yet another prime minister
appointment from Yeltsin, Putin is expected to easily win
confirmation from the opposition-led Duma, the lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has adhered to the guidelines of the constitution in his
unpredictable switch and parliament does not want to go to war over
the Putin nomination with their own elections looming in just four
months.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the position of prime minister has become irrelevant.
``It's simply doesn't matter anymore who is the premier of Russia.
From now on, it is all election politics,'' said Andrei
Piontkovsky, a political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   That fact does not bode well for the recovery of Russia's
economy, in crisis since the ruble crashed a year ago, nor for its
short-term relations with the United States on issues like arms
control.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Russian talks will begin this month on the next steps in
reducing their substantial nuclear arsenals _ being called START
III. But the Duma has yet to ratify the 1993 Start II treaty, and
with domestic politics dominating this fall's agenda, chances of
its passage appear dim.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has staked its Russian relations on Yeltsin,
and stood by him throughout the erratic times. As a result, the
U.S.-Russia agenda has been modest lately, as the Clinton
administration, and the rest of the world, adjusts to the parade of
prime ministers since March 1998: Viktor Chernomyrdin replaced by
Sergei Kiriyenko, replaced by Primakov, replaced by Stepashin and
now by Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin's team is concerned only with self preservation and
self interest,'' said Alan Rousso, director of the Carnegie Moscow
Center, a think tank. ``Unfortunately they don't have a vision for
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But in fairness, it is not clear any of his would-be successors
does, either.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing exists resembling a substantive debate on the issues of
how to fix Russia's deep problems. The pack of potential candidates
is busy scrambling for political alliances and benefactors among
the business-media tycoons. Democracy, communism, socialism hardly
matter much any more to the majority of disaffected Russians,
according to opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is a nation in search of a leader, someone who can bring
stability in a country buffeted by sweeping changes, some for the
better and many of them for the worse. While Russians enjoy their
personal freedoms under the fledgling democracy, most have seen
their standard of living drop in the painful transition to a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The lethargy of the country's political leaders and wild
profiteering by their business allies have created a deep apathy
among Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party remains strong among the old party faithful,
but its leader Gennady Zyuganov, defeated by Yeltsin in 1996, is
not given much a chance to succeed in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Once the crusading reformer, Yeltsin's popularity ratings are in
the single digits. He is seen as a man who for the past two years
has spent more time in hospitals and seclusion than on the job; a
president who rested and allowed his friends and family to get rich
while most of Russia's 146 million people sunk deeper into debt and
economic recession.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe Yeltsin already has done irreparable damage to
Russia's attempts at democracy, and his own place in history _
something that Putin and no one else can redeem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When dinosaurs writhe in their death throes they destroy
everything around them,'' the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said in a
commentary on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Russia's political factions are seeking to fill the void _
to create new political alliances like Luzhkov's, to promote a
blank slate like Putin or to turn to the 70-year-old Primakov, a
career policymaker who really doesn't seem to crave the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other political force, if we think about it,''
said Mintimer Shaimiyev, president of the semi-autonomous Tatarstan
region and leader of the All-Russia party, which merged with
Luzhkov's Fatherland movement. ``Somebody has to assume the
responsibility now.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of Russia isn't near, just the next chapter.

`LOVE' CONQUERS ALL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'
</P>
<P>
   1998, R, Miramax, CC, VHS priced for rental; DVD price for
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, big-spending Miramax bullied Oscar voters into giving this
a best-picture upset (along with six other Oscars). But the film
still deserved it.
</P>
<P>
   Clever, funny and warmly romantic, ``Shakespeare in Love'' makes
credible fiction out of history.
</P>
<P>
   What if William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) had writer's block
and couldn't write ``Romeo and Juliet'' until he was inspired by a
muse, or lady love (Gwyneth Paltrow)?
</P>
<P>
   Their courtship has a special glow, but it's the supporting cast
that steals the show, from Geoffrey Rush as the producer with bad
teeth to Judi Dench as the stern Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the true stars are director John Madden, who conducts
this cast like a maestro, and writers Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard,
who slyly use scholarly details at the service of a rollicking good
yarn. (4 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`CELEBRITY' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1998, R, Miramax, CC, VHS priced for rental; DVD priced for
sales.
</P>
<P>
   This black-and-white comedy from director-writer Woody Allen is
an edgy, funny stab at the caustic costs and seductive rewards of
fame.
</P>
<P>
   As Allen's surrogate, Kenneth Branagh plays an entertainment
journalist who gets too close to his show-biz quarry.
</P>
<P>
   He and Judy Davis as his ex-wife and Winona Ryder as a
struggling actress embody the kind of New York neurotics Allen fans
know and love. Leonardo DiCaprio has a cameo that may be close to
real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity'' is hardly an original film from Allen, but it
snugly fits the mold of ``Stardust Memories'' and other underrated
gems, and it's far more agreeable than the loathsome
``Deconstructing Harry.'' (2 1/2 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`DEEP END OF THE OCEAN' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; 1999, PG-13, Columbia TriStar, CC, VHS priced for rental; DVD
$24.95.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Pfeiffer stars in this sad, sobering saga of a mom who
loses her 3-year-old son in a hotel lobby and rediscovers him
almost a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the meat of the story arises _ following a common
TV-movie formula. As David Letterman puts it, ``I want my kid
back!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep End'' is a bit more complicated than that, although
Pfeiffer and Treat Williams as her husband lack solid arcs to play.
</P>
<P>
   Too many motivations are murky. Characters aren't ambivalent so
much as inarticulate.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer still has a heartbreaking aura. But the best
performance is by young Ryan Merriman as the son she thought she'd
never see again. He's not a child actor, in the common sense of
that term: He's an actor. (2 1/2 stars)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`THE MOD SQUAD' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1999, R, MGM, CC, VHS priced for rental; DVD $24.98.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Avoid. This bleak, boring revival of the 1960s TV show still
plays like a TV series _ and a very bad one.
</P>
<P>
   It's also peppered with today's state-of-the-art trappings in
terms of violence, profanity and sex _ if you want to call it that.
(1 star)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ANIMATED `MADELINE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its debut from Disney is ``Madeline: Lost in Paris,'' a
charming animated musical about the fun-loving French school girl.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-minute film (selling for $22.99) isn't elaborately
animated, but its visuals do evoke the illustrations from the
original Ludwig Bemelman books.
</P>
<P>
   Voice actors include Lauren Bacall, Jason Alexander and
Christopher Plummer, who mix English with basic French words. Check
it out _ c'est bon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Video ratings &LR;  &QL; 
4 stars _ Excellent &QL; 
3 stars _ Good &QL; 
2 stars _ Fair &QL; 
1 star _ Poor

ONLINE MUSIC LEADER MAKES KEY ACQUISITION

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One of the more interesting software players for
music encoded in the MP-3 format was snapped up last week by Lycos,
the search engine-cum-portal that's trying to carve out a space for
itself in the online music business.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos (www.lycos.com) had already created a specialized search
area on its site to look for MP-3s, the compression standard that's
widely used to squeeze music and other audio files into a
relatively svelte size while retaining sound quality near that of a
CD.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' MP-3 service has been unique among the major portals and
quickly made Lycos the biggest place on the Net _ home to 500,000
MP-3 songs and spoken-word files.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lycos has bought Mediascience Inc., the company that makes
the Sonique player (www.sonique.com), creating a package of player,
content and portal that should prove quite attractive to folks
interested in the burgeoning world of digital music.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case people don't want to use Lycos for their music
files, Mediascience plans to keep doing business with companies
such as Scour.Net (www.scour.net), the Los Angeles-based search
site specializing in MP-3s and other digital media, said Al-Raz
Adatia, Mediascience's chief technical officer.
</P>
<P>
   Adatia, understandably a bit excited when I talked with him just
before the Lycos deal was announced, said he believes Lycos will
give his small company much more visibility as it tries to expand
on its current 5 million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, the Sonique player will put Lycos on
millions of computer desktops, even when people are using their
machines for something other than browsing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we have a lot of opportunities to do a lot of
interesting stuff,'' Adatia said. ``What's the value for Lycos?
We're providing them with a desktop presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Lycos successfully wooed them, Mediascience was something
of a digital ``Runaway Bride,'' spurning 10 other buyout offers,
Adatia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them don't quite get it. This is about music,
emotions,'' Adatia said. ``People want their Madonna record,
regardless of the platform. One of the reasons why Lycos is going
to be the ultimate partner to us is they made sense. They came to
us and said `Here are our pieces; here's why you're the value add.'
This deal puts together the pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonique player has several nifty aspects, some of which mean
more to record labels or computer geeks than Joe Sixpack music
fans, such as a modular security architecture that handles not only
their own anti-piracy encryption system but those of other players
as well.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly for fans, however, the player's way of
compressing music into the MP-3 format (called a codec) is
excellent, good enough to catch the ear of the folks who
co-developed the format in the first place, Germany's Fraunhofer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   It plays numerous other audio formats and MP-3 files as well,
and it has a dazzling interface, the look of which can be radically
customized with a sophisticated program that creates unique
``skins.'' It also comes with a 20-band equalizer function and an
excellent playlist editor.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' mascot is a Labrador retriever. In this case, it looks
like the big dog brought back a winner. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; HD-aches: KCET, the Los Angeles public television station, had
big plans to take advantage of the high-definition TV revolution.
The station hosted an early set of seminars on HDTV, raised
millions of dollars to build a new digital production studio and
otherwise girded itself for the high-def age.
</P>
<P>
   But eight months after most Los Angeles commercial stations
kicked on their digital transmitters, KCET is still waiting to do
the same, said spokeswoman Laurel Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a grant that we were supposed to be getting that
hasn't arrived yet,'' said Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   The $861,000 grant for a digital transmitter has been mired in
paperwork at the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration, though Lambert said the station has been assured
the money  &UR; !ital! &LR; will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule, which has repeatedly slipped, now calls for the
station to start transmitting digital programming in March 2000,
almost a year later than early estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Lambert and other station execs are trying to
make lemonade out of some very tart citrus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The digital studio is built,'' Lambert said. ``We have been
building and designing and installing our new educational
technology center. And a lot of the equipment needs a lot of
testing and installing work that will take until the fall. So it's
been all right that the transmitter wasn't ready to go yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jargon of the week: From a conversation at a recent Net business
gathering: She calls her boss, a former movie studio owner now
pondering an Internet move, ``one of the highest net-worth
individuals in the country.'' You and I would just call him rich.
</P>
<P>
   And from the oh-so-cool catalog of a European design firm,
furniture for ``the non-territorial office.'' Files can be locked
up in rolling containers stowed in ``garages'' in some corner of
such office space. When you come to the office, you roll your
container to an unused space and start to work. Hmm, and just where
do the alpha males get to mark their space? We'll ask Jay Chiat.
</P>
<P>
   Periodic brilliance: Here's a nifty idea for creating memorable
but not easily crackable passwords, snagged from the magazine
Internet World: Use the notations for chemical compounds.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know, high school chemistry made your head hurt. But
even something like NaClH2O (which roughly translates to salt
water) can upload those headaches to the hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon everywhere: The many fans of Pokemon, particularly the
animated TV show, should check out a recently released album _
``2.B.A. Master'' _ of music from the animated TV series.
</P>
<P>
   It includes the show's theme song, another ditty that names all
150 pocket monsters called ``PokeRAP'' and 10 other songs. And
``PokeRAP'' also can be seen in a video on the disc that will play
in your computer.
</P>
<P>
   The album's label, Rave Music, has shipped a reported 250,000
copies to stores, anticipating some serious interest among fans.

WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A BARENAKED LADY? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ You'd think if a Barenaked Lady walked into the room,
most people would at least look up. But Steven Page, lead singer
with the Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies, remains pretty much
invisible wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a day off in Boston, which is kind of the Barenaked
mecca,'' Page said. ``I walked around with my family. We went to
the museum and the aquarium. I didn't get recognized once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in D.C., we're playing to 15,000 people. Yesterday, I
walked around, and I think maybe one person recognized me, but they
didn't say anything. That's pretty cool _ except for on the days
when I have no self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if he wore leopard-skin pants and torn T-shirts like Keith
Richards, more people might realize that they are in the presence
of a bona fide rock star. But Page doesn't think he could pull it
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to lose about 50 pounds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With U.S. sales of the band's latest album, ``Stunt,'' at more
than 3 million, Page and fellow Barenaked Ladies Ed Robertson, Jim
Creeggan, Tyler Stewart and Kevin Hearn have emerged as the kings
of nerd-rock.
</P>
<P>
   Their hook-happy song-craft and fun-loving stage presence appeal
to a broad modern rock audience seeking an alternative both to
bubble-gummy pop and edgier rap/metal hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Days when Page lacks self-confidence are becoming few and far
between.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back on how I felt when I was 15 or 16,'' he said. ``I
think if I could have seen myself now, I'd have felt a whole lot
better then. Now I'm in a really popular rock band, and I'm pretty
confident about the quality of what I write and what I do onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel as much like a nerd as I probably look.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans may not realize that BNL has a Texas connection.
``Stunt'' was recorded early last year at Austin's Arlyn Studios.
Page said the band was looking for a place away from home to
concentrate on the album, and settled on Austin in part because of
its reputation as a cool music town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we'd be done at midnight, and we'd go out and see
some bands for a couple hours every night,'' Page said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'd be so tired after working 14-16 hours straight, we'd
be like, `OK, I'm going to bed. Everybody else going to bed?' We
did go out one night and get our minds blown by Junior Brown, but
that was about it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Austin sessions, keyboardist Kevin Hearn fell ill.
When he returned home to Toronto, he underwent a series of tests
and learned he had leukemia. After an intense round of chemotherapy
and a blood-cell transplant, he has rejoined BNL on the current
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 100 percent cancer-free. He just had his one-year
all-clear,'' Page said. ``That's not to say he's in perfect health.
He's certainly not the same guy he was before he was sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's got a lot of energy for a guy who was that sick. I
saw him at death's door a year ago, and to have him onstage playing
with us and playing as well as he is playing, is a pretty amazing
gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Page, 29, grew up in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough. His
father was a high school guidance counselor and a '60s folk-music
fan who raised his son on a steady diet of the Beatles and Simon
and Garfunkel.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look back, those are definitely my biggest benchmarks,''
Page said. ``But then, getting older, I discovered people like
Elvis Costello. Later still, Randy Newman and Harry Nilsson were
huge influences on my writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there's stuff that was on the radio as I was growing
up _ Duran Duran, Culture Club, whatever else _ just because it was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Barenaked Ladies was born in 1988 when Page and Robertson became
friends at a summer music camp. (At the same camp, Page met his
future wife, music teacher Carolyn Ricketts, with whom he has two
young children.)
</P>
<P>
   Page and Robertson were a classic case of polar opposites
attracting. While the former has a tendency to become intense and
nervous, the latter is typically cool, calm and collected. That's
Robertson doing the fly white-guy rap on ``One Week,'' BNL's huge
modern rock hit of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was going to make one decision about anything in life, I
would probably make the opposite decision,'' Page said, ``except
when we're onstage. When we're onstage, we complete each other's
sentences. We know exactly where the other guy is going. There is
this kind of telepathy when it comes to writing songs or performing
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Barenaked Ladies' 1992 debut album, ``Gordon,'' sold 900,000
copies in Canada, which is roughly the equivalent of selling 9
million in the much-larger U.S. market. The album won BNL
group-of-the-year honors at the Juno Awards, Canada's equivalent to
the Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   But the group's massive popularity produced a backlash in Canada
that only recently has begun to ebb.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read a lot of stuff in the (Canadian) papers that'll say,
`Well, they're back, and they're big, and we're still not sure that
we like them. ...' Or people think that we've `dumbed down' for
American success, which is hogwash.''
</P>
<P>
   Page says he's given up trying to convince longtime BNL fans
that success hasn't changed the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really hit home for me was, in 1992, when Nirvana hit the
top of the charts. And in Ontario, the province in Canada where we
live, we elected a Social Democratic government, and in the United
States, you elected Clinton as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``And everybody who had worked so hard to make these things
happen immediately started second-guessing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Nirvana, it was like, `Well, they're a sellout.
It's not our music anymore.' But they weren't moving over to the
mainstream; they were bringing the mainstream over to them, which I
think is the most amazing thing you can do. I just wanted to stand
on a mountain and shout, `You won! For crying out loud, you won!'''
</P>
<P>
   Page says he doesn't worry about those critics who've accused
BNL of being a little too clever for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our immediate response would be, who cares? I think that's
from the point of view of people who analyze it too much, and I
just can't bring myself to pander to that. Our fans don't sit there
and say, `If they had just put a little less humor in it, I think
I'd like it better.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Joking around is how we communicate with each other, and I
think if we were to not do that, it'd be less than honest.''
</P>
<P>
   One more question: About that name ... ?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was naming the band now, I wouldn't name it Barenaked
Ladies,'' Page said. ``But we named it when we were 18 and never
even had any sense that we'd be playing gigs. Once we did, it was
always too late to change it. The five people who saw us and liked
us, how are they going to find us again if we change the name?
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking at the time when we named it, this'll keep
us alternative. This'll keep us cool, like the Violent Femmes or
the Jazz Butcher or something like that. You know, we've sold a lot
of records for a band with the stupidest name in rock.''

SOLID PERFORMANCES SAVE A GLOOMY FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Released on Aug. 14, 1998, ``Return to Paradise'' was a dour
film about a young American lad held on drug charges in a scummy
Malaysian jail. It featured an awkward script and first-rate acting
by a small cast, most notably Joaquin Phoenix as the suffering
inmate. And it was very, very serious.
</P>
<P>
   A year later comes ``Brokedown Palace,'' a dour film about young
American lasses held on drug charges in a scummy Thai jail. It
features an awkward script and first-rate acting by a small cast,
most notably Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes as the suffering
inmates. And it is very, very serious.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for an alignment of the planets? (On Aug. 12, 2000,
we'll see the release of ``Return to Brokedown Palace Paradise,''
set, for a change of pace, on Nantucket.)
</P>
<P>
   Not to read too much into this, but perhaps Hollywood is trying
to tell us something _ perhaps we're the inmates, imprisoned in a
hoosegow of our own imagining. When a film features an outraged
attorney yelling ``We had a deal! We had a deal!'' at venal foreign
officials, there is indeed cause to feel trapped.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, ``Brokedown Palace'' has many earnest things on its
mind, some of which it addresses with competency and occasional
art. Having Claire Danes around automatically gives a movie both
accessibility and edge, thanks to her natural smarts and her
equally natural well of compassion. Beckinsale (``The Last Days of
Disco'') also labors admirably, although her role _ as the more
innocent of two squeaky innocents _ is a fuzzy blur by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Neither actress is helped by David Arata's uneven screenplay or
Jonathan Kaplan's direction, which has neither the blunt pessimism
of ``The Accused'' nor the flared-nostril theatrics of ``Unlawful
Entry,'' two earlier Kaplan pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Danes and Beckinsale play Alice and Darlene, lifelong pals just
graduated from high school. On a whim they decide to celebrate
(sans parental knowledge) in Thailand, where they do a touristy
swirl through the sights and wind up, prostrate and giggling,
before proud rows of Buddhas. In this same chipper mood they barge
into a chi-chi Thai hotel, where they sneak drinks on someone
else's tab (``Oh, come on, they don't care!,'' says Alice, all
casual condescension) and promptly get caught.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian bloke (Daniel Lapaine) comes to the rescue, wines
them, dines them, beds one of them and then dupes the two into
trying to cart a few kilos of heroin into Hong Kong. Caught again,
they get arrested and shipped off to prison, a pest-infested
hellhole where Alice reveals her naivete by asking for a lawyer
(``Ah, yes, and one telephone call, too,'' smirks her
interrogator).
</P>
<P>
   Later, transferred to a slightly less-repulsive women's prison,
Alice and Dar don earth-tone muumuus and have their hair bobbed _
ragged and greasy, but tres chic; the waif look does Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even scared at first,'' says Alice in a
tad-too-flippant narration. ``I mean, I'd had worse haircuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with these scenes, aside from the fact that everyone
looks like a model for British Vogue, is their insufficient horror.
We're told repeatedly that being held in a Thai prison is a dread
fate, but we don't see the proof of it; aside from one incident of
physical abuse, two cockroach gross-outs and one short punishment
in a corrugated iron box, there isn't much that compares
unfavorably to the American prison system.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates are free to wander outside in the twinkling Asian
sunshine. They smoke hash whenever they like. They eat tropical
fruit. Their guards are easily bribed, their fellow prisoners are
more irritating than dangerous, and one of them, a hip Caribbean
woman with perfect dreadlocks, owns a Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   The entire film grooves to a slinky dance beat, its soundtrack
filled with cuts from Delirium and the Solar Twins _ the latter
offering an electronica cover of that 1980s club anthem ``Rock the
Casbah.'' (Incidentally, ``Brokedown Palace'' comes from a Grateful
Dead song.)
</P>
<P>
   As expected, much of the film consists of Alice and Dar trying
to get out _ they've been sentenced to 33 years _ and much of this
requires the aid of ``Yankee'' Hank Green (Bill Pullman,
bemused-gruff redux), an American lawyer living in Thailand.
Pullman doesn't have much to do here beyond the usual
shark-or-saint routine, although he does have one bizarro scene in
which he browbeats a local official by threatening to put him on
``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lou Diamond Phillips appears as a hale-fellow-well-met in
the U.S. Embassy, which (as students of plot devices already know)
proves useless in the girls' quest.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Brokedown Palace'' succeeds _ and it does, here and
there _ is in its most human moments, small studies of friendship
and tattered dignity that appear throughout. Danes has two of them:
the first a poignant shouting match with Darlene's father, the
second an extraordinary plea for mercy at the movie's climax.
</P>
<P>
   Danes' transformation from giddy child to flinty woman is a plum
of a performance, almost reason enough to sweat through a gloomy
film.
</P>

MUSICAL STAR ON THE RISE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds. : Accent mark needed over first e in Miserables) 
 
By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' has scored a coup in
acquiring its new leading lady, Carolee Carmello, one of musical
theater's brightest young stars.
</P>
<P>
   Carmello comes to the musical adventure after scoring a personal
triumph in last season's ``Parade.'' Her portrayal of Lucille
Frank, valiantly striving to save husband Leo Frank when he is
wrongly accused of murder, brought her a sheaf of rave reviews, the
Drama Desk Award as best actress and a Tony nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Prizes and critical praise are nothing new to Carmello, whose
string of notable credits on and off-Broadway include Cordelia in
``Falsettos'' and her Obie-winning turn as the character known as
the Young Wife in ``Hello Again.``
</P>
<P>
   Houston audiences get to see Carmello in ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel's'' Houston run at the Wortham Center, which runs through
Aug. 22. The Houston engagement is part of a three-city summer
tour, a transitional phase in the show's move from the Minskoff
Theater on Broadway (where it played for two seasons) to its new
Broadway home, the Neil Simon Theater, where it will re-open in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Carmello plays Marguerite, the actress heroine torn between her
English nobleman husband Percy (aka the Scarlet Pimpernel) and her
former lover, Chauvelin, the Pimpernel's nemesis. Ron Bohmer plays
Percy, and Marc Kudisch is Chauvelin.
</P>
<P>
   Set during the French Revolution, ``Pimpernel'' is based on the
swashbuckling adventure novels of Baroness Orczy. Percy leads a
secret life as a heroic adventurer, rescuing souls doomed to the
guillotine during Paris' ``Reign of Terror.'' He's known only as
the Scarlet Pimpernel; the flower is the hero's insignia.
</P>
<P>
   After the tragic eloquence of ``Parade,'' Carmello finds
``Pimpernel's'' romp fun in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a romance novel,'' she said. ``I get to play a
glamorous role, the pretty girl in beautiful gowns. It's fun to be
fought over by two gorgeous men. Both Ron and Marc are wonderful,
great foils for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The music is from Frank Wildhorn, and book and lyrics are by
Broadway newcomer Nan Knighton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank is adept at writing melodies that stay in your mind and
are fun to sing,'' Carmello said, ``so I have some beautiful songs
_ including a new ballad, ''I'll Forget You.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Carmello is joining ``Pimpernel'' well into its
Broadway life (and after last fall's major revamping improved it
considerably), she is not new to the show _ having played
Marguerite in the musical's early readings and developmental
workshops. But in fall 1997, as ``Pimpernel'' went into production
for Broadway, Carmello opted to go to Toronto for ``Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so connected, so passionate about that show, that I
felt it was where I needed to be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parade'' proved a bittersweet ``succes d'estime.'' The only
serious new musical last season, it was acclaimed by most critics
as an artistic milestone, nominated for more Tonys than any other
show, and won Tonys for best book and score. But it ran only three
months _ hurt by a few critical dissenters and even more by the
financial difficulties of Livent, the Canadian-based company that
co-produced it with the nonprofit Lincoln Center Theater.
</P>
<P>
   (Livent's bankruptcy also was the reason the earlier, mammoth
``Ragtime'' tour was pulled from the road and replaced with the
scaled-down _ and, thankfully, still effective _ edition now at
Jones Hall, produced by PACE Theatrical Group.)
</P>
<P>
   Hearing Carmello talk about ``Parade,'' it is clear the show is
still close to her heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few things I have felt as passionately about.
Lucille was a great role, and they don't come along very often. I
looked forward to doing it every single night. Jason Robert Brown's
score was so beautiful, and Alfred Uhry's book was brilliant. I'm
sure that, in hindsight, the show will be better-appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfortunate that Livent went bankrupt just as we were
about to open _ the worst possible timing. Lincoln Center Theater
very bravely shouldered the financial burden, but they are a
nonprofit theater and didn't have the deep pockets for the kind of
marketing that's needed to sell a Broadway show these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmello enjoyed a reunion with ``Parade'' co-star Brent Carver
when they performed an excerpt from the show at this year's Tony
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Between ``Parade'' and ``Pimpernel,'' Carmello starred as Ella
Peterson in ``Bells Are Ringing'' for Los Angeles' Reprise!
concert-musical series. Playing the role originated by the great
Judy Holliday in the Betty Comden/Adolph Green/Jule Styne romp, she
got to sing such hilarious material as ``Is It a Crime?'' and ``I'm
Goin' Back,'' and such classic ballads as ``The Party's Over,''
``Long Before I Knew You'' and ``Just in Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great because that was a role I had wanted to do for
years and years,'' Carmello said.
</P>
<P>
   Another of her favorite roles was Audrey in ``Little Shop of
Horrors,'' which she did for a yearlong run at Boston's Charles
Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Of two favorites she longed to play as a girl, Carmello already
played Maria in ``The Sound of Music'' early in her career, but she
has not gotten around to Eliza Doolittle in ``My Fair Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may already be too late for that one!'' she joked. (Julie
Andrews was 21 when she performed the role).
</P>
<P>
   These days, Carmello is chiefly drawn to new works by young
composers like Michael John La Chiusa (``Hello Again'') and Jason
Robert Brown (``Parade'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to mix it up a bit _ make a living but keep myself
involved in the newer stuff. If I only did the money-making jobs
and revivals, it would be less satisfying. A lot of what happens
now is that new shows are cast by the time they get to Broadway
production. If you're not involved early in the development, you
may lose that chance. So I try to get involved in projects that
look interesting in their early stages.''
</P>
<P>
   As Carmello heads back to Broadway in ``Pimpernel'' this fall,
her husband _ three-time Tony nominee Gregg Edelman (``City of
Angels,'' ``Cabaret'') _ will be joining the cast of the
long-running ``Les Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmello plans to be with ``Pimpernel'' on Broadway for some
time, noting that the producers are talking about sending out a
different cast to tour the show next winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I hope `Parade' will come back,'' she said. ``I got a note
from (director) Hal Prince saying he hopes I'll be a free for a
tour next spring. Of course, it depends on what else is going on at
that time. I have a 3-year-old, so touring now is not the easiest
thing. But it's a show I would jump at the chance to do again.''

SAN FRANCISCO POLICE FORCE MARKS 150 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In 1849, San Francisco was a Gold Rush boomtown
grown out of control. The little city by the Bay was flooded with
fortune seekers, sailors, adventurers, crooks and scalawags. The
newspapers at the time described a daily litany of robberies,
stabbings and drunken brawls.
</P>
<P>
   Where were the police? There weren't any. That was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are without a single policeman or watchman and have not
the means for confining a prisoner for an hour,'' Mayor John Geary
said in his inaugural address.
</P>
<P>
   Geary made good on his campaign promise to get tough on crime.
On Aug. 13, 1849, he hired a police chief and 33 officers _ they
were paid $6 per day _ to bring order to the streets of San
Francisco, which then had about 12,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1849, good help was hard to find. It was the year of the Gold
Rush and, like everyone else working in San Francisco, the police
often quit on a whim to seek their fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a professional department at all back then,'' said
Sgt. Bob Fitzer, the present-day department's unofficial historian.
``They basically hired guys who could break up fights.''
</P>
<P>
   The police still have to break up drunken fights in this town.
But today the department employs about 2,000 officers to patrol a
city that has grown to 750,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The department began celebrating its 150th birthday on Friday.
The celebration will continue this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the department is marked by numerous stories of
courage, from tales of officers who risked _ or gave _ their lives,
to accounts of savvy investigative work.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, no one is sure of the name of the first San Francisco
police officer to die in the line of duty, Fitzer said. While there
are voluminous records of the chiefs during the department's first
five decades, there are scant records of the officers who walked
the beats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys on the street are really the unsung heroes,'' Fitzer
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some stories, like that of Sgt. Joe Brady, who was
shot down without warning on Oct. 1, 1924, when he walked up to a
car parked outside the Fairmont Hotel, or Officer Timothy Ryan, who
was killed by a drunken ex-husband in a domestic dispute in 1943.
There was Officer Antone Schoembs, who in 1919 was shot dead with
his own gun by a car thief.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some unflattering episodes to be told, especially
from those early days.
</P>
<P>
   Officers weren't required to wear uniforms until the late 1850s.
The Alta California newspaper ran several articles complaining
about officers who hid their badges and ducked away to avoid taking
on tough guys. During the anti-Chinese riots in the 1870s and
1880s, there were reports of police officers who looked the other
way or even joined in and beat up migrant laborers.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1906 earthquake, police officers broke into a saloon
across from the Hall of Justice and took its beer to douse a fire
that threatened to destroy the city's court records and police
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Press accounts at the time reported that the officers afterward
used large quantities of the confiscated beer to fuel their own
party.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the problem of overcrowded jails.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1849, as Geary pointed out in his inaugural speech, San
Francisco did not have a jail. To solve the problem, the Town
Council bought the wooden brigantine Euphemia and turned it into a
prison barge. The ``brig'' was soon overcrowded, mostly with rowdy
former sailors who had jumped ship into San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the jail didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco newspaper readers were treated to an almost
daily diet of jail escapes, rearrests and further escapes,'' wrote
retired deputy police chief Kevin Mullen in his book ``Let Justice
Be Done: Crime and Politics in Early San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some things have changed since the early days. At
least four of the escapees were hanged without benefit of a formal
trial. ``They hanged malefactors or banished them from the state on
the pain of death should they return,'' Mullen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Fred Lau said that the 150th anniversary was not
just an opportunity to embrace history but a chance to celebrate
the department's future. Lau, 50, is quick to point out that in his
lifetime the department has changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest change that I've noticed has been diversity:
people of color, women, lesbians, gays,'' Lau said. ``It looks a
whole lot different than it did when I started 28 years ago. The
Police Department looks more like the community it serves than ever
before.''

SALAD DAYS: THE FORMER SIDE DISH IS NOW THE HOT NEW ENTREE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: benjy is cq; accent mark needed over first e in Frisee) 
 
By DAI HUYNH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Caesar still reigns. But as the heat index climbs,
threats to the crown are lurking in the shadows of restaurants
across Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The salad entree trend is hot, and chefs are tossing up a storm
to create a culinary oasis _ signature crispy, green treats to cool
off their sweat-beaded customers on these roasting days.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when salads were just accompaniments to steaks,
the backup chorus, the opening act. No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our salads continue to replace a lot of our traditional
entrees in terms of sales,'' says Aldo Catania, co-owner of La
Strada Restaurant near downtown. His two Houston restaurants
currently feature six salad entrees, including the Angus Steak
Salad and Pepper-Crusted Yellowfin Tuna Salad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, we offered only one. Now they've become a menu
staple,'' Catania says.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 hot salad trends:
</P>
<P>
   (1) Caesar salads with all their variations and toppings.
</P>
<P>
   (2) Hot-and-cold salads (greens topped with hot grilled items
such as chicken, eggplant or shrimp).
</P>
<P>
   (3) Grain and pasta salads.
</P>
<P>
   (4) Seafood salads.
</P>
<P>
   (5) Goat cheese salads _ i.e., Daily Review Cafe's Baked Goat
Cheese Salad.
</P>
<P>
   (6) Trendy dressings, such as garlic parsley ranch and chipotle
vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   (7) Roasted- and grilled-vegetable salads.
</P>
<P>
   (8) Fruits and nuts in salads.
</P>
<P>
   (9) Spinach salad.
</P>
<P>
   (10) Southern-style fried-chicken salad.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest survey by the National Restaurant
Association, 82 percent of restaurant menus across the country
offer main-dish salad selections _ up 5 percent from 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge because I haven't done salads that much,''
says James Nakayama, executive chef of benjy's in Rice Village.
</P>
<P>
   It makes it more satisfying, though, when something works well.
So far, Nakayama has discovered that customers like his
pecan-crusted salmon salad, crab cake over grilled vegetables, and
maple-smoked chicken with walnuts, apples, pickled onions and
honey-thyme dressing.
</P>
<P>
   For many Houston restaurants, the bulk of the salad business
occurs at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 40 to 50 percent of my business is &UR;  &LR; salad-based during
lunch time,'' says chef Tom Williams of the Fox Diner. ``People
want to eat lighter during the day because they have to go back to
work, and it's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   But gone are the days when a tossed salad or simple chef salad
would do. Diners today are demanding more choices, more flavors.
Instead of a Cobb salad, think more along the lines of Scott Chen's
Crispy Shrimp With Honey-Coated Walnuts Over Baby Frisee, Vallone's
Marinated Grilled Portobello Salad With Beef Carpaccio, Houston's
Seared Tuna Salad, the Texas Field Greens Salad With Fried Crawfish
at Ciro's Cibi Italiani, Cafe Noir's Ginger Shrimp With Endive,
Miyako's Salmon Skin Salad, or Dalat Vietnamese Bistro's Green
Papaya With Beef Jerky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare nowadays for diners to order the Caesar salad,''
says Zumm Escudier, executive chef of Renata's Restaurant and Piano
Bar. ``They're become educated about food, and they want to
discover and try different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris-trained Escudier changes her salad entrees with the
seasons. Right now, Renata's offers grilled chicken over a bed of
snow-pea leaves, banana blossoms topped with grilled chicken, and
green, red and yellow tomatoes with grilled sea bass or blackened
tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Carl Walker of Brennan's follows the seasons as well,
currently offering lump crab meat on a bed of tomatoes, asparagus
and corn relish. Meanwhile, Prego is dishing out the Crabmeat Tower
Salad, and the Blue Agave is serving Crab Claw With Avocado Salad.
</P>
<P>
   For those hankering for soft-shell crabs, they can find theirs
nestled among mixed greens at Vallone's or sauteed spinach at La
Strada.
</P>
<P>
   Steak is also a popular salad topper, and so is grilled, fried
or boiled shrimp. But chicken is still the main topping at many
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Some chefs, however, are adding a sweet/savory dimension to the
meat by smoking instead of grilling, such as the tea-smoked chicken
salad with kaffir-lime vinaigrette at benjy's and the smoked
chicken spinach salad at Solero.
</P>
<P>
   Dressing and salad are like bread and butter _ they just go
together. But instead of classics such as ranch or blue-cheese
dressings, restaurants are taking a more creative approach by
blending their own. Witness Scott Chen's caviar cream sauce,
Backstreet Cafe's pumpkin seed vinaigrette, Sambuca's pepper and
corn vinaigrette and Carmelo's mango vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, we were anchored to the classics. You just didn't
deviate from them,'' Carmelo's owner Carmelo Mauro says. ``Now
there's much more creativity. We're not scared to mix and match
ingredients anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, more women than men order salad
entrees, restaurateurs say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men tend to stick to the wraps or sandwiches,'' says
Martin Berson, manager of benjy's. ``It's a macho thing.''

   AMERICAN-VACATION (Undated) _ Once upon a time the rich played

   DIGITAL-DISPUTE (Unated) _ If the sum total of human knowledge
becomes instantly and universally accessible on the Web, will every
fact become private property, to be leased or sold? Or will
information become so cheap as to lose any value, eliminating
incentives for using it or adding to it? Doomsday scenarios, to be
sure. But with the Web growing at a rate that defies human and
institutional experience, it is not surprising that such fears have
spread, and that both consumers and purveyors of facts _ which
includes most everyone, really _ have squared off over how and how
much to regulate the proliferation of raw and packaged knowledge.

IMPALA IS A SMALLER, RE-ENGINEERED TAKE ON AN OLD FAVORITE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Impala is back.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet has reintroduced the Impala nameplate for model year
2000 in a modified and larger version of the midsize Lumina sedan
that is roomy enough to be classified as a full-size car by EPA
standards.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Impala isn't anything like its predecessors. It's
not a huge boat, and it doesn't have rear-wheel drive, V-8 engines
or a four-on-the-floor manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   What it offers is a favorite nameplate from the childhoods of
aging baby-boomers, but in a modern, front-wheel-drive package that
incorporates engineering features of the best-selling Japanese
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   That's just about the only formula that makes sense for today's
automotive marketplace, in which Toyota and Honda sedans rule.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy tried selling big cars well into the '90s with the
Caprice. Although it was a fine automobile, it was snubbed by
boomers. The big Caprices ended up primarily in police and taxi
fleets. The few sold to consumers mostly went to golden-agers who
refused to cram themselves into today's smaller, sleeker cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Impala was introduced in 1958 as an uplevel coupe and
convertible variant of the Bel Air and then in 1959 as a sedan and
wagon. The Impala name was last used on a souped-up SS version of
the Caprice that ran for three model years _ 1994-19996 _ and was
produced in Arlington, Texas. Production was limited, so those
Impalas have become something of a collector's item.
</P>
<P>
   Impala purists _ especially those who liked the Super Sport
models of the '60s _ won't be excited by the new model. But the
2000 Impala gives Chevrolet a family sedan that can compete well
against the popular Ford Taurus and perhaps the Toyota Camry and
Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 122 cubic feet of interior space, the Impala is
roomier than any midsize competitor. Along with that space, it
brings a combination of styling, performance and value that today's
new-car buyers crave.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not exactly an exciting car _ the kind that inspires
Beach Boys songs like ``409,'' which glamorized the 409-cubic-inch
engine in the first Impala Super Sport. But it can carry as many
people and nearly as much stuff as a midsize sport-utility, yet
maintain good handling, sporty looks and much better fuel economy
than an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Overall length is 200 inches _ almost an inch shorter than the
Lumina. But the wheelbase is three inches longer, and very
efficient use of space has created a roomier interior than that of
the Lumina.
</P>
<P>
   With a bench seat up front, the new Impala seats six adults
comfortably, but its turning radius is the same as that of the
smaller Taurus. The trunk is huge _ 17.6 cubic feet (vs. 15.5 cubic
feet for the Lumina and 15.8 for the Taurus). The interior is as
roomy as that of the larger Buick Park Avenue, but the Park Avenue
has slightly more rear-seat leg room.
</P>
<P>
   Exterior styling is more reminiscent of the Chevy Malibu of the
early '70s than the early Impalas. Still, some design cues are
taken from the Impalas of the past, including the round taillights,
the muscular exterior lines, and the chrome center bar and Chevy
bow-tie emblem in the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet touts value in all its literature about the new
Impala. This is a full-size car that carries a price tag under
$20,000 _ fairly well-equipped. For a list price of $19,265
(including transportation), the base Impala comes with a 3.4-liter,
180- horsepower V-6 engine (the same one used in the Venture
minivan), four-speed automatic transmission, power windows and door
locks, six-passenger seating, air- conditioning, power steering,
cruise control, four-wheel power disc brakes and an AM/FM radio.
</P>
<P>
   For $22,925, the uplevel LS model comes with a bigger engine _
the 3.8-liter, 200- horsepower V-6 also used in the Park Avenue _
as well as traction control, antilock brakes, dual-zone temperature
controls, a side air bag for the driver, bucket seats up front
(with power adjustments for the driver's side), and a firmer
``touring'' suspension that helps the vehicle hold the road better
during cornering.
</P>
<P>
   The interior isn't as luxurious as those of some competitors,
and the instrument-panel materials are rather plain. But Chevy had
to cut corners somewhere to keep the price down, and this was the
most likely place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cabin is quiet at highway speeds, the seats are as
comfortable as any in this class, if not more so, and the ride in
our LS model test car was cushy, but not overly so.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't tested the base model, but the 180-horsepower engine
should provide plenty of power for most people's needs. The bigger
engine in our LS is a capable performer, adding some excitement to
the driving experience. The transmission shifts smoothly and almost
seamlessly, and with the touring suspension, the Impala LS corners
much better than most of its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is impressive, and will be one of the top selling
points. The base engine is EPA rated at 20 miles per gallon in the
city and 32 on the highway, for a combined city/highway 27.4 mpg
average. The bigger engine is rated at 20 mpg city/29 highway, for
an average of 26.5 mpg. The average sport-utility vehicle has fuel
economy ranging from about 14 to 18 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment on our LS model included the Passlock
theft-deterrent system, daytime running lights, 16-inch aluminum
wheels, power trunk opener, variable intermittent wipers, fog
lamps, rear spoiler, body side moldings, tilt steering wheel,
remote keyless entry, dual heated electrically remote-controlled
outside mirrors, rear-window defogger, and split-folding rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   LS models come with cloth-trimmed front bucket seats, but ours
had the optional leather-trimmed seats ($625), which adds leather
to the front seating surfaces only. An AM/FM/cassette six-speaker
stereo is standard, but ours came with the optional audio system
with cassette and compact-disc players and eight speakers ($223).
</P>
<P>
   Other options on our test car included an electric sun roof
($700); a ``comfort seating package'' ($425), including heated
front seats and a six-way power front passenger seat; and the LS
preferred-equipment group ($517), which added an electronic
driver-information system that monitors 17 items, including tire
pressures; an alarm system, an automatic-dimming rearview mirror,
and steering-wheel radio controls.
</P>
<P>
   Total price for our fully-equipped LS test car was $25,415,
including $560 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The new Impala is built at Oshawa, Ontario.

IMPALA IS A SMALLER, RE-ENGINEERED TAKE ON AN OLD FAVORITE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Impala is back.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet has reintroduced the Impala nameplate for model year
2000 in a modified and larger version of the midsize Lumina sedan
that is roomy enough to be classified as a full-size car by EPA
standards.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Impala isn't anything like its predecessors. It's
not a huge boat, and it doesn't have rear-wheel drive, V-8 engines
or a four-on-the-floor manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   What it offers is a favorite nameplate from the childhoods of
aging baby-boomers, but in a modern, front-wheel-drive package that
incorporates engineering features of the best-selling Japanese
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   That's just about the only formula that makes sense for today's
automotive marketplace, in which Toyota and Honda sedans rule.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy tried selling big cars well into the '90s with the
Caprice. Although it was a fine automobile, it was snubbed by
boomers. The big Caprices ended up primarily in police and taxi
fleets. The few sold to consumers mostly went to golden-agers who
refused to cram themselves into today's smaller, sleeker cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Impala was introduced in 1958 as an uplevel coupe and
convertible variant of the Bel Air and then in 1959 as a sedan and
wagon. The Impala name was last used on a souped-up SS version of
the Caprice that ran for three model years _ 1994-19996 _ and was
produced in Arlington, Texas. Production was limited, so those
Impalas have become something of a collector's item.
</P>
<P>
   Impala purists _ especially those who liked the Super Sport
models of the '60s _ won't be excited by the new model. But the
2000 Impala gives Chevrolet a family sedan that can compete well
against the popular Ford Taurus and perhaps the Toyota Camry and
Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 122 cubic feet of interior space, the Impala is
roomier than any midsize competitor. Along with that space, it
brings a combination of styling, performance and value that today's
new-car buyers crave.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not exactly an exciting car _ the kind that inspires
Beach Boys songs like ``409,'' which glamorized the 409-cubic-inch
engine in the first Impala Super Sport. But it can carry as many
people and nearly as much stuff as a midsize sport-utility, yet
maintain good handling, sporty looks and much better fuel economy
than an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Overall length is 200 inches _ almost an inch shorter than the
Lumina. But the wheelbase is three inches longer, and very
efficient use of space has created a roomier interior than that of
the Lumina.
</P>
<P>
   With a bench seat up front, the new Impala seats six adults
comfortably, but its turning radius is the same as that of the
smaller Taurus. The trunk is huge _ 17.6 cubic feet (vs. 15.5 cubic
feet for the Lumina and 15.8 for the Taurus). The interior is as
roomy as that of the larger Buick Park Avenue, but the Park Avenue
has slightly more rear-seat leg room.
</P>
<P>
   Exterior styling is more reminiscent of the Chevy Malibu of the
early '70s than the early Impalas. Still, some design cues are
taken from the Impalas of the past, including the round taillights,
the muscular exterior lines, and the chrome center bar and Chevy
bow-tie emblem in the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet touts value in all its literature about the new
Impala. This is a full-size car that carries a price tag under
$20,000 _ fairly well-equipped. For a list price of $19,265
(including transportation), the base Impala comes with a 3.4-liter,
180- horsepower V-6 engine (the same one used in the Venture
minivan), four-speed automatic transmission, power windows and door
locks, six-passenger seating, air- conditioning, power steering,
cruise control, four-wheel power disc brakes and an AM/FM radio.
</P>
<P>
   For $22,925, the uplevel LS model comes with a bigger engine _
the 3.8-liter, 200- horsepower V-6 also used in the Park Avenue _
as well as traction control, antilock brakes, dual-zone temperature
controls, a side air bag for the driver, bucket seats up front
(with power adjustments for the driver's side), and a firmer
``touring'' suspension that helps the vehicle hold the road better
during cornering.
</P>
<P>
   The interior isn't as luxurious as those of some competitors,
and the instrument-panel materials are rather plain. But Chevy had
to cut corners somewhere to keep the price down, and this was the
most likely place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cabin is quiet at highway speeds, the seats are as
comfortable as any in this class, if not more so, and the ride in

an average of 26.5 mpg. The average sport-utility vehicle has fuel
economy ranging from about 14 to 18 miles per gallon.

NAVY'S BATTLE FOR VIEQUES RAISES CANCER SCARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 15)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ Fisherman Fernando Robinson estimates
that 60 of his neighbors in the residential enclave near the Navy's
training and target range have died from cancer over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Residents call the decimated neighborhood ``the Second Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos ``Papa Fu'' Martinez blames decaying Navy bombs and
leaking explosives strewn on the ocean floor for damaging the
underwater stands of coral that serve as nurseries for the small
fish that feed the grouper, red snapper and hog fish that make up
the fishermen's catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy has to go, one way or another,'' says Martinez, a
wizened 63-year-old fisherman who says he's harvested these waters
since he was seven years old.
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Morales, 28, says the Navy is an important source of
income for some of the 9,300 islanders who live on civilian land
sandwiched between a Navy ammunition depot on the western end of
the island and the firing range at the eastern end, within sight of
the islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have nothing against the Navy,'' says Morales, who is
hoping a Navy contract might enable the local General Electric
Corp. electrical components plant to rehire him as a fork lift
driver after a four-week layoff. ``They just have to stop the
bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   And Roberto C. Nelson, a Navy spokesman, worries that unless the
Navy resumes target practice on Vieques by September when the next
aircraft carrier battle group comes through for training, the lives
of American aviators and Marines will be in jeopardy if they face
combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and Marine Corps have used Vieques for 58 years to
prepare Atlantic-based forces for deployment in every conflict
since World War II, including Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and the
78-day campaign in Kosovo earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a game,'' says Nelson, who works at the nearby
9,000-acre Roosevelt Roads Naval Station that pumps $300 million a
year into the local economy. ``In the military, the penalty you pay
for improper training is people die.''
</P>
<P>
   Vieques, an arid, wind-swept 33,000-acre island lying eight
miles east of the Puerto Rican mainland, lies at the heart of an
escalating struggle between the Navy and Puerto Rico, a
Spanish-speaking territory of 3.8 million U.S. citizens that came
under American jurisdiction during the Spanish-American War in
1898.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans' simmering resentments about the use of Vieques
for target practice exploded into the open in April when the pilot
of a Marine FA-18 fighter-bomber mistakenly dropped two 500 pound
bombs on a hilltop range observation post, killing David Sanes
Rodriguez, 35, a civilian employee of the Navy, and injuring four
others.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mishap, Puerto Rico's political leaders have united to
demand that the Navy stop using Vieques for target practice and
protesters have occupied the 899-acre target area, blocking any
resumption of bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   One protester, Puerto Rican Sen. Ruben Barrios, leader of the
Puerto Rican Independence Party, vows to remain at his sandy
encampment until the Navy announces plans to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton can go into the next millennium as a protector of
the ecology or he can be one of the dictators of his age,'' says
Barrios, who like Clinton graduated from Georgetown University and
Yale Law School. ``The president cannot extricate himself from this
situation _ the pressure is too great in all of Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombing and shelling have been suspending since the April mishap
but Navy Secretary Richard Danzig is eager to resume target
practice at Vieques to assure that Navy pilots, ships and Marine
Corps troops are prepared for combat before they go overseas.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has ordered a special Pentagon panel to
propose a compromise by Aug. 31.

<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is confronting the issue in
her exploratory U.S. Senate campaign in New York, where Puerto
Ricans and other Hispanics make up 14.2 percent of the state's
population. City Council member Jose Rivera raised the issue with
Mrs. Clinton during her visit to Queens on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor her likely GOP rival, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, has taken a position on the dispute over Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates in 2000 are likely to confront the
issue, as well, as the result of a nationwide campaign that civil
rights leader Jesse Jackson launched last week to rally Hispanic
and African-American voters on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson joined Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello and Rick
Dovalina, national president of the U.S.-based League of United
Latin American Citizens, to map political rallies in key states to
challenge the Navy's ``occupation'' of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that once we leave this place and take our
case to the people of New York in great numbers, and Illinois and
Texas and California and Florida, this issue will be a critical
matter on the agenda for 2000,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The five states control more than half the 280 electoral votes
that a presidential candidate must win to capture the White House.

</P>
<P>
   Vieques is an unlikely setting for such a high-level dispute.
The 22-mile long island, covered with wind-blown vegetation and
surrounded by the glistening waters of the Caribbean, was used for
centuries by Spanish colonial overlords to raise sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy began buying 22,000 of the island's 33,000 acres in
1941 for $47 an acre to establish a training area and ammunition
depot. Nazi submarines were prowling the Atlantic Coast at the
time, imperiling Navy ships' access to resupplies of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Today, cows and horses wander aimlessly down single-land roads
crisscrossing the island. Drivers slow at corners or road-side
homes to hail greetings to childhood chums. Vice Mayor Hector Ortiz
can see a visitor at a moment's notice, no appointment required.
</P>
<P>
   Economic development is fitful. The airport terminal and the
municipal hospital are brand new, washed in the soft pastels of the
Caribbean. A sprawling sports complex, including a cavernous gym
and baseball field, stand partially complete.
</P>
<P>
   But island life has changed since the bombing mishap. Printed
and hand-scrawled signs proclaim ``Fuera Marina Vieques'' -- Navy
out of Vieques. Citizens speculate constantly about the fate of
Vieques and the most frightening talk of late is about a rumored
but unproven epidemic of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't know,'' says Ortiz, the city's vice mayor.
``They read that islanders suffer a higher rate of cancer than
Puerto Rico. Everything negative that happens on Vieques gets
blamed on the Navy _ even if people don't have the facts to back it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who has driven a van for visiting government officials
and tourists since being laid off by GE, says islanders often
complain about getting sick from seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people, they are afraid of the cancer, the chemicals, that
sort of thing,'' says Morales. ``It's the poison fish. You start to
feel bad, like needles poking you, your tongue is heavy. There's a
lot of dizziness. You can get sick from good fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen fear that their catches may be carrying
disease-causing chemicals from decaying bombs on the ocean floor to
the dinner tables of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the 56-year-old fisherman sitting in the shade of a
tree at the beach where fishermen moor their skiffs, says his
neighbors are afflicted with lung, throat and skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many young people are dying,'' says Robinson, with an
insistent tone in his voice. ``My friends lose their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of cancer has been around for years. A study by the
government of Puerto Rico completed in October 1997 found 482 cases
of cancer between 1960 and 1989, contributing to a cancer rate on
the island that stands 27 percent higher than any other
municipality in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar ``Doc'' Salicrup, 37, a Vieques-based Navy hospital
corpsman who tried to save the mortally wounded security guard in
April, says islanders may be suffering high rates of cancer due to
the widespread use of tobacco, including smoking and chewing
tobacco. Sugar cane workers for generations commonly chewed tobacco
in the fields, Salicrup recalls, possibly contributing to high
rates of cancer now among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the bombing mishap and White House
involvement, investigators from a federal cancer-monitoring agency,
the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, have begun
investigating the islanders' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry could take six months and potentially delay any
decision by Clinton on whether to allow the Navy to resume target
practice with bombs, naval gunfire, and Marines' artillery and
mortars.
</P>
<P>
   Agostini, Puerto Rico's attorney general, says the Navy must
await the outcome of the federal cancer investigation before it
``even thinks'' of resuming target practice, adding: ``They have to
run studies to try to find out if what they are doing is the reason
for these terrible health results.''
</P>
<P>
   But fishermen like Robinson remain wary of any outcome that
falls short of ending target practice by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people who come to do the studies are from the Navy, we
won't believe them,'' says Robinson. ``If they're sent by the Navy,
nothing is going to happen. The bombing will begin again.''

   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ Fisherman Fernando Robinson estimates
that 60 of his neighbors in the residential enclave near the Navy's
training and target range have died from cancer over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Residents call the decimated neighborhood ``the Second Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos ``Papa Fu'' Martinez blames decaying Navy bombs and
leaking explosives strewn on the ocean floor for damaging the
underwater stands of coral that serve as nurseries for the small
fish that feed the grouper, red snapper and hog fish that make up
the fishermen's catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy has to go, one way or another,'' says Martinez, a
wizened 63-year-old fisherman who says he's harvested these waters
since he was seven years old.
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Morales, 28, says the Navy is an important source of
income for some of the 9,300 islanders who live on civilian land
sandwiched between a Navy ammunition depot on the western end of
the island and the firing range at the eastern end, within sight of
the islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have nothing against the Navy,'' says Morales, who is
hoping a Navy contract might enable the local General Electric
Corp. electrical components plant to rehire him as a fork lift
driver after a four-week layoff. ``They just have to stop the
bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   And Roberto C. Nelson, a Navy spokesman, worries that unless the
Navy resumes target practice on Vieques by September when the next
aircraft carrier battle group comes through for training, the lives
of American aviators and Marines will be in jeopardy if they face
combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and Marine Corps have used Vieques for 58 years to
prepare Atlantic-based forces for deployment in every conflict
since World War II, including Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and the
78-day campaign in Kosovo earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a game,'' says Nelson, who works at the nearby
9,000-acre Roosevelt Roads Naval Station that pumps $300 million a
year into the local economy. ``In the military, the penalty you pay
for improper training is people die.''
</P>
<P>
   Vieques, an arid, wind-swept 33,000-acre island lying eight
miles east of the Puerto Rican mainland, lies at the heart of an
escalating struggle between the Navy and Puerto Rico, a
Spanish-speaking territory of 3.8 million U.S. citizens that came
under American jurisdiction during the Spanish-American War in
1898.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans' simmering resentments about the use of Vieques
for target practice exploded into the open in April when the pilot
of a Marine FA-18 fighter-bomber mistakenly dropped two 500 pound
bombs on a hilltop range observation post, killing David Sanes
Rodriguez, 35, a civilian employee of the Navy, and injuring four
others.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mishap, Puerto Rico's political leaders have united to
demand that the Navy stop using Vieques for target practice and
protesters have occupied the 899-acre target area, blocking any
resumption of bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   One protester, Puerto Rican Sen. Ruben Barrios, leader of the
Puerto Rican Independence Party, vows to remain at his sandy
encampment until the Navy announces plans to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton can go into the next millennium as a protector of
the ecology or he can be one of the dictators of his age,'' says
Barrios, who like Clinton graduated from Georgetown University and
Yale Law School. ``The president cannot extricate himself from this
situation _ the pressure is too great in all of Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombing and shelling have been suspending since the April mishap
but Navy Secretary Richard Danzig is eager to resume target
practice at Vieques to assure that Navy pilots, ships and Marine
Corps troops are prepared for combat before they go overseas.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has ordered a special Pentagon panel to
propose a compromise by Aug. 31.

   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is confronting the issue in
her exploratory U.S. Senate campaign in New York, where Puerto
Ricans and other Hispanics make up 14.2 percent of the state's
population. City Council member Jose Rivera raised the issue with
Mrs. Clinton during her visit to Queens on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor her likely GOP rival, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, has taken a position on the dispute over Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates in 2000 are likely to confront the
issue, as well, as the result of a nationwide campaign that civil
rights leader Jesse Jackson launched last week to rally Hispanic
and African-American voters on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson joined Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello and Rick
Dovalina, national president of the U.S.-based League of United
Latin American Citizens, to map political rallies in key states to
challenge the Navy's ``occupation'' of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that once we leave this place and take our
case to the people of New York in great numbers, and Illinois and
Texas and California and Florida, this issue will be a critical
matter on the agenda for 2000,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The five states control more than half the 280 electoral votes
that a presidential candidate must win to capture the White House.

<P>
   Vieques is an unlikely setting for such a high-level dispute.
The 22-mile long island, covered with wind-blown vegetation and
surrounded by the glistening waters of the Caribbean, was used for
centuries by Spanish colonial overlords to raise sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Navy began buying 22,000 of the island's 33,000 acres in
1941 for $47 an acre to establish a training area and ammunition
depot. Nazi submarines were prowling the Atlantic Coast at the
time, imperiling Navy ships' access to resupplies of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Today, cows and horses wander aimlessly down single-land roads
crisscrossing the island. Drivers slow at corners or road-side
homes to hail greetings to childhood chums. Vice Mayor Hector Ortiz
can see a visitor at a moment's notice, no appointment required.
</P>
<P>
   Economic development is fitful. The airport terminal and the
municipal hospital are brand new, washed in the soft pastels of the
Caribbean. A sprawling sports complex, including a cavernous gym
and baseball field, stand partially complete.
</P>
<P>
   But island life has changed since the bombing mishap. Printed
and hand-scrawled signs proclaim ``Fuera Marina Vieques'' -- Navy
out of Vieques. Citizens speculate constantly about the fate of
Vieques and the most frightening talk of late is about a rumored
but unproven epidemic of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't know,'' says Ortiz, the city's vice mayor.
``They read that islanders suffer a higher rate of cancer than
Puerto Rico. Everything negative that happens on Vieques gets
blamed on the Navy _ even if people don't have the facts to back it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who has driven a van for visiting government officials
and tourists since being laid off by GE, says islanders often
complain about getting sick from seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people, they are afraid of the cancer, the chemicals, that
sort of thing,'' says Morales. ``It's the poison fish. You start to
feel bad, like needles poking you, your tongue is heavy. There's a
lot of dizziness. You can get sick from good fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen fear that their catches may be carrying
disease-causing chemicals from decaying bombs on the ocean floor to
the dinner tables of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the 56-year-old fisherman sitting in the shade of a
tree at the beach where fishermen moor their skiffs, says his
neighbors are afflicted with lung, throat and skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many young people are dying,'' says Robinson, with an
insistent tone in his voice. ``My friends lose their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of cancer has been around for years. A study by the
government of Puerto Rico completed in October 1997 found 482 cases
of cancer between 1960 and 1989, contributing to a cancer rate on
the island that stands 27 percent higher than any other
municipality in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar ``Doc'' Salicrup, 37, a Vieques-based Navy hospital
corpsman who tried to save the mortally wounded security guard in
April, says islanders may be suffering high rates of cancer due to
the widespread use of tobacco, including smoking and chewing
tobacco. Sugar cane workers for generations commonly chewed tobacco
in the fields, Salicrup recalls, possibly contributing to high
rates of cancer now among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the bombing mishap and White House
involvement, investigators from a federal cancer-monitoring agency,
the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, have begun
investigating the islanders' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry could take six months and potentially delay any
decision by Clinton on whether to allow the Navy to resume target
practice with bombs, naval gunfire, and Marines' artillery and
mortars.
</P>
<P>
   Agostini, Puerto Rico's attorney general, says the Navy must
await the outcome of the federal cancer investigation before it
``even thinks'' of resuming target practice, adding: ``They have to
run studies to try to find out if what they are doing is the reason
for these terrible health results.''
</P>
<P>
   But fishermen like Robinson remain wary of any outcome that
falls short of ending target practice by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people who come to do the studies are from the Navy, we
won't believe them,'' says Robinson. ``If they're sent by the Navy,
nothing is going to happen. The bombing will begin again.''

MR. PROSPECTOR FETCHES $3 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LINDA TRISCHITTA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The auctioneer teased the audience with
a big pause when the bidding reached $2.6 million, and then moments
later announced the final price of $3 million for a Mr. Prospector
bay colt with a white diamond between his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga Springs Mayor J. Michael O'Connell denied with a laugh
that he was one of the competing bidders during the excitement that
came midway on the closing night of the 79th Annual Fasig-Tipton
Saratoga Select Yearling auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obviously a special event,'' O'Connell said Thursday.
``And to see a horse go for $3 million is outstanding. It reflects
well on Fasig-Tipton.''
</P>
<P>
   The $3 million purchase was made by Aaron and Marie Jones of
Eugene, Ore., who bid from outside of the auditorium, where the
crowd burst into applause as the hammer came down.
</P>
<P>
   A Jones-owned horse, Prime Timber, finished fourth in this
year's Kentucky Derby and won the San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   The sale equaled the third highest price ever paid for a
Saratoga yearling.
</P>
<P>
   The average price for the evening's 47 lots was $253,723, which
surpassed by 18 percent the 1998 final night figure of $215,250.
Average price for the entire three-day sale was $261,456, compared
with $211,395 in 1998, a 24 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Gross sales for the final night totaled $11,925,000, 15 percent
higher than 1998's $10,332,000. Gross sales for all three sessions
totaled $38,957,000 for 149 horses, 14 percent higher than the 1998
gross total of $34,246,000 for 162 horses.
</P>
<P>
   The record price for Saratoga was $4.6 million in 1984 for a
chestnut colt. Last year's high price was $1.7 million for a filly.
</P>
<P>
   How do buyers make such expensive decisions? Some thoroughbred
buyers use timeless techniques like studying a horse's physique,
gait and cardiovascular fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Others opt for a method called biomechanics, the study of
biological processes like heart action and muscle movement. It is a
field that has improved business for one company by 400 percent in
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert D. Fierro, president of EQUIX Biomechanics
of Lexington, Ky., about 250 clients confidentially use his company
to evaluate the racing and breeding potentials of stallions, mares
and yearlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can measure the heart, but you can't measure the soul,''
Fierro said of intangibles like the will to win.
</P>
<P>
   EQUIX, which charges $650 for an analysis of a horse, advised 12
clients during the Saratoga yearling sales.

LIFETIME RIVALS COMPETE FOR WOMEN'S ATTENTION, CASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, in its ongoing effort to become a one-stop
sister-clique network where thoughtful original programming would
outnumber broadcast network rehashes like ``The Commish,'' Lifetime
hatched ``Any Day Now,'' a dynamic drama that begins its second
season Sunday night, dissecting the racially delicate relationship
of two strong-willed women.
</P>
<P>
   Also returning to the cable channel's schedule this week is ``Oh
Baby,'' the unconventional comedy series about a single woman who
opts for parenthood without one of the essential ingredients such
ventures often require _ a man.
</P>
<P>
   If I failed to mention the series premiere of ``Maggie,'' the
third new series introduced last season, it's because Lifetime
killed that half-hour comedy after, as new network President Carole
Black sums up factually if rather coldly, ``It failed to live up to
the promise of its pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: It tanked in the ratings, so it was dumped on the
trash heap.
</P>
<P>
   Canceling series is par for the course in the TV industry. But
Lifetime's quick trigger finger is an exception in cable, where
shows are usually given generous amounts of time to find an
audience. How else could you possibly explain the return of
``Linc's'' on Showtime?
</P>
<P>
   The death of ``Maggie,'' a marginally humorous but ambitious
series based entirely on a woman and her doubts about love and
marriage, are proof that there's a new marshal at Lifetime. And
she's circling the wagons, readying for a fierce battle.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime, available in 73 million homes and partly owned by
Disney, has long fought off cable competition in the form of
female-friendly Home &AMP; Garden Television, Romance Classics, The
Food Network, E! Entertainment and recently E!'s fashion-oriented
programming. But its monopoly has never been challenged head-on.
That is due to change: Oxygen Media debuts Feb. 2, and Turner's The
Women's Network is set to begin programming later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the all-important brand-name sweepstakes, Oxygen has already
generated word-of-mouth publicity. It has also pulled off a clever
public bashing of Lifetime by saying women don't want more passive
entertainment or more movies depicting them as victims, criticisms
that Lifetime has defended against for most of its 15 years. And
for Oxygen mouthpieces to say it's high time that television caters
to ``intelligent women'' sounds like a direct smack in the Lifetime
kisser to me.
</P>
<P>
   The word-of-mouth buzz comes courtesy of Oxygen's big-name
pedigree: CEO Geraldine Laybourne is one of the industry's most
respected visionaries, having helped build Nickelodeon into a
kiddie-channel powerhouse. She also helped guide Disney's cable
ventures, which means that from '96 to '98, she had some say in the
handling of Lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, Oprah Winfrey is also involved _ her Harpo
Entertainment Group will produce original programming, and reruns
of ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' will hit Oxygen by 2002. Other
partners include the Carsey-Warner TV production house, which
hasn't dazzled us as of late but whose creations include ``Cosby,''
``Roseanne,'' ``Grace Under Fire'' and ``Cybil,'' all of which
rated highly with women.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen is keeping its programming game plan under wraps, but we
do know that actress Candice Bergen will host a Charlie Rose-style
talk show called ``Exhale,'' and that comedies, dramas, sports,
music and a series on money (called ``ka-Ching'') will be part of
the menu.
</P>
<P>
   On the theory that women ages 18-to-49 will find Lifetime too
fluffy and Oxygen too stuffy comes The Women's Network, a
middle-ground channel birthed by Turner Broadcasting and partnered
with publishing companies Time Inc. and Conde Nast. This means that
the channel will draw upon such publications as Time and Gourmet, a
synergy promising politics and the latest in one-dish dinners.
</P>
<P>
   With such resources, The Women's Network, too, is promising that
its viewers will not be subjected to the kind of movies or reruns
or sitcoms offered by, well, you-know-who. ``Just reliable and
relevant information,'' says Pat Mitchell, the channel's CEO.
``Information that addresses the needs of the lives of all today's
active and smart and time-challenged women.''
</P>
<P>
   All this makes for vexing times at Lifetime, which responded
last year by pumping $160 million into original programming (a 40
percent increase from the year before) in an effort to stop looking
like a cable channel living off broadcast network reruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Day Now,'' the Deep South drama starring Annie Potts and
Lorraine Toussaint, is equal to the best of network dramas. A
number of TV critics found the series dramatically nourishing and
its choice of story lines refreshing, particularly its depiction of
female friendship complicated by matters of race.
</P>
<P>
   It quickly set a renegade precedent of going against TV formula
and probably helped bring viewers to the network's half-hour
comedies, especially ``Oh Baby,'' which featured Cynthia Stevenson
as a marketing executive who was artificially inseminated. This
season, beginning Saturday, she shows us life with baby.
</P>
<P>
   Just like ``Any Day Now,'' the series shows an engaging
relationship between two women. If this were network fare, it would
have been brought together by other devices, like affections for
the same man. Instead, Stevenson and pal Joanna Gleason are a hoot,
often at odds but united emotionally in Stevenson's decision to go
it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it appears that Lifetime is failing to capitalize
on its momentum. This season's two new entries are reality-type
series that can be found anywhere. One was. ``Ruby,'' which aired
on Fox for a spell, features Ruby Wax, an acid-tongued talk host.
Wax is so over-the-top that she'll be hilarious to half the room
and annoying to everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond Chance'' is hosted by singer Melissa Etheridge, who
introduces stories about women who have experienced twists of fate
that changed their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime plans to continue its popular lifestyle program ``New
Attitudes'' and the biography series ``Intimate Portraits,'' a
high-gloss treatment of celebrities that, because of its dogged
emphasis on the positive, usually ends up offering half-truths.
</P>
<P>
   Since women make 70 percent of retail purchases and pay 95
percent of the household bills (including, coincidentally, the
cable bill) don't mistake this new courtship for anything except
the pursuit of dollars. Oxygen and Turner are positioning their
channels for the unlimited competition that digital television will
provide. It's the same reason that Black Entertainment Television,
a lone wolf for 20 years, may finally get competition for
African-American viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But if Lifetime plans to defend its throne against the new
intruders, it had better up the ante in quality programming and
steer clear of movies about wives who sue The Other Woman for
stealing their husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Price of a Broken Heart'' airs at 8 p.m. CDT Monday.

CARLSBAD SLAYING CASE SPURS REVIEW OF 1996 MURDER

   &UR;  &LR;  BOSTON -- Police said Thursday they will ``take another
look'' at Raffi Kodikian, accused of killing his best friend in New
Mexico, in connection with the 1996 murder of Swedish nanny Karina
Holmer, whose torso was discovered in a dumpster behind a Fenway
building where Kodikian lived.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other potential witnesses, Kodikian, 25, was
interviewed by police seeking clues in Holmer's strangulation and
dismemberment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who lived in that building was questioned as part of
a routine canvass,'' said Detective Sergeant Margot Hill, a police
spokeswoman. ``That doesn't mean one way or another that any
suspicions were raised about him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hill said the department would ``take another look'' at
Kodikian in light of the murder charge he faces. Kodikian told New
Mexico authorities he stabbed David Coughlin, 26, twice in the
heart to put a friend dying of thirst out of his misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do it at the discretion of New Mexico police,'' she
said.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ They say it's not about the money, which can mean
only one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Check your wallet. Check it again. Calculate just how much money
is missing. Take what's left, if there is anything, and find a
safer place for it.
</P>
<P>
   Like an incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval and Tiger Woods are in a huff, and it's easy to see
why. More than a week has passed since anybody has thrown a $1
million and change at them for the honor of staging a meaningless
exhibition to further a phantom rivalry. Imagine how much it pains
them, then, to contemplate taking a week out of their busy
September schedules merely to represent their country in the Ryder
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   No glitzy guarantee money. No pot of gold to be divvied up among
the players at the drop of the last putt. Just a $5,000 stipend,
which, if you're in the tax bracket of International Management
Group-preferred clients, is chump change.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, Duval and Woods have appeared in one Ryder Cup.
This, of course, eminently qualifies them to enlighten the PGA of
America as to how to salvage an event that began in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Duval and Woods are lobbying for Ryder Cup compensation. This
year's competition at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., appears
safe for public consumption, but the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the
world have hinted at possible boycotts of future Ryder Cups if
their demands aren't met.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see us each get an amount ... whether it's
$200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000, whatever it is ... and I
think we should be able to keep the money and do with it whatever
we see fit,'' Woods said. ``For me, personally, I would donate all
of it to charity. I'm sure most everyone else would do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a decade ago, the Ryder Cup was a money pit, propped up by
the PGA. Woods and Duval weren't on the tour during those lean
years, or maybe they wouldn't be so put out about the prospect of
this year's Ryder Cup generating an estimated $63 million. The PGA
will clear an estimated $20 million from the event, with much of
the money set aside for programs to help the sport grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to give some money back to a children's soccer field
in Ponte Vedra Beach (Fla.), that should be my choice,'' Duval
said. ``I don't want $5 million, but I think we should have some
money to take back to benefit, you know, where we live. And if
people see a problem with that, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup is big enough business where the players are
entitled to an accounting of the money. PGA fat cats in blazers
shouldn't be subsidizing summer homes with Ryder Cup receipts.
Beyond that, power plays over which charities get how much money
needlessly sully one of the purest forms of competition in
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, how long would it take for players to start
designating themselves as their favorite charity? Bless American
Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw for taking a stand against all this
nonsense. Crenshaw normally is mild-mannered, but a Ryder Cup
meeting Tuesday had him so steamed that smoke was coming out of his
ears a day later.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sick of issues like this in the sports world,''
Crenshaw said. ``When you can't just show up and play for your
country, I don't know. If that's not reward enough, then my heart
bleeds for the game of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the Ryder Cup is that for one week during the
year, the pros are playing for something bigger than themselves.
They're playing for pride, for each other, for country, in what
four-time Ryder Cup participant Tom Watson calls ``the Olympics of
golf.'' In such a setting, with no money at stake, there's more
choking than on the back nine of Augusta National on a Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play for money 51 weeks of the year _ or we could,''
England's Lee Westwood said. ``So I think one week every two years
playing for pride and honor and representing your country is not
too much to ask. I just think if people start getting paid for it,
it will just taint it a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It would turn the Ryder Cup into an extension of golf's silly
season. Globe-trotting players chasing almighty dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a sad day in the future when players on both sides
of the Atlantic can say to themselves, `This is not worth it,'''
said Crenshaw, who has played in four Ryder Cup events. ``Every
fine player who's worth their salt has given their heart and soul
to Ryder Cup. Playing for your country, I can't imagine anything
more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw backed off a bit Thursday, wondering aloud if he wasn't
on the wrong end of a generation gap. Well, guess what? It's not
strictly a generational thing. Listen to Westwood, who is 26, and
you begin to get the idea that it's an ugly-American thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up watching Nick Faldo playing in it, Seve
(Ballesteros), Woosie (Ian Woosnam), and people like that,''
Westwood said. ``It's an honor to represent England and Europe, for
me, and I think players have bonus-related things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a good Ryder Cup, it might encourage a few more people
to come and watch another time. And that, in turn, puts people
through the gates for the tournament and puts more money in our
pockets. It could build the popularity of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, it could build the popularity of the European
team. Even in America.
</P>
<P>
   So, go Europe. Take the Ryder Cup home again, to a place where
it's worth something.

 &HT;    DROUGHT HASN'T WILTED FARM FAMILY'S LOVE OF THE LAND
 &HT;    Moving in (a) national and (l) lifestyle categories for release
Sunday, Aug. 22.

<P>
   OTTOBINE, Va. _ They met at the wedding of his brother and her
friend from nursing school. A year later, they said ``I do'' to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good match _ rooted in shared values that their
forebears had cultivated over generations of tilling the Southern
soil.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up on a North Carolina tobacco farm in an era when
neighbors helped each other pick the broad green leaves and hang
them in weathered wooden barns for curing. His ancestors had raised
cattle and corn on the hilly western edge of the Shenandoah Valley
for over a century.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, they loved each other and they loved the land
and they loved the lifestyle. They lived near his folks on the farm
that his daddy had purchased in 1929. Although hard work and hard
times were never strangers, satisfaction was their constant
companion as they raised a daughter and a son along with the crops
and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after more than three decades together, Wayne and Betty
Cupp reckon that it is nearly time to retire and let their
28-year-old son, Maurice, take over this rural enterprise begun by
his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   If only it would rain ...
</P>
<P>
   The drought in the mid-Atlantic states is the worst since the
Dust Bowl days of the Great Depression over 60 years ago. Stunted
cornstalks are withering in the fields. Farmers are shipping cattle
to market early because they can't afford feed. Pastures are
sunburnt brown and crunchy. Except for some stubborn weeds, about
the only greenery around is the paint on John Deere tractors
sitting idle in sheds.
</P>
<P>
   It's so dry hereabouts that University of Virginia scientists
stuck radio transmitters on the backs of turtles and tracked one
that trudged two miles _ at an inch per step _ to find water.
</P>
<P>
   Worry is as bountiful as crops are sparse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad drilled the well in 1954 and we've always had plenty of
water until this year. For the first time ever, the well water
turned muddy,'' said Wayne Cupp. ``We moved the cows to a pasture
where the creek runs. Then the creek went dry. Then the pond went
dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the well has revived and, at least for the time being,
it is providing the several thousand gallons of clear water needed
every day by the extended Cupp family and their cows, pigs and
turkeys. Additional water from mountain springs is being hauled in
to save the backyard garden and orchard that provide vegetables and
fruit to be canned or frozen for winter meals.
</P>
<P>
   The garden ``is not doing too well,'' allowed Betty Cupp. ``Last
year, I put up 100 jars of green beans. This year, I've done
seven.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even with a wife and two children below the age of 2 to
support, Maurice Cupp expresses no qualms about starting a career
of fretting on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we'll get through it,'' he says of the current troubles.
``We always have.''
</P>
<P>
   But why would a family put out such effort generation after
generation?
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Despite the parched fields along the Eastern seaboard, enough
rain has fallen across the heartland to produce bumper crops
nationally and keep commodity prices depressingly low for farmers.
Wayne Cupp estimates his break-even point on raising hogs is about
35 cents per pound, and last year he had to sell some for 15 cents
a pound. So if he fattened a hog up to 400 pounds, he lost $80 at
market for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, agriculture is being ruled by the economies of
scale. The century's trend is toward fewer and bigger farms.
Already, 80 percent of the nation's food is grown on 20 percent of
the farms. Agribusinesses have swallowed up small family farms like
Wal-Marts have squeezed out small-town merchants.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupps own 108 acres in a scenic region coveted by
developers. A neighboring farm recently sold for $6,000 an acre.
Samuel Cupp, who died in 1991 at the age of 96, paid about $100 an
acre for the land now cultivated by his son and grandson. It
doesn't take a calculator to figure that there's a huge profit in
selling out.
</P>
<P>
   But life is more than a ledger. The Cupps figure much of their
sowing and reaping cannot be measured by what's in the bank, silo
and deep freezer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly like the economics of farming,'' said
Betty Cupp. ``But I like living out in the country. I like having
room for a garden. I like the scenery. I like living in a way where
kids learn responsibility by doing chores as they grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of their marriage, Betty has worked fulltime as a
registered nurse in the maternity ward at Rockingham Memorial
Hospital in Harrisonburg, about 20 miles away from their farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We depend on her salary at times like this,'' said Wayne. ``I
don't know what we would do without it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of stresses,'' said Betty. ``But when the kids
were little, Wayne could make his own schedule to take care of
them. If they were sick, he could take them to the doctor. We never
had to hire a baby-sitter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was here to help take care of them, too,'' recalled
Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Laura, studied music education at James Madison
University. Now 31, she is married to a tax lawyer and lives in
Sterling, Va., a suburb of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice went to college for a little over a year, but his
parents knew that his heart was always on the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming kind of gets in your blood. When my son was growing
up, I could see that in him,'' said Wayne. ``But I let him make up
his own mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have discouraged him, but he doesn't listen,'' said
Betty, with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all I've ever known, all I've ever wanted to be,'' said
Maurice. ``There are probably some things I could do to make more
money, but I guess you do what's in your blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like working for myself, being my own boss. I like the
satisfaction of raising something up, whether it's crops or
livestock. I appreciated the life growing up and I'd like to raise
my children the same way. I want to teach them the value of work no
matter if they go into farming or something else.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Wayne is 64 years old now, and Betty is seven years younger.
Both had hoped to retire in another year or so, but the drought has
put those plans on hold. It will take a while just to catch up.
There won't be a corn crop this year, although the stalks will be
harvested for silage to feed the cattle. Planted in swaths between
cornfields, the pearl millet is usually is cut twice each summer
for hay. It is not tall enough this year for even one cutting. The
cattle will likely just graze on it for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With no corn or hay for feed, the Cupps won't augment their herd
by buying calves to fatten up over the winter and sell next year to
feed lots. Indeed, they could have to sell off breeder cows to cut
costs. But that would hinder a comeback when feed crops are better.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is plenty to do even in these hot, dry times.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Cupps rise at about 5 a.m. An hour later, Betty
usually drives off to begin her 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift at the
hospital, while Wayne takes the pickup truck to the turkey houses
to check on the 20,000 or so young birds being raised under
contract to the Rocco poultry company. There are two turkey houses
on the Cupp farm _ built at a cost of about $150,000 apiece _ and
Maurice has rented a third house on nearby property.
</P>
<P>
   The poultry company supplies the birds and feed and medicines.
The Cupps provide the houses, labor and water. The farmers' first
check on the young turkeys is at 6 a.m., the last at 9 p.m. Alarms
go off at any hour in case of problems such as a power outage.
Disease can cull all profit from a flock and is a constant concern.
In a good season, they'll make about $1 per hen or $2 on a tom,
Wayne figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkeys have a reputation for being dumb,'' Wayne says with a
smile. ``But I don't know which is dumber _ the birds or the people
dumb enough to raise them.''
</P>
<P>
   On her days off from the hospital, as summer ends, Betty cans
and freezes vegetables and fruit from the garden. Blackberries are
doing well despite the drought, and she prepared 100 jars of jelly
and jam.
</P>
<P>
   There are four kinds of tomatoes in the garden, along with sweet
corn, collard greens, okra, beans, eggplant, cucumbers, peppers,
onion, squash, rhubarb, and cantaloupes. Behind the blackberry
bushes and grape vines are apple, peach and pear trees. The garden
supplies about half the family's vegetables and fruit for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, the Cupps will take a hog or cow to be slaughtered
and butchered. The beef and pork comes back neatly packaged for the
freezer. They get a good deal on poultry at the Rocco company
store.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K worries won't send the Cupps scrambling to the grocery store
on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   The pond that the Cupps stocked with bluegill, bass, catfish and
minnows is bone dry. The adjoining hillside, normally a green
pasture where cows graze, is a moonscape of exposed dirt and rocks.
The long driveway is dusty between the white frame farmhouse and
the turnoff at Waggy's Creek Road.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still shade on the front porch of the house where
Betty and Wayne reared their children and where they can now rock
their grandchildren. They can still feel serenity as they look out
over the patchwork quilt of fields and pastures between their
hilltop home and the Shenandoah Mountains. Every evening, the sun
still sets in silence behind those mountains. Bo, the famously fast
black dog once clocked at running 35 mph beside a car, still roams
down Daniel Cupp Road _ so named because it once led to the house
of Wayne's great-grandfather. Maurice and his family live down that
way now.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the rains come to the Shenandoah Valley, the Cupps will
be here farming.

Samuel Cupp, who died in 1991 at the age of 96, paid about $100 an
acre for the land now cultivated by his son and grandson. It
doesn't take a calculator to figure that there's a huge profit in
selling out.
</P>
<P>
   But life is more than a ledger. The Cupps figure much of their
sowing and reaping cannot be measured by what's in the bank, silo
and deep freezer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly like the economics of farming,'' said
Betty Cupp. ``But I like living out in the country. I like having
room for a garden. I like the scenery. I like living in a way where
kids learn responsibility by doing chores as they grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of their marriage, Betty has worked fulltime as a
registered nurse in the maternity ward at Rockingham Memorial
Hospital in Harrisonburg, about 20 miles away from their farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We depend on her salary at times like this,'' said Wayne. ``I
don't know what we would do without it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of stresses,'' said Betty. ``But when the kids
were little, Wayne could make his own schedule to take care of
them. If they were sick, he could take them to the doctor. We never
had to hire a baby-sitter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was here to help take care of them, too,'' recalled
Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Laura, studied music education at James Madison
University. Now 31, she is married to a tax lawyer and lives in
Sterling, Va., a suburb of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice went to college for a little over a year, but his
parents knew that his heart was always on the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming kind of gets in your blood. When my son was growing
up, I could see that in him,'' said Wayne. ``But I let him make up
his own mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have discouraged him, but he doesn't listen,'' said
Betty, with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all I've ever known, all I've ever wanted to be,'' said
Maurice. ``There are probably some things I could do to make more
money, but I guess you do what's in your blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like working for myself, being my own boss. I like the
satisfaction of raising something up, whether it's crops or
livestock. I appreciated the life growing up and I'd like to raise
my children the same way. I want to teach them the value of work no
matter if they go into farming or something else.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Wayne is 64 years old now, and Betty is seven years younger.
Both had hoped to retire in another year or so, but the drought has
put those plans on hold. It will take a while just to catch up.
There won't be a corn crop this year, although the stalks will be
harvested for silage to feed the cattle. Planted in swaths between
cornfields, the pearl millet is usually is cut twice each summer
for hay. It is not tall enough this year for even one cutting. The
cattle will likely just graze on it for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With no corn or hay for feed, the Cupps won't augment their herd
by buying calves to fatten up over the winter and sell next year to
feed lots. Indeed, they could have to sell off breeder cows to cut
costs. But that would hinder a comeback when feed crops are better.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is plenty to do even in these hot, dry times.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Cupps rise at about 5 a.m. An hour later, Betty
usually drives off to begin her 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift at the
hospital, while Wayne takes the pickup truck to the turkey houses
to check on the 20,000 or so young birds being raised under
contract to the Rocco poultry company. There are two turkey houses
on the Cupp farm _ built at a cost of about $150,000 apiece _ and
Maurice has rented a third house on nearby property.
</P>
<P>
   The poultry company supplies the birds and feed and medicines.
The Cupps provide the houses, labor and water. The farmers' first
check on the young turkeys is at 6 a.m., the last at 9 p.m. Alarms
go off at any hour in case of problems such as a power outage.
Disease can cull all profit from a flock and is a constant concern.
In a good season, they'll make about $1 per hen or $2 on a tom,
Wayne figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkeys have a reputation for being dumb,'' Wayne says with a
smile. ``But I don't know which is dumber _ the birds or the people
dumb enough to raise them.''
</P>
<P>
   On her days off from the hospital, as summer ends, Betty cans
and freezes vegetables and fruit from the garden. Blackberries are
doing well despite the drought, and she prepared 100 jars of jelly
and jam.
</P>
<P>
   There are four kinds of tomatoes in the garden, along with sweet
corn, collard greens, okra, beans, eggplant, cucumbers, peppers,
onion, squash, rhubarb, and cantaloupes. Behind the blackberry
bushes and grape vines are apple, peach and pear trees. The garden
supplies about half the family's vegetables and fruit for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, the Cupps will take a hog or cow to be slaughtered
and butchered. The beef and pork comes back neatly packaged for the
freezer. They get a good deal on poultry at the Rocco company
store.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K worries won't send the Cupps scrambling to the grocery store
on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   The pond that the Cupps stocked with bluegill, bass, catfish and
minnows is bone dry. The adjoining hillside, normally a green
pasture where cows graze, is a moonscape of exposed dirt and rocks.
The long driveway is dusty between the white frame farmhouse and
the turnoff at Waggy's Creek Road.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still shade on the front porch of the house where
Betty and Wayne reared their children and where they can now rock
their grandchildren. They can still feel serenity as they look out
over the patchwork quilt of fields and pastures between their
hilltop home and the Shenandoah Mountains. Every evening, the sun
still sets in silence behind those mountains. Bo, the famously fast
black dog once clocked at running 35 mph beside a car, still roams
down Daniel Cupp Road _ so named because it once led to the house
of Wayne's great-grandfather. Maurice and his family live down that
way now.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the rains come to the Shenandoah Valley, the Cupps will
be here farming.

 &HT;    EDUCATORS, PARENTS QUIETLY LOWER SCHOOL VIOLENCE
 &HT;    820&AMP;add. With SAFE-TIPS.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While President Clinton and Congress clash over
whether to tighten hate-crime and gun-control laws, tens of
thousands of educators and parents are working outside the
spotlight to minimize school violence in less controversial ways.
</P>
<P>
   While not ignoring the unlikely chance that a school will be
assaulted by a mass murderer, they spend far more time trying to
minimize painful, everyday violence.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening of a national teleconference on school safety
Thursday night, Clinton said recent multiple shootings made
``another compelling argument for the passage of hate crimes
legislation and common sense gun laws.'' Congress has resisted such
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But neither proposal was mentioned by any of the citizens who
spoke up during the remaining 85 minutes of the teleconference,
which was hosted by Education Secretary Richard Riley and Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us teachers spent a lot of time talking about violence
this summer, and at first we thought we ought to push for new
policies or new legislation,'' said Eddie Davis, an English teacher
and National Education Association board member from Durham, N.C.,
who serves on his state board of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we finally came to the conclusion that, for the most part,
we already have the policies in place, and we already have enough
laws,'' Davis said. ``What we have to do is consistently and fairly
enforce (them), so that children know that we are being consistent
and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lydick, a school-safety activist from Fairfax County, Va.,
said she was impressed with a booklet she read recently called
``Early Warning, Timely Response.'' It is a school safety guide
prepared last year by the Education and Justice departments and 18
national educational, children's and police organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Lydick was reassured by reading the guide, because many of its
tips have already been tried by her local coalition, which
coordinates school safety efforts by parents, educators, community
activists and business volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   She also found a few other sound ideas, like ways to convince
parents to spend more time offering a positive example and
listening to their older children's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping there's enough funding that we could give (the
guides) to everyone in every school,'' Lydick told Riley and Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Riley was quick to respond that anyone could order a copy of the
32-page guide through a toll-free phone call to 1-800-USA-LEARN or
download a copy by clicking on ``Safe Schools'' at his department's
Web site (http://www.ed.gov).
</P>
<P>
   The department has already issued more than 300,000 copies of
the guide. That included mass mailings to more than 85,000 public
and 26,000 private elementary and secondary schools last fall and
again after the deaths of 14 students and a teacher at Columbine
High School in April.
</P>
<P>
   But the booklet, like the school-by-school struggle against
violence, has been overshadowed by fears arising from the
nationally publicized multiple-victim assaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel safe in my school, but I don't think it will be safe
when I get in the big (secondary) school,'' said Lydick's
sixth-grade daughter, Elaine.
</P>
<P>
   Two new studies support the general consensus among educators
that they are making progress:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Centers for Disease Control confirmed that the number of
adolescents who report carrying a gun, carrying another weapon such
as a knife or club, or requiring treatment for injuries from a
fight fell steadily from 1993 through 1997. In each case, the
numbers were lower in the schools than in other locations.
</P>
<P>
   _ State education departments reported to the U.S. Department of
Education that, even though enforcement of ``zero tolerance'' laws
for firearms in schools is tightening, the number of students
expelled for bringing firearms to school dropped by nearly
one-third between the 1996-97 and 1997-98 school years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must remember that despite the tragedies at Columbine and
in Georgia and the scares in other places last year, schools are
still the safest place for children,'' Reno said. But, she added,
``We must realize that the facts may not translate into what people
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   A school security officer called from Chattanooga to ask Reno
and Riley, ``Is there a nationwide plan for educational
preparedness for violence and hate crimes in schools?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no national plan, per se,'' Reno replied, deferring
to the age-old American tradition of local responsibility for
schools. Any response plan, she said, ``is going to depend on each
school district and each police force and each local community.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley interjected, ``But our 'Early Warning' guide really sets
out exactly, good, well-thought-out ideas about how (local schools,
parents, police and emergency services) can can develop those
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   As a prime example, he pointed to Zavala Elementary School in
Austin, Texas, which has received national recognition as a safe
and effective school that has become a center of community services
and recreation during and after school hours in a high-crime,
low-income neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a united effort in the community and the churches nearby,
we have psychologists, counselors, social workers, priests, parents
and volunteer mentors coming in,'' said Olivia del Valle, Zavala's
assistant principal. A school with many adults is safer than one
occupied only by students and paid professionals, several
teleconference participants agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Del Valle was impatient with the lament that most parents stop
attending school events or listening at length to their children
after their youngest child leaves elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the school's responsibility to provide many avenues for
participation, because different parents need different ways,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her school informs and recruits adult volunteers and parents
with ice cream socials, booths at flea markets, meetings held
outside of working hours in the evening or on weekends , and
parent-teacher meetings that are held in houses and beauty or
barber shops that don't scare off parents who themselves did poorly
in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every school is different, and every school needs its own
safety plan,'' Del Valle said.

 &HT;    Hometown pulls together to support Jim `Catfish' Hunter
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Brian Zumbano
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERTFORD, N.C. _ As the baseball world holds its collective
breath for Hall of Fame pitcher Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, the town of
Hertford simply prays for a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The Perquimans County native has been hospitalized in the Pitt
County Memorial Hospital intensive care unit since suffering a head
injury during a fall at his home Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the 53-year-old was diagnosed with amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Since the incident Sunday, residents of Hertford have come
together in support of the town's most favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   ``This community loves Jimmy and his family very dearly,'' said
Sherry Harrell, who has been Hunter's next-door neighbor for the
past 27 years. ``Everybody's been completely devastated by this.
But Jimmy is a fighter and won't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Harrell, who has been to the hospital and is in
close contact with the Hunter family, Hunter's heart stopped
briefly early Tuesday morning. Hunter's condition was then upgraded
from serious to critical.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter has rebounded since then. Hospital spokesman Doug
Boyd said Friday morning that Hunter is breathing more on his own,
although he remains in critical condition and is hooked to a
ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's ALS fund-raiser, set for McDonald's in Hertford from
6 a.m. to 11 p.m., will still go on as scheduled. The event,
co-sponsored by East Carolina radio, will raise money for the Jim
``Catfish'' Hunter ALS Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell said Hunter's health is of the utmost importance in
Hertford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when somebody you think so much of is going through
something like this,'' Harrell said. ``But I personally plan on
being right here when he comes home. We're already planning his
coming-home party. We're just so optimistic he's going to make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrell also said that fellow Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson and
New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner were among several major
league baseball luminaries who have called to inquire about
Hunter's health.
</P>
<P>
   But the most support and concern has come from Hertford Baptist
Church, which Hunter and his family attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a family in our church has a catastrophe like this, we
all come together tremendously,'' said Hertford Baptist Rev. Keith
Vaughn, who has been with the Hunter family throughout the week.
``Even if this man never threw a baseball, the community would
still hold him in the same regard. He may be North Carolina's
favorite son, and it's not just because of his baseball career. It
has to do with his strength of character and the type of person he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter retired from baseball 20 years ago after winning five
World Series rings with the Oakland Athletics and New York Yankees.
After returning to Hertford to take up hunting and fishing on a
full-time basis, Hunter was once again thrust into the national
spotlight when he was diagnosed with ALS last November. Hunter used
his notoriety to start up the Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter ALS Foundation
to raise money to fight the illness.
</P>
<P>
   Since the inception of the foundation, Hunter has made numerous
public appearances to help raise money, including a trip back to
Oakland, Calif., in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunter said that nobody could imagine how much it meant to him
to go back to California and get the support he did,'' said
Harrell, who accompanied the Hunter family on the trip with her
husband, Thomas. ``It was just wonderful. The fans were so kind to
him. I can't describe how great it was. You would think as long as
he's been out of the game, people might not remember or know too
much about him. But there was this little girl in the stands with a
sign that said 'We love you Catfish.' It was so nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But while baseball fans across the country remember Hunter as
the long-haired Cy Young award winner with the bushy mustache, most
people in and around Hertford just talk about their friend Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a special person to achieve the things Jimmy did and
not let it get to their head,'' said Ed Nixon, a life-long friend
and former high school teammate of Hunter's. ``Jimmy never let what
he'd accomplished get to his head. He was always that same ol' farm
boy. He's a darn' fine man.''

   HAMPTONS-HITCHHIKERS (New York) _ In the last few years, I've
picked up nearly a dozen hitchhikers _ young and old, men and
women, and once even a member of the Maidstone Club in green golf
pants. But only, and exclusively, in the Hamptons. Summer
Hamptonites, liberated from their Manhattan cellblocks and
intoxicated by the small-town charm and impression of safety that
most resort towns exude, relax their guards. They leave alarm
systems off and the front-door key under the potted reindeer
topiary. And amid some of the country's most conspicuous affluence,
they sometimes hitchhike or pick up those who do. By Steve
Garbarino.

   LUXURY-PILLOWS (New York) _ In a triumph of specialization, the
Company Store has emitted a spinoff catalogue, the new 31-page
Pillow Source Book. It is mostly about bed pillows, and it is

   NITEOUT-SOUTAR (New York) _ Tuesday night was the latest episode
in the education of Mike Soutar, the new editor of Maxim magazine,
the skin-drenched monthly. The September issue, the first under
Soutar, is just out, with a cover of a scantily clad Pamela Lee (or
is that redundant?). Since its United States debut in 1997, Maxim
has become a fast favorite of adolescent American boys and the
adults who think like them. The magazines, known in their native
Britain as lad magazines, focus on the purported essentials to a
young man's life: sex, beer, sports and giggles. By Jesse McKinley.

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ In the desertlike conditions that have
befallen most Northeastern gardeners this year, it is gratifying to
see a few hardy specimens unfazed by heat and drought. One such is
the yucca plant that grows behind my mailbox post. It's no miracle
that the yucca is doing well. Yuccas are native to arid desert
regions in the Southwest and in Mexico, although a few species are
native to the Southeast, including mine, Yucca filamentosa. By Cass
Peterson.

   TEAMSTERS-FEDS (Washington) _ Ten years after federal officials
gained a strict supervisory role over the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters in an effort to rid it of mob control, the union's new
leadership is pushing hard to get the government out. The Teamsters
president, James P. Hoffa, who took office in March, has made
ending federal supervision his chief goal, insisting that the giant
union can run its own affairs now that the Mafia's hold on it has
been broken. By Steven Greenhouse.

   GAYS-MILITARY (Washington) _ The Pentagon today announced its
first major revision of guidelines for enforcement of its ``don't

   LA-SHOOTING-MENTAL (Seattle) _ The mental health system in
Washington state got a clear and extensive look at Buford Furrow in
the months before he is alleged to have opened fire on school
children in a Jewish Community Center and killed a postal worker in
Los Angeles. What the mental health experts saw was a man who twice
slashed his arms so deep they required stitches, drank alcohol
until he blacked out, and espoused a deep hatred for anyone who is
not white. Yet, despite lengthy evaluations at mental institutions
here, and no shortage of resources, Furrow was never ordered to
remain under state psychiatric care. Instead, after serving nearly
six months for attempting to stab two hospital attendants, he was
released to normal parole supervision and required to take
medication designed to control psychotic impulses. By Timothy Egan.

17-year career, announced her retirement yesterday in Heidelberg.

sign that L.L. Bean, the 87-year-old arbiter of what's what in
rugged outerwear, is kissing up to cosseted baby boomers in a big
way: the company's Maine Hunting Shoe, its first product and

<P>
   Just like us, computers find it tough to hear what's being said
in a noisy room. So computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh are teaching them to lip-read.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not you realize it, you're pretty good at
lip-reading, according to Alex Waibel, a computer scientist at CMU.
``When people are in a noisy environment they pay more attention to
the lips,'' he says. Lip-reading dramatically improves our
understanding of what people are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Waibel's new software, called NLips, is designed to reduce the
error rate of speech-recognition software in noisy environments.
For software that is, say, 92 percent successful when the
surroundings are quiet, the lip-reading only helps marginally, says
Waibel, improving successful recognition to about 93 percent. But
when there is a lot of background noise, the success rate of a
typical package drops to around 60 percent _ and NLips can bump
this up to about 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Like most speech-recognition systems, NLips breaks down speech
into discrete sound chunks, called phonemes, but crucially it also
combines information from lip movements. Computer-mounted cameras
record lip sequences, using tracking software to compensate for any
slight movements of the head.
</P>
<P>
   A neural network, which learns as it goes along, constantly
monitors lips in the video sequences looking for the 50 visual
equivalents of phonemes, or ``visemes'' as Waibel calls them. The
software crosschecks the output from the speech recognition program
against the visemes.
</P>
<P>
   NLips works so well because it combines different sorts of
perceptual information, both visual and audio, Waibel says. He
admits that the lip-reading software is hopeless on its own. Waibel
says his lab is ``looking at all these signals and capturing the
perceptual world in its entirety,'' just as humans do.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Waibel and his colleagues have only tested NLips for
spelling out words, letter by letter. But he is confident that
moving onto continuous speech should be straightforward, because
most speech recognition software finds this less of a challenge
than spelling. With so many letters sounding similar, ambiguity
causes a lot of spelling problems.
</P>
<P>
   Waibel is now working on incorporating NLips into a video
conferencing system that can automatically create transcripts of
what is said and by whom.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Strong, project manager for several speech-recognition
projects at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va.,
believes that it's only a matter of time before speech-recognition
software companies follow CMU's two-pronged approach.
</P>
<P>
   The next goal, he says, is to put voice recognition inside noisy
vehicles _ allowing you to give voice commands to your car, for
example _ but this has in the past been dogged by the unpredictable
nature of background vehicle noise. Recognition under these
conditions will be almost impossible unless the error rate can be
reduced _ perhaps by using a tiny camera to feed images to
lip-reading software. &QL;

 &HT;    Farming, not politics, on the minds of Iowans
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE CENTER, IOWA _ People here are talking about losing money
on a bumper corn crop _ the weather has been perfect and the green
stalks are eight feet high with golden, glowing crowns _ because
prices are so low.
</P>
<P>
   They're talking about the state fair in Des Moines, and the
possibility of another playoff run by the Trojans, their beloved
high school football team.
</P>
<P>
   But as nine Republican presidential candidates and about 500
reporters descend on nearby Ames for Saturday's GOP straw poll,
politics is one thing most people here aren't talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to where we take the phone off the hook so we can go
to bed,'' said Mike Riemenschneider, an active Republican who has
rebuffed three candidates' offers of free straw poll tickets.
</P>
<P>
   John Strawn, editor of the local Enterprise-Record, said he
should bill fax-crazy candidates for wasting his paper, and bank
President Joyce Buck wonders why the campaign season can't be
shortened.
</P>
<P>
   Riemenschneider describes the straw poll as ``overblown,'' and
he's right: The 20-year-old event, which has come to resemble a
political carnival, is basically a Republican party fund-raiser
masquerading as an election.
</P>
<P>
   This year's poll, which is expected to attract about 10,000
people, has taken on added significance _ at least in the eyes of
the candidates and the press. Because California and New York have
moved up their primaries, the campaign schedule is front-loaded
like never before, meaning that the nomination process will be over
almost before it begins.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has built such a large
early lead that the straw poll stakes have been raised for the
candidates who aren't even in the second tier. A poor showing in
Ames may prompt some of them to drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's straw poll, together with its February caucuses that
officially kick off the presidential campaign season, give the
Hawkeye State a significance beyond its relatively meager 7
electoral votes. The state also has tended to mirror the nation in
recent presidential elections. So it makes sense to pay attention
to Iowa, even at this early stage.
</P>
<P>
   State Center, ``The Rose Capital of Iowa'' has a population of
about 1,300. By Iowa standards that isn't so small: The town is the
site of a regional school that serves kids from surrounding farming
communities that are even smaller. State Center has no
manufacturing, and about half of the residents work in nearby
cities (Des Moines is 45 miles away).
</P>
<P>
   But State Center, which is surrounded on all sides by some of
the richest soil in the world, is and always has been about
farming.
</P>
<P>
   Talk here is about corn and soybean prices, which are at 25-year
lows. Last Thursday, corn was selling for $1.60 a bushel and
soybeans were at $4.30. To break even, farmers have to sell their
corn for about $2.50 and their soybeans for about $6.00. The
presidential candidates crisscrossing the state have touted various
solutions to the problem: opening foreign markets, emergency aid or
low-interest loans to farmers, promises to embrace embargoes that
include food.
</P>
<P>
   But when one asks State Center farmers what a president could do
to help them, many just shrug their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farm economy is so bad, people are kind of scratching
their heads,'' said Kevin Whitaker, who grows corn and soybeans and
raises hogs. Whitaker, 43, doubts that low-interest loans would do
more than ``prolong the agony'' and he balks at the prospect of
emergency assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to trim production, that's all there is to it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the emerging farm crisis, which would hit Iowa harder
than most states, it's difficult to pin down the top concern of
State Center residents.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping coffee and smoking a cigarette in the Main Street
hardware store _ a popular hang-out _ 61-year-old retiree Bob
Knutson pointed to people's frustration with HMOs as the top issue.
State Center's most prominent Democrat, 82-year-old Rita Figgins,
worries that changes to Social Security and Medicare will ``mess
them up.'' Pasta plant worker Dave Gray, bouncing his 5-year-old
son Walker on his lap, chose education. Jackie Henchal, a former
farm wife who became State Center's deputy city clerk when her
husband was forced to sell his land, wants stricter welfare rules.
</P>
<P>
   Many State Center residents, often mentioning last year's White
House sex scandal and recent school shootings, said the nation's
most pressing problem is a decline in morals. But they were
hard-pressed to say what exactly a president could do about it,
other than to avoid extramarital affairs himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think myself that kids watch too much crap on TV,'' downtown
restaurant owner Charlene ``Char'' Hrnicek said of violent
teen-agers. ``They watch blood, guts and sex on television, so what
do you expect? You don't like somebody, you get a gun out and shoot
them _ that's about where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Riemenschneider blamed modern parents for not disciplining their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's wrong with the United States? When I was a
kid, if I knocked my neighbor's window out, my parents would beat
the hell out of me. They made you pay for it, made you go over and
rake and mow the lady's yard all summer,'' Riemenschneider said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you raise a kid that age and not know he's making
grenades and bombs in the garage?'' he added, referring to the
teen-agers who went on a shooting spree in a Colorado school.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the comments of many other State Center residents, Buck,
the bank president, said Bush ``appears to have the morals that
should be required of a president and other elected officials.''
But she shook her head when asked what a president could do to
promote such high standards in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you legislate morality? How do you legislate ethics?''
</P>
<P>
   In their fuzzy concern about ethics and their scattered interest
in a variety of other issues, State Center residents are
representative of the rest of the country, if a recent survey is
accurate. A Gallup poll found that for the first time since 1954,
there isn't a single issue that more than one-fifth of Americans
agree is the most pressing one facing the country. Eighteen percent
of those surveyed said the most important problem was a decline in
ethics and morality, 17 percent said crime, 11 percent said
education and 10 percent said gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The results stand in stark contrast to 1980, for example, when
44 percent of respondents cited foreign policy, or 1975, when 60
percent chose the high cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   The especially early start to the 2000 campaign and the absence
of a single galvanizing issue have kept most State Center residents
from paying close attention to the political spectacle that is
shattering Iowa's summer calm. But some are already tied to
candidates _ some even by blood.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Andersen, a Web site designer and computer repairman who
recently opened a small shop on Main Street, says he shares a
great-grandfather with Vice President Al Gore. Andersen, who
publishes a monthly family newsletter that he dutifully forwards to
his Washington cousin, says he and Gore are both great-grandsons of
Henry Gore, a Virginia farmer who lived from 1736 to 1791.
</P>
<P>
   He's also been inviting the vice president to family reunions,
but Gore hadn't been able to make one and the two had never met _
until last Wednesday, when Andersen attended a Gore luncheon in
nearby Marshalltown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up (the next) morning I had to make sure I hadn't
been dreaming,'' Andersen beamed the day after his long-awaited
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Poling, who is a big backer of GOP candidate Steve Forbes,
also is linked to a famous world leader: Former Soviet premier
Nikita Khruschev. About 12 years ago, Poling answered an ad seeking
someone resembling Khruschev to appear in a film starring Richard
Gere. Poling got the job, playing a nonspeaking role in flashback
scenes of Khruschev's 1959 visit to Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Now Poling, a semi-retired financial adviser, is organizing
Forbes supporters for the straw poll. He's already recruited six
State Center residents and four from nearby Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not part of the inner circle, he's fresh blood and he
owes no debt to special interest groups,'' Poling said of Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Poling argues that the straw poll is an important test. ``It's
about the first indication of where people stand, the first measure
of how well the candidates are doing,'' he said. ``By the way,
Forbes has the best food going _ Holiday Park barbecue from Ames,
Iowa. Be prepared for the shock of your life.

   NEW YORK _ In the testosterone-laden air inside the Chelsea
Piers sports complex, Mike Soutar stood tall in the batting cage,
staring down a mechanical pitcher with a smirk on his face. The
pitch came, Soutar swung furiously _ and missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost, so close,'' Soutar said with his light Scottish brogue
and big smile. ``Next time, buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night was the latest episode in the education of Soutar,
the new editor of Maxim magazine, the skin-drenched monthly. The
September issue, the first under Soutar, is just out, with a cover
of a scantily clad Pamela Lee (or is that redundant?).
</P>
<P>
   Since its United States debut in 1997, Maxim has become a fast
favorite of adolescent American boys and the adults who think like
them. The magazines, known in their native Britain as lad
magazines, focus on the purported essentials to a young man's life:
sex, beer, sports and giggles.
</P>
<P>
   And while Soutar, who previously edited the London-based
magazine FHM, is known for having a working knowledge of all four,
he was out with a couple of colleagues last Tuesday night as part
of a continuing mission to sample lad life, American style.
</P>
<P>
   After a few dozen awkward swings and the oh-so-faint glistening
of sweat, Soutar, 32, retired to the Chelsea Brewery with his two
buddies, Andy Clerkson, the editor in chief of Stuff magazine, and
Keith Blanchard, the group creative director of Maxim and Stuff.
There the talk turned to typical Maxim fare: girls, ideas to
improve bullfighting (more bulls, less fighters) and food.
</P>
<P>
   The gang went on to the studiously hip Lot 61, which none of the
three had heard of but was suggested by the sole woman in the
group, Clerkson's wife, Carolyn. Once they were settled in a
zebra-pattern booth, beers were ordered and the menu skewered.
``What's a hacked duck?'' Soutar asked, sounding genuinely
concerned. ``And pray tell, what is arugula?'' (Pronounced, by
Soutar, are-RUG-ool-uh.)
</P>
<P>
   For all his roguish charm, Soutar is married with two young
boys, and Tuesday would be his last night as a pretend bachelor
after four months alone in New York. His weekend plans would
include dashing to London to bring his wife and children back to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited I can't sleep,'' he said. ``I had a cleaning
woman come in to make it look like I'd done the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A pu pu platter (there were jokes), shrimp, dumplings and hacked
duck came, and went, in a hurry. Smokes all around. Talk strayed to
the differences between Marlboro Lights in Britain and the United
States. And football _ British, that is.
</P>
<P>
   En route to Ace Bar, an East Village dive with an emphasis on
bar games, Soutar explained Maxim's appeal. ``Guys want one thing
at the end of the day, and it's not what you think,'' he said.
``Guys want to be the funniest guy in the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   At Ace Bar, more beers were downed as the clock snuck past 1
a.m. By then, the boys had guiltlessly reverted to British pub
antics. A few rounds of arrows and then a wager: three darts to hit
one bull's-eye.
</P>
<P>
   If Soutar hit it, Blanchard would declare his love to a
stranger. If Soutar lost, he would declare his love to Blanchard,
in a loud voice to the entire bar.
</P>
<P>
   Soutar stared down the dartboard, threw _ and hit. Bull's-eye.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, as Blanchard fulfilled his end of the bet _ to
the confused stranger _ Soutar stood giggling heartily at the bar
and toasting his friend. ``Right now,'' he said, ``he is the
funniest man here.''

THE $2,300 PILLOW AND THE MASS-MARKETING OF LUXURY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a triumph of specialization, the Company Store has
emitted a spinoff catalog, the new 31-page Pillow Source Book. It
is mostly about bed pillows, and it is absolutely riveting,
particularly when read in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Are you a feather-core or double-down kind of person? Silk or
buckwheat? Cotton or wool fill? (Hint: the silk one might prevent
wrinkles, according to the catalog.)
</P>
<P>
   Have you considered pillow densities _ firm, medium and soft?
What about quilted covers or gusseted edges? Are you a back or a
side sleeper? Do you want extras like a knee wedge or a body
pillow? Isn't life grand! Perhaps you are one of the lucky ones, a
new dot-com millionaire, and you're wondering what to spend your
overnight fortune on. Try the Legends eiderdown pillow: $2,300 for
a king-size model.
</P>
<P>
   Try two!
</P>
<P>
   The Company Store is proudly hawking its eiderdown pillow as a
limited-edition ``masterpiece,'' the ``world's most expensive
pillow.'' It's an irresistible come-on and an increasingly familiar
one, the lure of ultimate luxury just a phone call away.
</P>
<P>
   Newly minted high rollers used to study magazines like The Robb
Report for clues on how to spend their wealth, and then they had to
run a gantlet of snooty salesfolk on Rodeo Drive or Worth Avenue or
Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But now luxury is being mass-marketed. You can buy
cashmere-upholstered mattresses from Dial A Mattress, 16th-century
fountains on the Internet from Millionaire.com or crystal-studded
Wonderbras from Victoria's Secret. And a $2,300 pillow from my
favorite heretofore mid-price catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait, are you sure that's not a typo?'' said Dominique
Browning, the editor of House &AMP; Garden, when I told her about the
$2,300 pillow. I assured her it wasn't, and she said: ``Oh, my God,
I guess it's a labor thing, handpicked down or something. Clearly
the pillow is a luxury item, but at a certain point, I guess money
is just so meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browning has been thinking a lot about luxury, which she
defines as what happens when time burnishes a beloved object. The
September issue of her magazine is devoted to the subject. So are
two new books, ``Luxury Fever: Why Money Fails to Satisfy in an Age
of Excess'' by Robert H. Frank (Free Press), and ``Lead Us Into
Temptation: The Triumph of American Materialism'' by James B.
Twitchell (Columbia University Press).
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Twitchell duke it out over that old chestnut, Can
money buy happiness? Their conclusions: Absolutely, Twitchell says.
Heck no, Frank says.
</P>
<P>
   All this chatter is because two years after Alan Greenspan
wagged his finger and warned stock market investors against
``irrational exuberance,'' Americans are spending more wildly and
exuberantly than ever, in every (italics)market.(end italics) What
fun!
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. Spending is not just fun, ``it's
redemptive,'' Twitchell said in an interview. ``There is healing in
what all logic says is a totally ridiculous purchase.'' He
explained his theory that expensive purchases are a form of
therapeutic indulgence, in the medieval sense of the word:
indulgences were sold by the Roman Catholic Church ``to relieve the
sinner of part or all of a sin,'' Twitchell explained, adding,
``The price moved according to the naughtiness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the pillow is, I think,'' he continued. ``A
private compact with the self for indulgence. That it is over the
top is part of the allure. Not just `I'm worth it,' but `I deserve
it' and `They owe me big-time.'''
</P>
<P>
   With thoughts like these, I removed an eiderdown pillow from its
plastic wrapping, wondering why it didn't have a more impressive
package, like the felt bags you get with expensive shoes. The
Company Store had sent it to me as a loaner, strictly in the
interest of a scientific inquiry, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   The pillow's 435-thread-count silk cover was indeed lovely,
oyster-colored like the cover of an old down quilt. I gave the
thing a tentative poke. It squished in the normal manner and
recovered nicely. I don't know what I was expecting _ an aria,
maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has beautiful resilience,'' said David Pipkorn, the vice
president for manufacturing at the Company Store. He also told me
that eiderdown is extremely rare. Eider ducks are a protected
species, and their down is collected by hand from nests in Iceland
so as not to harm the ducks, Pipkorn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Company Store says that its Legends is the ``pillow of a
lifetime, and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Wondering how many other cheeks had lain on my pillow's smooth
surface, and worrying about a catastrophic and bizarre mishap
before I had to return it _ like an exploding coffee pot in the
kitchen that would seep, a la ``The Haunting,'' upstairs, I shoved
the pillow into two pillowcases. I took it nervously to bed,
feeling rather like a Russian mail-order bride.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was just a pillow. Nothing remarkable happened when I
laid my head down. In fact, it felt soft and squishy, which is not
my style at all in a pillow. I could not get to sleep and gave it
the heave-ho before even one night was through.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I would have done better with a choice from the pillow
menu guests receive at L'Ermitage, a new luxury business hotel in
Beverly Hills that offers latex temperature-sensitive pillows,
air-pump-able pillows and anatomically designed Tempur-Pedic
pillows, any of which can be purchased right at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guests told us they wanted versatility in their pillows,''
said Alison Brainard, the director of sales and marketing at
L'Ermitage. All of which suggests that real luxury, for most
people, is a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Pipkorn said his pillow was for someone who was looking for the
absolute best in everything, ``not just a sleep experience,'' and
that the Company Store had sold fewer than a dozen eiderdown
pillows since the Pillow Source Book hit mailboxes in June. The
company wouldn't say who bought them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clients would go for something like it,'' said Juan Pablo
Molyneux, an interior designer in New York who is fond of similar
rarities, opulent materials like travertine and lapis lazuli. But
he wouldn't say which clients.
</P>
<P>
   Molyneux, for one, thinks that no matter who you are, you can
say a lot with an eiderdown pillow. ``You know, like, `What is the
next step in life, now that I have this pillow?'''
</P>
<P>
   Probably a nap.

GARDEN COLUMN: THRIVING IN THE BIG DRY _ THE YUCCA AND FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Aug. 15)  
(th) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the desertlike conditions that have befallen most
Northeastern gardeners this year, it is gratifying to see a few
hardy specimens unfazed by heat and drought. One such is the yucca
plant that grows behind my mailbox post.
</P>
<P>
   It's no miracle that the yucca is doing well. Yuccas are native
to arid desert regions in the Southwest and in Mexico, although a
few species are native to the Southeast, including mine, Yucca
filamentosa. It has been in its element this year, throwing up
six-foot spikes of creamy bell-shaped flowers over sword-shaped
leaves that look like iris foliage from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   Up close, you can see the curly fibers that edge the leaves and
give the plant its common name, Adam's needle (the sharply pointed
leaf being the needle, threaded by the long fibers).
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the reassurance it offers that something is capable
of thriving in weather that has destroyed tender shrubs like
azaleas and wilted even tough specimens like forsythias, the yucca
gives comfort in another way: its seedpods are filled with
developing seeds, a sure sign that insects, too, are surviving the
long dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   Yuccas can be pollinated only by a certain species of moth. If
the seeds are developing in my Yucca filamentosa, I can be sure
that the yucca moth (Tegeticula yuccasella) will survive the Big
Dry.
</P>
<P>
   Yuccas are a fine example of what naturalists call mutualism: a
relationship between insect and plant that is beneficial to both.
In human terms, this is the ``you scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours'' phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Bees and other common pollinating insects are not attracted to
yucca plants, and wouldn't help much if they were. Yucca pollen is
heavy and sticky. Bees can't pick it up, and even a gale can't
budge it.
</P>
<P>
   But the female yucca moth is perfectly adapted to gather the
sticky pollen, roll it into a ball and stuff it into depressions in
the plant's stigma. When she's finished pollinating each flower,
she lays an egg in it. The developing seeds provide food for the
larva when it emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Without the yucca moth, yuccas could not produce seed, disperse
to other areas or adapt to changes in climate or soil conditions.
The plant produces offshoots at its base and can be propagated by
separating the shoots and planting them elsewhere, but the
offshoots are genetically identical to the parent. The plants also
can't expand yucca territory by more than a few inches without help
from humans, animals or the wind.
</P>
<P>
   As for the moth larva, it's eat yucca or die. There are no
alternative plant hosts. If all the yuccas were eradicated or died,
the moth population would die out in a single year. The moth may be
a finicky eater, but at least it had the good sense to choose an
extremely hardy host to provide its diet.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the relationship is evident. In the field beyond
my mailbox, a dozen or more yuccas have sprouted from seed and are
standing tall amid the parched grass, immigrants making themselves
at home as naturalized citizens. I see more wild yuccas every year,
growing in ditches and other untended spots, a natural consequence
of the plant's increasing popularity as an ornamental in local
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Yuccas spread rather slowly, and are not likely to become an
invasive pest as is the case with many other garden escapees. If
they did become more common in the wild, however, it might not be
such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Yuccas have a history of being useful. All have bundles of
fibrous cells that can be pulled out of the leaf blade and braided
into rope, like sisal, which is produced from a relative in the
Agave family. In some areas of the Southwest and Baja California,
yuccas are grown for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Yucca blossoms are edible raw, or may be boiled and served as a
vegetable. Indians roasted and ate the immature seedpods and ground
the mature pods and seeds into flour. The roots contain saponin, a
kind of natural soap, and have been used to make medicinal salves
as well.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not likely to roast yucca pods for dinner or lather up in
the shower with a yucca root, although it's reassuring to know that
I can. I'm content to enjoy the plant for its stately beauty and
ease of care.
</P>
<P>
   It's suited to dry spots in full sun. It can be grown from seed
or root cuttings, or be propagated from the offshoots.
</P>
<P>
   Yuccas are especially nice planted with miscanthus or other tall
ornamental grasses. In winter, the grass turns a pale silvery beige
and the yucca foliage darkens to deep olive, almost black. The
combination is striking.
</P>
<P>
   Like many native American plants, yucca is more appreciated
abroad than at home. Gertrude Jekyll admired it, and it is often
found in European gardens, especially in the form of refined garden
specimens of Y. filamentosa like Color Guard, whose foliage is a
beautifully variegated cream and green, or Blue Sword, whose leaves
have a bluish cast.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are no species of yucca moth native to
Europe, so if British or French gardeners want to propagate yucca
from seed, they must painstakingly hand-pollinate the plant, which
is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   I am, therefore, doubly pleased to see evidence that the yucca
moth thrives, even in a record dry spell.
</P>

   THIS WEEK: Division for Perennial Favorites &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By PATRICIA JONAS
</P>
<P>
   Perennial doesn't mean forever. Some favorite hot-colored
flowering plants must be propagated every three years for continued
vigor. Like other members of the iris family, Crocosmia Lucifer can
quickly form a congested clump and needs division when flowering
diminishes. The best time to divide is after flowering in mid- to
late summer, when foliage may need to be cut down because of spider
mite damage.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Kniphofia hybrids and Lobelia cardinalis, are best
divided in spring. Remove spent Kniphofia flower spikes, but cut
back foliage by no more than half.
</P>
<P>
   If Lobelia cardinalis flower stems are left to produce seed, new
plants will replace old ones. In summer, propagate by cutting
flowering stems straight across in two-inch lengths, just above a
leaf at top and below a leaf at bottom. Remove lowest leaves and
insert in a sterile rooting medium.

POINT OF VACATION TAKES A REST IN A TECHNOLOGICAL WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Spelling of `Aron' in 2nd graf is correct; spelling of
`Halttunen' in 5th graf is correct.) 
(yn) 
 By FELICIA R. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time the rich played when the mood struck, and
almost everyone else worked their farms and confined relaxation to
the Sabbath. Although August is now established as prime vacation
time, few Americans realize that their treasured paid vacation is a
fairly recent phenomenon. The very concept reflects ever-changing
American ideas about work, leisure and the markers of middle-class
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have vacations without a certain kind of class with
the resources and the time to take vacations,'' said Cindy S. Aron,
an associate professor of history at the University of Virginia.
``That doesn't really happen in the United States until the first
half of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular vacation owes its birth to such factors as the
changing nature of work and the rise of the railroad. Ms. Aron, the
author of ``Working at Play: A History of Vacations in the United
States'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), explained that as the
19th century drew to a close, more men became salaried employees in
the growing corporate world. Before then, most Americans were
farmers, artisans or self-employed in some capacity. Wealthy people
_ like the South Carolina planters who sailed up the coast to
Newport, R.I. _ went off to play; others ``went away'' primarily
for their health.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a culturally sanctioned, institutionalized break
from work made sense only as the nation was transformed from an
agricultural into an urban-industrial society _ with workers who
had benefits _ and a transportation network developed to move
people about. A new middle class with a few dollars in its pockets
and a taste for amusement allowed vacation places to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason scholars have gotten so interested in vacation is
because vacation says so much about work,'' said Karen Halttunen, a
professor of history at the University of California at Davis. She
says an increasingly frenzied consumer culture is blurring the
lines between work and leisure and changing the nature of
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vacations were born in the industrial revolution, when the
pressure of industry time discipline _ working by the clock _ meant
we started separating work from life,'' Ms. Halttunen said. People
started dividing life into ``after work,'' she said, and weekends,
vacation and retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think modern life has whittled away at all of those and has
ended the demarcation between work and life set up by the
industrial revolution,'' she said. Technology has helped obscure
the line with cellular telephones, fax machines, e-mail and the
Internet, which make people always available.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aron argues in her book that however captive to work people
may be while on vacation now, it originated as a benefit and then
became a marker of middle-class status. Thus, as an idea, it
changed from the prerogative of an elite in the early 19th century
to a mass phenomenon right before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The term vacation did not even enter the lexicon until the
middle of the last century as journalists, physicians and religious
leaders began to ponder the concept of leisure. They wrestled with
the Puritan notion that amusements were either inherently wanton or
fraught with the dangers of dissipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working at Play'' quotes The New Englander, a
Congregationalist publication, as saying in 1851: ``A recreation .
. . is something which recruits, restores and prepares the man for
better service and should be engaged in, always, with this end in
view.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ms. Aron writes, ``vacation resorts themselves
became sites of change _ creating environments in which vacationers
not only could enjoy new sorts of pleasures but could also
experiment with new, often less restricted rules of conduct and
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aron documents how roles for women were relaxed at resorts
where they engaged in sports previously reserved for men, swam in
scanty clothes and walked about freely. Married people engaged in
flirtations, and class distinctions were dropped as vacationers
donned the more democratic garb of leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, however, was not the only coin of the vacation realm.
The campgrounds, resorts and other playgrounds became segregated by
class, race and religion. Jews and blacks faced exclusion from many
vacation places and began to establish their own. The Catskills,
for example, began to attract large numbers of Jews. Blacks
established and began flocking to places like Oak Bluffs in
Martha's Vineyard and Idlewild, a resort in northern Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many stories the story of vacation can tell,''
Ms. Aron said. Americans get more paid vacations today than they
did a decade ago, but historians like Roy Rosenzweig, a professor
of history at George Mason University in Virginia, see a trend
toward more frequent but shorter vacations, with the cellular
telephone and the computer going along to stay in touch with the
office. Some historians say it betrays American anxiety about
working hard enough to do more, buy more and be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that Americans don't relax enough or have enough
fun is an old charge or a canard,'' counters Neil Harris, a
cultural historian who is a professor of history at the University
of Chicago. ``By the late 19th century there are psychologists
making the point that play is a good thing, that society is too
highly pressured.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several developments have altered the traditional vacation,
Harris said, like the use of television for entertainment; the rise
of the two-career family; the geographical dispersal of extended
families.
</P>
<P>
   Dual career families, obviously, mean that two date books have
to be consulted in scheduling time off. And because families are
far-flung, the family reunion often now means traveling somewhere
and getting together as a form of vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk about vacation as an instrument of leisure, how do
you fit in TV, which is a form of leisure, no matter how passive,''
Harris said. ``What time does TV replace? It may increase the
desire for more physically active vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halttunen says that how people fit technology like
television and the Internet into their lives reflects not so much
the influence of that technology as cultural and psychic needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is that we are an advanced consumer culture in
which people are chronically dissatisfied with what we have,'' she
said. ``So we work harder to get the wherewithal to make those
consumer purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The very concept of the career is getting more widespread,''
Ms. Halttunen continued. ``Once, doctors and lawyers had careers.
Now secretaries have careers and blue-collar workers have careers.
Secretaries take work home.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the vacation has become something that one buys,
Ms. Halttunen argues, and increasingly _ and paradoxically _ people
rely on it both to relax from the career conveyer belt and to
further their own or their children's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a work ethic run amok,'' Ms. Halttunen said. ``
You can't just sit on the the porch anymore.''

NATO CHIEF OUTLINES LINKS WITH KLA DURING KOSOVO WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 15)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO war planners and the Kosovo Liberation Army
coordinated during the Yugoslav war by communicating indirectly
through the Albanian government, according to NATO's top commander.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the American four-star Army general who heads
NATO, said the KLA information was used by NATO officers to help
plot bombing attacks on military targets.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's comments confirm the widely held perception that while
NATO never had its own ground troops in Kosovo during the war, KLA
ground forces were effectively acting as NATO surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA, which sought Kosovo's independence from Belgrade, was
comprised of ethnic Albanians who lived in Kosovo, a province of
Yugoslavia. The KLA was a demoralized force of about 3,000 troops
in March but grew to about 17,000 troops by June, according to U.S.
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received information from the Albanians and the Albanian
military about what was happening across the border in Kosovo. I
assume that came from the KLA,'' Clark said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any information we got from any source, we used,'' he said,
adding that KLA targeting intelligence had to go through the same
rigorous ``cross checks'' that other information about proposed
targets went through.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he set out four rules _ what he calls ``measures of
merit'' _ that guided NATO's target selection.
</P>
<P>
   First, NATO targeting specialists had to determine whether
attacking a target was too dangerous for NATO jets.
</P>
<P>
   Second, NATO had to decide whether destroying the target would
sufficiently damage Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Third, NATO had to take steps to assure that damage to civilians
was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, Clark wanted to assure that attacking the target would
not fray cohesion among the 19 NATO member nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said KLA officials didn't consult directly with allied
commanders during the war, which started March 24 when NATO bombed
Yugoslavia to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end
his ethnic cleansing campaign against the Kosovo's Albanian
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any direct communication with them, to the best
of my knowledge,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials are usually wary of any suggestions that the
alliance and the KLA worked closely during the 78-day bombing
campaign because NATO doesn't want to be perceived as having chosen
sides in a civil war. The alliance's official position is that it
doesn't support Kosovo's independence from Belgrade, as the KLA has
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Although there may not have been direct links between NATO and
the KLA, the alliance's operations directly benefited the KLA as it
waged a ground war against Yugoslav forces, while the KLA's ground
war buttressed the NATO air campaign and helped bring the conflict
to a close.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the punishing allied air campaign in March and
April against Yugoslav troops and facilities gave the KLA, battered
by a superior foe, time to regroup and rearm.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces had been attacking into Albania in pursuit of
KLA rebels but after NATO moved 5,000 U.S. troops armed with Apache
helicopters, tanks and artillery into Albania, Albania felt secure
in defending its border against Yugoslav incursions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That in turn enabled the KLA to mass and go on the offensive
at the end of May,'' said a senior alliance official, who asked to
remain anonymous. ``It completely changed the geo-strategic mindset
by putting those U.S. troops on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of May saw stepped up air attacks by NATO and a
resurgent KLA on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA was getting stronger with each passing day in May,''
Clark said. As NATO accelerated attacks against Yugoslav forces,
the KLA mounted an aggressive offensive.
</P>
<P>
   In these final weeks of the war, the KLA fought Yugoslav forces
to secure high ground in western Kosovo, while NATO functioned as
the de facto air force for the rebels. The relationship was in full
bloom by June when U.S. B-52 bombers attacked Yugoslav forces that
were mounting a counter-attack against the KLA.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Clark also said:
</P>
<P>
   _ The final tally of Yugoslav tanks, artillery pieces and
personnel carriers destroyed by NATO might not be as high as
anticipated. He said NATO is now completing the count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll find that we didn't hit everything we said. But
the short answer is that we hit enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Preventing ethnic Albanians from killing ethnic Serbs in
Kosovo is one of Clark's top priorities. ``No one should be
surprised that it's not possible to prevent all of these
incidents,'' he said. The rapid development of an indigenous police
force is essential, he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Milosevic ``has been cautioned in numerous ways and numerous
times to keep his hands off Montenegro,'' the pro-West Yugoslav
province that has angered Belgrade by pushing for greater
independence.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the months leading up to NATO's war in Kosovo, Clark dusted
off a paper on how to mount contingency operations that he has
written in 1975 as a young captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, I used that paper. I learned what I studied
and it was what I applied to fight this war,'' he said.

   Through Friday, a mere 0.83 inches of rain has fallen this
summer at Central Park in New York City. During the course of this
weekend, up to an inch or more of rain could fall in New York and
most of the Northeast as a slow-moving low pressure system draws
moist air inland from the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The day will dawn partly sunny with spotty showers from the
Appalachians to the Northeast and Middle Atlantic seaboards. As the
sun heats the sultry air over the region, ascending currents of
humid air will yield numerous thunderstorms. A few of these storms
may cause local flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, a cooler, steadier rain will dampen areas from
western Pennsylvania to central New York on Saturday morning.
Meanwhile, residual moisture in the lowest few thousand feet of the
atmosphere will cause low clouds to linger across the eastern Great
Lakes and Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A broken zone of thunderstorms will erupt ahead of a cold front
pushing southward toward the Gulf Coast and Carolinas on Saturday.
Farther south, Florida will have partial sunshine, though spotty
afternoon thunderstorms will form in the very humid air. Elsewhere
in the South, extreme heat will persist across Texas and Louisiana
where afternoon readings once again exceed 100 degrees in many
places.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and scattered showers will accompany a jet stream
disturbance crossing the Northwest on Saturday where temperatures
remain rather cool. Meanwhile, mainly sunny skies will embrace
California, though patchy morning clouds will be found near the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THINGS IN THE SKY
</P>
<P>
   Major meteor showers like Perseids that streak across the sky
around this time each year prompt calls to meteorologists seeking
explanations of the event. However, despite the misleading name,
meteorologists have no special expertise concerning the meteors
that illuminate the night sky. Astronomers are the scientists who
can lay claim to detailed knowledge of meteor showers. In
antiquity, when science was in its infancy, the fields of
meteorology and astronomy were more closely allied. Indeed, the
word meteorology has Greek roots and means the study of ``things in
the air.''

AS A RULE OF THUMB, THEY HITCH IN THE HAMPTONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVE GARBARINO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She didn't seem dangerous, with her tumbleweed of
bottle-blond hair and brown sarong. She had an overstuffed plastic
beach tote slung around one arm, the other arm extended out over
the road, its thumb signaling the need for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   I had nowhere particular to go. It was a sleepy Monday, and most
of my friends were toiling away in Manhattan. So I picked her up.
</P>
<P>
   Her name was Tanya, and she had the handsome hardness of Angie
Dickinson, roughly 40, a bridge worker's tan and a Tareyton 100
smoker's rasp. From somewhere on Long Island, not the ``phony''
Hamptons, as she referred to them, Tanya was heading for the free
Paul Simon concert at the Ranch field grounds in Montauk, hoping to
sell her attache case full of mood rings.
</P>
<P>
   I was considering an afternoon drink at Cyril's Fish House along
Montauk Highway. That would put her close enough to her
destination.
</P>
<P>
   I'd thumbed it myself in my teens, almost weekly during summers
at Rehoboth Beach, Del. (where I once was issued a $15 ticket for
doing so). In the last few years, I've picked up nearly a dozen
hitchhikers _ young and old, men and women, and once even a member
of the Maidstone Club in green golf pants. But only, and
exclusively, in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Summer Hamptonites, liberated from their Manhattan cellblocks
and intoxicated by the small-town charm and impression of safety
that most resort towns exude, relax their guards. They leave alarm
systems off and the front-door key under the potted reindeer
topiary.
</P>
<P>
   And amid some of the country's most conspicuous affluence, they
sometimes hitchhike or pick up those who do.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd. Spot the rare hitchhiker on an Interstate highway
anywhere else and a shiver goes down your back, like spotting a
chain gang chopping shoulder brush in the Deep South. See someone
hitching in the Hamptons, and well, it's almost quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be an illusion. ``It's an extremely dangerous thing to
do, because you don't know who's picking you up,'' said Glen
Stonemetz, Chief of Police for East Hampton Village. ``Not to
mention the fact that with the kind of drivers we have around here,
I wouldn't stand on the edge of the highway. I'd walk before I'd
hitchhike.''
</P>
<P>
   Call me reckless, but on a Friday this month I set out to
explore the state of Hamptons hitchhiking for myself. I wore beachy
casual wear, intending to look like a local: gray bell-bottom
sweatpants, a faded University of Madrid T-shirt and black
flip-flops. Here is the diary of my hitchhiker's odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   12:10 I park my car at Turtle Crossing in East Hampton, a
favorite local barbecue pit, and go inside for a fortifying glass
of water.
</P>
<P>
   12:14 I cross Montauk Highway, stand under the shade of blowing
trees and stretch my right arm out as if it were a divining rod
channeling a ride. At first it feels liberating, rebellious. Then
it feels just plain stupid. The temperature is in the high 70s,
with a light zephyr blowing: a perfect hitchhiking day.
</P>
<P>
   12:17 My first ride, and in only five minutes! Through the open
passenger window of a green Saab 900 with Pennsylvania plates, I
spy the man driving: a bit hefty, salt-and-pepper beard, roughly
50. From the looks of him, I'd say he was married with children and
was heading in his work clothes to do some touch-up on his teak
sailboat. I get in.
</P>
<P>
   12:19 ``I'm not going very far,'' the driver says. ``It's
somewhere along here. I'm buying this table that I'm going to
paint.'' We drive about a half mile. Pulling into the parking lot
of the Animal Rescue Fund Thrift Shop, next to the Spielberg
Nursery and Garden Shop, the driver apologizes, ``Sorry it was such
a short ride.'' I thank him and get out.
</P>
<P>
   12:24 Back on the blacktop, it's hotter, and there's more
traffic. The midweek pickup trucks and older cars driven by
year-round Hampton residents are giving way to the brand-new
Lincoln Navigators, Cadillacs and Mercedes-Benzes of weekend
people. I begin to play Count the Mercedeses. Seven so far.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   12:26 The rotating lawn sprinkler at Spielberg Nursery sprays me
in the face. Setting my backpack down, I spot a greenback floating
along the pavement. It's a $50 bill. Pocketing it, I continue my
walk east, confidence at a new high.
</P>
<P>
   12:27 Joggers and bicyclists seem repelled by me. I offer a
cheery ``Hey!'' to all. No one responds.
</P>
<P>
   12:30 Approaching town, I pass the sign reading ``Historic
Amagansett, Settled 1680.'' My powder-blue Nokia cell phone beeps
from my backpack. I talk to a friend, holding the phone with one
hand, thumbing with the other. Jeering at the only-in-the-Hamptons
sight of a hitchhiker talking on a cell phone, a BMW sedan with
four blond young people honks at me.
</P>
<P>
   12:35 Sixteen Mercedes-Benzes.
</P>
<P>
   12:40 Outside the Amagansett General Store, a couple in their
30s are packing beach gear and a cooler into a car trunk. The
woman, in a pink jumper, calls, ``How far you going?'' I tell her.
``Well, we're just going to the beach.'' I thank her all the same,
and move on.
</P>
<P>
   12:42 Walking between the Hampton Chutney Company and Peace and
Carrots, I spot wild raspberries growing on the roadside. They're
plump and ripe. I fall upon them.
</P>
<P>
   12:45 A patrol car is approaching. I keep my thumb raised.
Without incident, it cruises slowly by.
</P>
<P>
   12:48 I Lose count of the Mercedes-Benzes at 32 or so and start
counting drivers on cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   12:50 From the back of a passing flatbed, three children with
crew cuts, about 8 years old, shout obscenities at me in unison.
</P>
<P>
   1:02 Finally, outside Amagansett, a ride. The man behind the
wheel looks normal: sandy hair with a boyish Kennedy forelock,
early 40s, dressed in paint-spattered khaki shorts. I hop into his
Chevrolet sport utility vehicle. A furniture painter? I wonder,
until he starts talking about how cars are ``microenvironments.''
I'm in luck. He's going all the way to Montauk. I tell him I'm
heading to Cyril's, the roadside reggae shack.
</P>
<P>
   1:04 ``So, do you work at Cyril's?'' he asks. I break my cover
and tell him I'm writing about hitchhiking in the Hamptons. His
name is Bob Ficalora, he's 42 and has two children. He retired from
a desk job at IBM a few years ago, and now is an owner of Breakers,
a Montauk hotel. He explains his criteria for picking up
hitchhikers. ``I do a quick visual of them,'' he says. ``If they
look ratty or down and out, I don't mind. I pick up hitchhikers all
the time, girls, guys, locals, tourists. But if they look edgy, I
won't stop.'' He pauses. ``A working man, I'll pick up a working
man any day,'' he says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   1:20 Ficalora drops me at Cyril's, where I talk to the owner,
Cyril Fitzsimmons, an Irishman in a straw cowboy hat and sarong. He
says that his mostly Irish staff hitchhikes all the time. ``The
girls get picked up by the summer guys, who later come back to ask
them out on dates.''
</P>
<P>
   1:45 I am back on the asphalt, returning toward East Hampton,
the sun beating on me. There's no cover. Less traffic this way,
too.
</P>
<P>
   1:50 A Mazda RX-7 pulls over to the roadside. It's a guy with
short dark hair, in khaki shorts, about 35. He looks like the actor
Guy Pearce. Speaking with an Irish accent, he tells me he is Mark
Corr, a bartender at McKendry's in Amagansett, just a short walk
from Turtle Crossing. He agrees to take me all the way back to my
car. ``I've hitchhiked all over Europe,'' he says. ``And here, too.
You get a lift in the Hamptons quicker than it would take to take
the bus.''

IN MEXICO CITY, THE FAIRER SEX IS ARMED WITH TRAFFIC TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 15)   (EDs: Note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ On a busy intersection in this hurried capital of
impatient, fast drivers, women are stopping traffic.
</P>
<P>
   They also are taking names and writing tickets.
</P>
<P>
   They are the only ones doing so.
</P>
<P>
   In a drastic reversal of authority roles in this male-dominated
culture, Mexico City officials _ at a loss over what to do about
rampant, almost-institutionalized police corruption _ have banned
male police officers from giving out traffic tickets.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, the fairer sex is now also the more honest sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is proven scientifically and psychologically that women are
less likely to commit acts of corruption,'' said Raul Tovar, a
spokesman for the Mexico City Police Department. ``This is a
historic moment for our citizens, for all those who are committed
to the rescue of our city.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Police Chief Alejandro Gertz replaced 1,500
male traffic cops with 120 women officers who were dispatched to 30
strategic points in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The men's ticket pads were taken away and given to the women,
relegating the men to directing the perennially jammed traffic of
this metropolitan capital of 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the new measure has not been welcomed by all, both
male officers, and some drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are some of them displeased? Because it was a source of
extortion for them,'' Tovar said of some male officers. ``But this
has been well received by the citizenry. The common good is
justified.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is called ``mordida,'' as in bite, but better known
as a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   For a motorist, it is much cheaper and faster to pay mordida,
the equivalent of $5 or $10, than to pay traffic fines that start
at $25. For a police officer, who earns about $200 a month, it is
an additional source of income.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers, however, are often pulled over just to dispense cash
like roving teller machines. The city says it loses millions of
dollars that could otherwise go to improving services.
</P>
<P>
   At a horn-blaring thoroughfare where traffic comes from eight
sides, Solis Gonzalez M. de Jesus is all business in her crisp
brown police uniform. At a red light, she won't even let motorists
inch into the pedestrian lane, stepping onto the street with a
stern look on her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman is always more decided and more honest,'' said
Gonzalez, 24, a thick pad of tickets under her arm. ``My job is to
not accept extortions because it is a crime. That is why we get
paid. But there are many people who get distressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, many male officers complained the women give out
fewer tickets, and they said the entire male police force is
getting a bad rap because of the actions of a few bad apples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there is everything in the department,'' said
Luis Estrada Manny, one of the officers who can no longer write
tickets. ``We are paying for some of our colleagues who don't do
everything on the up and up.''
</P>
<P>
   But crime specialists say corruption is endemic in the police
force. In Mexico, traffic cops are a different entity from the
regular police force, and there are other branches as well _ city,
municipal, state, judicial and rural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apple is rotten to the core,'' said Rafael Ruiz Harrell, a
criminologist and university professor who also writes a column on
crime for the daily Reforma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are just as corruptible as men but to a lower degree.
They are not on the take as much as men,'' added Ruiz. ``And male
drivers have a more difficulty offering a bribe to a woman. I think
this has been an excellent measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Tovar said that since the new rules were put in force two weeks
ago, corruption has been reduced 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a better level of supervision and control,'' Tovar
said. ``Women have confidence, moral authority and a better work
habits. They show up for work, and they show up on time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The women are not alone giving out tickets. A virtual convoy of
reinforcements is on standby nearby, including a male police
supervisor, a city tow truck and several ``demoted'' male traffic
officers.
</P>
<P>
   In all, each female is bolstered by about 15 officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This operation is well controlled to see there are no acts of
corruption,'' said Rafael Torres, supervising the traffic operation
at a downtown corner. ``I feel good supporting the women. Some
drivers don't have good manners and are very aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Other male officers grumbled that they don't have a choice but
to accept the new rules and follow orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were fired or quit our jobs, we would not be able to get
another one,'' said one officer, who asked his name not be used for
fear or reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encounter prejudice and stigma everywhere. A prospective
employer says: `Oh, police. You are all corrupt. Goodbye.' It
doesn't matter what your experience and education are. Nobody wants
you,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Two nearby officers nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz, the police chief, is contemplating another radical change
to ensure tickets are paid: removing a vehicle's license plates
until the penalty is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The police department said that out of 1.6 million tickets given
out last year, only 10 percent were paid, a yearly loss estimated
at $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz, 60, was until recently the dean of the University of the
Americas and president of a non-government advisory council on
public security.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a citizen like anybody else. He doesn't belong to any
political party,'' Tovar said. ``He is an intellectual who was
worried about his community.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined the administration of Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, the first opposition leader of the capital, a year ago as
police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas is running for president in 2000, the year his mayoral
term is up, and with every changing administration, new rules and
new people are put in place.
</P>
<P>
   So there is uncertainty whether the female-only policy will
survive in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe by then we can generate a new consciousness in
society,'' Tovar said. ``A new culture committed together to
improve our city and our image.''

LAWMAKERS FIND PORK IN OCEAN WITH HUGE WATER BILL; NO JUSTICE; GONE
FISHING; HATE CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Before they cast off for their August recess,
lawmakers managed to land a whopper: a $4.3 billion bill that pays
for a host of water projects across the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the GOP tax-break legislation grabbed most of the
headlines as Congress rushed to adjourn, the House and Senate also
finished work on the Water Resources Development Act of 1999. That
bill, which was strongly supported by coastal communities and
development groups, authorizes a range of projects dealing with
beach nourishment, shore protection and navigation improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Sen. Connie Mack, a Republican, said the bill would help
to ensure that America's waterways, beaches and ``other national
treasures are protected, safe and navigable.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bill has drawn the ire of at least one environmental
group, which contends it encourages too much development along the
nation's coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coast does just fine without us,'' said Steve Ellis,
coastal program coordinator for the Coast Alliance in Washington.
Ellis said the bill is simply a grab-bag of goodies for communities
along lakes, beaches and rivers. He said it's unfair to ask
taxpayers to foot the bill for improvement projects that benefit a
relatively small population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anybody who would contest that it's a
big pork-barrel bill,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does, however, reduce the federal share of one aspect
of beach nourishment programs. Currently, Uncle Sam picks up 65
percent of the estimated 50-year maintenance costs of such
programs. The bill reduces that share to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups successfully fought another proposed
provision in the bill that would have increased the federal subsidy
for harbor deepening projects.
</P>
<P>
   NO JUSTICE?
</P>
<P>
   Congress may be in recess, but that doesn't mean partisan
squabbling has to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the White House and the Senate have been trading pot
shots lately over the number of vacancies on the federal bench.
President Clinton says the Republican-controlled Senate has been
slow to act on his nominees and is playing politics because of
disputes over ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they're acting responsibly, but the president
has been slow to name some nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Judiciary Committee has been pursuing its work in a
balanced and thorough manner,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican
who chairs that panel, said in a letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups are getting in on the act. People for the American
Way, a liberal-minded civil liberties group, is pressing the
committee to act quicker, noting that 21 vacancies have been
declared emergencies because they have remain unfilled for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans cannot get their day in court,'' complained Carole
Shields, president of that group.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are 67 vacancies on the federal bench; 50
nominations are pending.
</P>
<P>
   GONE FISHING
</P>
<P>
   As the representative for a tobacco-heavy district, Rep. Howard
Coble from North Carolina has long been a champion of that
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, boat designers may also have reason to sing his
praises.
</P>
<P>
   As the chairman of a House subcommittee that deals with
copyrights, Coble, a Republican, last year sponsored a bill to
protect the intellectual property of vessel hull designers. In a
recent ceremony at the Library of Congress, the hull design of a
bass fishing boat was registered with the federal government's
copyright office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first became aware of the problem of knock-off hull designs
through Hatteras Yachts which used to have a large facility in our
congressional district,'' said Coble, who suggested the knock-off
designs may not be as safe.
</P>
<P>
   HATE CRIMES
</P>
<P>
   Southern conservatives may soon find themselves in the middle of
an emerging debate: whether to expand federal hate-crimes laws.
</P>
<P>
   The recent shootings at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles
are focusing new attention on a bill that would do just that.
</P>
<P>
   While it's been endorsed by the White House, the Hate Crimes
Prevention Act is finding resistance from some Republicans who are
uneasy with a measure that would broaden hate-crimes laws to
include gender, disabilities and sexual orientation. The law
currently covers crimes committed on the basis of race, color,
religion or national origin.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say such legislation promotes unequal justice by
categorizing victims according to their background.
</P>
<P>
   The likely flash point for the debate will be the House
Judiciary Committee, which has already held one hearing on the
bill. Committee members include Republicans Charles Canady and Bill
McCollum of Florida, Howard Coble of North Carolina, Spencer Bachus
of Alabama, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

CHANDRA MANEUVER PAVES WAY FOR OBSERVATIONS, NASA SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The large door that admits radiance to NASA's recently launched
$1.55 billion Chandra X-ray telescope has opened, paving the way
for the first science observations later this month, the space
agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-foot long telescope was launched late last month by the
crew of the shuttle Columbia, whose skipper, Eileen Collins, became
the first woman spacecraft commander. The observatory was lofted
into space with the door closed, and the opening procedure carried
out Thursday was among the most critical of the post-launching
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-foot diameter door was designed to remain open
throughout the five-year mission of the telescope. Chandra is
circling the Earth once every 63.5 hours in an elliptical orbit
with high and low points of 86,487 miles and 5,999 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new X-ray telescope is in the midst of a 60-day
orbital checkout period, astronomers tentatively plan to make and
publicly discuss their first observations in late August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a ways to go, but we couldn't be happier with
the way this mission has gone so far,'' said Fred Wojtalik, NASA's
Chandra program manager.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra was designed to study the highest energy phenomena in
the universe, including black holes, stellar explosions and
galactic collisions. Like the Hubble Space Telescope and the
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, Chandra will help astronomers refine
their theories on the age and evolution of the universe.

ROBERT FRANK: AN ECONOMIST WHO WOULD REIN IN GALLUPING CONSUMPTION
WITH A TAX  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. _ On the bulletin board of Robert H. Frank's office
at Cornell University are two glossy photos.
</P>
<P>
   One is of a Porsche 911 Turbo, price $105,000. The other is of a
Patek Philippe Calibre '89 timepiece, price $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   They are not there as objects of lust, but they are not there
quite as objects of mere censorious academic disapproval either.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they symbolize the subject of Frank's work on the
psychology and utility of spending and the relative virtues of
public and private consumption. Indeed, Frank, whose newest book is
``Luxury Fever'' (Free Press, 1999), has become the popular
economist of the moment and academia's most conspicuous critic of
the dizzy spend-athon of the '90s. He argues that people are caught
in an arms race of consumption and that tax policies need to be
changed to encourage public investment over private spending.
</P>
<P>
   Frank's new-found celebrity _ he has become an opinion-page
regular of various newspapers and an ascendant talking head on
television _ has not come without criticism. Even some friendly
economists fault his work for being long on supposition and short
on data. And conservative economists say the government has no
business encouraging or discouraging people from buying luxury
goods they want.
</P>
<P>
   But even some who see his prescriptions as political nonstarters
concede that Frank has ventured into one of the most intriguing
thickets in economics and modern life: why people spend money, what
they spend it on, whether they spend it on the right things.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's smart for each individual may not make sense for the
group,'' said Frank, 54. ``It's very often smart for one, dumb for
all. It's my core idea. I've been pushing it for 25 years, but when
I wrote about it back in 1985, no one wanted to discuss it. I'm
glad people are listening now.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who has an undergraduate degree in mathematics, a masters
degree in statistics, and a doctorate in economics, has taken a
textbook route from cloistered academic to op-ed page regular and
talking head.
</P>
<P>
   His early books, like ``Choosing the Right Pond: Human Behavior
and the Quest for Status'' (Oxford University Press, 1985) focused
on rivalry and cooperation in economic and social behavior and were
written for a largely academic audience.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, Frank has emerged as a purveyer of
deceptively simple ideas that have skillfully tied economic issues
to broad social problems. In 1995, he and his co-author, Philip J.
Cook, published ``The Winner Take-All Society,'' which argued that
our economy and public life is being warped by a society
increasingly dominated by a few big winners and many losers.
Instead of thousands of privately owned coffee shops, there are now
thousands of Starbucks. Students, instead of happily going to their
local college, are funneled into a national sweepstakes in which
the lucky few get into Harvard. The outcome, they argue, is a
high-stress society that directs too many resources in the wrong
direction and generates wasteful spending patterns.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Luxury Fever: Why Money Fails to Satisfy in an Era of
Excess,'' Frank updates many of the ideas of ``Choosing the Right
Pond,'' to the Land Rover-stock options-Chateau Latour era. In the
earlier book, he examined the ways, as he saw it, in which ``people
come into the world equipped with an inner voice urging them to
rank as high as possible on whatever social hierarchy they belong
to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new one, he analyzes the boom in luxury spending, whether
for a $5,000 Viking-Frontgate Professional Grill, a $17,500 Patek
Philippe wristwatch, a $1,800-a-night suite at the Four Seasons
Resort in Palm Beach, Fla., or a $48,000 Lexus LX450 sport-utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   He argues, as he did in ``Choosing the Right Pond,'' that
spending choices have more to do with comparative values than
absolute ones. A 3,000-square-foot house that would be a palace in
Japan, for example, or even in 1970s America, no longer measures up
if your neighbor's house has 4,000 square feet. If competitors are
wearing $1,500 suits to job interviews, you need to do the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are other critics of consumption, many of them allied with
the notion of ``voluntary simplicity,'' which argues for
individuals to scale down their lives and demands.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unlike them, Frank contends that hyper-consumption can make
sense for individuals. If they want the best school district for
their child, it might make sense to buy an overpriced house in an
exclusive town. If others are driving enormous sport utilities
vehicles, people might not be safe in an economical,
environmentally friendly Honda Civic. Like a crowd of people at a
concert, who all decide to stand because the row in front of them
has done so, individual behavior _ standing at a concert, instead
of comfortably sitting _ can sometimes make sense if it is dictated
by group dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   The problems arise when the needs of the individual are contrary
to the needs of the group. The result of luxury fever, he argues,
is that individuals work too many hours and undergo too much
stress; that society neglects too many critical public needs,
ranging from better roads to cleaner air and water, at the expense
of often-frivolous private ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The left basically got it wrong from the beginning,'' said
Frank, who votes Democratic and is clearly closer to the left end
of the spectrum than the right. ``They said the market is bad
because the firms are too powerful and they take advantage of us.
They manipulate us through advertisements. They control the
political process. It's totally wrong. If there's something really
good out there, you'll buy it with or without advertising and if
there's a crumby thing, the ads can make you try it once, but you
won't come back. So corporations have an incentive to spend their
advertising dollars on things you are going to like.''
</P>
<P>
   The right, he said, gets it wrong by putting all its faith in
the wisdom of the market and the idea that individual demands give
the best outcomes for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, they do,'' he said. ``But often they don't. When
whatever I want has negative consequences for someone else, then
the invisible hand doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   To Frank, the solution does not lie in the good intentions of
the ``voluntary simplicity'' movement or the imposition of luxury
taxes on yachts or diamonds. Instead, he says, it lies in a
progressive tax on consumption _ not the conventional sales tax,
under which all purchasers pay the same thing, but a tax on total
spending, with rates increasing as spending increases. Consumption
would be calculated, essentially, by subtracting savings from
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The tax would act like boxing gloves or steroid bans, he said,
to keep the competition at a more sensible level by deterring
runaway spending on luxuries: the biggest houses and biggest boats
and costliest cars would tend to get smaller and less costly and
the restraints on spending would ripple down through society, just
as the luxury arms race now ripples up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I love stuff,'' said Frank, who has a Saab and BMW in
the garage of his 1911 Arts and Crafts-style house in Ithaca, N.Y.
``I like cars. I like food and wine. I buy rugs and lamps. You
can't change human nature. You can just change the rules of the
game. You don't eliminate the race. You just make it cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Many mainstream economists applaud the idea of a consumption
tax, and say the idea makes sense, however dim its political
prospects may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you don't use the argument Frank does about
consumption, it's an excellent way to encourage savings,'' said
Kenneth Arrow, a retired Stanford University economist and Nobel
laureate. And many liberal economists applaud Frank's ability to
put broad issues about consumption and public investment on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   To many free-market conservatives, however, Frank's scholarship
and newfound celebrity are equally suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin Rosen, an economist at the University of Chicago said
Frank's views on why people spend are based on supposition, not on
research. He said the government has no business telling people
what to spend money on, and the robust economy is eloquent
rejoinder to Frank's critique. And he argues that data showing an
alarmingly low savings rate fail to take into account the degree to
which a rising stock market has allowed people to accumulate wealth
in ways that savings figures do not measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should some guy in Ithaca be telling me what I should be
spending money on?'' he asked. ``How does he know why people spend?
He has no data, no proof. You can't have economic policy or
government involvement in the economy based on pure speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say an overall consumption tax is too crude an instrument,
one that would still allow people to spend on the most socially
harmful goods if they chose. Others said that a proposal, in
effect, to take resources from the rich and give them to the
government is the kind of solution only a liberal academic could
seriously propose at a time when politicians are battling over the
size of tax cuts. And conservatives argue that private spending is
more efficient than government spending, so a dollar taken from
consumption need not mean a dollar in services like better roads or
federal food inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Frank concedes that his argument can sound too simple,
particularly when he adds the seemingly contradictory kicker that
if people followed the incentives to save and invest rather than
spend, their extra earnings would allow them to spend even more
than they did earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the critics tend to give credit to Frank for being
onto something truly vexing and insufficiently examined in American
life at a time houses built in this country have doubled in size
since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hirshleifer, a retired University of California at Los
Angeles economist, reviewed ``Luxury Fever'' unfavorably in the
publication ``Reason.'' But he concluded: ``Still, I am inclined to
defend Frank in one important respect: as a moralist and a
Jeremiah. If our society is to remain at its barely civilized
level, from time to time we do need to be reproved for the
vulgarity of wasteful consumption, not to mention the in-your-face
boorishness currently recommended by ideologies of
self-assertiveness and self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank sees his work as scholarship, not moralizing. But he is
comfortable with the degree to which his work has taken economic
issues and raised overarching social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been natural for me to think of everything as an
economic question,'' he said. ``It's all choice. It's all scarcity.
You want to do more of one thing, you have to do less of another.
Money is just a unit of accounting to think about how much we care
about different things. I think one of the problems with economics
is that it has insisted on too narrow a model of human nature, too
impoverished a view of social interaction. You can't explain
everything as trying to squeeze our every ounce from the bottom
line.''

   TECHNO-FILE _ Over the last few weeks a war has been waged
between AOL and Microsoft over open access to instant messaging,
the technology that lets users shoot private messages directly to
other users that pop up on their screen. Instant Messaging may not
seem like a big deal, but the big companies are clashing for a
reason _ IM is merely a preview of things to come. (Gallaga, Austin
Amnerican-Statesman).

 By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jay-Z's latest release, ``Girls' Best Friend,'' is an
unusual love song: an ode not to a woman, but to the rapper's
diamonds. In the video, he dazzles the camera with his collection
of ice-blue bracelets, pendants and pinky rings. ``I took you outta
Jacob's in clusters/ Busters, they wanted to rush us/ Love the way
you sparkle when the sun touch ya,'' he raps.
</P>
<P>
   For those not in the know, Jacob _ Jacob Arabo, to be precise _
is the Harry Winston of the hip-hop world, the jeweler who gives
most of today's leading rappers their shine.
</P>
<P>
   His name has popped up in the lyrics of Mase, Foxy Brown and
Busta Rhymes. A 34-year-old immigrant from Tashkent, Uzbekistan,
Arabo now sips Champagne regularly with famed Hamptons party-givers
like Sean (Puffy) Combs and Russell Simmons and flies out to Las
Vegas with Jay-Z and Damon Dash to sit in the good seats at
heavyweight championship fights.
</P>
<P>
   His customized platinum and diamond creations gleam on album
covers like Slick Rick's ``Art of Storytelling'' and in the posters
for ``Forever,'' Puff Daddy's latest album, which hits stores on
Aug. 24. ``I love Jacob's jewelry,'' Combs said. ``All his work is
original.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arabo doesn't just design jewelry for glitzy photo shoots.
He does romantic pieces, as well. Last month when Pepa, of
Salt-n-Pepa, married Treach, of Naughty by Nature, the rap
superstars came to Arabo for matching diamond-and-platinum wedding
rings (her rock was 12 carats, his 6.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacob is the only one in the diamond district that really
caters to the style that rappers and urban minorities are digging
now,'' said Slick Rick, the British-born rapper, who recently taped
an episode of Black Entertainment Television's ``Rap City'' inside
Arabo's store. And what exactly is that style?
</P>
<P>
   Slick Rick laughed before answering, ``Slightly gaudy.''
</P>
<P>
   Understatement is not, after all, a hallmark of rap style.
``That platinum crucifix has 50 carats in diamonds,'' Arabo said,
gesturing to Combs on his ``Forever'' poster, which hangs
prominently on the store's wall. The bracelet has 170 carats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of custom work for P-Diddy,'' Arabo said, using a
variation of the artist's name reserved for close friends (and his
jeweler).
</P>
<P>
   Arabo then reached across his desk to one of his
works-in-progress. ``I'm making this ring right now for Wyclef
Jean,'' he said, holding out a platinum pinky ring the size of a
dreidel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center stone is a 13.84-carat princess-cut diamond, and
then there's another 10 carats of diamonds all the way around.''
While he would not disclose how much the ring cost, some of his
clients are less tight-lipped about price tags. ``Hundred-thou for
the bracelet,'' Jay-Z rapped in his hit ``Money Ain't a Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Arabo's store, Diamond Quasar, is a surprisingly modest counter
nestled inside the Kaplan Diamond Exchange on the Avenue of the
Americas and 47th Street. Asked how he feels about the
anti-Semitism that flares up occasionally in rap lyrics, Arabo, who
is Jewish, said: ``What, are you kidding me? They all say, `Jacob,
I want to marry a Jewish girl.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pasted along the walls are snapshots of Arabo posing with Jay-Z,
Ed Lover, Method Man, Busta Rhymes and other rap luminaries, as
well as with athletes like the heavyweight boxer Shannon Briggs and
Stephon Marbury, the New Jersey Nets guard, and pop stars like
Jennifer Lopez, N-Sync and the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the glittering photos is a small Hebrew prayer with
menorah on the wall, and a photo of Arabo with Angela, his wife and
business partner.
</P>
<P>
   With his jet-black hair slicked back in waves, Arabo has the
swarthy good looks and brusque manner of a 47th Street diamond
dealer as played by Robert De Niro. Sitting at his desk, leafing
through invoices, he barks gruffly in Russian peppered with hip-hop
slang. But when the stars show up his tone turns buttery.
</P>
<P>
   He lit up last Wednesday afternoon when Missy Elliott, dropped
in unexpectedly looking for something special to wear to the Source
magazine awards and a ``Tonight'' show appearance. Arabo had the
perfect ring in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 20-carat canary diamond,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a house payment,'' Ms. Elliott said, laughing. ``I'm
going to need a lot of security when I wear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elliott explained one of the reasons for Arabo's popularity
with the hip-hop crowd. ``A lot of people don't let you exchange
jewelry, but Jacob got the jewelry on the spot that you can get
right then and there. He's always willing to exchange, and that's
why I'm a loyal customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Arabo nodded. ``When they come back with their old piece of
jewelry that I sold them and say they paid $50,000 for it,'' he
said, ``I'll take it back in trade, as long as they upgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxy Brown, the nom-de-rap of Inga Marchand, another of Arabo's
frequent customers, said she liked the way Arabo brought her own
jewelry ideas to life. ``I design my stuff for him to make, and
other jewelers don't do that,'' she said. ``He made me my mother's
Christmas gift, a platinum broken heart with diamonds. She keeps
one half and I keep one half.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Damon Dash, Jay-Z's business partner and the chief executive of
Roc-a-Fella Records, said Arabo was shrewd enough to know that rap
egos require one-of-a-kind merchandise. ``We used to go to this
other jeweler, and he started duplicating our designs,'' he said.
``If Jay or myself had spent a lot of money on a ring or a
particular bracelet or chain, we would soon see somebody else with
the same thing on. When we found Jacob, he promised us he wouldn't
duplicate anything he made for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After emigrating from the Soviet Union, Arabo came to New York
in 1979 and began working in the diamond district when he was 16.
His first contact with the rap industry came 10 years ago, when Biz
Markee walked into his store.
</P>
<P>
   Other hip-hop clients like the late Notorious B.I.G. followed
suit. Arabo's rise has coincided with the rap world's current rage
for platinum. Gold chains were once a staple of hip-hop style, but
for today's rappers any jewelry with a yellow gleam is as played
out as a pair of two-year-old Nikes. (For recording artists there's
some symbolism in the distinction of precious metals: in music
business parlance, ``going platinum'' means selling a million
albums or more, while gold status indicates sales of 500,000.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For years I had been selling fine engagement rings in platinum
settings,'' Arabo said. ``I figured, `Why not start making men's
jewelry in platinum?''' Jay-Z helped spread the platinum gospel
throughout the rap world with lyrics like, ``Baby, I don't play/
All my jewelry is light gray.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvet Britto, who runs the Britto Agency, a public relations
company for sports and entertainment figures, said Arabo was
popular with celebrities because he provides them with a kind of
special attention rare among diamond district merchants. ``Jacob
delivers jewelry to you, he lends pieces, he custom makes for
you,'' Ms. Britto said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hip-hop taste is capricious, she noted, recalling how
five years ago another diamond district jeweler was on every
rapper's lips. ``Jacob's jewelry is the trend now, like Bentleys,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Arabo had a delicate problem: deciding
which of his high-profile clients would get the original
Swiss-movement timepiece he had designed, its thick platinum band
so chock-full of diamonds the watch weighed more than a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a couple of buyers for this, but I haven't decided who
to give it to,'' he said. ``Busta Rhymes wants it very bad, but I
don't want to give it to him. Why? Because when he goes onstage he
bangs everything around. He breaks a lot of jewelry, and this is
such a delicate watch, I have to sell it to the man who's just
going to wear it when he goes out.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is Marbury, the NBA star, who has became one of
Arabo's best customers. ``I've been coming the whole summer,''
Marbury said during a recent visit. ``I got my fiancee's ring, a
bracelet, necklace, two or three earrings. I've spent, like, $1
million with him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Marbury was examining a pinky ring Arabo was
designing, featuring a 22-carat, princess-cut center stone. Arabo
carefully unwrapped the giant specimen _ cut, like all Arabo's
diamonds, in Israel _ and set it on his desk to sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable if I tell you some of the things I've made
here,'' Arabo said, smiling. ``Diamond-and-platinum belly chains.
Diamond toe rings. Diamond anklets. For Usher, I made a diamond
handcuff, with over 100 carats of invisibly set diamonds.'' Arabo
added that he was currently working on his most unusual design: a
platinum and diamond eye-patch for Slick Rick.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I can afford it,'' the rapper confirmed over the
phone.

ON THE INTERNET, BALANCING THE FREE FLOW OF DATA AND PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a day when you get on the Web, and every time you check
a stock price, read an article or get a phone number, some hidden
cookie charges a fee to your credit card. Then imagine that you've
been running a nice business compiling a directory of services in
your area when suddenly your list appears on the Web, free.
</P>
<P>
   In more extreme terms, if the sum total of human knowledge
becomes instantly and universally accessible on the World Wide Web,
will every fact become private property, to be leased or sold? Or
will information become so cheap as to lose any value, eliminating
incentives for using it or adding to it?
</P>
<P>
   Doomsday scenarios, to be sure. But with the Web growing at a
rate that defies human and institutional experience, it is not
surprising that such fears have spread, and that both consumers and
purveyors of facts _ which includes almost everyone, really _ have
squared off over how and how much to regulate the proliferation of
raw and packaged knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   One such battle is currently being fought over two pending bills
in Congress. One is the Collection of Information Antipiracy Act,
introduced by Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C. The other is the Consumer
and Investors Access to Information Act, presented by Rep. Thomas
Bliley, R-Va. As the names imply, the bills approach the protection
of databases from fundamentally opposing sides. The antipiracy act
concentrates on specifying what cannot be done with a database or
the data in it, while the access bill emphasizes the argument that
facts themselves cannot be copyrighted.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, supporters of the bills have divided into
those who largely use data and those who largely sell it. Thus
research libraries, scientists, online brokerages and other
services that depend on digesting data are fervently lobbying for
the Bliley bill, while real estate agents, for example, are
lobbying for the Coble bill to protect their listings.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute that databases need protection in a medium
that can deliver the entire body of Western law to a home computer
in less time than it took for a medieval scribe to make one copy of
the Magna Carta. The problem is that existing means for protecting
intellectual property _ copyrights, trademarks, conventions,
professional ethics _ simply wilt before the sheer expanse of
information available on the Web and the associated potential for
huge profits, or huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   The very notions of ``intellectual property,'' ``information''
or ``database'' have taken on qualitatively new meanings when
translated into cyberspeak as ``content,'' just as the sins of
stealing, plagiarizing or extorting are transformed on the Internet
into ``content piracy'' or ``cybersquatting.'' If in the past
purveyors of data could expect to make some money simply by
packaging and delivering information _ whether by ticker tape,
books or CD-ROMs _ the Web has transferred value directly to
ownership of the data.
</P>
<P>
   One frequently cited example was the attempt by The New York
Times to prevent Amazon.com, the online booksellers, from posting
the Times best-seller list on its Web site. Though the list is
commonly posted in bookstores, The Times had an online partnership
with barnesandnoble.com, Amazon's chief competitor, and on the Web
the list gained a marketing force that it never had in the shops.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon countered by suing The Times. The case was settled on
Monday with an agreement that Amazon.com would continue to list the
best sellers only in alphabetical order and to publish the list
only when it became available to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   To John Barton, a professor of law at Stanford University, the
rush to claim ownership over databases is tantamount to a modern
land grab, with dangers for endeavors that traditionally build on
the work of others, like scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say I'm sympathetic to the plight of a movie
producer who sees the product distributed digitally without any
payment,'' said Barton. ``But we are reaching the point where we're
creating serious complications for the kind of data flow you need
for democracy and scientific inquiry to work. People are
commercializing everything and selling it. I'm worried that we are
going to patent facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of stronger intellectual property rights have
their own worries. Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee,
Terry McDermott, the chief executive officer of the National
Association of Realtors, argued that cyberpirates were stealing
real estate multiple listings and threatening the very basis of his
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Internet has become the battleground, the fears of
the realtors and others reach back to a Supreme Court decision in
1991 that had nothing to do with the Web. In Feist vs. Rural
Telephone, the court ruled that the publisher of a regional
telephone directory had the right to copy numbers from a local
directory because he was in effect adding value to an existing body
of fact. The decision challenged a venerable doctrine of copyright
law, which held that the ``sweat of the brow'' expended in
compiling a list, even if the information was in itself openly
available, entitled it to protection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what's really at stake, argues Jonathan Band, a lawyer who
represents the Online Banking Association, is money. He said there
are few cases in which companies have suffered seriously from
pirates or in which scientific research has been stymied. The
bottom line is that one of the oldest commodities on the market,
information, is suddenly in huge demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the piracy, or the fear that we'll lose the incentive
to invest in data,'' he said. ``It's that those who have
information can make a lot more money.''

LATINO ALT ROCK TOUR WORTH CHECKING OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Resending to correct spelling of rock en espanol sted
``roc'') 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Watcha, roughly translated, means ``check it out''
_ and that's exactly what audiences are doing as the inaugural
version of this edgy Latin-rock caravan tour rock 'n' rolls its way
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   People are finally discovering Latin rock is much more than
simply (ITAL STARTS)la vida loca.(ITAL ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   You've heard all about Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez and other
top-selling Hispanic-causing-panic performers riding the (ITAL
STARTS)mucho caliente(ITAL ENDS) Latin-pop craze all the way to the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   But another less well-known Latin musical world exists. And
while it may require a bit more effort to discover the experimental
sounds of Cafe Tacuba than to hear Lopez's current Top 10 smash,
``If You Had My Love,'' the universe of Latino alternative rock
just got closer.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point of the Watcha tour.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-date trek, produced by the organizers of the annual
hard-rock- and thrash-fueled Warped tour, accents a genre-bending
and quite varied lineup that includes Cafe Tacuba, Puya, Molotov,
Illya Kuryaki, Control Machete, Todos Tus Muertos, Fishbone, Los
Mocosos, Bersuit, Enanitos Verdes, Union 13, Chris Perez and Viva
Malpache.
</P>
<P>
   The high-energy roadshow hits the 6,000-seat Greek Theatre on
Sunday, following dates in Florida, Texas (four shows) and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the perfect time to unite the creativity of
(ITAL BEGINS)rock en espanol(ITAL ENDS) and Latin hip-hop with the
spirit of Warped,'' explains Kevin Lyman, co-founder and producer
of the sister tours. ``With the current success of Latin music, we
wanted to give exposure to the more underground sounds that
culturally diverse Latino and Anglo youth are embracing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, salsa, mambo, rumba and other Latin rhythms made
their mark on the American musical map long ago. After all, Gloria
Estefan, Celia Cruz, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Carlos Santana, Tito
Puente, Ritchie Valens, Los Lobos and Ruben Blades, among many
others, scored hits, pioneered new sounds and became household
names.
</P>
<P>
   But while the most successful of the new crop, such as Martin
and Lopez, are enjoying success with hits sung in English, another
bunch of bilingual Latin artists are mixing thrash, hard-rock and
hip-hop while aiming for the tattooed and teen-aged end of the
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic Watcha lineup ranges from the innovative Cafe
Tacuba to the Santana-inspired Afro-funk of Los Mocosos to the
bilingual power-pop of Perez, widower of slain Tejano superstar
Selena.
</P>
<P>
   It's as varied a bill as the Latin genre itself _ and the bands
know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tour is a brand name to identify different types of
music,'' said bassist Quique Rangel of Mexico City's Cafe Tacuba,
one of Watcha's best-known names. ``It gives people a chance to
experience the different visions of this music. In a place like
Mexico City at the end of the century, there isn't just one culture
but a lot of cultures existing together.''
</P>
<P>
   The band, whose arty new Warner Bros. release, ``Reves/Yo Soy''
(``Backwards/I Am''), is an all-instrumental sonic free-for-all
that recalls the Kronos Quartet alongside the ambient soundscapes
of Brian Eno, has received airplay on public-radio stations at the
same time that it's been favorably compared to Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our music is a response to the place where we live and the
times we live in,'' Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   A multicultural environment far from Mexico City but closer to
Los Angeles inspired the sprawling San Francisco outfit Los
Mocosos, a Latin-funk act also on Watcha who are somewhat similar
to Latin-tinged '70s funk acts like Malo. Los Mocosos includes
musicians from Santana, Tower of Power and Primus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area is a melting pot of cultures, and that's what
inspires us,'' says Los Mocosos leader Piero ``El Malo'' Ornelas.
``The thing about Latin music is it took awhile to reach the
average person, just like hip-hop did. Eighteen years ago, people
in the Midwest weren't listening to hip-hop. Today, they are.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But today, it's much easier to find records by
artists such as, for example, Cafe Tacuba, Puya and Ozomatli _ all
of whom are signed to major labels _ in out-of-the-way places. And
many of Watcha's diverse range of acts have been embraced by
college- and public-radio throughout this country.
</P>
<P>
   A tennis-shoe-wearing skateboard kid can just as easily pick up
the new effort by Mexico City's Mana on the WEA Latina label as
they can the new Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the new cross-cultural era Watcha hopes to capitalize
on. The tour came together when political fire-starters and Mexican
rap-rockers Molotov were invited to appear on the summer's Warped
tour. It soon became clear the time had arrived for a ``Latin
Warped,'' a multi-act Latin-based alt-rock summer festival, Lyman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect it to be financially successful,'' Lyman
admits. ``We're building a bridge to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   That bridge also leads to Puya, a Puerto Rico-bred quartet that
switches from a swinging Afro-Cuban pulse to metallic frenzy in the
space of a song. The band, signed to MCA Records, broke ground this
summer as part of the highly successful OzzFest '99 tour headlined
by Black Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our music used to be underground,'' said Puya bassist Harold
Hopkins Miranda. ``Now, there's lots of new people getting into it.
It's growing all the time because we're playing new places
everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, maybe, Puya and Cafe Tacuba might just be as widely
known as Martin and Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his experience on Watcha, Ornelas enthused about the
production crew, borrowed from Warped, who don't all speak Spanish
but have gone beyond the call of duty for the various acts on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've helped when cars have broken down or when some of the
younger musicians who've never been out on the road before needed
moral support,'' Ornelas said. ``Some of them have even had to use
sign language to communicate with the guys who don't speak English.
But the whole experience has been great. It's just been a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Watcha, of course, is just one of many (ITAL STARTS)rock en
espanol(ITAL ENDS) or Latin music events coming to Los Angeles in
this summer of Rickymania. Forthcoming dates at the Greek alone
include Marc Anthony, Los Lobos, and the Ritmo de Corazon '99 show
featuring Maldita Vecindad and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a three-act bill featuring Santana plus leading
Latin-rockers Mana and Los Angeles' own Ozomatli has sold out four
nights at the Anaheim Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize Watcha is a gamble,'' tour producer Lyman offers.
``But we're looking to the future. These bands are going to be the
next big commercial breakthrough in alternative rock. They say 12
percent of the population will be Latino by next year. This music
hits on two fronts _ it's good music and it reflects the
culture.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As fighting continued in southern Russia, Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin threatened Friday to launch airstrikes
against Islamic militants in the breakaway republic of Chechnya,
risking a widening of the seven-day-old conflict in a neighboring
region, Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Putin made his threat, a spokesman for the Chechen
government in Moscow was quoted on radio as saying that if Russia
attacks Chechnya, Chechen forces are ready to make ``Russian
helicopters drop from the sky like rain.''
</P>
<P>
   The tough line from Putin, who was named to his job by President
Boris Yeltsin on Monday, suggests that Moscow is ready to set aside
shaky hopes for an improvement in relations with Chechnya for a
military victory against a group of Chechnya-based Islamic
insurgents in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Chechen commandos crossed the mountainous border
into Dagestan and occupied several villages, setting off Russia's
worst crisis in the Caucasus region since the end of the 1994-1996
war against Chechnya. That war ended in a humiliating defeat for
Russian forces, and the de facto independence of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, various attempts have been made to normalize
Moscow's relations with Chechnya, which is technically still part
of the Russian Federation. But preparations for a meeting between
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov and Yeltsin have repeatedly
stalled, in part because of the continuous changes in the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov, a moderate separatist whose authority at home has
been undercut by militant Chechen field commanders and their
Islamic allies, has repeatedly warned Moscow not to drag Chechnya
into the Dagestan conflict. He has disclaimed any responsibility
for the raids launched into Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in the Siberian city of Tomsk, Putin told
reporters that the Russian military offensive in Dagestan was
progressing ``positively'' and that a final ``assault'' was under
way.
</P>
<P>
   As he took office early this week, Putin said that the military
campaign, conducted by troops from both the Defense and Interior
ministries, would be completed successfully within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday whether Russian forces would pursue the commandos
back to their bases in Chechnya, Putin, the former chief of
Russia's domestic intelligence agency, answered without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strikes will be delivered on the militants' bases,'' he said.
``Chechnya is Russian territory, and strikes will be delivered
wherever militants are located, Chechnya or no Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen reports that Russian forces had already crossed into the
republic _ on land as well as by air _ were denied Friday by the
Defense Ministry in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of seizing several villages in two regions along the
Chechen border inside Dagestan, an Islamic council, led by Shamil
Basayev, a Chechen militant regarded at home as a hero in the war
against Russia, declared Dagestan an independent Islamic state, and
vowed to drive all `'infidels'' out.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen separatists have long set unification with Dagestan _ a
province the size of Austria and home to more than 30 ethnic groups
_ as one of their goals, giving the landlocked Chechen republic a
gateway to the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Dagestani officials reported Friday that Russian
forces had driven the militants out of one region and captured a
rebel weapons depot. Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov, the commander of
Interior Ministry troops, said that the first phase of the
operation to clear rebels out of the Tsumadin area was over, and
that a new phase would begin in the Botlikh region, where the
insurgents are said to control seven out of some 30 villages, on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, Russian forces have occupied the main
town in the Botlikh district but are surrounded by heavily armed
rebel outposts on mountaintops. The newspaper Izvestia reported
Friday that the commandos might have drawn their opponents into a
trap, although NTV, Russia's largest independent television
channel, said Friday night that plans are ready to take out the
mountain strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   According to Izvestia, the press service for the Defense and
Interior ministries confirmed that four Russian helicopters had
been destroyed and an SU-24 fighter plane damaged in the fighting.
Four top military officers were wounded when their helicopter was
struck, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Dagestani authorities, who called in federal forces, have
distributed arms to local militias, but according to television
reports, the Dagestani volunteers have not been involved in the
fighting, which has mostly involved airstrikes and tank fire. Most
of the civilians in the contested villages either fled or were
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Casualty reports are conflicting, with the Russian government
claiming 200 rebels killed since the start of the fighting, and
Chechen reports saying that only five guerrillas have been killed
and 15 wounded. Moscow has confirmed 11 dead on its side, while a
spokesman for the insurgents said that 60 federal troops had been
killed. Federal reinforcements continued to arrive in Dagestan on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dagestani authorities, one of the wounded was a man
known as Khattab, a commando leader and an ally of Basayev believed
to have been born in Jordan, who has set up military training camps
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, the Finnish government, which now holds
the presidency of the European Union, expressed concern about the
escalation of the conflict and cautioned the Russian authorities
about using force.
</P>
<P>
   But it also condemned the ``occupation of villages by armed
groups'' and reaffirmed Russia's ``territorial integrity.''

   NEW YORK _ At a recent dinner party in Southampton, in a big
white house with a picket fence, the help couldn't keep up with the
orders thrown at them. The food was exquisite, lobster salad
followed by lamb; the house was picture perfect, decorated only a
year before. But the hostess, in a beige silk Bill Blass suit and
simple Harry Winston diamond earrings, had two faces. To her
high-powered guests _ Wall Street men and media moguls, and women
in linen and soft cotton _ she showed a radiant smile. ``It's so
nice to see you,'' she said to one dark-haired man as he arrived.
``Let's get Lee Ann to get you a drink.''

   But to the young serving woman in a black skirt and white apron,
she barked, ``Hurry it up.'' Minutes later, when the server was
drawn into conversation by a guest, the hostess bee-lined over and
scolded, ``I said, `Hurry it up.''' Pulling on her arm, she said,
``You're not to talk to the guests.''
</P>
<P>
   At the seated dinner, the hostess loudly upbraided another
server, one of the full-time staff of three, ``There aren't enough
water glasses on this table!'' As the woman retreated wordlessly to
the kitchen, the dozen guests looked away so as not to deepen her
embarrassment and theirs. The hostess, turning to the man on her
right, said, ``She's not very bright.''
</P>
<P>
   As the economic good times roll on and on, never before have so
many been able to employ so many others as servants. But a boom
market in domestic help is coinciding with a boom in boorish and
disrespectful behavior toward domestics, say maids and drivers on
Fifth and Park Avenues, nannies in Central Park, servers at parties
in the Hamptons, household employment agencies and chroniclers of
the social scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad behavior is epidemic,'' said David Patrick Columbia,
the editor in chief of Avenue, the magazine of Upper East Side
life, who circulates widely among the beau monde. ``There's a huge
amount of emotional and verbal abuse going on towards the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia is careful to keep an ear cocked to the servants who
otherwise go unnoticed in the city apartments and country homes of
some of the richest New Yorkers. He calls today's generation of
ladies and gentlemen of the house ``screamers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the hostess get up from dinner because the so-called
right fork isn't there, and they get into the kitchen and start
screaming at the staff,'' he said. ``Mind you, these are people who
didn't know what the right fork was until they married a person who
could afford the right fork.''
</P>
<P>
   On benches around the Central Park Boathouse, Upper East Side
nannies gather daily to trade stories about their employers. A
widely heard complaint is that children imitate the raised voices
and disrespect shown by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   A West Indian woman who works as a live-in nanny five days a
week on the Upper East Side said the family's young teen-age son
kicked her in the shins when she wouldn't make sandwiches for him
and his friends after school. She complained to the parents, but
they did nothing to the boy. ``His parents made believe they cared,
but they didn't,'' the woman said. ``They didn't punish him.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints by these workers _ who are almost always women, and
foreign born _ is wide ranging, and includes illegal abuses like
payment below minimum wage for six- and seven-day workweeks,
failure to pay taxes, and sexual harassment. Domestic workers
deprived of their legal rights have been championed in recent years
by a number of groups across the country, including the Workplace
Project in Hempstead, which helps immigrant maids sue employers in
small-claims court for back pay.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond such clear-cut abuses, however, there is a vast category
of mistreatment that is not illegal, but simply boorish _ rude and
demeaning. While it is rarely discussed by the dinner or house
guests at elegant Fifth Avenue apartments or in the Hamptons, it is
perhaps inevitable as more people who did not grow up with domestic
help are able to afford it but remain unclear on where to draw the
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come into money late in life or quickly, especially
women, don't know how to behave with subordinates and don't respect
them,'' said Nelson W. Aldrich Jr., the author of a 1988 memoir,
``Old Money: The Mythology of America's Upper Class'' (Alfred A.
Knopf), and a member of the extended Rockefeller family.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia agreed, citing employers who think any household chore,
even rinsing a dish, is beneath them. ``They go out of their way to
leave everything,'' he said. ``They let the food get stiff on the
plate. With a lot of these girls it's a measure of success to leave
the plates there overnight. The behavior is nouveau. Trophy wives
are always the worst _ girls who married wealthy men and never had
help before.''
</P>
<P>
   But this rudeness is hardly limited to women, or to those new to
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia noted: ``We live in an age that people in general that
work in stressful jobs in New York seriously lack the ability to
control themselves. People rage a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Scolding in front of guests is one of the most common
complaints. It humiliates the employee, and many employers seem to
think it adds power to their image. In fact, it often embarrasses
their guests.
</P>
<P>
   R. Couri Hay, a society columnist for Hamptons magazine,
recalled a seated dinner for 36 at an estate in Westchester County
when the hostess stopped the entire party because she thought the
table was not being cleared properly. She stood and, in front of
the table, chided her Hispanic maid for not knowing that she should
``serve left, clear right.'' The maid started shaking and dropped a
plate, a flowered antique, which caused the hostess to yell even
louder. The maid burst into tears and left the room. The hostess
apologized to her guests, rang her bell and had another maid come
out to clear.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, a number of men and women described by guests
as having made such outbursts said that competent household help is
scarce and that good people can demand huge salaries _ up to $2,000
a week _ and are quick to leave for a better offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this anyone's business how we treat our help?'' said
one hostess in New York and Southampton known for frequently
raising her voice and who spoke only on condition of anonymity
because she pays off the books. ``We pay them, and if they don't
like it, they can work somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carol Mack, a decorator known for her dinner parties in
Southampton, New York and Palm Beach, Fla. _ but not known for
mistreating staff _ offered an explanation for why some hostesses
are prone to raise voices and dress down employees publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often do you go to a party and they serve the lamb, and
the rice and vegetables comes a half an hour after?'' she said.
``The reality is, people don't listen. You think they understood
what you told them, and they go off and do what they want rather
than what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mack employees a cook, housekeeper, laundress and house
manager (for washing the car, changing light bulbs and stocking the
refrigerator). ``You're not dealing with a level of professionalism
that I think once existed,'' she said. ``People don't view domestic
help as a profession. Half of them do it as a summer job.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Greenhouse, a co-owner of the Pavillion Agency, which
has placed nannies and other domestics in the homes of wealthy New
Yorkers for 38 years, said the disrespect shown the help is worse
today than ever. Well-paid domestics _ who earn at least $500 after
taxes for a five-day week while living in, or $400 while living out
_ used to remain two to three years with a family. Now, many are
leaving after two months, citing poor treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He described, but would not name, a ``very high profile'' couple
who do not allow their help to eat the household food. ``They
insist that their leftovers be thrown in the garbage,'' he said.
``They do not want their help to eat their leftovers. Few people
last more than a few months with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nannies, he added, increasingly find rudeness, and worse, in
children. ``There are lots of incidents of biting and kicking and
verbal abuse,'' Greenhouse said. ``The older the children are, the
more drastic their tempers can be. I'm always hearing stories
involving children, teen-agers robbing money and jewelry from the
nanny, threats of physical violence.''
</P>
<P>
   A live-in nanny in her 30s from Hong Kong said the lady of the
house calls her stupid in front of the children. ``I'm taking care
of their children and I'm not treated like a human,'' she said.
``The children won't listen to their parents. They won't listen to
me. The parents maltreat us, the children follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Coco Myers, a co-author with Susan Carlton of ``The Nanny Book:
The Smart Parent's Guide to Hiring, Firing and Every Sticky
Situation in Between'' (St. Martin's Griffin, 1999), said that in
hundreds of interviews with nannies, the No. 1 complaint was lack
of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing we found made nannies leave more than
anything else _ not the money, not the hours, but the respect and
the lack of respect,'' she said. ``Employers don't think that they
have a life outside the family they are working for. We found that
once they feel the lack of respect, it's dispiriting. They
disengage.''
</P>
<P>
   Another day, at Carl Schurz Park, next to Gracie Mansion, Mina
Zayas, 29, sat with four friends, all domestics in some of the
wealthiest homes in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zayas said that when she first came to New York from
Paraguay in 1994, speaking no English and without a resident
alien's green card, she was hired as a live-in nanny by Muriel
Brandolini, a decorator who lives in a brownstone in the East 80s
with her banker husband.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brandolini asked Ms. Zayas for her passport. ``She wanted to
make a copy,'' Ms. Zayas said. But her employer held on to it. Ms.
Zayas said she was promised $300 for a five-day week, but when it
came to collect her pay, Ms. Brandolini only gave $200, complaining
that she didn't speak English. ``But she knew that in the
interview,'' Ms. Zayas said. The nanny job turned into housekeeping
as well, totaling seven days a week with no time off for the same
$200.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zayas said that Ms. Brandolini, whose interior designs have
appeared in Elle Decor magazine and whose fashion designs have been
featured in The New York Times and are sold at Barneys New York,
would take her to her Hamptons house on weekends, and she was
expected to work there full-time, too. When she said she wanted to
leave, she said Ms. Brandolini, still in possession of her
passport, would threaten to call immigration authorities. Finally,
Ms. Zayas had a friend intervene and she was able to quit, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brandolini, reached on a sailboat in the Greek islands last
week, said she did not remember Ms. Zayas, though she acknowledged
she has had many household workers in the last six years. Currently
she employs a housekeeper, a weekday nanny and a man who watches
the children on weekends. Two domestics who work for one of Ms.
Brandolini's relatives confirmed that Ms. Zayas had worked for her
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Ms. Zayas' specific charges of sub-minimum pay,
withholding a passport and threatening to call immigration agents,
she said, ``It's completely nonsense.'' She added: ``I take the
passport to make a photocopy, for security. I take their green card
and their Con Edison bill and take a Xerox and give it back. You
never know if these people live where they say they live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, at the end they get bitter,'' she said. ``They've
done something wrong and they ask for a raise. They break 10
dishes, you get mad and they talk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays if someone offers $50 more a week, they run,'' she
continued. ``There's no fidelity. It's rare to find that type of
people in help. They come to America to make money. It's hard to
find good help.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEPORT, Maine _ First came the indoor trout pond. Then there
was the barnlike addition devoted to children's clothes and
accessories. Now comes what is perhaps the ultimate sign that L.L.
Bean, the 87-year-old arbiter of what's what in rugged outerwear,
is going after cosseted baby boomers in a big way: the company's
Maine Hunting Shoe, its first product and essential icon, has been
revamped to make it more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in the boot are subtle to the naked eye. What was a
vulcanized, hand-formed rubber sole is now molded in a
machine-driven method that the company says saves money and results
in a lighter, warmer, better-fitting product. ``It may look the
same on the outside,'' declares the literature that accompanies the
new boot, which is still arrestingly utilitarian-looking, ``but
there's an inside story.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recent changes within the privately held company _ based,
as it has always been, here in this tourist mecca of outlet stores
and lobster shacks _ reflect an even bigger effort to recast the
venerable L.L. Bean into a more up-to-date mold.
</P>
<P>
   The company has added a new brand aimed at working women,
expanded its home-furnishings department and ``turned up the
volume'' on its children's line, as one executive put it. Even more
startling, Bean plans to develop a bigger retail presence _ once
unthinkable in a company that made its name in mail-order _ by
opening three to five full-scale stores along the Eastern Seaboard.
The first is scheduled to appear by next summer in a sprawling
suburban mall at Tysons Corner, Va., outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   All this is meant to counter plateauing sales at L.L. Bean,
which does not publish a financial statement but says it sold just
over $1 billion worth of gloves, parkas, kayaks, coffee tables,
boot-shaped chocolates, rifles, fly rods, lamps, duffle bags,
snowboards, men's dress shirts, dog beds, khakis, blazers, skirts,
pillow shams, knapsacks and bathing suits last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company witnessed enormous growth until recently. In 1967,
it had just under $5 million in sales. Lately, however, the
commercial environment has grown more complicated, with shifting
consumer tastes and the explosion of electronic commerce _ two
areas where Bean has been slow to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   Now the goal, says Leon A. Gorman, who has been Bean's president
for the last 32 years, is to increase sales at a double-digit rate
every year, to about $1.4 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman outlined the challenges facing the company in a lengthy
memo last year. Among his points was that the company's traditional
attitude toward profits _ that they would emerge naturally if
customers were treated well and stakeholders were well served _ had
to go. ``This attitude was naive, perhaps, on our part, although it
served us well for many years,'' Gorman told his staff. ``In
today's environment, however, we are going to have to focus much
more intently on profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Some see risks, however, in moving further into
bricks-and-mortar retailing. ``It's going to be intriguing to
watch, because often you find the folks who are successful with
catalogs are not successful with stores, and vice versa,'' said
Kenneth M. Gassmann, a retail analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co. in
Richmond. ``J. Peterman? We all know what happened there.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Peterman, whose catalogs were famously wordy and eccentric,
declared bankruptcy earlier this year after a high-speed expansion
into retail stores that didn't do well.
</P>
<P>
   But Bean executives, pointing to successful examples of
outdoor-oriented companies like Patagonia, a unit of Lost Arrow,
and REI that have expanded beyond mail order into retailing around
the country, insist that they have examined the issues carefully
and expect the concept of additional stores to work. While the
company has a handful of factory outlets in four states, and
through a partnership has a dozen or so boutiques in Japan, it says
its new, large stores will bring in many new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 1.5 million Bean customers within five miles of
Tysons Corners,'' said L.L. Bean's general manager for retail,
William P. Shea, an exuberant proponent of the retail concept, so
much so that Gorman, his boss, refers to it as ``Bill's baby.'' He
added: ``And that's before we arrive. Just wait till we arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea plans to move as many as 100 Bean employees to work in the
new store, ``to transfer the culture,'' as he put it.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman, a serene, athletic 63-year-old, is emblematic of the
old-school L.L. Bean, which his grandfather started in 1912.
Committed to as much domestic manufacturing as possible, especially
if it's located in Maine, he was pivotal in the effort to revamp
the Bean boot, whose rubber soles will be made by a small factory
near Lewiston, Maine (Another small factory made the old soles.) He
supports sturdy causes like the Nature Conservancy, the Boy Scouts
and the Maine chapter of the N.A.A.C.P.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he talks of brand loyalty like someone fresh
out of an M.B.A. program, citing the self-assessment and subsequent
reorganization the company went through last year as priming it
well for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the initiatives in motion now that will provide
substantial growth opportunities in the years ahead,'' Gorman says,
looking slightly embarrassed about the management-speak that has
invaded his vocabulary lately. Terms like ``brand management''
don't sound quite at home at a company that hacked its way out of
the wilderness, selling hunting gear and, when its thoughts turned
to domesticity, scratchy woolen blankets and chairs made from
snowshoes. ``I have to invent a new word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its cautious leanings, Bean set itself up for a
serious fall twice in the last two decades. First came its response
to ``The Official Preppy Handbook,'' a spoof of boarding-school
style, or lack thereof, published in 1980 that named Bean footwear
as part of the required wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman says now he wishes that distinction had passed the
company by. ``The women's apparel in particular got this frumpy
appellation,'' he said, calling it ``not really reflective of the
product line.'' The company geared up to handle an influx of
orders, which came and went, leaving Bean with excess capacity.
</P>
<P>
   More devastating was the company's blighted love affair with the
Japanese. In the late 1980s, the Japanese became heavy users of
Bean products, part of it a fashion trend, part of it stemming from
interest in the outdoors, and all of it helped along by the strong
yen. Sales to Japan built steadily, reaching 20 percent of the
company's overall business by 1995, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, the bottom dropped out of the Japanese
economy, taking most of Bean's sales to Japan with it. At the same
time, domestic sales were weak, and competition from longtime
rivals like Lands' End, which posted $1.4 billion in sales last
year, intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of the Internet. Bean had jumped on the
concept early, and its Web site was open for business by 1996. But
competitors roared by it, embracing improved technology that helped
consumers find their sizes, for example, while the Bean site
puttered along exactly the way it had started.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a very basic level, there are some things L.L. Bean really
needs to get on, including offering more sizing information and
more tools,'' said Evie Black Dykema, an analyst with Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``Overall, their site is very
thorough. It's basically their catalog, on line. But to realize
their full potential, they will need to expand their functionality
beyond what can be found in their catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   Other outdoor suppliers, like Lands' End and Recreational
Equipment Inc., or REI, have moved well beyond Bean's efforts in
cyberspace, she added. And other analysts were less charitable
about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really fell behind the pack by not picking up on
E-commerce soon enough and not being more aggressive with it,''
said Alan Mak, an analyst with Argus Research in New York. ``They
lacked the vision to see how powerful the Internet was as a retail
medium. And trying to play catch-up on the Internet is extremely
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem seems to have been the revolving door at
Bean's E-commerce division. Patricia Robles, the current executive
in charge, is the third person to hold the post in the last two
years. One recent departure was Tom Harden, an executive vice
president who left to work for an Internet mail-order gift company,
Send.com. But Ms. Robles insists that the company's revamped
Website, which is supposed to be available in October, will counter
all of the criticism by being as efficient, user-friendly and
up-to-date as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a company that's known to be conservative and traditional,
we really were out on the Web early,'' said Ms. Robles, whose
15-year career at Bean has included stints as a women's apparel
product manager and a manager of inventory control. ``The
disadvantages are that you put in early infrastructure and it
quickly becomes outdated. We did not move quickly to replace some
of the infrastructure, but we're doing that now.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's electronic commerce recently got improved status
within L.L. Bean, Ms. Robles said. ``We are really putting
significant resources into the Web,'' she said. The new site, she
explained, will include tips on where to go on outdoor excursions,
as well as what someone might need and how to order it from Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent addition is a brand called Freeport Studio, which
is supposed to appeal to working women with clothing that is
low-maintenance, relatively stylish and affordable. ``We're trying
to address the casualization of America,'' said Cindy Marshall, the
marketing executive for the line. ``We're certainly not
corporate.''
</P>
<P>
   The brand came out with its own catalog in January, and sales
are strong, Bean executives say. The line came about in response to
a letter from a longtime customer who bought other Bean products,
but pointed out that while they were useful on weekends, ``there
are only 52 weekends a year, and I need something to wear the rest
of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   She closed the letter by advising the company: ``Get with it.''

   RUSSIA-DAGESTAN (Moscow) _ As fighting continued in southern
Russia, the new prime minister threatens to launch air strikes
against Islamic militants in the breakaway republic of Chechnya,
risking a widening of the seven-day-old conflict in a neighboring
region, Dagestan. By Celestine Bohlen.

   TEAMSTERS-FEDS (Washington) _ Ten years after federal officials
gained a strict supervisory role over the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters in an effort to rid it of mob control, the union's new
leadership is pushing hard to get the government out. The Teamsters
president, James P. Hoffa, who took office in March, has made
ending federal supervision his chief goal, insisting that the giant
union can run its own affairs now that the Mafia's hold on it has
been broken. By Steven Greenhouse. 2,400 words.
</P>
<P>
   IOWA-CONSERVATIVES _ Beyond the big-money battle between Bush
and Forbes on the eve of the straw poll is a crucial grassroots
competition among Bauer, Buchanan, Quayle and others who want to
emerge as champion of the religious conservatives. They are all
trying to repeat Pat Robertson's surprise success here in 1988. By
Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   LA-SHOOTING-MENTAL (Seattle) _ The mental health system in
Washington state got a clear and extensive look at Buford Furrow in
the months before he is alleged to have opened fire on school
children in a Jewish Community Center and killed a postal worker in
Los Angeles. What the mental health experts saw was a man who twice
slashed his arms so deep they required stitches, drank alcohol
until he blacked out, and espoused a deep hatred for anyone who is
not white. Yet, despite lengthy evaluations at mental institutions
here, and no shortage of resources, Furrow was never ordered to
remain under state psychiatric care. Instead, after serving nearly
six months for attempting to stab two hospital attendants, he was
released to normal parole supervision and required to take
medication designed to control psychotic impulses. By Timothy Egan.

<P>
   ISRAEL-TEACH (Jerusalem) _ When the school year starts in a few
weeks Israeli textbooks, for the first time, will give the
Palestinian view of Israel's origin and will also for the first
time high schools will not teach history of Jews as completely
separate from history of other people. By Ethan Bronner. 1,900

   GAYS-MILITARY (Washington) _ The Pentagon announces its first
major revision of guidelines for enforcement of its ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy, but fails to satisfy gay rights advocates who
say that entrenched hostility toward homosexuals in uniform
continues to result in violent harassment, including last month's
brutal murder of a Army private in Kentucky. By Philip Shenon.

<P>
   TEN-GRAF-RETIRE (Undated) _ Germany's Steffi Graf, the
iconoclastic tennis dynamo whose perfectionist strivings and sonic
forehands carried her to 107 singles titles as well as a virtual
monopoly of the number one ranking at the extended peak of her
17-year career, announces her retirement in Heidelberg. Echoing
statements she made this year at the French Open and Wimbledon,
where she disclosed that her 1999 campaigns would be her last ever
at those slams, Graf, who in 1988 became the only player in history
to capture all four Grand Slam plus the Olympic gold medal,
confirmed that her nonpareil career was over, effective
immediately. By Robin Finn.

TEXAS MANUFACTURING MAGNATE CONSIDERS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A wealthy Big Bend rancher with strong ties to
Houston said he is contemplating an uphill race for Congress in a
GOP-held borderland district that extends more than 500 miles from
San Antonio to El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat John B. Poindexter, a manufacturing magnate, has an
office in Houston but resides in Presidio County, one of 29
counties in the 23rd Congressional District that is currently
represented by four-term U.S. Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Poindexter, who recently toured the congressional district from
end to end, said he was encouraged from his meetings with voters
and plans to announce his political intentions in October.
Candidate filing for all state and federal offices is open through
Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   If Poindexter seeks his party's nomination, he could face
several other Democrats in the March primary. Potential candidates
from San Antonio and Laredo have expressed interest in the
Democratic race. The emerging winner presumably would tangle with
Bonilla in the 2000 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, a television producer who has been a rising star in the
GOP since he took office in 1993, was on vacation this week and
unavailable for comment. A campaign spokesman in San Antonio could
not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla succeeded former Rep. Albert Bustamante, D-San Antonio,
in a district that was redrawn in the early 1990s to assure
continued election of Democrats. Yet, Bonilla, a staunch
conservative, defied conventional wisdom by cobbling together a
winning coalition of supporters that included disenchanted Hispanic
Democrats, city-dwellers, farmers, ranchers and oilmen.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic party officials have said that the 23rd Congressional
District still has enough Democrats to make Bonilla vulnerable,
especially if a well-funded candidate emerges to oppose him.
</P>
<P>
   Poindexter, with has never held elective office, owns the 25,000
acre Cibolo Creek Ranch between Presidio and Marfa. The former
frontier fortress, built in the 1850s, is now a dude ranch that has
enticed luminary guests including Mick Jagger and holds a spot on
the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Poindexter also owns J.B. Poindexter &AMP; Co., a privately held,
long-term investment partnership whose holdings include Morgan
Trailer Mfg. Co. and Truck Accessories Group, Inc. Revenues will be
about $425 million in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been encouraged to run, enough to undertake what was a
35-day tour through 29 counties, full time, every day, a very
rigorous tour,'' Poindexter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm contemplating the results of that. There really is nothing
more to say. It sounds so simple and superficial, but that's the
truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Poindexter also said it's premature to discuss how his policies
might differ with those of Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating insinuations that he lacks enduring ties to the
district _ he bought the ranch in 1990 _ Poindexter said, ``I've
never owned personal property anywhere in Texas but Presidio
County.''

 &HT;    Georgia company may soon turn out customized heart valves, using
stripped-down pig tissue and human cells
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In coolers shipped in cardboard boxes, the living tissues of
human heart valves, leg veins and knee tendons arrive at CryoLife
Inc., a spacious company in the shadow of Kennesaw Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Lab workers meticulously unwrap the bulky and bloody packages,
stripping and slicing tissue before bathing it in chemical
preservatives. The final product is stored _ still alive _ at minus
325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they do is process people parts,'' said Robin Young,
senior medical analyst for Stephens Inc., a Little Rock investment
firm that follows the publicly owned company. ``They were the
pioneer in this. And they continue to do it very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   CryoLife _ listed last fall by Forbes magazine as one of the
nation's ``Ten To Watch'' small companies _ has provided more than
35,000 heart valves for transplants since it was founded in 1984.
More than half of those valves are used for pediatric patients. The
company has also shipped more than 17,000 veins and almost 7,500
orthopedic parts _ such as Achilles' tendons and meniscus cartilage
_ for transplant.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the company is aggressively entering the fledgling
field of tissue engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly the stuff of science fiction, tissue engineering
involves the manipulation of biology to create and grow custom-made
parts for patients that would not be rejected by a recipient's
immune system and could last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, medicine repaired or replaced (human) parts by
using some piece of plastic or metal, which would allow a patient
to regain some function of some part of the body,'' said David Ku,
an expert in tissue engineering at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   But now, scientists are working to find other ways to repair or
replace parts of the body. And what researchers hope to find are
ways to merge engineering techniques with biology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implantable, living, biological devices will be the `norm' for
the new millennium and will replace all the synthetic implantable
devices,'' said Steven Anderson, CryoLife's president and CEO.
``Biochemistry and cell biology will be the technologies of the
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, CryoLife's newest product, SynerGraft _ a pig's
heart valve stripped of its cells and reseeded with human cells _
will be implanted in a human patient in Australia. If it takes, it
will be the first time a human has been successfully treated with a
heart valve partially grown in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the company might have discovered a Holy Grail of
medicine _ a way to provide millions of parts for patients without
needing human donors. No longer would patients have to depend on
the gift of strangers, or use metal or plastic parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would change everything,'' Young said. ``It would start a
revolution ... that would affect literally millions of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   An old theory revisited
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind these advances is not new.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a patient cuts his arm deeply and does nothing,
the gash will not heal properly for months. But if a surgeon
stitches the wound, the gash will heal much better and faster
because an outside structure _ the thread _ helps the patient's own
cells repair the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue engineering is based on the same principle _ with the
goal being to create biomechanical structures that ``allow the body
to heal itself,'' said Ku, a professor of mechanical engineering at
Georgia Tech. A secondary benefit is that the body's immune system
is unlikely to reject its own cells. Now, many patients must take
drugs to keep their bodies from rejecting donors' parts or
mechanical parts. And often, with mechanical parts, the body must
be forced to adapt to technology _ not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   CryoLife entered tissue engineering by experimenting with
something it already was familiar with _ heart valves. In 1991, its
scientists began stripping pig or ``porcine'' valves down to the
collagen, a group of proteins that form fibers and provide the
structural support for tissue. This, they believed, could provide
the scaffolding needed to attach and grow human cells onto the
valve.
</P>
<P>
   The company's researchers also improved upon SynerGraft's design
by splicing parts of several porcine valves and sewing them
together, forming a bigger and stronger valve. Researchers also put
in a sewing ring, a kind of hemline for surgeons who must suture
the valve into their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, they implanted customized pig valves populated with
sheep cells into sheep. The valves worked without the use of
immunosuppressant therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company, which has received $3.1 million in federal
funding for the valve research, is doing the first human implant in
Australia, which has different standards from those of the United
States for such experimental surgery. From there, it plans to
conduct international clinical trials. If all goes well, these
customized valves could be used in clinical trials next year in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   CryoLife has also produced another biological product, BioGlue
Surgical Adhesive, used to seal veins and wounds without the need
for sutures. BioGlue, a protein-based adhesive, is already used in
Europe and in select clinical trials in the United States. It could
be approved by the Food and Drug Administration as early as this
fall. BioGlue is a wonderful tool, doctors say, because it helps
them work against the clock when trying to repair severe vascular
or pulmonary problems.
</P>
<P>
   It could be particularly useful in surgery to fix a common
condition known as an aortic dissection, where the wall of a major
blood vessel splits in two. The surgery is almost always an
emergency and carries a high risk, said Dr. Steven Macheers, an
Atlanta cardiothoracic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   BioGlue, loaded in clear vials in what looks like a glue gun,
can be used to actually glue the walls of the artery back together,
he said. Its adhesive properties allow the glue to be used as a
sealant to prevent bleeding, a major complication in this type of
complex surgery. The seal holds for several years before the glue
disintegrates, after the tissue has healed.
</P>
<P>
   All of these innovations at CryoLife are possible because of its
successful core business of freezing and preserving tissue. It's a
business that has allowed the 420-employee company to post record
revenues for the first six months of the year for each of the past
seven years. Last year, it reported more than $60 million in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Parallels to hibernation
</P>
<P>
   The process for freezing for each type of tissue is different _
which is why Austin Powers and his mojo cannot be frozen in
suspended animation. At this point, there's no way to freeze an
entire body without killing millions of cells in different organs.
</P>
<P>
   Cryopreservation involves the removal of water from cells. The
water is then replaced with a chemical compound such as dimethyl
sulfoxide, or DMSO, which bathes the tissues in life-sustaining
salts and proteins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot different than a steak you get at a supermarket.
That tissue is dead when you freeze it and dead when you thaw it
out,'' said Albert Heacox, CryoLife's director of laboratory
operations. ``We have a process that cools down tissue and slows
down its physiological functions. It's sort of like when an animal
goes into hibernation.''
</P>
<P>
   The company receives donated tissue _ and has staff to prepare
it _ 24 hours a day. Typically, tissue and parts are harvested from
hospital patients minutes after death and rushed to CryoLife's
100,000-square-foot facility in coolers shipped by plane.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 hyperfiltered ``clean rooms'' designed to keep microbes to
a minimum, technicians strip, prepare and bathe the tissues before
they are stored in large stainless steel tanks filled with liquid
nitrogen. Right now, the company has about 4,400 heart valves,
2,900 orthopedic parts and 2,500 veins frozen and ready for use.
The tissue can stay in the tanks for up to a decade until it's
needed.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain and supply tissues for surgery, the company relies on
a network of almost 300 tissue banks nationwide. CryoLife typically
receives $7,000 for heart valves it processes, $4,000 for veins and
a few thousand for other parts. Its gross profit margin, on
average, is about 10 percent. And it charges the processing fee at
the back end _ when a recipient needs the part _ not at the front
end of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a positive relationship,'' said Jeff Al-Mashat,
spokesman for LifeLink of Georgia, a local organ procurement
agency. LifeLink has used leg veins from CryoLife for about a year,
although it has its own tissue processing center in Florida for
other parts.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage for organ procurement agencies is that they retain
control of parts they gathered and can call the company to reclaim
those parts as needed.
</P>
<P>
   CryoLife's main focus is on heart valves _ still constituting 43
percent of the company's total revenue. The heart valves are
particularly useful in the treatment of children born with
congenital heart defects. Today, children can be fitted with a
human valve within eight hours of the surgeon's request for one.
And that means they are able to recover and live a normal life
quickly. In CryoLife's headquarters, posters of ``CryoKids'' line
the walls, all bordered with the slogan, ``Every child deserves the
chance to be a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The valves also work well in adults, although fewer surgeons are
as familiar with them as mechanical heart valves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did the (heart) valve from CryoLife save my life, it
saved my dreams,'' said Phil Lanzatella of Sycamore, Pa., who is
vying to compete in heavyweight wrestling in the 2000 Olympics.
``This is allowing me to live life to the fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two years ago, Lanzatella was getting ready to leave
for Sweden for a competition. His wife, Melody, gave him a goodbye
hug, but as she rested her head on his chest, she heard ``a
horrible sound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like an old washing machine creaking,'' she said.
``It startled me, it was so loud. I knew something was terribly
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologists later discovered he needed open heart surgery
because of a large hole in his valve. The world-class wrestler was
given three options: Surgeons could implant a pig's valve,
mechanical valve or a human donor's valve. He decided to go with a
human valve, although the surgery is trickier and there is a chance
it will wear out in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Lanzatella is thrilled with his human valve _ and
has just been given the OK to wrestle again in pursuit of Olympic
gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what CryoLife is doing,'' he said. ``They've
given my life back.''

 &HT;    Cameron Alexander _ a force in the religious life of the city
and of the nation _ takes the quiet way, pastors `the least of
these.' Now he'll be publicly honored.
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the funeral of an up-and-coming Atlanta minister six years
ago, now-Mayor Bill Campbell accidentally offended the Rev. Cameron
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a mayoral candidate at the time, delivered a eulogy
characterizing the death of 22-year-old Aric Flemming, killed in a
car accident, as a ``mistake.'' A hush fell over the crowd of
7,000, mostly Baptists who generally believe that God is
all-knowing and all-wise.
</P>
<P>
   Two pastors speaking after Campbell said nothing about his
remarks. But Alexander, pastor of Antioch Baptist Church North,
couldn't ignore the comment.
</P>
<P>
   When it was his turn in the pulpit, Alexander said God never
made mistakes and wasn't running for office. The crowd erupted in
applause and ``Amens.''
</P>
<P>
   Few preachers would offer such a rebuke at a public forum, but
Alexander, 66, has long gone his own way.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the line between entertainer and preacher has
become perilously thin, Alexander has quietly built a 9,000-member
megachurch in Atlanta's inner city by defying conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   He passed up a chance to move his church into the suburbs and
kept it in one of Atlanta's toughest neighborhoods. He doesn't
write books or sell tapes to promote his ministry. And his distaste
for the spotlight is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Alexander takes center stage today, when he will be
honored for three decades of service at Antioch during a luncheon
at the Georgia World Congress Center, with proceeds benefiting
church ministries. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who calls Alexander his
mentor, will be the main speaker at the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is one of the most powerful black Baptist leaders in
the nation. He's the head of a group that presides over 800 Baptist
churches in Georgia and a member of the board of directors for the
National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc., the nation's largest body
of black churches.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta City Council President Robb Pitts calls Alexander a
``quiet power broker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only a spiritual leader, but he also provides
tremendous support for elected officials,'' Pitts said. ``I don't
think a major decision is made, particularly where there's
controversy, in which his opinion is not sought.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Alexander disdains public displays of his influence,
canceling television interviews at the last moment and, when
possible, remaining behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   And he remains fearless in standing up for what he believes. He
still refuses, for instance, to allow women to preach at his church
because he doesn't believe the Bible supports the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't leverage his power for political or personal
gain,'' said the Rev. Fred Robinson, an associate minister at
Antioch.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander thinks self-promotion interferes with his duties as a
pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always seen myself as a local pastor,'' he said. ``That
means visiting the sick. If they're in the hospital, three or four
weeks, you're there. It means burying the dead, being there before
and after. It means paying the rent, going to their school. It
means being on duty every day, all day and all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a native of Atlanta, is a graduate of Morehouse
College. He has been a pastor for 47 years, leading three churches
in rural Georgia before coming to Antioch in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   He has been married for almost as long as he's preached _ 45
years _ to Barbara Jackson Alexander. They have three sons and a
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Antioch is one of a handful of Atlanta megachurches that remain
in the city. About 12 years ago, a study commissioned by the church
suggested that it move from its Northside Drive location because
the area was crime-infested, transient, and there was little room
for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said he decided to ignore the study after receiving a
revelation from God. Instead of relocating, he created ministries
to reach the needy in his community _ the homeless, drug addicts
and people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``A church should be there to serve the least of these,'' he
said, ``the hungry, the alcoholics, the addicts _ a hospital needs
to be where people are sick.''
</P>
<P>
   And Alexander has been able to accomplish such deeds because
he's been free of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one does not stay plugged in spiritually, one can drift and
use one skill more than all the other skills,'' Alexander said.
``If you're good at getting money or you're good at people skills _
you're charismatic _ it's easy to do something with those skills
for yourself rather than for the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Aaron Parker, an authority on the Baptist church, said
Alexander has survived in one pulpit for 30 years because he has
kept his focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's lasted because he serves,'' said Parker, pastor of Zion
Hill Baptist Church in Atlanta. ``He directs the attention of the
church toward serving the community as opposed to serving itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said he has no plans to change his low-key leadership
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather fill people up with the inspiration that comes from
a life with God than fill up any arena,'' he said. ``Success in the
Lord has nothing to do with quantity but quality. If you can fill
up one person, and they can go home and change their place, and the
house next to where they live and the jobs where they're working,
then you're being successful.''

 &HT;    An exhibit of the Atlanta artist Allcott _ who won a cult
following with his bright colors and self-promotion _ turns into a
celebration for family and friends
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 15.

<P>
   (Before his untimely death, legally blind painter Gene Allcott
developed a cult celebrity
</P>
<P>
   in Atlanta, unbeknown to his family. Seven years later, an
exhibit celebrates his artistry.)
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Gene Allcott had any limitations, he couldn't see
them. Or he painted over them. Or he covered them up with the sheer
energy of his personality.
</P>
<P>
   Nearsighted to the point of being legally blind, with a quick
wit and an even quicker brush, Allcott was a self-employed Atlanta
artist who won a cult following with his particular brand of
indefatigable goofiness and shrewd salesmanship. The ultimate
cocktail party artist, Allcott never had a day job, never left home
without a business card, never met a face he couldn't paint and
never missed an opportunity to insinuate himself into a
conversation, a living room or a gallery show.
</P>
<P>
   So when he died in 1992, at age 38, after accidentally tumbling
off a truck while helping friends move, his mother and siblings
were shocked to discover that he had become a local celebrity.
Nearly 400 mourners showed up for the funeral at H.M. Patterson &AMP;
Son's Oglethorpe Hill mortuary, ensuring that Allcott's passing was
as full of laughter as his life. ``I enjoyed myself tremendously
even though I was totally devastated,'' says his widow, Mary Alice
Allcott, who married the artist on Valentine's Day 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Atlanta College of Art, where Allcott graduated in 1977,
has staged a retrospective that is turning into a homecoming for
his family, friends and the ACA students who have benefited from
the scholarships and class trips established by his survivors. To
go with the
</P>
<P>
   32 paintings, drawings, prints, cutouts and furniture, the
college has put together a color brochure with a collection of
</P>
<P>
   stories and reminiscences by Allcott acquaintances. Allcott's
sister, Liz Sharp of Homer, N.Y., jokes that someone should turn
her brother's life into a television series.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hollywood screenwriters and chroniclers of Southern
peculiarities would be hard-pressed to find a more colorful hero
than Allcott, who alternated between being out of control and
saintly, charismatic and kooky. Weighing in at all of 2 pounds, 14
ounces at birth, he developed a horrible case of nearsightedness as
a result of getting too much oxygen in the incubator. But his
parents _ particularly his father, a University of North Carolina
art professor _ encouraged Allcott to draw, even though the boy was
so rambunctious that they had to fashion a little harness to keep
his glasses on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he couldn't hit a baseball didn't keep him from
being a very enthusiastic batboy,'' says curator Libby Mohr, the
ACA's director of special events, pointing to Allcott's signature
self-portrait of a young, bespectacled boy holding a bat. Allcott
attended the California Institute of the Arts in the early '70s and
later transferred to the Atlanta college.
</P>
<P>
   Gene-isms
</P>
<P>
   Soon, his brightly colored portraits _ a man holding a giant
martini, a girlfriend with her fat legs sprawled in the air _
caught on among a well-monied clientele that was charmed by the
disarming simplicity and beaming smiles of those silly faces.
Everybody wanted an Allcott.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the always tongue-in-cheek artist titled a solo
exhibition, ``Everybody's Talking About the New Work of Gene
Allcott.'' Seven years after his death, everybody still is.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the memorial service,'' Mohr remembers, ``people would
laugh before the speakers even told the story or anecdote. This
sweet little girl stood up and said, `I was one of Gene's best
friends. I rode MARTA with him.' And people just laughed before she
could tell the story. He used to give her advice to the lovelorn
and helped her when she was nervous about a job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Allcott called his MARTA bus driver his ``chauffeur.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after he graduated from the college, he remained a campus
fixture, a fund-raiser, a friend and role model. Encouraging
college maintenance worker Ernest Norwood to make art, Allcott gave
him paints and supplies, and the self-taught artist went on to have
his own show and be written up in Atlanta magazine. Once, after
being urged to make a donation to his alma mater, Allcott flipped
$50 to Mohr, then insisted that the college name something after
him. So college president Ofelia Garcia reciprocated by naming the
bottom drawer of her filing cabinet for Allcott. He loved it.
</P>
<P>
   Living life to the full
</P>
<P>
   Art collector Maria Lou
</P>
<P>
   Dorio, former owner of Virginia-Highland's Chow restaurant,
remembers the Sunday her staff ran out of ingredients during
brunch. Rushing to the grocery store, they ran into Allcott. He
wanted to know why they were buying so much hamburger meat. He
managed to give them his business card, and before they knew it,
his ``Uptown Couple'' was the focal point of the restaurant and on
the cover of the menu. The restaurant closed in January, but Dorio
says the painting has a place of honor in her home, sometimes
hanging next to the family's Jasper Johns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I like about the martini painting,'' says
Atlanta attorney Harry Kuniansky, referring to his portrait, which
hangs in the ACA show, ``is that as blind as Gene was, somehow he
got the olive just right. Little details that you would never think
about, he could see.''
</P>
<P>
   Allcott's wife, Mary Alice, says that kids would ask Allcott if
he was an adult or a child.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, he was invited to teach at Atlanta's Schenck
School, a private school for children with learning disabilities.
``This would be a once-a-week or once-a-month thing, I thought,''
writes Cathy Day, former art director of the school, in the
brochure. ``But then again, we all knew Gene! He came to school
with me every day for six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Says his wife: ``Knowing when it was time to go home was not his
strongest suit. On some levels, his social skills were awesome, and
on another level his social skills were inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   To say that Allcott is remembered as a figure of fun is like
saying the sky is blue. Told that he sounds so much like Ignatius
J. Reilly, the nutty New Orleans hot-dog salesman in John Kennedy
Toole's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ``A Confederacy of Dunces,''
his acquaintances couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time Gene went to New Orleans,'' says Mary Alice
Allcott, ``he got drunk and tried to buy a llama.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ALLCOTT FILE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Personal: Born June 17, 1953, in Chapel Hill, N.C. Died March
28, 1992. Survived by his wife, two sisters (one an artist, one a
magazine editor) and a brother (a doctor).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Early work: Was painting at least by age 6. ``His work has
been characterized as strong, original and powerful,'' said a
newspaper clipping from 1971, when he was 18. He once painted a
billboard for a restaurant in exchange for free meals.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Professional career: Beginning in 1976, his work was included
in some 30 group exhibitions and nine solo shows in Atlanta. He was
known for mass-marketing his designs on greeting cards, T-shirts,
posters and prints. Among the more notable collectors of his work
is fashion designer Alexander Julian, another lover of vivid colors
who also grew up in Chapel Hill and knew the artist.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A reviewer's words: ``The colors he chooses are unabashedly
bold and uncompromising. This is pink, this is blue, this is green,
and there's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In his own words: ``Being an artist is the only thing I've
ever wanted to do. And my parents always told me to go for it. I
was a late bloomer because of my sight, but there was no question I
would be an artist.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Girl power for Lifetime original programming
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The star of ``Ruby'' studies a showgirl's scanty G-string and
wonders _ out loud _ what wearing it would do to her own
``organs.''
</P>
<P>
   On the set of ``Beyond Chance,'' meanwhile, the hostess nestles
in a cocoon of soft candlelight and inspiring talk of life-altering
``twists of fate.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the start of another season of original programming on
Lifetime, the cable network that's long billed itself as
``Television for Women.'' Increasingly, it seems it's all different
sorts of women they're after, if those two new series debuting this
week are any indication.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the returning shows ``Any Day Now'' (the
Emmy-nominated drama has its second season premiere at 10 p.m.
Sunday) and ``Oh Baby'' (season two kicks off at 10 p.m. Aug. 21),
the new programs are part of Lifetime's effort to consolidate its
girl power hold over the world of cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen, the new women's cable network whose big-name backers
include Oprah Winfrey and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, is
expected to launch in early 2000. While Lifetime got a little
breathing room Friday when Time Warner suspended plans for its own
Turner Women's Network, the 15-year-old cable channel clearly sees
continued development of original series as key to building viewer
loyalty among advertiser-desirable adult women.
</P>
<P>
   After all, everything can't be left up to twists of fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond Chance''
</P>
<P>
   Spooky.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be what producers are going for with this series of
real-life tales about people who have premonitions of danger or
receive life-changing messages in dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But working with someone who turns out to be your long-lost
sibling? That's downright scary, for many reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the very first story told on ``Chance.'' Ignore the
fact that there's nary a mention of the legalistic and other types
of spade work that undoubtedly went into validating the tale. It's
still a tear-inducing saga of a woman who accidentally discovers
her co-worker is the sister she never even knew was given up for
adoption? It's the feeling of a greater force at work that really
counts here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's no simple answer for the mysteries of life, we
look for explanations that are often beyond our imagination,'' says
host Melissa Etheridge, who's bathed in so much mood-setting soft
candlelight and New Age music, it risks putting some viewers to
sleep. ``Beyond reason. Beyond chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Curious, then, that the episode's most compelling story seems to
be at least partially rooted in science.The heart and lungs of an
18-year-old male are transplanted into a delicate female dancer,
who gradually acquires his lumbering walk, his tastes in food (beer
and chicken nuggets) and other traits. By the time a doctor shows
up to suggest that we may store ``memories'' throughout our bodies,
you'll be intrigued and maybe a little bit unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Give us one or two of these each week to balance out all that
candlelight and the unapologetically tearjerking tales, and this
show could have a chance at long life.
</P>
<P>
   Premieres Aug. 16 at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruby''
</P>
<P>
   That can't be her real name, can it? Ruby Wax? And what about
her hair? That's not, um, a natural shade of red, is it?
</P>
<P>
   And don't even get us started on the poker-faced cowboy she
somehow gets to open up and admit that his career choice was
largely guided by fear of trying new things. This stuff has to be
scripted, right?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if Ruby's genuine or imitation? Who cares? Turns out
she's a gem, although like most big flashy rocks, she may not be
everyone's taste.
</P>
<P>
   The premise, such as it is, drops the tart-tongued Wax into
various fish-out-of-water settings. Thus, in the premiere episode,
filmed backstage with Las Vegas showgirls, we learn everything we
did (and a lot we didn't) want to know about G-strings.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to Wax's unique style of interviewing (she describes
her show as ```60 Minutes' on acid''), we also learn that showgirls
are pretty much like everyone else, albeit with a few delicious
twists (one knockout with legs up to here lost her Vegas magician
husband to an older woman).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruby'' really hits her stride in the second episode, when she
sets out on the range with a group of cowboys and her longtime
friend, Carrie Fisher, for whom she's determined to find a
boyfriend. As Fisher clomps along on horseback, Diet Coke and
cigarette in hand, Wax chats up a potential suitor sporting a
lowslung cowboy hat and a forbidding handlebar mustache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she too complicated for you?'' Wax asks. ``What's the
vibe?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is vibes, and I live by that,'' comes the somewhat
surprising response. ``I live with vibes or an aura, somewhat,
amongst my horse. I know what my horse is feeling, what cattle are
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   And then danged if he doesn't do a spot-on analysis of Fisher,
much as he would his horse. Right out there in the desert, Ruby's
found a diamond in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers may feel the same way about ``Ruby.''

 &HT;    Twin African-American brothers are doubly good at dealing with
emergencies in the Emory health care system
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Patients come into Atlanta emergency rooms with a
range of problems: heart attacks, fevers, broken bones, headaches.
</P>
<P>
   At three of the city's ERs, doctors work overtime to make sure
their patients don't acquire an additional complaint: double
vision.
</P>
<P>
   There's no infection lurking in the emergency departments of
Grady Memorial, Crawford Long and Emory University hospitals. But
there is a potential problem. It keeps administrators poring over
personnel records and paying close attention to shift schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Its name is T.K. Jasper. Or more precisely, their names: doctors
Travis Kendal and Travan Kennard Jasper _ Emory emergency
physicians, assistant professors and identical twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night, somehow, we got put on the same schedule for
Grady,'' said Travan, the elder by 37 seconds. ``We had a good time
that night. They had never seen the two of us together before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people still don't know there are two of us,'' added
Travis. ``One nurse thought I was making it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, who turned 30 years old last month, joined the
emergency medicine department of Emory University School of
Medicine in June 1998. They arrived trailing the same brilliant
resume: Stanford University biology degrees, University of Chicago
Medical School, University of Michigan residency. But their
recruitment by Emory, which oversees Grady and Crawford Long in
addition to its own hospital, offered more than the marquee value
of identical twins with identical training doing an identical job.
It added two more African-American physicians to a local cluster
that is striking in a mostly white profession and a very white
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the largest contingent of African-American faculty in
any predominantly white institution in the country,'' said Dr. Leon
L. Haley Jr., chief of the Emergency Care Center at Grady. ``There
may be more at Howard University or at King-Drew Medical Center in
Los Angeles. But there are 35 African-American faculty in emergency
medicine across the country, and we have 11 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the jobs in Atlanta put the Jaspers in the unusual
position, for once, of not being unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the only African-Americans in our residency program in
the last two years of our training,'' Travis said. ``When we went
to University of Chicago, it was 132nd out of 133 medical schools
for its percentage of minorities _ less than 1 percent, and our
arrival raised it to 3 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For once,'' said Haley, also African-Amer-ican, ``they don't
have to be trailblazers, because the road has been blazed for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there are still double takes. ``We've been doing genetics
lectures to middle school students in a summer program,'' Travis
said. ``So if Travan starts the lecture, for instance, he'll make
an excuse and leave the stage, and I'll walk on and take over. And
then at the end he'll walk back on, too. They are always surprised,
and I can't ever believe they didn't notice.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be hard to tell the two apart. They cut each other's hair
and shave in the same style, a goatee with a wisp under the lower
lip. They have the same taste; on a recent morning, having dressed
in separate houses, they both wore white-on-white shirts,
earth-toned geometric ties with gold tie bars, chino trousers and
soft-soled shoes (Travis' were Timberlands; Travan's were Bass).
Until recently, they both owned white sedans and black sport
utility vehicles _ Travis a Mercedes and a Jeep, Travan a Lexus and
a Ford Expedition. They call each other ``T.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are differences. They are both single but keep their
private lives separate. ``People always want to know if we date the
same women,`` Travis said, rolling his eyes. ``It's not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   They both wear wire-framed glasses, but Travis' are
copper-colored while Travan's are closer to gold. Their voices are
alike, but Travan's speech is slightly slangier, Travis' a bit more
formal. Travan is half an inch taller; Travis has a chicken pox
scar in one eyebrow and a tiny freckle in the bow of his upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   Detecting the differences requires close scrutiny. The Jaspers
are used to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always gotten a lot of stares, a lot of questions and
sometimes a fair amount of attention,'' Travis said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaspers, who have no siblings, were born in Richmond. Their
mother and stepfather are hairstylists, and their grandfather owns
a small business. They were the first in their family to finish
college. They were co-valedictorians in high school, got the same
SAT scores before college, scored within one point of each other on
their graduate school admission exams and received residency
evaluations that were never more than 2 percentage points apart.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they deny being competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me a story about why they tended to follow each
other's career,'' said Dr. Arthur Kellermann, who heads the medical
school's emergency department and recruited both Jaspers in
separate interviews. ``They said that since their mother had
trouble telling them apart, she would reward or punish them both
for something one of them did. It programmed them from an early age
to look out for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   As in their mother's raising of them, being not-distinguishable
has both rewards and pitfalls. Their credit records get mixed up.
When they applied to residency, the three- to-seven year stretch of
training after med school, several programs assumed they'd received
duplicate applications and threw one out. To get residency
assignments, a nationwide computerized system known as
``matching,'' the Jaspers resorted to the type of application used
by couples who want to be in the same location. Otherwise, they
would have been competing against each other _ on the basis of
identical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard people (in other residency programs) say, `We liked
them, but we couldn't figure out how to handle twins,''' said Dr.
Steven Dronen, the residency program director for emergency
medicine at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it as two for the price of one _ though of course
we paid them two salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Twin physicians in emergency medicine is a slightly risky
proposition. Because it moves so quickly, emergency depends on
spoken commands; unlike most hospital medicine, not much is written
down until afterward. The pitfall of doctors who look alike could
be that a nurse, replying to one physician's order, could give a
test or medication to the other's patient.
</P>
<P>
   To combat that, Michigan kept the Jaspers on different shifts.
Emory has assigned them mostly to separate hospitals, Travis at
Emory University and Travan at Crawford Long; both work at Grady,
but, except for one slip, never at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The system isn't perfect. ``When we were residents, there was an
elderly lady with altered mental status,'' Travis said. ``She came
in with all her family members, and after a few hours she was fine.
I walked off to do something, and while I was gone, my brother
walked through the department in regular clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to her relatives, `Dr. Jasper just walked by in
street clothes; he must be leaving,' and then I walked up again,
still in my white coat. And they said, `You know, we think Mom's
having problems again. ...'''
</P>
<P>
   The high visibility of being young, black, bright and noticeable
has an extra resonance at Grady; many of its patients are
African-American, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't as fortunate as some others growing up, so if
things had been different, we would have been the people who go to
Grady,'' Travan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I came to Atlanta, I hoped I'd spend most of my time
at Grady. You know, I'd done all this hard work, and now it's time
to give back to the community I came from, and hopefully not only
take care of them, but be a role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people ask me, I can say, `I know exactly what you're going
through. I came from a household that had some of the things you're
dealing with in your household.' I have a lot of patients who say,
`It's so nice to see you doing this. Keep going.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They just urge me on.''
</P>

TENNESSEE TOWN CELEBRATES CROCKETT

   LAWRENCEBURG, Tenn. _ As America prepares to enter the 21st
century, a 19th century hero remains popular.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 people are expected to visit Lawrenceburg this
weekend to help celebrate the birthday of the town's most famous
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Davy Crockett Days Celebration is being held at David
Crockett State Park in Lawrenceburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how popular David Crockett is today. His
notoriety has spanned centuries,'' said Charles Norvell, regional
naturalist for Tennessee State Parks. ``He was a hero in his time
and he is still a hero today. There's a lot of people in America
who cannot tell you who the secretary of state is but they know who
David Crockett was.''
</P>
<P>
   Crockett was born Aug. 17, 1786, in what is now eastern
Tennessee, and moved to Lawrenceburg in 1817. He was elected to the
first Lawrence County commission in 1819.
</P>
<P>
   He built a grist mill, distillery and gun powder mill on the
banks of Shoal Creek on property that is now part of the state
park. He left Lawrenceburg and moved to western Tennessee in 1821
after a flood destroyed his businesses.
</P>
<P>
   While living in Lawrenceburg, Crockett was elected to the state
Legislature. He later served in Congress, from 1827 to 1831 and
from 1833 to 1835.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett died at the Alamo in 1836 while fighting for the
independence of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   During this weekend's celebration, re-enactors dressed in
clothing from the Crockett era will demonstrate frontier skills and
crafts. Norvell said the goal of Crockett Days is to show what life
was like in Tennessee in the early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Re-enactors, who are known as longhunters, will set up more than
175 frontier-era lodges in the park. Men, women and children will
live in the lodges, cook their meals over fires and live as
frontiersmen did when Crockett lived in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do, we try to do just like they did before the
1840s,'' said Jim Nation, a spokesman for the Davy Crockett
Longhunters Club.
</P>
<P>
   Norvell said it is the largest educational event for any state
park in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   A Davy Crockett film festival will be held in the park's visitor
center.
</P>
<P>
   Norvell said Crockett called himself David but he often was
called Davy in stories about his superb frontiersman skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davy Crockett is the legend and you cannot separate the legend
from the man,'' he said.

GARZA SWORN IN AS ENVOY TO NICARAGUA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Oliver P. Garza, the son of a Texas farm laborer,
raised his right hand over a Bible in the ornate Treaty Room of the
State Department Friday and pledged to ``support and defend the
Constitution'' as the new U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, 57, a career diplomat, told about 100 friends and
supporters who crowded under a large crystal chandelier in the room
with tall white columns decorated with gold American eagles that it
was a testament to this country that someone from his humble roots
could attain the post of ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a dark suit, black shoes, a white shirt and yellow
tie and wearing conservative tortoise-shell reading glasses, Garza
joked that when he first walked into the State Department many
years ago wearing black and white shoes, others took one look at
him and said he would never make it as a diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Garza's wife of 38 years, Yolanda, held a Bible as David Pryor
Jr., the deputy chief of protocol, administered the oath, in which
the new ambassador pledged to ``support and defend the Constitution
against all enemies foreign and domestic.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Romero, acting assistant secretary of state for Western
Hemisphere Affairs, praised Garza as a ``recognized and respected
member of the San Antonio community'' who has ``steadily moved up
the ranks over the past 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero said the post would be a challenging one, especially in
the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, which 10 months ago killed
hundreds of people in Central America and displaced thousands of
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicaraguans and their government authorities are poised not
just to replace but to transform their society,'' Romero said.
``Nobody is better equipped than you to represent the U.S. in
Nicaragua.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua, a nation of 4.6 million, has enjoyed relative peace
this decade after a long period in which the United States actively
supported the Contra rebels fighting the leftist government. But
the nation has struggled economically.
</P>
<P>
   Garza thanked some 20 family members in the crowd, including
those, he quipped, who are ``crying out for attention,'' referring
to his 11-month-old granddaughter Elisa Lopez, who squealed and
babbled throughout the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   He also apologized for not naming all the attending relatives,
adding ``we only have this room for an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza's four children, Desiree Denise Garza-Bell, Melissa
Garza-Lopez, Christopher Garza and Gregory Garza, and his two
brothers, Rudy and M.P. Garza, were among the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Garza said in an interview afterward he never aimed to become an
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell into this more by accident than design,'' said Garza,
who just completed a stint as consul general in Guadalajara,
Mexico. ``Having achieved this was something very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza grew up in Poteet, a small town south of San Antonio that
refers to itself as strawberry capital of the world..
</P>
<P>
   In addition to duty in Colombia, Panama, Korea, Uruguay and the
Dominican Republic, Garza worked as an agent for the Drug
Enforcement Administration in San Antonio from 1974 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Garza graduated from St. Mary's University in San Antonio in
1970. He also was a student at the National War College in
Washington from 1987 to 1988, where military officers and
government officials study issues such as national security and
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Garza's son Christopher, 34, of Reston, Va., said the
ambassadorship, ``is an achievement for us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Garza, 28, an agent for the Drug Enforcement
Administration in Los Angeles, said he was proud that his father
``finally made it. He's worked hard. I've always planned to follow
in his footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   M.P. Garza, who owns a company that sells computer products,
said he never imagined his brother would climb this high in the
diplomatic ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have a very directed upbringing,'' he said. ``Back
in those days nobody talked about going to college or having a
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Pastrano, a retired Air Force flight engineer and the
new ambassador's uncle, said Hispanic teen-agers should draw a
lesson from Garza's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give up just because you come from where you come
from,'' he said. ``If you come from a place where you have always
been put down, you can fight and get out of it.''

SUSPECT IN MASS KILLING IN MEXICO IS ARRESTED IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A man suspected of being one of the gunmen who
killed 19 people last September on a farm in Mexico has been
arrested in Los Angeles, law-enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals
Service took the man, Manuel Escalante, 24, into custody after he
picked up his mother and sister from a bus stop on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Agents had followed the two women from Ensenada, Mexico, after
getting a tip that they were going to visit him. The Mexican
attorney general's office in Los Angeles said 10 other suspects in
the shootings had been arrested in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Escalante, a Spanish citizen with longtime residency in Mexico,
was identified in court papers as a member of a gang with strong
ties to the violent Arellano Felix drug cartel of Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, 1998, he and 12 others spent the evening drinking
and consuming cocaine with Arturo Martinez Gonzalez, the head of
the gang, according to the court filing.
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning hours of Sept. 17, they decided to rob a
ranch near Ensenada owned by Fermin Castro, a reputed marijuana
grower for the Felix cartel who reportedly owed Martinez Gonzalez
money and who had nearly 1,800 pounds of marijuana in storage,
court documents said. Castro and 18 people from three families
living in a compound on the ranch were lined up and shot.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Wilson, a special agent in charge of the immigration
service's fugitive alien removal unit, said Escalante had been
arrested near his home in the South-Central neighborhood of Los
Angeles. Another immigration official said he was initially held on
suspicion of working as a carpenter while in the country on a
tourist visa. He is being held at the federal detention center in
Los Angeles pending extradition proceedings.

MALAYSIA MARKET BOOSTED BY REINSTATEMENT IN MORGAN STANLEY INDEX  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ After 11 months as a financial pariah, Malaysia
earned a measure of redemption late Thursday when Morgan Stanley
Capital International said it would readmit the country to model
portfolios that many fund managers use as a guideline for where and
how much to invest. In response, the country's benchmark stock
index soared Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley said it would reinstate Malaysia in its so-called
All-Country Far East Free and Emerging Markets Free indexes as of
February, after having removed the country when Malaysia imposed
currency controls last September. Many overseas funds use the
indexes to judge their own performance, and some are bound by their
charters not to invest in countries that are excluded from the
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big booster,'' Ahmad Bachok, the head of sales at
Arab-Malaysian Securities Sdn. Bhd., said as the composite index in
Kuala Lumpur, the capital, rose 6 percent Friday. But many stock
markets elsewhere around Asia retreated.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean stocks fell by more than 3 percent, weighed down
partly by concerns about debt restructuring at the Daewoo Group.
Singapore stocks dropped more than 2 percent, and stocks in
Indonesia fell almost 1.5 percent as a spreading financial scandal
raised doubts about that country's economic restructuring plans.
Stocks also fell in Hong Kong and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley also said it would adjust its portfolios to
double the weighting of Taiwan, reflecting the growth of the market
there. Stocks rose 4 percent in Taiwan despite concerns that China
was mobilizing armed forces in response to what it sees as moves
toward independence by Taiwan, which it considers a renegade
province.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia was hurt badly by the Asian economic crisis that began
in Thailand two years ago. The government blamed foreign currency
speculators for much of the problem and, in response, imposed
severe controls on the movement of money in and out of Malaysia
last September. Those controls alienated many overseas investors
and isolated the country financially.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia has since been seeking to regain investor trust. In
February, it eliminated a ban on the repatriation of funds
overseas, replacing it with a tax of up to 30 percent. On Sept. 1,
Malaysia will go further, replacing the repatriation tax with a
capital gains tax that is considered much less onerous.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts and traders feared that foreign investors, who
still have as much as $6 billion invested in Malaysia, were dumping
their holdings to prepare for a September exodus. The move by
Morgan Stanley helped allay those fears and halted almost a month
of stock-market declines.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's improving economic picture is also contributing to
enthusiasm for its stocks, said Kevin Ng, an economist at ABN-Amro
Asia Securities Pte. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian companies are producing and exporting more, he said,
and it appears that the country may have pulled out of recession in
the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But some consultants and bankers say Malaysia has yet to deliver
the kind of transparency and accountability it needs, and Morgan
Stanley cautioned that its decision was contingent on continued
restructuring by Malaysia.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 15, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-RETIREMENT-REVIEW (United Nations) _ When it comes to
worrying about how to sustain a Social Security system in an era of
aging populations _ or how to insure that there will be enough new
talent to fill the workplace as fewer babies are born and more
people retire _ the United States is far from alone. Around the
world, but particularly in Europe and richer Asian nations, the
situation is even more alarming, and so are the choices governments
may soon have to make. By Barbara Crossette. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   EVOLUTION-CREATIONISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ As politicians fight
over whether evolution should be taught in school, its supporters
might strengthen their case if they conceded a point to its
opponents: Since evolution is indeed a theory and not a proven
fact, there may be benefits to having it taught side by side with
creationism. The result could be a wider appreciation that
creationism isn't even a theory, and that what evolution's
opponents consider its weakness is actually its strength: like all
of science, it is based on malleable human knowledge. By George
Johnson. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-SURPLUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ There is no budget surplus
this year, and at the rate Congress is going, there may not be one
anytime soon. It's beginning to look about as real as a $3 bill.
For when Congress comes back from vacation, a ritual dance around
an enormous pile of money will resume. And when this dance is done,
the first pot of black ink the government was supposed to have
saved in 30 years will be drained, deliberately and completely,
according to Republicans and Democrats alike. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENTS-IN-PUBLIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ There was a time when
presidents could move about freely in public with little or no
entourage, often to mingle with the people. But in the age of the
choreographed photo-op and the scripted `listening tour,' of all
news all the time and blanket Secret Service protection, it seems
all but impossible that an American politician, even a president as
populist as Bill Clinton, could pull off such a stunt. By Todd
Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   DROUGHT-HOMEOWNERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Amid this summer's
drought, the cherished American activities of plant and lawn
watering have been criminalized by state and local governments
desperate to change people's behavior and save water. While the
goal may be justified, a basic question remains: How did this rap
get pinned on the average citizen? By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   SCENT-SENSITIVITY-REVIEW (Udated ) _ A look at people who are
sensitive to certain smells, and efforts to ban perfume and other
fragrances in an effort to accommodate them. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   ELVIS-ARCHIVES-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Among the Elvis artifacts
and archives to be auctioned in October are contracts he signed and
hundreds of other never-published documents and letters
illuminating the singer's rise and fall. Here are gleanings from
the Presley archives.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-FEMALE-COPS-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ As part of an
anti-corruption drive, the new police chief here hopes to reduce
bribe-taking by traffic cops by allowing only female officers to

to being in positions of power, are less susceptible to corruption.
Also, it is felt, women are easier to communicate and deal with. By

   YELTSIN-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
seemingly erratic behavior in naming a virtual unknown as his new
prime minister and political heir does not necessarily mean he has
taken leave of his senses. It may well be part of a Yeltsin plan to
hold on to as much power as he can, for as long as he can. By
Celestine Bohlen.

   EUROPE-ECLIPSE-REVIEW (Frankfurt) _ Millions of Europeans drove

blackened lenses and gape at an event that lasted two and a half
minutes. By Edmund L. Andrews.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 15, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-RETIREMENT-REVIEW (United Nations) _ When it comes to
worrying about how to sustain a Social Security system in an era of
aging populations _ or how to insure that there will be enough new
talent to fill the workplace as fewer babies are born and more
people retire _ the United States is far from alone. Around the
world, but particularly in Europe and richer Asian nations, the
situation is even more alarming, and so are the choices governments
may soon have to make. By Barbara Crossette. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   EVOLUTION-CREATIONISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ As politicians fight
over whether evolution should be taught in school, its supporters
might strengthen their case if they conceded a point to its
opponents: Since evolution is indeed a theory and not a proven
fact, there may be benefits to having it taught side by side with
creationism. The result could be a wider appreciation that
creationism isn't even a theory, and that what evolution's
opponents consider its weakness is actually its strength: like all
of science, it is based on malleable human knowledge. By George
Johnson. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-SURPLUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ There is no budget surplus
this year, and at the rate Congress is going, there may not be one
anytime soon. It's beginning to look about as real as a $3 bill.
For when Congress comes back from vacation, a ritual dance around
an enormous pile of money will resume. And when this dance is done,
the first pot of black ink the government was supposed to have
saved in 30 years will be drained, deliberately and completely,
according to Republicans and Democrats alike. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENTS-IN-PUBLIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ There was a time when
presidents could move about freely in public with little or no
entourage, often to mingle with the people. But in the age of the
choreographed photo-op and the scripted `listening tour,' of all
news all the time and blanket Secret Service protection, it seems
all but impossible that an American politician, even a president as
populist as Bill Clinton, could pull off such a stunt. By Todd
Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   DROUGHT-HOMEOWNERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Amid this summer's
drought, the cherished American activities of plant and lawn
watering have been criminalized by state and local governments
desperate to change people's behavior and save water. While the
goal may be justified, a basic question remains: How did this rap
get pinned on the average citizen? By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   SCENT-SENSITIVITY-REVIEW (Udated ) _ A look at people who are
sensitive to certain smells, and efforts to ban perfume and other
fragrances in an effort to accommodate them. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   ELVIS-ARCHIVES-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Among the Elvis artifacts
and archives to be auctioned in October are contracts he signed and
hundreds of other never-published documents and letters
illuminating the singer's rise and fall. Here are gleanings from
the Presley archives.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-FEMALE-COPS-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ As part of an
anti-corruption drive, the new police chief here hopes to reduce
bribe-taking by traffic cops by allowing only female officers to
write tickets. The rationale is that women, who are not accustomed
to being in positions of power, are less susceptible to corruption.
Also, it is felt, women are easier to communicate and deal with. By
Joseph Treaster.

CARLSBAD SLAYING CASE SPURS REVIEW OF 1996 MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  BOSTON -- Police said Thursday they will ``take another
look'' at Raffi Kodikian, accused of killing his best friend in New
Mexico, in connection with the 1996 murder of Swedish nanny Karina
Holmer, whose torso was discovered in a dumpster behind a Fenway
building where Kodikian lived.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other potential witnesses, Kodikian, 25, was
interviewed by police seeking clues in Holmer's strangulation and
dismemberment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who lived in that building was questioned as part of
a routine canvass,'' said Detective Sergeant Margot Hill, a police
spokeswoman. ``That doesn't mean one way or another that any
suspicions were raised about him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hill said the department would ``take another look'' at
Kodikian in light of the murder charge he faces. Kodikian told New
Mexico authorities he stabbed David Coughlin, 26, twice in the
heart to put a friend dying of thirst out of his misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do it at the discretion of New Mexico police,'' she
said.

A GENERATION OF FREELANCERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget about that X, and all of its slacker implications. We are
now in the midst of Generation 1099 _ the once pitied but now
envied group of self-employed workers who dutifully file Form 1099s
to the Internal Revenue Service four times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Prime evidence of the new era is the emergence of two companies
that are making the life of a full-time freelancer even more
attractive, offering a lot of the perks that most permanent
employees enjoy. Freeagent.com and Aquent (Latin for not a
follower), both opened shop in the last two months, and act as
virtual employers that offer group benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to give the freelancer the same security earned by
traditional W-2 employees,'' said John Chuang, Aquent's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   As of February 1997, there were 8.5 million independent
contractors _ aka free agents, freelancers or consultants _
according to the government, 1.5 million of them between the ages
24 and 35. Not to be confused with temps, who are employed by one
agency, 1099ers have many clients and set their own hours.
</P>
<P>
   The life of the self-employed is not all leisurely lunches and
afternoons at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Members of Generation
1099 spend an inordinate amount of time hustling, invoicing and
politely harassing accounts payable.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike full-time employees, who have taxes withheld, 1099ers
are responsible for paying their own state, federal and Social
Security taxes, and shelling out huge amounts for health insurance
_ if they have it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been sick in my life, and I said I'd wait until I'm
30 to get insurance,'' said Kris Tobiassen, 29, a graphic designer
in New York who has been a full-time freelancer for five years.
``My birthday's coming up in a few short months, but I'm thinking
about waiting _ it's so expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance, stock options and retirement plans pull many
people toward full-time, permanent employment. ``The accessibility
of benefits can serve as a glue to an existing job,'' said Jeffrey
Bradach, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. Then
there's the camaraderie and the relief of more structure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those boons are not enough to lure some people. ``It
would have to be a helluva lot of money for me to go back to an
office,'' said Michael Bassett, 35, a computer consultant in
Manhattan. ``Big fat six-figure sums. I like the freedom too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   But freedom's often just another word for nothing left to
deposit _ especially when the landlord comes knocking, the electric
bill lands in your mailbox, it's midnight on April 14th, your tooth
cracked on a piece of toffee and your latest client can't cough up
the cash. That's usually when 1099ers flip through the help wanted
ads, looking for permanent employment.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, professional groups like the National Writers Union
have offered freelance writers some benefits. Freeagent.com and
Aquent aim to offer more benefits _ group-rate health, dental,
life, property, casualty, professional and disability insurance;
401(k) retirement plans and pensions _ to freelancers in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Freeagent.com even offers stock options in its privately held
parent company, Opus360, for those who want to bet on its future.
</P>
<P>
   As a 31-year-old in Manhattan, I could join an Oxford Health
Plans managed-care plan for $224 a month through Freeagent.com,
compared with $270 on my own.
</P>
<P>
   Job seekers can display their resumes on these sites. The
companies also have billing and collection services, although they
collect only from established corporations. You invoice
Freeagent.com or Aquent and they pay the money owed you, less 3
percent to 5 percent. The companies collect fees or even
commissions from the other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Chuang says he wants Aquent to be the ``Rosetta stone which
translates the W-2-based world of financial services to the world
of independent professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradach of Harvard says that the new services will encourage
people to try new careers or take more risks. They will also give
freelancers more leverage.
</P>
<P>
   With all the possibilities, there seems to be only one reason to
get a full-time job: the company Christmas Party. Then again, that
might be a reason not to.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With a grin splitting his face and a gleam in his
eye, Roberto Madrazo exudes the confidence of one of the most
talked-about men in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a man who thinks like us. We don't need a man who went
to Harvard or Yale,'' shouted a fan at a boisterous rally here for
Madrazo, who wants to be Mexico's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, the former governor of Mexico's Tabasco state, did
study urban planning at the University of California for a year.
But it's not a biographical detail he trumpets as he works his
populist charm on Mexico's disgruntled masses _ and fights for the
presidential nomination of this country's Revolutionary
Institutional Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, the party that has controlled Mexico's presidency for
70 years, is attempting to shed its authoritarian, corrupt image by
holding its first presidential primary ever on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, a 48-year-old lawyer and party veteran since his teens,
has vaulted unexpectedly onto center stage and taken a lead in
polls by doing the unthinkable: In aggressive ads and speeches, he
is attacking his party brethren and free-market economic policies
pushed by Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, the supreme PRI
commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the candidate of the forgotten PRI!'' Madrazo
told a crowd of working and middle-class supporters at a rally here
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With slogans urging an end to ``great results for few, and few
results for many,'' Madrazo is surging in popularity among Mexicans
who feel impoverished by free-market reforms and believe the PRI
has been hijacked by Ivy League-trained economists, such as
Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Some ``PRIistas'' credit Zedillo with taking a bold step to
democratize the PRI by endorsing a primary. But Madrazo lays claim
to that legacy through his father, Carlos, a PRI leader who he says
tried to similarly modernize the party 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's father was killed in a 1969 airplane crash some
Mexicans believe was no accident. The crash left Madrazo an orphan
at 16, and that memory could be fueling his drive for the
presidency, according to some observers.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's rising star threatens to eclipse former Mexican
interior minister Francisco Labastida, a candidate who emerged from
Zedillo's inner circle. This week, a Mexico City newspaper reported
that Labastida's campaign manager had described Madrazo as a relic
from ``the most corrupt PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard a (campaign) ad where Madrazo talked about
honesty, I thought of Hitler talking about human rights,'' Esteban
Moctezuma reportedly said in a closed breakfast meeting with
Mexican graduates of Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's followers asked the PRI to reprimand Moctezuma, who
replied that his comments were made in confidence and were taken
out of context.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest television ads, Madrazo appeals to nationalist
sentiment and implicitly challenges Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is not for sale. And neither am I,'' he says, after
snapshots representing Mexico's state-owned oil and electricity
industries flash by.
</P>
<P>
   None of Madrazo's three rivals within the PRI have proposed
privatizing Mexico's oil industry, but a Zedillo proposal to
privatize some sectors of electricity production met a wall of
resistance this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to explain his positions, Madrazo has a lighter touch.
</P>
<P>
   As a Tabasco senator, he supported the adoption of the North
American Free Trade Agreement, and says Tabasco, his own state on
the Gulf of Mexico, has benefited.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Madrazo's image as a PRI nationalist that's winning him
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the candidate of the people,'' said Mexico City
homemaker Rosa Maria Hernandez, a PRI loyalist who attended a
Madrazo rally.
</P>
<P>
   In a July poll conducted by the Mexico City-based Indemerc-Lou
Harris group, PRI sympathizers favored Madrazo over Labastida by 7
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In the same poll, voters in general also favored Madrazo by 5
percentage points over the National Action Party's Vicente Fox,
considered the toughest foe the PRI could face in next year's
general election. Labastida trailed behind Fox by 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Madrazo's popularity, analysts say the PRI _ which
normally keeps its feuds secret _ could fail to regroup around him
should he win in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody hates (Madrazo). I'm not talking about the people.
I'm talking about the PRI system,'' said Vicente Licona of the
Indemerc-Lou Harris group.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have since publicly made peace, Madrazo feuded
with Zedillo in 1994 after he was elected to the Tabasco
governorship. In response to charges of vote-rigging by Madrazo
opponents, Zedillo ordered an investigation that found the
accusations warranted. He tried to force Madrazo to resign, but
Madrazo's supporters took to the streets and Zedillo backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has also been dogged by charges he spent as much as $36
million to get elected _ many times over the cost of a normal
governor's race _ and received donations from corrupt bankers and
other dubious sources. But because the PRI in general is widely
believed to have endorsed illicit donations, the allegations are
not likely to stick to Madrazo in a primary, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with their portrayal of Madrazo as retrograde,
Labastida's campaign is raising questions about where Madrazo is
currently obtaining money to air a generous number of expensive
television ads.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rumors is that Madrazo is receiving money from Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, the former president who went into self-exile
amid allegations that his brother stole public money and accepted
millions in bribes from drug lords.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard-educated Salinas is one of Mexico's most reviled
politicians, largely because the country plunged into economic
crisis following his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lie. It's totally false. The principal collaborators
of Carlos Salinas are in the Labastida camp,'' Madrazo said,
ridiculing the rumored link in an interview with Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In an act of political jujitsu, Madrazo is trying to turn the
tables on Labastida by appealing to Mexicans' disgust with the
PRI's anti-democratic habits.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, the PRI's presidential nominees have always
been quietly selected by the president of the republic. The
decision to hold a primary this year is supposed to put an end to
that process, known as the ``dedazo,'' or ``big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's first television ads, however, implied that the PRI's
presidential candidate might still be imposed from above. In a
witty play on words, it urged Mexicans to give a ``madrazo'' _ a
``punch'' in Mexican slang _ to the ``dedazo.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's guidelines for the primary require that elected
officials who belong to the party _ including the president _
remain publicly mum on who they support for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Also prohibited is the use of state resources to bolster a
candidate. Madrazo recently accused Labastida of benefiting from
government resources during a recent tour of Chiapas state, where
the governor is known as a Labastida partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the old PRI,'' Madrazo said, accusing his rival of the
same evils Labastida attributes to him. ``We want a new PRI to
surface that's stronger, more modern and more democratic, so that
people can choose candidates freely with their votes and not have
them imposed on them the same way as before.''

WHY WE BROKE UP MA BELL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 15, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most powerful argument against monopoly is not that it
inflates its owners' profit (though of course it does), but rather
that it retards innovation. Remember that its chief reward is said
to be a quiet life for the the monopolists and their children _ and
a little more stability than is good for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrate, therefore, the Justice Department's decision more
than fifteen years ago to break the hold of American Telephone and
Telegraph on the United States telecommunications system. More than
a little, the 1984 divestiture changed the network that today binds
together the nations of the world and which promises to change
still more in the years to come, propelling us into a state of
dense interconnection that was no part of Ma Bell's plan..
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that AT&AMP;T's Bell Labs was forever a cornucopia of
new ideas. Indeed, the transistor was invented there in the years
just after World War II, opening the crucial pass to the computer
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was International Telephone and Telegraph Co. that
instigated the key developments in fiber optics, the technology
that, more than any other, has turned out to be the basic
infrastructure of today's information highway. Yes, the very same
ITT that in the early 1970s became synoymous with the arrogance of
multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   A few years before Dita Beard, its chief Washington lobbyist,
became famous for skulking around Washington in a cheap red wig in
the wake of the Watergate burglaries; before Harold Geneen, its
chief executive, truculently battled the Church Committee over his
corporation's attempts to overturn the Allende government in Chile,
it turns out an ITT scientist in England named Charles Kao
published an eight-page paper arguing that fiber optic
communications were a real-world possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Using glass pipes designed to carry pulses of light intead of
copper wire to carry electrons could offer huge transmission
capacity at low cost, Kao argued in early 1966, with co-author
George Hockham -- as long as the pipes themselves could be
successfully engineered.
</P>
<P>
   A series of breaks then put Kao in charge of a small development
effort at ITT's Standard Telecommunication Laboratories subsidiary
north of London, and the events he put in train (with direct
encouragement from Geneen himself) eventually created today's
long-distance revolution: overseas telephone connections as clear
as those with the house next door, and far more abundant.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of the British Post Office to pursue the new
technology; the discoveries by Corning Glass of new pure fiber
materials; the advent of the semiconductor laser as a source of
light (and the success of scientists at an obscure Russian
laboratory in beating their American counterparts at Bell Labs to a
room-temperature design); the rapid progress of the late 1970s, as
fiber optic began to outperform both coaxial cable and satellite
transmission; the climactic decision in 1984 of MCI to install a
transcontinental fiber network in North America _ all these
developments in some sense flowed out of half-a-dozen years of
missionary zeal by Kao, who unexpectedly took over Stantard
Telecommunication Labs' optical waveguide program at the age of 31,
closed it down and took off after the dream of fiber optics
instead.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story to be gleaned from ``City of Light: The Story
of Fiber Optics,'' by Jeff Hecht, the most recent in a series of
histories of technology underwritten by the Alfred Sloan
Foundation, published in this case by Oxford University Press. The
series itself has been uneven, but Hecht's narrative is a model of
the sort -- exactly what might have been hoped from a writer who
covered the industry for 25 years for trade publications, yet
retains both the detachment and perspective necessary to put a
narrative construction on events.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Newton, Mass., Hecht now covers all manner of topics,
from optics to paeontology, for Britain's New Scientist magazine.
But it is clear from the 11-page chronology (and the extensive
notes citing interviews with virtually evey major figure of the
modern period) that he has written an authoritative history of an
otherwise all-but-invisible industry. Trained as an engineer
himself, Hecht has a real gift for conveying the fog of uncertainy
about the possibilities in which scientists, engineers and managers
must make their choices about the approaches to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, Bell Labs was a surprising also-ran,'' writes
Hecht, ``a world-class laboratory that scored few conceptual
breakthroughs and spent untold millions chasing dead ends. Bell
suffered from being fat and happy and too quick to reject outside
ideas in favor of its own.'' The labs were slow to recognize
problems inherent in its preferred approaches, he concludes, not
surprisingly, since one of the hardest jobs research managers face
is ``to kill their own faltering projects before they grow into
money pits....'' Thus Bell bore down on hollow optical waveguides,
a technology that looks downright silly is retrospect (the light
pipes apparently would have had to have been absolutely straight)
as Kao began to explore glass transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is harder to explain why the Bell environment only rarely
sparked the creativity that ignited new ideas at Stantard
Telecommunication Labs, British Post Office/British Telecomm,
Corning, Lincoln Labs and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Had the
prestigious lab become stuck in the mud?''
</P>
<P>
   Hecht's book only incidentally illuminates the principles behind
the antitrust statutes. Mostly it is a example of satisfying
technological history. He begins with an account of the spectacular
``luminous fountains'' that were centerpieces of the great
electrical expositions in London, Paris and Cicago at the end of
the 19th century, then traces the slow zig-zag development of the
idea from early applications (the illumination of out-of-the-way
spaces by doctors and mechanics) to theoretical investigation of
the underlying principles of light transmission by glass by those
involved in the telephone industry.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming moral here is that large numbers of persons are
involved in the accomplishment of any significant innovation - not
a solitary ``inventor'' or two. Hecht notes in passing that a
timeline of inventions that decorates the subway stop at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology records that fiber optics was
invented there by Narinder Kapany &UR;  &LR; in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Kapany was only one of many contributers to the basic
science, he says, and 1955 mainly marks the beginning of an epic
quarrel with Karinder's his thesis adviser Harold Hopkins about who
deseved credit for the ideas therein. If anyone deserves to be
singled out for the role he played in influencing the course of
events it is Charles Kao, who left the field once events were in
train to become professor and now president of Chinese University
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the point about ATT's embarassment at the hands of its
lesser-known competitors _ the British Postal Service, Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone and, especially, ITT _ deserves a wide and
retentive audience. The tendency of successful corporations to
overlook major innovations in rival technologies is well-known:
Kodak spurning Xerox, for example. Competition ordinarily finds a
way around stubborn conventional wisdom in due course.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when the technological system is so dominant
that there is no effective way to offer an alternative to the
public? On these rare occasions, government must take a hand.

 &HT;    High-speed Net services enticing targets for hackers
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At first, Helene Jaillet thought it was a
glitch. She ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   Then the problem came up again. When she logged off her home
computer, her Windows software told her multiple people were logged
in. At one point, 20 ``users'' were poking around in her system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually caught somebody,'' said Jaillet, a graduate student
at the University of Texas. ``I went back and traced who the
Internet service provider was and I called them.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a growing number of home Internet users, Jaillet recently
jumped on to faster Internet service using one of Time Warner
Cable's Road Runner cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   But as she found out, higher speeds and 24-hour connectivity
come with a price: Users of so-called broadband services such as
cable and digital subscriber lines, or DSLs, are more vulnerable to
attacks from hackers than users who connect with traditional
dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   As broadband service continues to take off _ research group
Dataquest Inc. predicts 2.8 million cable and DSL modems will be
shipped this year _ a crisis in home security could be coming, some
say.
</P>
<P>
   The way hackers often worm their way into broadband service
systems is to use software that scans service providers' networks
for open ports _ an open port allows them to infiltrate a computer
system and have access to files, folders and applications on a
user's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Higher-speed Internet access offers hackers two advantages _ if
a user's Internet connection is constantly active, it makes finding
an open port an easier target. And the faster speeds make it easier
for them to get in and out of a system quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hackers out there that want to find an open port are going to
be looking for the faster access services,'' said Steve Farabee,
director of digital online services for Time Warner. ``It's kind of
like if you live in a nicer neighborhood, you're more likely to
have the burglars come to your place.''
</P>
<P>
   Road Runner, which has several thousand users, runs scans of its
own network twice a month in an attempt to detect hackers. The
company said it is trying to find software it will sell to its
customers for extra protection, Farabee said, but until that is
available, Road Runner users are on their own. He said users are
expected to take their own security measures, including setting up
passwords and seeking out information on security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sticky area,'' Farabee said. ``We don't want to take
responsibility for a customer's security. We try to point them in
the right direction and give them some general pointers on what
they should do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaillet said she found that out the hard way when she tried to
call Road Runner's abuse line. She said she was told keeping
hackers out was her problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude was that it was a buyer beware market, and it's
essentially my problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jaillet was advised to set up a firewall for her home network _
the computers she and her husband have linked together to share
Road Runner service. A firewall, widely used by companies on the
Internet, is software that purports to keep hackers out of a local
network while still allowing users to be connected to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   While Jaillet said she knows about firewalls, many other
computer users don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of people that just bought their computer
three weeks ago and they have no clue what's going on,'' she said.
Dewey Coffman, vice president of marketing for Jump.Net, said his
company takes a hands-off approach to firewalls and security
software for its users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our customers are sophisticated users _ they know how
to protect their information,'' he said. Some Jump.Net customers
use modems with tighter encryption or set up their own firewalls,
Coffman said.
</P>
<P>
   But even with firewalls and the latest security software, home
users may not be safe, said John Dickson, a marketing manager for
San Antonio-based SecureLogic Corp. Dickson, whose company
specializes in Internet security, said personal firewall technology
is weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reason to be very afraid,'' Dickson said. ``At the
personal and small office level, there's going to be some lessons
to be learned. All of us are looking at this as being a huge, huge
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet provider Texas.Net says unlike other DSL companies, it
has a firewall built into all of its user networks.
</P>
<P>
   Jonah Yokubaitis, one of Texas.Net's founders, claims that so
far his company hasn't had a single hacker penetrate its firewall,
which was developed by Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's a good business practice and saves us a lot of
headaches in the long run,'', Yokubaitis said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time the rich played when the mood struck, and
almost everyone else worked their farms and confined relaxation to
the Sabbath. Although August is now established as prime vacation
time, few Americans realize that their treasured paid vacation is a
fairly recent phenomenon. The very concept reflects ever-changing
American ideas about work, leisure and the markers of middle-class
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have vacations without a certain kind of class with
the resources and the time to take vacations,'' said Cindy S. Aron,
an associate professor of history at the University of Virginia.
``That doesn't really happen in the United States until the first
half of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular vacation owes its birth to such factors as the
changing nature of work and the rise of the railroad. Ms. Aron, the
author of ``Working at Play: A History of Vacations in the United
States'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), explained that as the
19th century drew to a close, more men became salaried employees in
the growing corporate world. Before then, most Americans were
farmers, artisans or self-employed in some capacity. Wealthy people
_ like the South Carolina planters who sailed up the coast to
Newport, R.I. _ went off to play; others ``went away'' primarily
for their health.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a culturally sanctioned, institutionalized break
from work made sense only as the nation was transformed from an
agricultural into an urban-industrial society _ with workers who
had benefits _ and a transportation network developed to move
people about. A new middle class with a few dollars in its pockets
and a taste for amusement allowed vacation places to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason scholars have gotten so interested in vacation is
because vacation says so much about work,'' said Karen Halttunen, a
professor of history at the University of California at Davis. She
says an increasingly frenzied consumer culture is blurring the
lines between work and leisure and changing the nature of
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vacations were born in the industrial revolution, when the
pressure of industry time discipline _ working by the clock _ meant
we started separating work from life,'' Ms. Halttunen said. People
started dividing life into ``after work,'' she said, and weekends,
vacation and retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think modern life has whittled away at all of those and has
ended the demarcation between work and life set up by the
industrial revolution,'' she said. Technology has helped obscure
the line with cellular telephones, fax machines, e-mail and the
Internet, which make people always available.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aron argues in her book that however captive to work people
may be while on vacation now, it originated as a benefit and then
became a marker of middle-class status. Thus, as an idea, it
changed from the prerogative of an elite in the early 19th century
to a mass phenomenon right before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The term vacation did not even enter the lexicon until the
middle of the last century as journalists, physicians and religious
leaders began to ponder the concept of leisure. They wrestled with
the Puritan notion that amusements were either inherently wanton or
fraught with the dangers of dissipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working at Play'' quotes The New Englander, a
Congregationalist publication, as saying in 1851: ``A recreation .
. . is something which recruits, restores and prepares the man for
better service and should be engaged in, always, with this end in
view.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ms. Aron writes, ``vacation resorts themselves
became sites of change _ creating environments in which vacationers
not only could enjoy new sorts of pleasures but could also
experiment with new, often less restricted rules of conduct and
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aron documents how roles for women were relaxed at resorts
where they engaged in sports previously reserved for men, swam in
scanty clothes and walked about freely. Married people engaged in
flirtations, and class distinctions were dropped as vacationers
donned the more democratic garb of leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, however, was not the only coin of the vacation realm.
The campgrounds, resorts and other playgrounds became segregated by
class, race and religion. Jews and blacks faced exclusion from many
vacation places and began to establish their own. The Catskills,
for example, began to attract large numbers of Jews. Blacks
established and began flocking to places like Oak Bluffs in
Martha's Vineyard and Idlewild, a resort in northern Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many stories the story of vacation can tell,''
Ms. Aron said. Americans get more paid vacations today than they
did a decade ago, but historians like Roy Rosenzweig, a professor
of history at George Mason University in Virginia, see a trend
toward more frequent but shorter vacations, with the cellular
telephone and the computer going along to stay in touch with the
office. Some historians say it betrays American anxiety about
working hard enough to do more, buy more and be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that Americans don't relax enough or have enough
fun is an old charge or a canard,'' counters Neil Harris, a
cultural historian who is a professor of history at the University
of Chicago. ``By the late 19th century there are psychologists
making the point that play is a good thing, that society is too
highly pressured.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several developments have altered the traditional vacation,
Harris said, like the use of television for entertainment; the rise
of the two-career family; the geographical dispersal of extended
families.
</P>
<P>
   Dual career families, obviously, mean that two date books have
to be consulted in scheduling time off. And because families are
far-flung, the family reunion often now means traveling somewhere
and getting together as a form of vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk about vacation as an instrument of leisure, how do
you fit in TV, which is a form of leisure, no matter how passive,''
Harris said. ``What time does TV replace? It may increase the
desire for more physically active vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halttunen says that how people fit technology like
television and the Internet into their lives reflects not so much
the influence of that technology as cultural and psychic needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is that we are an advanced consumer culture in
which people are chronically dissatisfied with what we have,'' she
said. ``So we work harder to get the wherewithal to make those
consumer purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The very concept of the career is getting more widespread,''
Ms. Halttunen continued. ``Once, doctors and lawyers had careers.
Now secretaries have careers and blue-collar workers have careers.
Secretaries take work home.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the vacation has become something that one buys,
Ms. Halttunen argues, and increasingly _ and paradoxically _ people
rely on it both to relax from the career conveyer belt and to
further their own or their children's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a work ethic run amok,'' Ms. Halttunen said. ``
You can't just sit on the the porch anymore.''

IGNATZ BUBIS, HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR AND POST-WAR LEADER, DIES AT 72  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Poland)   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Ignatz Bubis, who survived the Holocaust
and led Germany's small post-war Jewish community for nearly two
decades, died in a hospital here Friday. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Bubis' death was announced in a brief statement by the Central
Council for German Jews, which did not list the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   A former businessman with a knack for getting along with many
kinds of people, he became revered as voice of reconciliation as
well as one who campaigned passionately for Germany's residual
Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as a new generation of more confident and less
angst-ridden Germans came to maturity, Bubis became alarmed that
the country was sliding into forgetfulness and even nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Bubis became outraged last year when one of Germany's most
prominent writers, Martin Walser, argued that shame about the
Holocaust should not be ``exploited for present purposes'' and that
Auschwitz should not become a ``moral cudgel.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Walser's comments were nuanced, Bubis pounced on them as
``moral arson,'' and as the most dramatic example yet of Germany's
drift toward what he saw as an ominous ``intellectual
nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1927 in Breslau, Germany, now Wroclaw, Poland, Bubis and
his family fled from advancing Germans when he was eight years old.
They were later captured and sent to camps as forced laborers. His
father, brother and sister all died in the camps. His mother died
of cancer in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Bubis later described his survival as essentially a matter of
chance, and he remained devout to the memories of that time for the
rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the vast majority of other surviving Jews, Bubis decided
to live in Germany and settled in Frankfurt in 1956. Asked recently
why he had returned to Germany, after his release from the camp in
Poland, he remarked that Germany was the closest thing to a home
that he had.
</P>
<P>
   As West Germany began to enjoy a sustained economic boom in the
1950s, Bubis started up businesses trading jewelry and precious
metals in Frankfurt. He then went into the real-estate business in
the 1970s, developing high-rise office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   As a real estate developer in Frankfurt, Bubis clashed
repeatedly with Germany's left-wing and environmental groups, who
wanted more land preserved for ordinary housing and denounced him
as an unscrupulous speculator.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bubis' critics at the time was Joschka Fischer, a founding
member of the German Green Party who is now Germany's foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Bubis, who became president of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany in 1983, later achieved more amicable relations with
Fischer and other erstwhile activists who became less hostile to
business over the years.
</P>
<P>
   With his background as a businessman and his political clashes
as a real estate developer, Bubis became a politician in the small,
right-of-center Free Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Democrats campaigned against government regulation and
greater freedom for business, but they also supported stronger
citizenship rights for immigrant workers-both themes that appealed
to Bubis.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Free Democrats, he became a locally-elected
representative in the Frankfurt city government.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the German Jewish community, Bubis spoke out
repeatedly for the need to remember the horror of the Holocaust and
fought any tendencies to dismiss it as mere history.
</P>
<P>
   He became popular in Germany as a moderate figure who sought to
bridge the divide between Jews and non-Jews, but was also
discouraged at his progress. In an interview with Stern magazine
last month, Bubis said he felt he had accomplished ``nearly
nothing'' in his seven years as the chairman of the Central Council
of Jews in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do away with these divisions _ here Germans, there
Jews,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the years-long political debate about
building a memorial to the Holocaust in Berlin, Bubis remarked that
a memorial in Berlin as such was perhaps less important than
preserving and expanding memorials at actual sites of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Bubis was a central player in the recent battles over forcing
German banks and industrial corporations to compensate Holocaust
victims whose property was stolen or who were forced into slave
labor during the war.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he heaped scorn on American class-action
lawyers who began filing lawsuits in the United States on behalf of
survivors. Accusing the lawyers of using the Holocaust to generate
big fees for themselves, he vowed at one point last year that he
would never sit down them.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Bubis' death evoked sadness from a remarkable swath of
German leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great loss not just for the Jewish community but for
all of Germany,'' said Wolfgang Gerhardt, head of the Free
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gregor Gysi, head of the Party for Democratic Socialism, the
successor to East Germany's old Communist Party, praised Bubis as
singular voice for tolerance and pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   ``His efforts against every form of racism and hostility to
foreigners must become a requirement for us,'' said Gysi. ``He had
the capacity for integration, for principled argument and for
tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubis is survived by his wife, Ida, and daughter, Naomi.
</P>
<P>
   In the Stern interview, he said he had decided to be buried in
Israel, because he feared that his grave would be desecrated, like
the gravestone of his predecessor at the Central Council, Heinz
Galinski, which was destroyed by a bomb in December.

 &HT;    Instant messaging can be stifling
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you've ``instant messaged'' before, perhaps
using software such as America Online's Instant Messenger, you
understand the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging lets you zap a quick message directly to
someone else's computer, provided they're using the same software
and are accepting messages at the time. Once they receive that
message, they can zap a message back, and then you've got your own
mini-chat room, making instant messaging more immediate and
personal than standard e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   If sending an e-mail is the online equivalent of a letter,
instant messaging is an Internet phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly innocuous in nature, instant messaging has become no
less than a battle of good vs. evil between Internet titans
Microsoft Corp. and America Online Inc. And, this time _ depending
what you think of open information on the Internet _ Microsoft may
not be the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   The fight started last month when a new version of Microsoft's
instant message software, MSN Messenger, was released. The new
version included a feature allowing users to message users of AOL's
Instant Messenger. Feeling that Bill Gates and Co. were
gatecrashing, AOL blocked access of MSN Messenger, effectively
rendering the new feature useless.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shot back publicly, accusing AOL of failing to support
an open set of standards for instant messaging. For its own part,
Microsoft has never gone out of its way to share the secrets of
Windows with other developers, so, it's not surprising that AOL
feels Microsoft wants open standards only when it suits its needs.
AOL began a push soon after, aligning itself with Earthlink
Network, Mindspring Enterprises and Juno Online Services to
distribute its Instant Messenger in favor of Microsoft's software.
</P>
<P>
   What this means for regular users, though, is a step back in
terms of usability. Because of the bickering between the two
companies, users won't have the flexibility of messaging someone
who happens to be using a different piece of software.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing's not an issue _ both instant messengers are distributed
free on the Internet. What each company wants is to have control
over what users see _ they want to be able to push advertising,
links to their own products, and most importantly, their brand name
on the messenger that you'll see every time you send or receive a
message.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Microsoft each say they want open standards and
interactivity _ but each is camping with its own group of policy
standards boards and neither seems willing to give up and join the
other.
</P>
<P>
   If you want an idea of what a mess this could turn into, think
about e-mail. What if every e-mail program used a different set of
standards and you could only e-mail people who used the same
program you use? That's what may happen if companies such as AOL
and Microsoft don't agree on way to open up the barriers to their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company is completely in the right here _ Microsoft
could be seen as a poacher trying to piggyback on AOL's popular
product while AOL is being criticized for blocking users from its
database.
</P>
<P>
   As this continues, instant messaging continues to be seen as a
fringe application _ messenger programs such as AOL's and the
popular ICQ are handy, but they have been slow to evolve. The
future of instant messaging could be bright. We could see
messengers that make it easier to share files like photos or
documents or to extend a chat into a video conference. A sleeker
application than e-mail, it may be a good substitute in non-desktop
devices like personal digital assistants, set-top box Internet
terminals and digital phones.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these applications are already available, but until
instant messengers can talk to one another in the same standard
language, we won't see these technologies truly blossom and users
will continue to be fragmented into isolated instant messaging
camps.

LET'S TALK: AT TIMES, BUSH CAN BE COCKY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: This is an analysis) 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During her tenure as Texas governor, Ann Richards once stood
atop the state Capitol steps and tried to make an outlandish joke
with a group of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A television reporter looked up at Richards. ``Are you serious
governor?''
</P>
<P>
   The comedienne-governor rolled her eyes and made a sweeping
motion with her right hand, as if to drive the reporters away as
annoying pests: ``You people can just suck the humor right out of a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican
presidential nomination, got a taste of what Richards meant this
week with the publication of interviews he granted to a
conservative writer for Talk magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The public has frequently seen an affable George W. Bush or a
serious George W. Bush. What the Talk article captured, creating
discomfort for Bush's presidential campaign, is the cocky George W.
Bush, the one-time fraternity president, former Air National Guard
fighter pilot, oilman and sports team owner.
</P>
<P>
   The article portrays Bush as uninterested in whatever his
administration has done to reduce abortion, as someone who peppers
his regular conversations with various forms of a four-letter
sexual vulgarity, and as mocking executed killer Karla Faye Tucker,
a pickax murderess who pleaded Bush's office for mercy on the
grounds that she had found religion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said writer Tucker Carlson
captured some of Bush's personality in the piece but that Carlson
had mischaracterized his interviews with Bush, especially the part
about Karla Faye Tucker. Hughes also said no one remembers Bush
using foul language in his interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Bush became visibly angry when asked about the Talk interview
and tried to defer questions to Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He misrepresented me. I don't remember it happening that way.
I took the Karla Faye Tucker situation very seriously,'' Bush said,
adding that Tucker's execution last year ``was a very somber moment
and a very serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential rival Gary Bauer chided Bush over
abortion and the Tucker comments. And Bush received critical
editorial comment from the Manchester Union Leader and
conservative, nationally syndicated columnist George F. Will, who
said the article exposed what he saw as Bush's childishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A critical mass of lightness in a candidate causes the public
mind to snap closed, with the judgment, 'Not ready for prime
time,''' Will wrote. ``He and it (the Republican Party) will care
if on Nov. 7, 2000, people think of (Vice President Al) Gore or
(Bill) Bradley as an unexciting but serious professor and of him as
an amiable fraternity boy, but a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Talk reporter saw, and Will vicariously, was Bush's
inner child.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who cover Bush regularly know there are three distinct
Bush personalities.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is the affable Bush. This is the guy most people
meet at campaign rallies. He memorizes people's names and the names
of their children. He calls on reporters by name at news
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is the serious Bush. This is the somber man who said
he had prayed over the issue of Karla Faye Tucker before refusing
to grant her a stay of execution and wrestled with his religion's
call to public service.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the cocky Bush, who as a young man can be seen
in a widely circulated family photograph wearing an ``I'm-so-cool''
smirk on his face and a cigarette in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Richards captured this side of Bush's personality in their 1994
campaign when she complained that seeking the governorship was not
a beauty contest: ``You can't wake up one morning, look in the
mirror and say, `Hmm, Hmm, I think you're so cute I think you ought
to run for governor.'''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the self-possessed Bush allows his cocky side to
manifest itself as smart-alecky remarks at news conferences. This
Bush is the one whose own daughters remind him that he is ``not as
cool as he thinks he is,'' the one who thinks of the funny line
before its effect.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush's days as a hard-drinking National Guard fighter
pilot-turned oilman, Bush has quit drinking, quit smoking and
married former public school librarian Laura Welch. But that cocky
Bush still shows up.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same kind of cockiness that got his father bad
publicity in 1984 when the self-assured elder Bush emerged from his
vice presidential debate with Democrat Geraldine Ferraro and popped
off that he had ``kicked a little ass.''
</P>
<P>
   The cocky Gov. Bush who makes flippant comments shows up on days
when he is feeling especially good about himself, such as right
before his inauguration to a second term in office.
</P>
<P>
   The day Talk magazine interviewed Bush was the day he discovered
he had set an all-time fund-raising record for a presidential
primary candidate, $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bush's staff is correct in saying Carlson misrepresented
the interview, Bush's attempts at humor have been known by those
who cover him to be flippant.
</P>
<P>
   Any personal torment Bush might have experienced from Tucker's
execution was 16 months behind him while his top-of-the-world
fund-raising was fresh and exciting.
</P>
<P>
   When the cocky Bush is around, the only visible brake on his ego
is Laura Bush, who more than once has been seen popping his balloon
with a needle-like ``Hey!'' or a playful tap to his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Laura rarely travels with Bush on his presidential campaign
swings. He says he and his wife believe in historic preservation so
they don't want to leave their twin teen-age daughters alone in the
Texas Governor's Mansion.

AUTO INSURERS SEEK 7.8%   RATE INCREASE FOR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts' auto insurance industry have asked
regulators to approve a 7.8 percent rate increase for next year,
hoping they will get for the first time in five years a significant
increase in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the average auto premium would rise $69. But
insurance rates in Massachusetts, while still among the top 10
nationwide, have dropped in four of the last five years. Last year,
the industry ended up with only a .7 percent increase after asking
for a 15.5 percent increase. The current average premium is $887 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry's initial rate request is usually viewed by
state regulators and consumer advocates as a strategic high-end
bargaining position, an industry spokesman insisted this year's
number should be taken at face value.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Johnston, president of the Automobile Insurers Bureau of
Massachusetts, which represents the 42 auto insurers in this state,
said escalating expenses, from salaries and rent to computer costs
and taxes, explain why the industry deserves this increase for the
year 2000. He said his group will present state regulators with
volumes of documents and statistics to justify its request.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said the industry has been dealt so many setbacks by
state regulators in recent years that he worries about companies
fleeing the Massachusetts market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in a crisis stage yet, but we will soon be there if
prices charged for auto insurance continue to be set below expected
costs and with unrealistic economic wizardry as a foundation,'' he
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After four months of review with state regulators, Insurance
Commissioner Linda Ruthardt is expected to issue a final decision
by December.
</P>
<P>
   Deirdre Cummings, consumer program director for the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, said she has yet to
review any information to justify a nearly 8 percent rate increase.
She said she believes drivers of the state's 3.6 million insured
cars have reason to be optimistic that next year's auto insurance
bill will reflect a rate decrease.

LUCENT TO BUY MAKER OF HIGH-SPEED NET EQUIPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing a Bay State shopping binge, Lucent Technologies
Friday announced plans to buy a maker of fast Internet
communications gear for about $250 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's deal with privately held Xedia Corp., an Acton, Mass.
company that employs 90 workers, is expected to bring its
Massachusetts employment roster to more than 9,200 and bolster its
position as apparently the state's 8th biggest private employer,
according to the most recent tally.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old Xedia makes high-speed router devices that help
Internet service providers develop flexible, more easily expanded
networks. Its customers include MCI WorldCom, Sprint, and
Concentric Network.
</P>
<P>
   Xedia follows more than a half-dozen other Massachusetts
companies that have become part of Lucent through a series of
acquisitions and mergers over the last two years. Massachusetts now
ranks third behind New Jersey and Illinois in Lucent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Sanford, president of Lucent's InterNetworking Systems
group, said taking over Xedia ``fills an important space in our
enterprise data networking portfolio with award-winning products
that are absolutely best-in-class.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent will tender 3.86 million shares of its stock for all
outstanding Xedia stock, worth $254 million at Friday's close on
the New York Stock Exchange. Lucent predicted it will close the
deal this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Brooks, a telecommunications analyst with Aberdeen
Group, said, ``I think they got a great chunk of technology here.
I'm quite excited for both these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said she considers the price Lucent offered to be ``at
the high end of reasonable'' and reflects a sound strategy of not
waiting for ``fire-sale prices'' to add companies serving key
untapped markets for Lucent, the world's biggest telecommunications
provider.
</P>
<P>

MANY SEE YELTSIN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF `THE FAMILY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ When the president of the world's second largest
nuclear power wants to make an important political decision, he
consults the family.
</P>
<P>
   Not his family, but The Family, a collection of business
tycoons, cronies, and Kremlin bureaucrats who wield enormous _ and
many say destructive _ influence on Russia's President Boris N.
Yeltsin since his reelection three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, The Family has taken on legendary proportions, with
many of the country's ills being laid squarely on its doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Some media in Moscow speculated, for example, that The Family's
hand was behind last August's financial meltdown, when Russia's
currency lost 70 percent of its value in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The oil business of prominent Family member Boris Berezovsky's,
reports say, stood to benefit from a weak ruble to increase his
export earnings, and he allegedly lobbied for a devaluation that
devastated the savings of ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers also say that Yeltsin's decision Monday to sack
his government was the Family's dirty work. Ex-Prime Minister
Sergei Stepashin was seen as not tough enough to fight off the
president's _ and the Family's _ enemies. So steely former spy
Vladimir Putin, who helped throttle an investigation of Yeltsin by
testifying to photos that showed the chief investigator cavorting
with naked women, was brought in as prime minister to get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's manic rumor mill even speculated that recent tension in
Dagestan, where Russian forces are battling Islamic militants, was
organzed by The Family.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the respected newspaper Segodnya reported that
Kremlin chief of staff _ and Family member _ Alexander Voloshin met
recently with rebel leader Shaimil Basayev, fueling speculation
that the tension in the Caucuses was a made-to-order pretext to
declare a state of emergency and cancel next year's presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not these sinister allegations are true, few doubt
that the Family wields power in the Kremlin. Yeltsin himself has
scornfully denied that he is beholden to anything but his political
intuition, but all sides have pointed to the Family's influence,
particularly in recent moves.
</P>
<P>
   So just what is this Family, which has caused so much trouble
for this vast country?
</P>
<P>
   At the center of The Family is an actual member of Yeltsin's
family: the president's eldest daughter Tatyana Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   She burst on to the public stage during the 1996 presidential
vote when she signed on as an image consultant for her father's
campaign. Dyachenko was credited for softening Yeltsin's image _
ordering his security guards, for example, to stop wearing
sunglasses on campaign stops so as to not intimidate voters.
</P>
<P>
   And the other Family members? The Russian media regularly names
the following: oil tycoons Berezovsky and Ramon Abramovich;
Valentin Yumashev, the ghost writer of Yeltsin's autobiography; and
Kremlin Chief of Staff Voloshin, a former busness partner of
Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   All of these built fabulous fortunes for themselves during
Russia's controversial privatization auctions in the early 1990s,
and they were all part of a group of tycoons who _ fearing a
Communist revival _ used their industrial and media empires to make
Yeltsin's reelection a foregone conclusion. Dyachenko is the
conduit. The others lobby Yeltsin through her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Family acts in the way similar to a court in a monarchy,''
said Andrei Riabov, a political analyst at the Moscow Carnegie
Center. ``In its current form, the family appeared during the 1996
presidential election when some of those who engineered Yeltsin's
victory decided to stick around and keep the spoils.''
</P>
<P>
   But to do so, they needed to depose a powerful competitor for
the president's ear. Before the election Yeltsin's closest adviser
was Alexander Korzhakov, the chief of the president's security.
Korzhakov, an ex-KGB officer, had been Yeltsin's bodyguard, driver,
drinking buddy, and confidant. He was blamed for many of Yeltsin's
more disastrous decisions, such as the one to wage war against
Chechen separatists, which eventually cost 80,000 lives. Korzhakov
was also the president's gatekeeper and jealously guarded access to
Yelsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korzhakov was the Family before the Family existed,'' said
Moscow-based political analyst Andrei Piontkovsky. When Dyachenko
decided to enter politics, she was able to break Korzhakov's
monopoly on Yeltsin, engineering his firing shortly before the
election. This opened the door for Berezovsky and other members of
the Family.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of shadowy behind-the-scenes influence are nothing new in
Russia and are even the subject of lore. Rasputin, the legendary
19th century monk, had the ear of Nicholas II, Russia's last czar,
and that of his wife, Alexandra. Rasputin gained access to the
royal family after he cured the czar's son of a severe illness,
convincing Alexandra that he had divine gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Today's aides reached the Kremlin inner sanctum with more banal
means: money. Yamoshev wrote Yeltsin's memoirs and Berezovsky
organized the overseas publication, and delivered the profits.
</P>
<P>
   In his kiss-and-tell book ``Boris Yeltsin: From Dawn to Dusk,''
Korzhakov wrote that Berezovsky handed over $15,000 a month to
Yeltsin in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The book also says Berezovsky and Abramovich _ whom he calls the
Kremlin's cashier _ arrange Yeltsin's and Dyachenko's overseas bank
accounts. That could explain why The Family plans to hold on to
power at all costs, fearing the prosecution that might result
should a president hostile to them succeed Yelsin.

 &HT;    The most meaningless meaningful poll in the country
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ It's county fair meets political convention. It's
part marketplace of ideas and part sideshow. It's the Iowa
Republican Straw Poll, this year's most meaningful meaningless
political event.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 15,000 people _ many whisked to Ames in buses paid
for by the presidential candidates _ are expected to pack a campus
coliseum today for an event whose importance is strictly in the
eyes of the beholders.
</P>
<P>
   And because the world press is making believe the make-believe
election matters, the candidates are playing it straight. Though
the straw poll has no official role in the nominating process _
it's merely a fund-raiser for the Iowa GOP _ the past week in Iowa
has looked like the week prior to the state's first-in-the-nation
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference is that some of the candidates stumping
here this week will be gone by February's caucuses. And if today
doesn't go well for them, some could be gone by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it matters,'' said front-runner Gov. George W. Bush, who
has spent fewer days campaigning in Iowa than any of the other
straw-poll participants. ``It matters because it's part of the
nominating process.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Iowa caucuses, today's event will go further toward
determining who won't be president than who will be. Well-funded
candidates like Bush and wealthy publisher Steve Forbes are
expected to finish first and second because of their money and
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has rented about 90 buses to haul supporters here. Bush
has more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent all week in Iowa, crisscrossing the state in a
high-tech bus while his ads ran on TV. He paid for a 30-minute
infomercial that aired Thursdsay night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a good milestone on the way to the caucuses next
year,'' said Forbes, who, like Bush, has spent more than $1 million
on the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   And while he is convinced he has the message to move voters his
way, Forbes, like the other GOP contenders, is adding music to lure
Iowans out on the last summer Saturday before school starts in much
of the state. His campaign is paying for what it's calling ``the
biggest party in Iowa this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we want to invite all of you to be our very special
guests,'' Forbes' aide Steve Grubbs said in his post-speech pitch
all week. ``This thing has gotten huge, and all of your favorites
from television are going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes party tent will feature singers Ronnie Millsap and
Debby Boone. The Bush rally site will feature singers Tracy Byrd,
Linda Davis and Emilio Navaira, as well as athletes Roger Staubach,
Nick Lowery, Sean Elliott and champion bass fisherman Johnny
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when the concerts and rallies wind down this afternoon,
straw poll participants will move into Iowa State University's
coliseum for candidate speeches and voting. It costs $25 to get in,
but the candidates are picking up the tab for their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll could be most significant for candidates
struggling to survive in the shadow of Bush's money and poll
numbers and Forbes' family fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who has been campaigning
here for years, and ex-Vice President Dan Quayle could see their
White House dreams effectively snuffed out if they finish near the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, whose campaign peaked the day it began and has
struggled since,
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is do or die for us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole sounded a tad more concerned in an e-mail to
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do need to complete our plan by raising the last $5,000 of
our budget. Like our bus, the campaign needs the financial fuel to
complete its journey. Could you help me?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the further-right wing of the party, Pat Buchanan, Orrin
Hatch, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes are waging an intramural battle
for credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Out of harm's way here today _ at least for now _ is Arizona
Sen. John McCain, a GOP presidential contender who called the event
a ``scam'' and is staying away.
</P>
<P>
   An Iowa Project 2000 poll completed last Monday, which showed
Bush way ahead of the pack at 37 percent, had Alexander in eighth
place with 3 percent.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Few ideas are as deeply ingrained in Israeli culture
as the one summed up by the Hebrew phrase, ``me'atim mul rabim,''
or ``the few against the many.'' Schoolchildren have long been
taught that the Jews have always been surrounded by enemies and
that their victory over five Arab states in the 1948 War of
Independence was a near miracle of David-and-Goliath proportions.
</P>
<P>
   But the start of this school year marks a quiet revolution in
the teaching of Israeli history to most Israeli pupils. New,
officially approved textbooks make plain that many of the most
common Israeli beliefs are as much myth as fact.
</P>
<P>
   The new books say, for example, that it was the Israelis who had
the military edge in the War of Independence. They say that many
Palestinians left their land not _ as has traditionally been taught
_ because they smugly expected the Arab states to sweep back in
victoriously but because they were afraid and, in some cases,
expelled by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The books freely use the term ``Palestinian'' to refer to a
people and a nationalist movement, unheard of in the previous
texts. They refer to the Arabic name for the 1948 war _ the Naqba,
or catastrophe _ and they ask the pupils to put themselves in the
Arabs' shoes and consider how they would have felt about Zionism.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the books no longer separate Jewish and Israeli history
from events around the world but weave them into a single tapestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 10 years ago much of this was taboo,'' reflected Eyal
Naveh, a history professor at Tel Aviv University and the author of
one of the new ninth-grade textbooks on the 20th century. ``We were
not mature enough to look at these controversial problems. Now we
can deal with this the way Americans deal with the Indians and
black enslavement. We are getting rid of certain myths.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``new history'' approach that Naveh and other new textbook
authors are using in their descriptions of the Israeli-Arab
conflict is 10 or 15 years old. It has gained a growing following
among academic scholars and then with a somewhat larger public
after the 1993 Oslo peace accord between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But while the publication of such revisionism by scholars is one
thing, the inclusion of their perspective in school books is
clearly something else. In all states, but especially new ones,
school is typically viewed as a place not only to learn but to be
imbued with civic and patriotic spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that these new books are currently being assigned and
bought without advance publicity about the changes says something
about Israel's sense of its own maturity. But it seems nonetheless
likely that when, in the coming months, the books' contents become
known, controversy will ensue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Why not just translate the Palestinian books for our children
and be done with it?'' fumed Aharon Megged, a novelist and
outspoken critic of the new history, when he was read a passage
from a new textbook. ``This is an act of moral suicide that
deprives our children of everything that makes people proud of
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage to which Megged was reacting was from Naveh's book,
on the War of Independence:
</P>
<P>
   ``On nearly every front and in nearly every battle, the Jewish
side had the advantage over the Arabs in terms of planning,
organization, operation of equipment and also in the number of
trained fighters who participated in the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach of earlier textbooks is typified by the following
from a 1984 Education Ministry book on the years 1939 to 1949:
``The numerical standoff between the two sides in the conflict was
horrifyingly unbalanced. The Jewish community numbered 650,000. The
Arab states together came to 40 million. The chances of success
were doubtful and the Jewish community had to draft every possible
fighter for the defense of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   This shift in perspective is common to the work of the new
historians who are relying on newly opened state archives and the
emotional distance of a young generation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of portraying the early Zionists as pure, peace-loving
pioneers who fell victim to Arab hatred, the new historians focus
on the early leaders' machinations to build an iron-walled Jewish
state regardless of the consequences for non-Jews living here.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy that this narrative has generated mirrors the
wider dispute in Israel between those who favor more concessions to
the Arabs and those who fear that such concessions place Israel's
legitimacy and its very existence at risk.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of the new textbooks also mirrors the growing
acceptance of some new history by Israelis. Last year, when the
country marked its 50th birthday, a television series known as
Tkuma, or rebirth, offered a more complex and less varnished
version of Israeli history than had been typically shown. And a new
military history book of Israel by a group of mainstream military
historians has just been published that explodes several key myths
about Israeli military feats.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Yaron, who is in charge of the history curriculum at the
Ministry of Education, says the issue is one of historical
accuracy; he calls the changes salutary. He took up his post five
years ago, during the liberal administration of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, and quietly continued his work after Benjamin
Netanyahu, a conservative, was elected in 1996, finishing approval
of the new books just as Ehud Barak, who is in Rabin's mold, was
elected in the spring.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning a new era in history teaching where, for the
first time in Israeli textbooks, the picture is not black and
white,'' Yaron said. ``That was an important goal of mine when I
came, to make sure the Palestinian perspective was included.
</P>
<P>
   ``My second goal was to end the practice of separately teaching
Jewish and Israeli history on the one hand and world history on the
other. It was absurd. We used to spend one year teaching the
Holocaust and the next teaching World War II. Now we will teach
Jewish history in the larger context of other events. This doesn't
minimize Zionism. It puts it in context.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaron's department began integrating Jewish and world history
for middle school in its sixth grade textbooks several years ago
and is finishing this project with the new ninth grade books that
have just been printed. Since ninth grade history class is devoted
to the 20th century, when Israel was formed, this is the year when
controversy may be expected.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has a number of state-approved school systems and the new
books will only be used in the mainstream secular system that
serves about 60 percent of the population. The religious state
system and the strictly-observant systems that operate with state
approval and funds will not use the new books, meaning that the
divisions between the various sectors may now be aggravated
further.
</P>
<P>
   There are three new competing ninth-grade history books for the
secular system, one from the ministry's own publishing division and
two produced privately with ministry approval. All three take a
much broader, more textured approach to Israeli history than
textbooks have in the past. New books for the 10th through 12th
grades are due out in the coming year and all take the new approach
of integrating Jewish history with world history.
</P>
<P>
   One ninth-grade book is ``Passage to the Past'' by Kezia
Tabibyan, which not only mentions the 1948 massacre carried out by
radical Zionist forces in the village of Deir Yassin, something Ms.
Tabibyan says had never been done in a ninth-grade text before, but
also engages in a kind of historiography by asking students to
reflect on the use of myths in nation-building.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to educate the citizens of Israel after 2000 they
must know that there is another point of view about things like our
War of Independence,'' Ms. Tabibyan said. ``They must deal with
Deir Yassin. They must know that there was another people that had
their life here.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministry book, edited by Danny Jacoby, is in some ways the
most radical of the three. Its discussion of why the Palestinians
became refugees includes the sentence, ``There were also localities
in which the Jewish fighting forces conducted expulsion actions.''
The book also frankly discusses how Jews from North Africa and the
Arab world felt mistreated by European Jews when they came here.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, part of what is driving the change in history texts is
the ongoing Middle East peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The accords between the Israelis and Palestinians call on each
side to fight racism and provocation and instruct their populations
in coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one of the issues that has most troubled Israeli
commentators is the fact that the Palestinians are still using old
Jordanian and Egyptian texts which never mention Israel and often
portray Jews as evil and bloodthirsty.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli group called ``Palestinian Media Watch'' recently
published the findings of its study of Palestinian textbooks. In
one textbook on Arab history, the group noted, is the sentence,
``The best examples of racism and discrimination in the world are
Nazism and Zionism.'' Another book, for sixth graders, says, ``One
must be careful around Jews because they are lying traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Khalil Mahshi, director of international relations at the
Palestinian education ministry, said he is troubled by the
anti-Semitism that appears in the books used by Palestinians but
noted that new books are being written.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not rewriting our school history books,'' he said. ``We
are writing them for the first time. It will take a few more years
because we are just forming committees to set up the guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the new books would include Israeli perspectives on the
dispute, Mahshi begged for indulgence, saying that while the
Palestinians want to be treated as equals, their historical
development has not been equal to that of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are attempting to be as objective as possible,'' he said.
``We should be living a new reality, taking a more mature view, but
to do that means overcoming pain. To see the Zionist movement as
having an equal right to our land as we do is to embark on a
personal journey to history which is more complicated than most
people realize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a long time and even then I am not there. Israelis
are changing because they can afford it. They are now so rich and
powerful that they can afford to be magnanimous and say, `OK, there
are people here we haven't treated well.' But when you are still
dealing with daily difficulties and view them as the fault of the
people next door, can you afford to be so magnanimous?''

A GOLF COURSE OF THEIR OWN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Colo., Pa.)   (af)  
 By SASHA CAVENDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ When H. Wayne Huizenga, the billionaire
founder of companies like Waste Management and Blockbuster
Entertainment, and other members of the nation's business elite
began jetting to this island in recent years, they flew into one
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sankaty Head Golf Club, with the island's only 18-hole course
and members who have spent summers in Nantucket for years or
decades, closed its waiting list in 1994 with a backlog of at least
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   And so Huizenga, Roger S. Penske, Henry R. Kravis and others
jumped to join the new Nantucket Golf Club, which opened in April
1998. It is where John F. Welch of General Electric has played with
guests like Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   This Friday, President Clinton is expected to play. ``He's been
dying to do it since the day it opened,'' said Elizabeth Bagley,
his former ambassador to Portugal, who is holding a fund-raiser
here for Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that the president would be in Martha's
Vineyard that day and that no trip to Nantucket had been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Memberships, which initially went for $250,000, were fully
subscribed before the summer of 1998 ended, even as the fee rose
past $300,000. Golf Magazine just named the new Nantucket club to
its list of the 100 best courses in the nation, and Golf Digest
named it the best new private course for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs are both in Siasconset, known here as Sconset, at the
southeastern tip of the island. But the contrast between them
exemplifies the island's transformation from an understated haven
where the monied mixed comfortably with fishermen and farmers to a
theater for the display of Wall Street and corporate wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Sankaty Head, with the island's traditional, Yankee disdain for
status or rank, has long been the sort of place where
schoolteachers and corporate chiefs teed off one after the other.
Among the best golfers is a local sanitation worker.
Family-friendly, the club has a pool, tennis courts and bingo
nights.
</P>
<P>
   The Sankaty Head clubhouse, casual and comfortably worn,
maintains the same frugality that David Gray, a Detroit
businessman, intended when he founded the club in 1921. Shunning a
member's offer to buy a mantel clock for $150, he boasted of buying
one for $10 instead. None of the easy chairs cost more than $5.
</P>
<P>
   The initiation fee is $15,000 but would rise to $22,000 if
clubhouse renovations currently being discussed went ahead. For the
300 members with full golfing privileges, annual dues are $1,500.
In the off season, the course is open to the public for $550 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nantucket Golf Club, by contrast, was first of all an
investment. In bidding for the land, Nelson Doubleday, a co-owner
of the New York Mets, and Jack Nicklaus lost out to a group led by
Frederick D. Green, a Colorado real estate developer who is now the
club's president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the investors paid $8.25 million to buy 250 acres from
an old island family, the Coffins, and commissioned the designer
Rees Jones to lay the course out. While most golf courses are now
built as anchors for residential developments, the Nantucket Golf
Course stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we weren't here, there could be 140 houses instead,'' said
Charles Passios, the golf course manager. ``The golf course
preserves this open land, the moors, plant life, wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   Open, that is, for its members, who pass through its guarded
gates to a clubhouse that, unlike Sankaty's, is not visible from
any public road. Attendants radio ahead so members' golf bags can
be set out for them.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the members have no homes on Nantucket, and
some fly in and out the same day. Annual dues at the Nantucket Golf
Club are said to be $8,500, though the club will not confirm this
figure. There is no pool, nor are there tennis courts. There is
just golf.
</P>
<P>
   During the off season, the club shuts down. Like the island's
real estate, memberships are rising in value, and as some have
changed hands, the club has received a cut of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga, 61, is typical in his feelings about the new club.
``What I like most about the new Nantucket Golf Club is you feel
you could be in Ireland or Scotland,'' he said recently. ``The way
the course is laid out, the tall grasses, the weather and the
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Wright, chief executive of NBC, his boss Welch and J.
Perry Ruddick, a former vice chairman of Smith Barney who is the
president of Sankaty Head, are among the 50 or so members of both
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are a few, though wealthy enough to play where
they want, who make a point of shunning the whole club scene.
Richard Mellon Scaife, the Pittsburgh billionaire, plays at the
public nine-hole course near the two private ones. With no
motorized golf carts and no caddies, the course costs $22 a round _
or $24 for those like Scaife who splurge on pull-carts for their
clubs. ``It's the best,'' he said.

 &HT;    Gingrich aide to be queried in divorce
 &HT;    By Francis X. Gilpin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A lawyer for the estranged wife of Newt Gingrich has
been given approval in the couple's divorce case to question a
congressional aide about her relationship with the former U.S.
House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer John C. Mayoue, who represents Marianne Gingrich,
said Friday he expects to be able to put Callista L. Bisek under
oath in Virginia in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek, 33, who lives outside of Washington, couldn't be reached
Friday at her Arlington, Va., home or on the job at the House
Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich filed for divorce from Marianne Gingrich, his second
wife, on July 29 in Cobb County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican said in his petition to the court that the
marriage of 18 years was irretrievably broken.
</P>
<P>
   The couple separated May 10, according to Gingrich's petition.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue, in his request to question Bisek, said ``this action is
a divorce case'' and Newt Gingrich's ``relationship with Callista
Bisek is in question.''
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Dorothy A. Robinson issued an order late
Thursday granting permission to Mayoue to set up a videotaped
deposition of Bisek.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue said he intends to question Bisek about all aspects of
her relationship with Gingrich, who resigned his House seat after
1998 GOP election losses.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News quoted unidentified sources Friday as
saying Gingrich and Bisek were seen around her home in the wee
hours last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he pushed for President Clinton's impeachment
in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's lawyer, J. Randolph Evans of Atlanta, lamented the
turn that the divorce litigation has taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's very helpful when you're getting into
saber-rattling, which is what this is, because then it gets very
hurtful and very expensive for everybody concerned,'' Evans said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Mayoue requested and obtained permission to question
Bisek without giving him a chance to argue against it in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine. Everybody has their own style,'' said Evans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep the proceedings focused on what
proceedings like this should be focused on. That's reaching a fair
and equitable settlement for Marianne and Newt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's first marriage to the former Jackie Battley ended in
divorce and he wed his current wife within months of the final
dissolution.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Gingrich has claimed Newt Gingrich first talked about
divorcing her while she recovered from cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich has disputed that.

DALAI LAMA TO LEAD HUNDREDS IN A SPIRITUAL INITIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since he arrived in New York this week, the Dalai Lama has
maintained a busy intellectual schedule, devoted mainly to many
hours of public teachings.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he began three days of lectures at the Beacon
Theater on Broadway. And Sunday, he is to speak in Central Park's
East Meadow, where his theme will be training one's mind as a step
toward leading a virtuous life. The event, at 11 a.m., is free.
</P>
<P>
   But for some, the most spiritually powerful part of the Dalai
Lama's visit to the United States will take place farther afield,
in Indiana, beginning next week.
</P>
<P>
   It will come after the 64-year-old spiritual leader of Tibet
stops in Indianapolis on Monday, to receive an official greeting
from Gov. Frank O'Bannon and an interfaith group of clergy members.
The Dalai Lama goes from there to Indiana University in
Bloomington, where he will speak about ethics in the next
millennium, the subject of his new book.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also in Bloomington that the Dalai Lama will officiate
at a Kalachakra, a rite of spiritual initiation, and a highly
significant ceremony within Tibetan Buddhism. Its concepts come
from a sacred text nearly 1,000 years old, and these are discussed
in the ceremony by the officiating monk, in this case, the Dalai
Lama.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony takes place over the course of several days, and
hundreds, even thousands of people may participate. At the heart of
the experience is the goal of inner transformation for initiates.
But it is also intended, as a byproduct of that process, to help
bring peace to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initiation mimics the process of being reborn and passing
through childhood,'' said P. Jeffrey Hopkins, a professor of
Tibetan and religious studies at the University of Virginia. But at
each stage, he added, the participants are being led to create
within themselves ``an altruistic and wise consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins served as the Dalai Lama's translator, for his speeches
and books, for a decade until 1989. He is also the author of an
English translation of the Dalai Lama's discourses of the ritual,
``Kalachakra Tantra'' (Wisdom Publications).
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings about internal peace as a way to bring peace to the
world,'' he said. Its effect, he added, is that ``one should
experience a dedication to the welfare of others, an expansion of
one's field of compassion and altruism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more effective the initiation is,'' he said, ``the longer
and more efficacious the sense of altruism is that will come from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   What does the ritual look like?
</P>
<P>
   Timothy J. McNeill, Wisdom's publisher, has undergone it several
times. ``His Holiness is on the throne,'' McNeill said, referring
to the Dalai Lama. ``And you're sitting in the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of monks on stage with His Holiness,'' he
said. ``Off sort of facing His Holiness to the right is the
Kalachakra house, which is an elaborate structure.'' The key
element of the latter is a mandala, a complex, essentially circular
design, created out of colored sand over the course of several days
before the ceremony by Buddhist monks. In this case, the mandala
represents a palace, which initiates are asked to visualize, as
they are mentally guided through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the ceremony, you're sort of walked through,'' McNeill
said. ```Now you're at the north entrance to the palace.' You're
visualizing these various aspects of consciousness, or mind.''
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony's end, in a vivid demonstration of the
impermanence of matter, the Dalai Lama goes over to the mandala
with a broom and sweeps it up. The sand is then placed in an urn,
McNeill said. ``And then he pours it into a body of water. That's
an important part of the closure of the ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeill described the overall experience as profound in its
impact on those who participate. ``From the initiator's point of
view, your mind is being changed, you're being blessed,'' he said.

SE HABLA ESPANOL? BORDER CITY ADOPTS `SAFE HAVEN,' SPANISH-ONLY
ORDINANCES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CENIZO, Texas _ Like so many communities along the Rio
Grande, this hardscrabble town on the river's edge seems to be
neither Mexico nor the United States, but some of both.
</P>
<P>
   So, local officials reasoned, why not conduct city government
meetings in Spanish, the language nearly everyone speaks? And why
not establish the town as a ``safe haven'' for illegal immigrants,
a nod to the traditional back and forth of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Last week El Cenizo's mayor and two city commissioners did just
that, establishing one ordinance that makes Spanish the town's
official language and another that forbids employees of El Cenizo _
there's only one _ from cooperating with the U.S. Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here so much to help illegal immigrants as we are to
help the people of El Cenizo,'' said Gloria Romo, a city
commissioner. ``Besides, the only true citizens are the American
Indians. Everyone else came from another country.''
</P>
<P>
   While municipal safe havens are by no means unprecedented in the
United States, there are few _ if any _ along the 2,000-mile
U.S.-Mexico border, which of late has been increasingly militarized
to turn back a steady stream of illegal traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially more explosive, however, is El Cenizo's
Spanish-language measure, believed to be the first of its kind in
the United States. Already English-only advocates are calling this
sun-beaten town of 7,500 just down river from Laredo, Texas, the
beginning of the end of a truly United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we've been predicting all along: the
Balkanization of America along linguistic lines,'' said Tim
Schultz, director of communications for U.S. English, a
Washington-based advocacy group. ``These people don't consider
English their first language. In fact they don't really consider
themselves American.''
</P>
<P>
   As volatile as both ordinances would seem to be in an era of
English-only measures and efforts to deny illegal immigrants access
to health care and public education, city leaders say their action
stems from practicality rather than politics.
</P>
<P>
   Because the city had been conducting its council meetings in
English, few residents attended, leaving local politics the domain
of the few. And while officials clearly sought tolerance for
illegal immigrants, they enacted their immigration measure largely
to dispel rumors that City Hall was behind a local Border Patrol
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily, Border Patrol agents descend upon this community
of vacant lots, trailers and mom-and-pop groceries, most frequently
stopping the bus that runs back and forth to Laredo. Almost
everyone has a story about being pulled aside by the men in green.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want everyone to know that we're not the ones calling
`la migra,''' said Flora Barton, a city commissioner, referring to
the Immigration and Naturalization Service in border lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   Locals are supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Romero, a homemaker in El Cenizo, wants the Border Patrol
to stop bothering local residents ``who have children that go to
school and own their own land.'' As for the Spanish-language
measure, she said, ``If you speak English and Spanish and I speak
only Spanish, why not speak in Spanish?''
</P>
<P>
   The safe-haven ordinance forbids city employees from inquiring
into the immigration status of residents, a moot point since only
federal officials are authorized to do so. But the measure also
bars city employees from cooperating with the INS, under which the
Border Patrol operates.
</P>
<P>
   Such language potentially brings El Cenizo into conflict with a
federal law passed in 1996 that makes it illegal for state and
local governments to prohibit an employee from cooperating with
immigration officers. New York City, which adopted its own
safe-haven ordinance, challenged that law in court and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials say they do not intend to challenge El
Cenizo's safe-haven measure, but they say they will go to court if
the city actively hinders the work of federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeking to establish an adversarial relationship,''
said Russ Bergeron, director of media relations for the INS. ``On
the other hand, a lawsuit becomes necessary if a conflict arises.''
</P>
<P>
   El Cenizo officials, who relied heavily on a local law school
student to craft their ordinance, seemed truly surprised that their
measure would generate so much controversy. Though Mayor Rafael
Rodriguez is not backing down, both commissioners seemed almost
apologetic about taking on the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be against the law,'' said Barton. ``If
somebody comes to me and says this is against the law, we'll amend
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the language ordinance, the change in local law may have
been to assist the mayor as well as the town's residents. A U.S.
citizen who nonetheless came here illegally from Mexico years ago,
Rodriguez speaks no English.
</P>
<P>
   Still, El Cenizo is home to dozens here like the mayor. A former
colonia that sprang up on the edge of Laredo only to be
incorporated as a city 10 years ago, nearly all of its residents
are immigrants or the spouses or children of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Today the town has running water, electricity and paved roads,
conveniences that can't be taken for granted in the desperately
poor Tex-Mex borderlands.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say previous administrations took advantage of
the language barrier, conducting city business in English and
keeping the majority of residents clueless about municipal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rodriguez says, ``The idea is to communicate with the
people. When the meetings were in English, that didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the language measure, all city business, postings and
notices will be in Spanish, while ordinances will continue to be
written in English with translations available. Last Thursday, the
town held its first-ever city meeting in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration advocates applauded, saying that while the action
taken by El Cenizo underscores the growing political power of
Hispanics, it by no means undermines the nation-building process.
</P>
<P>
   But anti-illegal immigration groups see the borderlands slipping
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This portends what more and more communities are going to look
like,'' said John Keeley, director of communications for the
Federation for American Immigration Reform. ``This speaks to what
the trend will be.''

TEAMSTERS AND U.S. AT ODDS ON NEED FOR FURTHER MONITORING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years after federal officials gained a strict supervisory
role over the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in an effort
to rid it of mob control, the union's new leadership is pushing
hard to get the government out.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters president, James Hoffa, who took office in March,
has made ending federal supervision his chief goal, insisting that
the giant union can run its own affairs now that the Mafia's hold
on it has been broken.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa says that the supervision, unprecedented in its scope and
duration, is too meddlesome and expensive. For all the millions
that the mob has bled from the union, many Teamsters complain about
the $82 million the union has had to pay to finance the decade-long
federal effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Teamsters union is as free of corruption as any great
institution,'' Hoffa said.
</P>
<P>
   With Hoffa saying the Teamsters will no longer reflexively
endorse Democrats, as it did under his predecessor, Ron Carey, some
union officials say he may ask presidential candidates to support
an end to supervision as the price of endorsement by the
1.4-million-member union.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials acknowledge that the Teamsters has been
cleaned up substantially but are uneasy about withdrawing, saying
pockets of corruption remain in a powerful union that was long
infamous for shakedowns, intimidation, payoffs and looted pension
funds.
</P>
<P>
   These officials argue that it would be unwise to cut short the
supervision _ the most ambitious government effort to clean up a
single union _ which they say has largely succeeded by obtaining
the expulsions or resignations of more than 250 Teamster officials
accused of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cleanup has done a tremendous amount of good, but it would
be a mistake to say the union is corruption-free, mob-free,'' said
Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan and the federal
official in charge of the supervision. ``You don't want to say
prematurely, `It's fixed.' You don't want to backtrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa has vowed to keep organized crime out of the union, long
considered the nation's most mob-dominated, saying the Mafia was
responsible for the disappearance of his father, the Teamsters
leader James Hoffa, in 1975. The elder Hoffa, who led the union
from 1957 to 1971 and went to prison for jury tampering,
disappeared after promising to end mob control as he campaigned to
regain the union's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But many critics of the younger Hoffa assert that he has ties to
a corrupt old guard, and they question his motives for wanting to
end federal oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with prosecutors and Teamster leaders indicate that
federal supervision has accomplished something that 40 previous
years of investigations and prosecutions had failed to accomplish _
it has rid the Teamsters of mob control.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Mafia not only used to handpick the union's
president and the heads of many locals, but also strongarmed the
union into lending mobsters hundreds of millions of dollars from
its pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union has come an enormous way since the 1980s,'' said
Michael Cherkasky, the federal elections monitor. ``The union is
not controlled by the mob anymore. At local after local where there
was pervasive corruption and complete control by organized crime,
you see a sea change.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, law enforcement officials say the cleanup is far
from over. Some mob influence remains, and in a union with 600
locals, including truck drivers, warehouse workers, security guards
and flight attendants, an unsettling number of officials continue
to steal union money or commit other crimes, though on a far
smaller scale than in decades past.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials point to stubborn problems like Chicago's
Local 714, which represents movie-truck drivers and trade show
workers. A federal oversight board ordered it into trusteeship in
1996 after finding the local's leaders guilty of nepotism and doing
business with movie-truck companies owned by relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The local's principal officer, William Hogan, Chicago's most
powerful Teamster, was disgraced into leaving the union and
dropping his campaign for secretary-treasurer on the the Hoffa
slate.
</P>
<P>
   But many members complain that a corrupt old guard is back
because last year Hogan's son, Robert, won the local's top post,
and he appointed his father as Local 714's organizing director and
his uncle as executive director.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there have been shining examples of cleansed
locals. For decades, Teamsters Local 560 was a piggy bank for the
mob and was considered the nation's single most corrupt union
local. It was run by Anthony Provenzano, a captain in the Genovese
family, who was sentenced to life in prison for murdering a popular
union rival and who, prosecutors say, had another Teamster murdered
for rubbing him the wrong way at a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But after a trusteeship purged the local of more than a dozen
mob associates, members attending the local's recent monthly
meeting did not hesitate to criticize or joke with Local 560's
popular new president, Pete Brown, whom federal monitors have
vetted as clean.
</P>
<P>
   The federal oversight has been unprecedented in its size and
invasiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed monitors have overseen other unions, including
the Laborers International Union of North America, which many
labor-relations experts consider the most corrupt union in the
country today. But those unions, in effect, were allowed to handle
their own cleanups.
</P>
<P>
   While Teamster officials retained the powers to negotiate
contracts and handle most union matters, the anti-corruption work
was given to federal authorities: a government-appointed
investigations officer, with a staff of a dozen investigators; a
three-person review board to adjudicate corruption cases, and a
government-appointed elections monitor, with dozens of assistants,
to try to insure clean union elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters have had to pay $17 million for the three-person
review board, the investigation officer and their staff, while $38
million went to federal monitors to conduct three nationwide
Teamsters elections.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of mob control, law-enforcement officials say, the
Teamsters has again become a union dedicated to winning its members
better wages and working conditions, rather than a criminal
enterprise that extorted payoffs from employers.
</P>
<P>
   The national economy has also benefited because mob extortion
amounted to a criminal tax of several percent on many goods moved
by truck. Already, in New York City, authorities estimate that
ending mob domination of the union has saved the construction
industry millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the Teamsters was so central to the prosperity of
many crime families that breaking their hold has hurt them badly,
the authorities say, denying the Mafia millions in profits a year
and a dependable place to employ mobsters and their associates.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate that the union can clean its own house, Hoffa
recently appointed a respected former federal prosecutor from New
Jersey, Edwin Stier _ the man who cleaned up New Jersey's Local 560
_ to head an in-house, anti-corruption effort.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa has also begun talks with the Clinton administration and
several members of Congress with the aim of persuading the
government to end its supervision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been under government supervision for 10 years,''
Hoffa said. ``It's time for a fresh review of this.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the union has attacked the trustees of several
locals as greedy for charging hundreds of thousands of dollars per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White, the federal prosecutor, and other government
officials declined to say outright whether supervision should be
ended, saying they were still weighing the matter. But several
former federal prosecutors were more emphatic about the need to
continue supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five decades of organized corruption in a union,
corruption does not go away in one year or 10,'' said Randy Mastro,
who as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan oversaw the
racketeering lawsuit that forced the Teamsters to accept federal
supervision in 1989, after 40 years of failed efforts by the
government to end the Mafia's chokehold.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, sought to place the union under federal
supervision as part of a comprehensive strategy to kick corrupt
officials out and keep them out. It named 26 Mafia leaders and all
18 of the union's board members as defendants, accusing the board
of failing to fight corruption and the mob bosses of controlling
four Teamster presidents, including Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors outlined an encyclopedia of racketeering:
extortion, sweetheart contracts, no-show jobs, skimming off dues
money, taking kickbacks from vendors, awarding contracts to
relatives and accepting bribes to abort unionization drives.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing years of litigation and millions in legal fees, Teamster
leaders agreed in 1989 to the most far-reaching federal supervision
of any national union. The 1989 agreement set no time limit on the
supervision and established the first rank-and-file elections for
the Teamsters presidency to give members the power to vote out
corrupt leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since, the investigations officer, Charles
Carberry, a former federal prosecutor, has charged two dozen
Teamsters with being members of organized crime, including the
heads of two large Chicago locals and the president of New York
City's Teamster council. He has also charged 60 Teamsters with
associating with mobsters and 150 more with financial wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Carberry said mob control is gone but that mob influence remains
in some locals along with plenty of garden-variety graft. ``You
won't see a capo of the Gambino family as secretary-treasurer of a
local anymore,'' he said. ``But one may anticipate they will try to
maintain whatever influence they still can, although more subtly
than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the debate over ending supervision can find ample
evidence within the sprawling union to support their view.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want supervision ended can point to successful
cleanups like that at Local 282 on Long Island, which Carlo
Gambino, once New York's boss of crime bosses, had turned into
family property.
</P>
<P>
   The local's 3,000 members deliver concrete to New York's
construction industry, and the Gambino family recognized that if it
controlled Local 282 and its deliveries, it could easily extort
money from builders by threatening delays.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, federal prosecutors gained an extortion conviction of
the local's president, John Cody, who was so feared by builders
that they provided him with chauffeurs and helped build his beach
house. His successor, Bobby Sasso, also had the Gambinos' blessing,
but he was pressured into resigning in 1992 after the review board
charged him with extortion.
</P>
<P>
   When yet another mob associate became president, the federal
cleanup went into high gear. Local 282 was put into trusteeship,
Carberry brought charges that resulted in the removal of 22 local
officials, and one of the local's trustees, Milton Mollen, stripped
50 local officials of their posts because of mob ties, theft or
other wrongdoing. Nowadays all Local 282 officials must pass an FBI
screening.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago local members were too intimidated to talk at union
meetings, but nowadays Gary Labarbera, the trustee who runs the
local's day-to-day affairs, welcomes rank-and-file input as a way
to strengthen the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it would seem to be pretty free of any
organized crime element,'' Mollen said.
</P>
<P>
   But those who favor continued supervision point to locals still
troubled by mob ties. In 1991, Carberry brought charges against
four officers of Local 377 in Youngstown, Ohio: two for extortion
and two for engaging in a gun battle. But as recently as last
February, Carberry accused one of the local's shop stewards with
finding a construction job for a mob enforcer newly released from
prison, while the oversight board expelled one of the local's
leaders for running a gambling operation for Pittsburgh's mob boss.
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts outside the Teamsters are also debating whether
federal supervision should end. The debate involves two clashing
views for American unionism: one that unions, like corporations,
should run themselves with minimal government interference, and the
other that government oversight is the best tool to protect union
members and the public against predatory labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hurd, a Cornell University professor of labor relations,
said, ``The supervision has gone on too long and has been too
detailed and it's well beyond any kind of rational benefit to the
organization or to society. I think it should be scaled back a lot
and probably ended, although I think it's very important for the
government to continue to keep an eye on the Teamsters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Herman Benson, founder of the Association for Union
Democracy, a watchdog group, argued that supervision should
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a disaster to remove the oversight because Hoffa's
main aim is to get rid of government supervision so he can run the
union the way he sees fit. The danger in the present situation is
that he was the candidate of the old guard that wants to crush the
opposition and put the union back on the road where it was, if not
under the domination of organized crime, at least under the
domination of suspect elements. The only thing that stands in the
way is government oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa has repeatedly insisted that he is intent on eradicating
corruption. As evidence, he points to his hiring of Stier, his
setting up of an anti-corruption effort and his placing of several
corrupt locals into trusteeship.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said it was preposterous for anyone to suggest that he
would allow the return of mob influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that my father was, I believe,
murdered by the mob,'' he said in an interview before he was
elected. ``The mob will never come back into the Teamsters union. I
will see to that.''

RESULTS OF IOWA STRAW POLL WILL BREAK SOME GOP CANDIDATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ As Lamar Alexander tended to the pork chops
Friday at the Iowa State Fair, he was surrounded by television
cameras eager to catch the GOP presidential contender before
Saturday's Republican straw poll, a fund-raising event for the
state party that has evolved as a test of the candidates' strength.
</P>
<P>
   The event in Ames is assumed by many to be Alexander's last
stand in his battle to remain viable in a crowded field that
includes Texas Gov. George W. Bush, magazine mogul Steve Forbes,
former American Red Cross chief Elizabeth Dole, former Vice
President Dan Quayle and conservative activists Gary Bauer and Pat
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who campaigned across Iowa for the first time this week
Friday and who leads in statewide polls, has boasted he will win
the contest. And many observers believe Forbes, who has waged an
expensive and extensive campaign, will come in second or even best
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But it is anybody's guess how the rest of the field will stack
up at an event that is expected to draw as many as 15,000 hard-core
activists.
</P>
<P>
   While critics have derided the straw poll as a meaningless
barometer of political success, and a fund-raiser disguised as an
exercise in democracy, the conventional wisdom has been that those
candidates who do poorly will find it increasingly difficult to
raise the money necessary to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The straw poll will not determine who the party's nominee will
be. But it will determine who it will not be,'' said Steve Grubbs,
the former chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, who is now
working for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are particularly high for candidates such as
Alexander and Quayle, who are already struggling to raise money and
who have remained at the bottom of public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending more time in the state than any other
candidate, Alexander has had trouble competing against the
well-funded Bush and Forbes operations, which have been shelling
out hundreds of thousands of dollars to get their backers to the
straw poll. The Republican Party charges $25 a ticket for the
event, which entitles Iowa residents to vote for a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   While all the candidates have bought up tickets to distribute to
supporters, the Bush and Forbes campaigns could afford to do more
mailings to supporters and to provide extensive bus transportation
to get them to Ames. In addition, Forbes has been blitzing the
state with radio ads and is expected to host a half-hour call-in
infomercial Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is clearly miffed at these efforts, contending that
some candidates are substituting money for the kind of traditional
retail politics that he says will produce the party's superior
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes a better president? Coming to Iowa a hundred times
or raising a hundred million dollars?'' the former Tennessee
governor and U.S. education secretary asked. Alexander contended
that candidates such as Bush, who has raised $37 million, will be
unprepared to do battle with Democratic front-runner Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he going to do in a debate with Gore? He gets a tough
question (and says) ... bring me my pile of money,'' Alexander
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded to such remarks by saying that while money helps,
it isn't everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win elections with money alone. It requires message,
turnout and organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has followed the traditional primary election formula,
returning to the state repeatedly after his failed 1996
presidential effort and building an organization filled with state
GOP leaders such as former Gov. Terry Branstad.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush, who only announced in June that he was a
candidate, has only visited the state a handful of times. While
Forbes has tapped into his personal fortune to fund his campaign,
he has also been actively campaigning in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is clearly annoyed that he has not been rewarded for
playing by the rules. His comments are infused with barbs directed
at Bush and Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his lack of presence in the state, Alexander
sarcastically remarked, ``Mr. Bush must have had an emergency
meeting with the Texas Legislature. He can't be here.``
</P>
<P>
   And commenting on the outcome of the straw poll, he said, ``In a
straw poll, money talks. So Mr. Bush and Mr. Forbes ought to be
arrested if they don't win tomorrow.``
</P>
<P>
   Although Alexander initially said he had to do well in the straw
poll to remain a candidate, he now says he must ``exceed
expectations'' set by the media.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates were also doing some last-minute
campaigning in the state Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived Friday evening at the Des Moines airport with his
confidence intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go. Tomorrow is a day where we'll see how hard
I've worked and how hard our organization has worked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began Friday by meeting with about 30 Hispanics at
Jalepeno's Mexican Restaurant in Davenport, Iowa, though many of
those present were from nearby Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the group that he is ``working hard'' to make sure the
``Republican Party is welcoming new faces.'' He said he also wants
to make certain the American dream is for everybody, especially the
nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're having a little trouble learning, maybe it's because
English isn't your first language, we're going to give you some
extra time, some extra focus, some extra help,'' Bush said. ``There
are no second-rate children and no second-rate dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ontiveros, a businessman from Milan, Ill., organized the
event. He said he had met with Bush's father once at the White
House as one of the nation's top 100 Hispanic businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Ontiveros said he was disappointed that many Democratic
Hispanics whom he invited to the breakfast refused to come because
he believed they would change their minds if they listened to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult getting people here because they are all
Democrats,'' Ontiveros said. ``But I know one person who is a very
active Democrat who was here today who said, 'Now, I've got to

   The straw poll event begins at 4:30 p.m. at the Hilton Coliseum
on the campus of Iowa State University. The eight participating
candidates will each give 10-minute speeches. And ticket holders,
who are Iowa residents, will be allowed to vote between 3 p.m. and
8:15 p.m. The results will be announced at 9 p.m. The speeches will
be broadcast live on C-SPAN.

<P>
   The fund-raiser and straw poll has come under increasing
criticism this year for turning into too much of a carnival, with
candidates competing to see who can persuade voters with the most
lavish food spreads and high powered celebrities in the hours
leading up to the voting.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign is boasting that it will have an
air-conditioned tent near the coliseum where people can hear
entertainers such as Christian singer Debbie Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Bush clearly hopes that a parade of current and former
professional jocks such as ex-Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger
Staubach and former University of Iowa football coach Hayden Fry,
will motivate his supporters. The governor is also hosting a skeet
shooting event with the 1998 Olympic skeet shooting gold medalist
Kim Rhode.

COMMENTARY: WHAT TONY SOPRANO COULD TEACH BILL CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., in 1st graf, the double parentheses should be set as single
brackets) 
(yn) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this late date in the Bill Clinton melodrama, it's no scoop
that the man has long been in serious need of a good shrink. If
anything, the compulsive lying may be the least of his aberrations.
I'm still amazed that so little has been made of this curious
sentence in the Starr report: ``The longer conversations ((between
the president and Monica Lewinsky)) often occurred after their
sexual contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there another man in creation who talks to women more after
sex than before?
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a scoop that Clinton's ills are rooted in his
childhood, since that's the case with most troubled people, not
just a reckless, cigar-fixated product of the redolently Freudian
venue of Hot Springs, Ark. The real question raised by the entire
Talk magazine fracas is why a man of his age, resources and
intelligence _ not to mention public duties _ has not had proper
help for a treatable condition. Had he sought it, he, his family
and the country would all be happier today.
</P>
<P>
   This question, however, was rarely raised in the fatuous debate
over whether Hillary Rodham Clinton had made an ``abuse excuse''
for her husband by citing his travails as a 4-year-old to her Talk
interviewer, Lucinda Franks. That debate was easily resolved: it's
there in black and white that Ms. Franks, not Mrs. Clinton, brought
up the subject of Bill Clinton's rough childhood, and it's also
there in black and white that Mrs. Clinton said of her husband,
``He's responsible for his own behavior whether I'm there or 100
miles away.'' But if the First Lady was guilty of only trying to
explain her husband's history and not, as was widely charged, of
floating an excuse for his adult transgressions, she, like him, is
hardly off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has some dysfunction in their families,'' Mrs.
Clinton also says in Talk. ``They have to deal with it. You don't
just walk away if you love someone _ you help the person.'' Those
are the right things to say, but there's no evidence either in the
highly detailed interview or the public record or in her husband's
now excessively documented private behavior that Mrs. Clinton
actually helped steer her husband to effective professional help,
despite her stated knowledge of the symptoms and history of what
she calls his ``weakness.'' Though the president did submit to some
welcome pastoral counseling _ or at least did so once the
impeachment wolf was at his door _ the White House has repeatedly
knocked down the possibility that he has received any psychological
treatment from a doctor. Instead, as Ms. Franks reports, enabling
and denial still rule, even now: ``Public office has prevented the
president from seeking therapy, but friends told me they expect him
to after leaving the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about too little, too late. This is compartmentalization at
its most self-destructive. Public office should no more prevent a
president from seeking psychotherapy than it should prevent him
from seeking chemotherapy. And the Clintons, of all people, should
know that better than anyone _ they've made mental-health care a
political cause. In the 1992 campaign they joined with Al and
Tipper Gore to court boomers by talking openly of their past
experiences with family counseling, occasioned by the drug bust of
Clinton's half-brother and the hospitalization of the Gores' son
after he was hit by a car. ``By not confronting problems early,''
Clinton said all too prophetically at that time, ``you end up
making things worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly _ and just two months ago _ the Clintons and the Gores
held a full-day White House Conference on Mental Health. The
supposed point of that event, they said, was to counter the myths
of mental illness, thereby encouraging the frightened or
embarrassed to seek help. ``Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed
of, but stigma and bias shame us all,'' said Clinton in a radio
address. If mental illness is left untreated, he said at the
conference, ``the loss of human potential is staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his lofty preaching to the rest of us, perhaps it was
fear of just such bias that explains (but does not excuse)
Clinton's inability to seek treatment for his own condition, even
at the cost of putting himself and everyone around him through
hell. Perhaps he felt that while a sports hero like Mark McGwire or
a TV news star like Mike Wallace or even the country's most popular
fictional Mafia boss, Tony Soprano, can flourish after going public
with their mental-health histories, such revelations still condemn
a chief executive to charges of weakness. But isn't it weaker to
let one's emotional problems metastasize rather than address them?
What does it say about our culture that it may be easier for a
president to live down having oral sex with an intern in the Oval
Office than having oral discourse in a doctor's office?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lynn Rivers of Michigan, the only current member of the
House or Senate to talk openly about battling a mental illness
(manic depression, for 20 years), points out that politicians would
rather admit to alcoholism or drug abuse than to receiving
psychiatric care, even perhaps for a milder ailment. The record
does not contradict her. She and the late Florida Gov. Lawton
Chiles are the only two front-rank American politicians to be open
about their histories since Thomas Eagleton was thrown off the
Democratic ticket in 1972 after admitting he had been treated for
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it could be argued that we are retrogressing rather than
progressing in attitudes about mental illness in public life.
Joshua Wolf Shenk, who is writing a book about Abraham Lincoln's
lifelong bout with what would now be diagnosed as depression, notes
that Lincoln called melancholy ``a misfortune not a fault.''
Lincoln wrote and spoke openly of his ``moods &AMP; gloom,'' Shenk
says, and friends regarded that melancholy as a source of concern
and sadness, but not shame.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the White House conference, Tipper Gore tried to
counter the taboos that can surround mental illness by going public
about her own experience with depression. But for all her good work
on behalf of this issue, Mrs. Gore gave a mixed message similar to
that of the Clintons. As the otherwise approving Rivers puts it,
the vice president's wife ``could have contributed more by being
more specific.'' Mrs. Gore refused to describe the duration or most
details of her treatment, and was careful at each stop of her
staged self-outing, from USA Today to ``Oprah,'' to avoid use of
the word ``doctor,'' let alone a doctor whose professional title
might include the prefix ``psych-.'' (She said she had been treated
by a social worker rather than a psychiatric social worker.) Even
as Mrs. Gore made a cause of stamping out the shame associated with
being treated for mental illness, her mystifying circumlocutions
sent the signal, consciously or not, that she wasn't entirely free
of shame herself.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of Washington's halting efforts to address this
subject _ and most lawmakers would prefer to avoid it altogether _
can be far more profound than the Starr report. The more
obfuscation and fear that surround mental illnesses of all types
and their treatment, the less hope we have of ameliorating public
policy and prejudices that leave these illnesses undertreated,
untreated and mistreated. At the gravest end of the mental-health
spectrum, this failure produces catastrophes that are fast becoming
a fixture of the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Columbine, no one stated our predicament
more acutely than Dr. W. Walter Menninger, of the famed clinic
bearing his family's name in Topeka, Kan. Speaking to the American
Psychiatric Association in Washington, he pinpointed the national
hypocrisy: ``We recognize incidents of mental illness, and at the
same time we stigmatize people who suffer from it or seek help to
deal with it. We say `seek treatment,' but at the same time we
limit access, and availability, and insurance to pay for it, and in
the end make it more difficult to get treatment. There is a
disconnectedness between what we say we need as a society and what
we do as a society.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of this schism between words and actions, and the
piecemeal mental-health system it leads to, cut across all
demographic and cultural lines. As the White House sex farce was
preventable, so, conceivably, was the tragic rampage of this week's
shooter, the latest human time bomb who appears to have entered
that so-called system only to fall through its cracks.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dalai Lama, 14th in a line of spiritual leaders
of Tibet stretching back 600 years, was in the midst of responding
to a reporter's question about Buddhism's growing popularity in the
West when he paused to poke a little fun at the expectations that
people can place on him.
</P>
<P>
   He had given a public talk in England, he said, and told his
audience that those who had come out of curiosity would be fine,
but those who had ``great expectations'' might be disappointed. As
for those who expected him to perform miracles or healings, the
Dalai Lama told them such beliefs were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, if there's a genuine healer there, then I need
one,'' he said, gesturing at the back of his neck, as if to
indicate soreness or stiffness. He laughed in delight at the
recollection, a full, open laugh that seemed to invite all around
to join in.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disarmingly friendly and modest moment that those who
know him say is typical of a man who has spent 40 years in exile
from his homeland, who is intensely aware of the political and
religious repression of 6 million Tibetans living there, yet who
speaks with immense seriousness of the need for compassion and
reconciliation among all people.
</P>
<P>
   His message is both simple and compelling, one that offers hope
on both individual and societal levels. And that may be what is
proving so attractive about him to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama arrived in New York on Wednesday to give a series
of teachings, one of which, Sunday at 11 a.m. in Central Park's
East Meadow, will be free and open to the public. Although he has
visited the United States often since he first came here 20 years
ago, he has probably never been so widely recognized nor so admired
here as now.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, for example, people have called the offices of
Tricycle magazine, a Manhattan quarterly that focuses on Buddhism
in America, seeking information on how to see the Dalai Lama. James
Shaheen, the magazine's publisher, said, ``There are people who
call who genuinely say, `I'm going to learn something that's going
to help my life be more peaceful.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is something compelling to Americans about
nonviolence,'' Shaheen said. ``We live in a very violent society
and a lot of us want relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama has a book, ``The Art of Happiness'' (Riverhead),
on the best-seller lists. Another, ``Ethics for a New Millennium''
(Riverhead), hit the bookstores last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter, he offers his ideas about a universal ethic for
living that depends on common sense rather than religious
tradition. He writes that ``establishing binding ethical principles
is possible when we take as our starting point the observation that
we all desire happiness and wish to avoid suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   P. Jeffrey Hopkins, a professor of Tibetan and religious studies
at the University of Virginia, said that part of the Dalai Lama's
appeal is the accessibility of what he teaches. ``I think that he
worked very hard to fashion a message not just for Buddhists, and
not just for religious people, but for all people,'' said Hopkins,
who served as the Dalai Lama's translator for his speeches and
books for a decade, until 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the teaching, the Dalai Lama possesses an unusual
ability to make personal his encounters with people, Hopkins said.
``It's as if he's looking at and contacting your feeling,'' he
said. ``He's qualitatively different in a very common way _ not in
an impossible, transcendent way, except you get the feeling, this
is what transcendence is.''
</P>
<P>
   Another person who has met him often, the Rev. Joan Brown
Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of Churches,
said, ``There's a certain resoluteness and clarity about who he is,
and that has a certain appeal in a time when leadership is so
questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in an East Side hotel suite, the Dalai Lama sat
cross-legged on the seat of an armchair, wearing the maroon and
yellow robes of a Tibetan Buddhist monk. He spoke in English,
occasionally consulting with a translator who sat nearby. Although
he had agreed to the meeting only two hours earlier, shoehorning it
into what aides described as a packed schedule, he never once
turned his wrist to glance at his watch. Nor did he seem in any
hurry to bring things to a close.
</P>
<P>
   At 64, he is regarded by many Americans as a sort of Buddhist
equivalent to the Roman Catholic pope. But among Tibetans, he is
the living embodiment of the bodhisattva (enlightened being) of
compassion, and the reincarnation of his predecessor Dalai Lamas.
Enthroned in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa in 1940 at age 4, he has
lived in Dharamsala, India, head of a government in exile since
1959.
</P>
<P>
   On a secular level, he was honored for his commitment to
nonviolence with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism, in all its varieties, has been growing in public
acceptance and in the number of its practitioners in the United
States since the Dalai Lama first visited two decades ago. ``The
Complete Guide to Buddhist America'' (Shambala, 1998), a book for
which the Dalai Lama wrote the preface, reports that the number of
Buddhist meditation centers nationwide more than doubled from 1987
to 1997, to more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   What has helped its acceptance may be the increasing
articulation of Buddhism as a socially concerned force. ``These are
developments in Buddhism itself which make it a comfortable
dialogue partner for us and possibly a refuge,'' said Christopher
Queen, dean of students for Continuing Education and also a
lecturer on the study of religion at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of how the faith is viewed comes from the experience
of Nicholas Vreeland, director of the Tibet Center in New York, who
recently returned to this country after spending 14 years in a
Tibetan Buddhist monastery in south India. In the early 1980s, when
he appeared in his monk's robes, passers-by looked at him askance,
he said. ``Walking around 14 years ago in these robes and walking
around today is a totally different experience,'' he said. ``I feel
people support me.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about Buddhism's growing popularity here, the
Dalai Lama struck no note of triumphalism.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism as a path toward wisdom and inner calm, founded in the
2,500-year-old teachings of Siddhartha Guatama, the Buddha, has
attracted people seeking to deepen capacities for compassion and
forgiveness, he said. ``To some people, the Buddhist way of
approach is a more analytical way, more rational'' approach to that
end, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others may be drawn to it because it is new in the United
States and human nature loves novelty, he said. ``And, of course,
there might be some who have maybe wrong impressions of Buddhism,''
thinking meditation can quickly lead to ``instant enlightenment,''
he said. ``That's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama also quoted from the late Cardinal Basil Hume,
the Roman Catholic archbishop in Britain, that an interest in
spirituality is rising in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similarly, the interest toward inner values is increasing,''
he said. People have lots of material goods, but are not happy, he
said. ``People begin to realize that material facility alone is not
the full answer for life. That's my impression.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, Buddhism offers a practical prescription for living, a
spirituality based on obtaining peace and purpose, rather than
expectation of an afterlife. In elaborating the Four Noble Truths,
the Buddha taught that life contains suffering, but that there is a
way out, that wisdom and peace can be achieved through a change of
attitude and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The actor Richard Gere, who has known the Dalai Lama for two
decades, said that after previously studying Japanese-style Zen
Buddhism, he found in Tibetan Buddhism a more intellectual approach
to attaining spiritual wisdom and also a greater emphasis on
achieving compassion.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of Tibet, the Dalai Lama advocates what he calls
the ``middle way'' seeking self-government within China that would
preserve Tibet's spiritual heritage and permit respect for human
rights and democratic freedoms. He has called for protection of
Tibet's natural environment and for an end to the ``transfer'' of
large numbers of Chinese into Tibet, through which Tibetans have
become a minority in their own land.
</P>
<P>
   But these are grim times. As of last fall, he said, the Chinese
government had cut off informal contact with him, and repression of
Tibetan life and religion has become harsher. At same time, he
said, younger Tibetans are becoming more impatient.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, he said, there is ``almost no hope'' for the
solution he envisions. ``But in the long run, I'm optimistic,'' he
said. ``The main reason is, the current situation of Tibet for the
Chinese government policy is neither good for Tibetans nor for the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government, their top priority is stability and
unity,'' the Dalai Lama said. ``The current policy is actually
counterproductive in that respect. So I believe my middle approach
is the way to achieve genuine stability and stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama has pursued a nonviolent approach for 40 years,
ever since he and about 100,000 other Tibetans fled before the
Chinese army. That period has been longer than other historic,
nonviolent campaigns, like the mass movements for India's
independence and civil rights for African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really true nonviolence of the mind, which is true
spirituality, it takes a long time,'' said Gere. ``But the promise
of this approach is, once it is done, it is complete,'' he said.

 &HT;    Report to Congress on Olympic bid to be late
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ King &AMP; Spalding attorney Griffin Bell's report to
Congress on the Atlanta Olympic bid may not be ready until
lawmakers return to work after the August recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm planning on this being the last report,'' Bell, a former
U.S. attorney general, said Friday while indicating that he
intended for his revised account of Atlanta's bid tactics to be as
thorough and accurate as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A previous report signed by Billy Payne and Andrew Young, who
spearheaded the bid, contained discrepancies with what
congressional investigators uncovered in Atlanta records.
</P>
<P>
   The insufficient report prompted Bell, whose firm has handled
the Atlanta Olympic group's legal affairs since its inception, to
ask permission to amend it.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House Commerce Committee's subcommittee on oversight
and investigations, which is looking for possible violations of
federal bribery laws in the bid, granted Bell's request. Initially,
Bell indicated he might have his supplemental report ready by the
end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not finished the document search,'' he said Friday.
``We've looked at a lot of boxes, and we're almost finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell requested that Atlanta Olympic officials ship 30 boxes of
documents to King &AMP; Spalding's office in Washington for inspection
by his corporate internal investigations unit, which has taken over
responsibility for the congressional inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Eight additional boxes of documents, which Payne and Young say
contain personal papers and private fund-raising data, already had
been sent to the Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   After inspecting records in these and other boxes, investigators
said they found unreported evidence of scholarships, excessive
travel and expensive gifts for International Olympic Committee
members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Committee is trying to determine if the IOC should
be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Salt Lake City Olympic bribery scandal,
lawmakers raised questions about whether other bidding cities also
used improper inducements to secure the Games.
</P>
<P>
   In its earlier report, Atlanta Olympic officials disclosed three
dozen personal gifts for IOC members that violated a $200 limit,
athletic training funds for several African teens and a $25,000
donation to a South African anti-apartheid group.
</P>
<P>
   Bid officials have said they did not give scholarships, one of
the more serious infractions cited in the Salt Lake scandal.
</P>
<P>
   However, they acknowledge now to have discussed possible
scholarships with many IOC members and placing phone calls to
universities on behalf of the members' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those calls are believed to have resulted in
relatives attending college in the United States. However, Atlanta
officials say they never financed the scholarships and thus felt it
unnecessary to include these efforts in their original report to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   They also acknowledge providing some members and their families
excursions to Disney World in Florida, golf outings in Augusta and
visits to Savannah and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   All of these trips, they contend, were essential to the bid,
which Bell is expected to spell out in his report.

``We've looked at a lot of boxes, and we're almost finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell requested that Atlanta Olympic officials ship 30 boxes of
documents to King &AMP; Spalding's office in Washington for inspection
by his corporate internal investigations unit, which has taken over
responsibility for the congressional inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Eight additional boxes of documents, which Payne and Young say
contain personal papers and private fund-raising data, already had
been sent to the Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   After inspecting records in these and other boxes, investigators
said they found unreported evidence of scholarships, excessive
travel and expensive gifts for International Olympic Committee
members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Committee is trying to determine if the IOC should
be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Salt Lake City Olympic bribery scandal,
lawmakers raised questions about whether other bidding cities also
used improper inducements to secure the Games.
</P>
<P>
   In its earlier report, Atlanta Olympic officials disclosed three
dozen personal gifts for IOC members that violated a $200 limit,
athletic training funds for several African teens and a $25,000
donation to a South African anti-apartheid group.
</P>
<P>
   Bid officials have said they did not give scholarships, one of
the more serious infractions cited in the Salt Lake scandal.
</P>
<P>
   However, they acknowledge now to have discussed possible
scholarships with many IOC members and placing phone calls to
universities on behalf of the members' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those calls are believed to have resulted in
relatives attending college in the United States. However, Atlanta
officials say they never financed the scholarships and thus felt it
unnecessary to include these efforts in their original report to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   They also acknowledge providing some members and their families
excursions to Disney World in Florida, golf outings in Augusta and
visits to Savannah and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   All of these trips, they contend, were essential to the bid,
which Bell is expected to spell out in his report.

<P>
   KIBBUTZ AFIK, Golan Heights _ It's dusk when farmer Dennis Van
Meter drives his big white pickup to the eastern edge of his
avocado, mango and litchi orchard on this windswept plateau.
</P>
<P>
   He stops within a few feet of a barbed-wire fence, jumps down
from his truck, sinks his brown cowboy boots in the dirt, pops open
a beer and gestures to the green mountains and valleys in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Syria,'' he says in the clear tones of a transplanted
Californian, pointing eastward as he adjusts the white baseball cap
that covers a head full of gray-blonde curls. ``And that,'' he
adds, gesturing to the southeast, ``is Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is mine,'' he says, turning toward the rows of litchi
trees that line this southern stretch of the Golan Heights.
``You've heard of the Garden of Eden? I call this the Garden of
Dennis. I planted it, and I'm not leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   When Israeli politicians talk about trading land for peace with
Syria, they mean the orchards Van Meter has spent 16 years of his
life planting.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ehud Barak became prime minister July 6, a new sense of
urgency is evident in the discussions about returning the Golan.
Within 15 months, Barak has said, he expects to reach a deal with
Syrian President Hafez el-Assad. That prospect has left the 17,000
Israeli settlers who have built their lives here feeling
bewildered, angry and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My government invited me here,'' says an indignant Van Meter,
who bristles when referred to as a Jewish settler. ``When I told
them at the consulate in San Francisco that I wanted to move to the
Golan, they said, `Hey that's fantastic.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't suddenly tell us to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent what many Israelis whisper might be an inevitable
climb down from the heights, some of the Golan residents have
reignited a campaign to convince their countrymen that ceding this
strategic plateau to Syria would endanger Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigners are plastering the country with bumper stickers,
busing people in to see the value of the land their government
wants to trade for peace, and lobbying the Knesset, Israel's
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   They are also taking their campaign across the Atlantic Ocean to
try to convince the U.S. Congress that it would be costly and
harmful for the United States if Israel were to give up the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an in-your-face kind of campaign,'' said Van Meter's
wife, Marla, spokeswoman for the Golan Residents' Committee. ``I'm
going to the Knesset ... and saying, `Hi, I'm Marla. Hi, I'm Marla.
Hi, I'm Marla.'''
</P>
<P>
   These settlers say that if the time comes, they don't plan to go
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   They invoke the trauma of leaving Yamit, the Sinai settlement
uprooted in 1982 after Israel's 1979 peace treaty with Egypt. They
say they hope those ugly memories will keep Israelis from wanting
to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yamit was only 3,000 people,'' said Yuval Tidhar, a
37-year-old dairy farmer from the central Golan Heights. ``Here you
have 17,000 people. I can't imagine it happening, all these people
getting on the bus and going to another place. I'll resist.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as hard-core activists pursue their campaign, they are
being undercut by a growing number of their fellow Jews who say
they would be willing to leave their homes if the terms of the
agreement with Syria were good.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 60 percent of the Golan's residents voted for Barak last
May, despite his pre-election promise to put peacemaking with Syria
at the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, the Kibbutz Artzi Movement, a tiny left-wing
organization that has some collective farms on the Golan Heights,
announced that its members would not be ``obstacles to peace'' with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Most settlers on the Golan Heights are left-wingers, people
brought up on the Marxist ideology of collective farms who
traditionally vote for Barak's center-left Labor Party or for
Meretz, a smaller left-wing party that believes in trading land for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the West Bank settlers, Golan residents have not been
forced to confront the possibility of being uprooted until
recently.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Most Golan settlers say they feel torn between their liberal
politics and their desire to continue living on land they feel they
built into a productive place: The Golan Heights provides Israel
with 25 percent of its dairy products, 10 percent of its water, 33
percent of its beef and 50 percent of its apples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very much in the middle, swinging from one side to the
other,'' said dairy farmer Mauricio Betsalel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a really bad idea to leave,'' said Betsalel, who
voted for the Meretz party despite its willingness to give up the
region. ``But if we have to leave, I'm not going to chain myself to
a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Weary of the low-grade guerrilla war in southern Lebanon that
continues to kill or wound Israeli troops, most Israelis say they
believe moving off the Golan Heights is the only way to bring
peace. Until then, they believe, Syria will continue to help supply
the Hezbollah guerrillas fighting to drive the Israelis from a
swath of territory in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, 25 to 35 Israeli soldiers die in Lebanon, prompting
public calls to pull the troops out and increasing pressure on the
politicians to make peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   For many Golan residents like Van Meter, this logic is the
height of lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 years, he's been growing fruit here so close to the
border that sometimes he can see the silhouettes of unarmed Syrian
soldiers walking in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Never has he felt unsafe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we give this back,'' he asks. ``It's the quietest
border in the Middle East. This is what we call peace.''

DEHYDRATION DISORIENTS, BUT DOESN'T HURT, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Severe dehydration like that reportedly suffered by two
Massachusetts men, David Coughlin and Raffi Kodikian, last weekend
in New Mexico, can cause alterations in mental functioning,
including delirium, confusion, disorientation, seizures, difficulty
concentrating and even hallucinations, scientists and physicians
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely to cause severe pain. Kodikian, 25, allegedly
told authorities he killed his 26 year-old traveling companion
because Coughlin begged for an end to his extreme pain from lack of
water in the desert, according to the criminal complaint on file in
court in Carlsbad, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   People who are severely dehydrated ``are very uncomfortable
because they're so thirsty,'' said Dr. Ronenn Roubenoff, associate
professor of medicine and nutrition at Tufts University. ``But I
wouldn't exactly call that pain. That is one of the things I don't
buy about this story, the business of the pain.'' It is possible
that dehydration could cause muscle cramps, especially in the legs,
and this could be painful ``but it would come and go. It wouldn't
be constant agony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Montain , a physiologist who studies fluid balance issues
at the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine in
Natick, agrees that pain is not a typical problem in dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you begin to get dehydrated, you get thirsty. Then you get
vague discomforts. You don't feel good and you're not afraid to
express it. Then you get changes in mood _ you become more
impatient, but more prominently, you feel tired, apathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, as dehydration progresses, you get changes in speech _
it becomes more indistinct and slurred. You may stumble as you
walk. You have dizziness,'' he says. These symptoms often occur
when a person has lost about six percent of normal body mass
through dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Delirium, trouble staying awake and difficulty swallowing
usually occur when a person loses 10 percent of normal body mass,
Montain said.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico officials have said they found urine in Coughlin's
bladder. By itself, noted Roubenoff, that is not enough to
determine whether he was seriously dehydrated. The more important
question, he said, is how concentrated was the urine. If it was
diluted, that would indicate he was not dehydrated; if it was
concentrated, it would fit with evidence that he was.
</P>
<P>
   It is not always easy to determine precisely how dehydrated a
person is after death. But in a living person, a simple ``pinch''
test is often revealing _ if you pinch the skin into a little tent
and it holds that shape, the person is probably dehydrated. Other
signs are sunken eye sockets, dry-looking skin and difficulty
maintaining blood pressure upon standing up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   At least in living people, blood tests can help, too, by
determining the concentration of sodium in the blood. If the
concentration is high, that may indicate dehydration. But ``you can
be dehydrated with normal blood sodium or even low sodium, too,''
said Roubenoff.
</P>
<P>
   For people in normal situations, he added, the rule of thumb for
staying properly hydrated is to drink a half ounce of water a day
for every pound of body weight. If you weigh 120 pounds, that's 60
ounces, or about 7 1/2 eight-ounce cups.

BUSH COURTS VOTERS, DEFLECTS CRITICISM FROM OTHER CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush made a final dash
across this farmland state Friday, seeking to shore up support for
the first official test of his front-runner status in the
Republican presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Stump speeches were the order of the day for all the Republican
candidates who are participating in the Ames Straw Poll, a
fund-raiser for the Iowa Republican Party that has taken on
exaggerated importance in the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important event,'' Bush said Friday morning at a
Davenport restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation is watching to see what's going to happen on this
first step in a very long political process, the first step towards
the Iowa caucuses and then the primaries that follow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, interested Iowans will travel to the small town of
Ames where they will have to pay $25 _ a fee generally paid by the
candidates _ to vote in the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the results don't mean anything.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP candidates have devoted an immense amount of money and
time to the poll in an effort to prove their organizational
know-how and political popularity.
</P>
<P>
   And given the early front-loading in the primary process, some
political observers believe a poor showing could starve some
campaigns of future donations.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sen. John McCain of Arizona has declined to participate,
calling the event a scam.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end, the Bush camp is spending a whopping
$750,000 to buy an undisclosed number of tickets, bus in supporters
from all parts of the state and then feed and entertain them once
they get there.
</P>
<P>
   Some people participating in the straw poll will have to travel
100 miles or more to get to Ames.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush did not buy television or radio advertising,
millionaire businessman Steve Forbes and former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander have been running ads attacking Bush but without
mentioning his name.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates also have made veiled comments about Bush's
lack of experience in foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush appeared unnerved by such criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to respond by smiling and saying, `Here's what I
believe in,''' he said Thursday night when asked about his comment
that ``Americans are sick of that kind of campaigning. People
better be beware of the backlash to negative campaigning in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day before the Ames extravaganza, Bush started off at a
Mexican restaurant in Davenport where he ate migas, spoke some
Spanish and talked to local Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working hard to say the Republican Party should welcome
new faces and new voices. I'm working hard to make sure that people
understand that the American dream is for everybody,'' he told
about 20 people there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American dream is for your children and my children,'' he
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Republican Party philosophy, correctly explained,
was that ``We welcome small business people. We understand the role
of government is not to create wealth but an environment in which
entrepreneurship can flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the summer, Bush has made a point of scheduling
events that cater to Hispanics as part of his attempt to
demonstrate he can reach voters who do not traditionally vote for
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He also asked the Davenport group to support him in the straw
poll, apparently unaware that many in the crowd were out-of-state
residents from nearby Moline, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Non-residents are ineligible to vote in the Iowa poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to ask you to come to Ames tomorrow. I'm working
hard, and I'm here to ask you to come and help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Illinois resident David Navarro won't be voting in the
Iowa straw poll, he was impressed with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his Texas roots probably help him here (with
Hispanics). I think he thinks along the same lines we do,'' said
Navarro, who works for the restaurant's owner.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 35,000 Hispanics among the 2.7 million
residents of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But asked if many area Hispanics were Republicans, Navarro
quickly replied: ``No.''

 &HT;    Georgia Rep. McKinney decides not to support colleague Lewis
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) recently hosted a
dinner supporting a California Democrat's campaign to become
majority whip of the House if the Democratic Party wins back
control next year.
</P>
<P>
   That shocked fellow Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis, the
state's senior congressman and fellow Congressional Black Caucus
member.
</P>
<P>
   While a return to a Democratic rule of the House is anything but
certain, Lewis has made no secret of his desire to win the post.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a chief deputy whip, has said he wanted to run since the
Democratic gains in last year's congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that I wanted the job,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   So when he found out about McKinney's dinner in honor of Rep.
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Lewis said he was ``very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   After a fellow Democrat showed him an invitation to the dinner,
Lewis approached McKinney on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Cynthia, I have this flier saying you are having this
dinner (for Pelosi). I would have loved to have your support,'''
Lewis said. ``I told her that I wished she had told me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney told Lewis that she did not know that he was running
for job, which is the third-highest ranking job in the House behind
speaker and majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about it, McKinney
said she is ``re-evaluating'' her decision. ``I will support the
best candidate for the office,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John Lewis stands for anything, it's for keeping one's
word,'' McKinney said. ``If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be a
member of Congress today.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that McKinney would support anyone for whip other
than a fellow colleague from Georgia stunned longtime supporters of
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that Lewis has supported McKinney's campaign and
has used his connections in Atlanta's Jewish community to smooth
over tensions that erupted following her father labeling one of her
political opponents a ``racist Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Frank, the Southeast area director of the nonprofit
American Jewish Committee and founder of the Atlanta Black/Jewish
Coalition, said Lewis has been extremely supportive of McKinney in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   If McKinney supports a California Democrat over a fellow
Georgian, Frank said, it would not be received well in the Jewish
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is a sacred cow,'' Frank said. In addition, having a
Georgian in a leadership position would help the state, Frank
added.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's only other Democratic congressman, Rep. Sanford
Bishop, said he was endorsing Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we don't know what vacancies may occur, in the event Mr.
Lewis is running, my first choice will be the gentleman from my
home state of Georgia,'' Bishop said.

WHITE HOUSE BECOMING AN EXCLUSIVE PLATFORM FOR GORE, HILLARY
CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House officials this week converted the
Agriculture Department's deco-styled auditorium into an elaborate
stage for talks on the futuristic uses of crops and plants as fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But it also was a stage for a political campaign. Half-way
across the country, Vice President Al Gore was touting the same
issue, biomass energy, to farmers in Iowa, site of the critical
opening caucus for the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   While Cabinet officers, scientists and entrepreneurs gathered
around a USDA table to hear President Clinton expound on the
necessity of future energy sources, Gore was show-casing his own
expertise at the biomass event in Iowa and announcing the
initiatives being taken by the administration that day.
</P>
<P>
   As both Gore and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton gear up their
political campaigns, he for the presidency and she for the Senate
from New York, the White House more and more is becoming an
exclusive platform for both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot recall anything remotely as well coordinated for the
vice president or anyone else. I don't think there's ever been a
president as eager to see his vice president win and willing to go
the extra mile,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a political science
professor and presidential scholar at the University of Texas at
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance to Gore also is helpful to Clinton, perhaps
bolstering his legacy as president and retaining the core of his
agenda that would be undone by a Republican administration,
Buchanan said. He also noted that Gore's struggling candidacy could
use the help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make no bones about the fact the president would not only
like to see his wife be elected to the Senate if she chooses to
run, but the president has been quite open about the fact he'd like
the vice president to follow him in office,'' said Doug Sosnik, a
presidential adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried in the past to help them toward those goals and
this week is no exception,'' Sosnik said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Republicans cite Gore's embrace of Clinton as a reason he
should be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite his attempts to reinvent himself as his own man, Al
Gore is merely campaigning for a third term for Bill Clinton, a
term filled with scandals, higher taxes and cutting our national
defense,'' said Tom Yu, a spokesman for the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Ratcliff, the vice president's spokeswoman, said Gore
wants to ``expand on the success'' of the administration in areas
such as the economy and the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and vice president have been coordinating
efforts for more than six and a half years,'' Ratcliff said, adding
it was only natural that Gore would want to amplify an issue such
as biomass energy that has long been of interest to him.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan noted that there have been few two-term presidents and
those who were often tepid about their own vice presidents,
including Ronald Reagan toward George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have Gore and Clinton maintained a personal and
professional relationship but Gore aided Clinton during the
difficult days of impeachment when he predicted Clinton would go
down in history as one of the best presidents ever. And, Buchanan
noted, Clinton owes his wife an even greater debt for saving his
presidency during the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Hillary Clinton for some time has been making some
minor announcements that affect key states but this week seemed to
mark a greater effort at coordination.
</P>
<P>
   Sosnik, however, said there was no change in strategy but
perhaps just more effectiveness. ``It's the same glide path,'' he
said, adding that perhaps interest is heightened only because the
election season grows nearer.
</P>
<P>
   The president last weekend kicked off his first of many planned
fund-raising efforts on the vice president's behalf, starting with
his homestate of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The togetherness continued during the week as Gore joined
Clinton at a small business in Virginia to tout initiatives
spurring economic growth in poor areas. They also met with Texan
Lance Armstrong, the Tour de France champion and cancer survivor.
Reporters were allowed into the session only between Gore and
Armstrong, where the vice president called for time off for federal
workers wanting cancer screening.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and the first lady also condemned the
shootings of five people at a Los Angeles Jewish center before the
president did this week. And the president's conditional clemency
offer to 11 Puerto Rican independence leaders prompted questions of
whether he was helping his wife cater to a constituency in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Press Secretary Barry Toiv said the president's offer was
made, with the support of the Puerto Rican elected officials,
because the sedition convictions were viewed as unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Not all attempts to use the White House platform seem to work.
The first lady earlier this summer attended a traditional
photography session between the president and the World Series
champions, the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, who rarely attends such events, donned a
Yankees cap and proclaimed herself a life-long fan, prompting
gleeful mocking from her probable Republican opponent, New York
Mayor Rudolph Guiliani, who had actually attended the games.

`STRAW VOTE' WILL BE MAKE OR BREAK FOR SOME CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ It is undemocratic, inherently unfair, and
dominated by big-money candidates unbridled by federal
campaign-spending laws. But despite the carnival atmosphere
surrounding Saturday's ``straw vote'' of Iowa Republicans, the
event has been given so much attention by the candidates that it
could make or break several campaigns months before a single real
vote is cast.
</P>
<P>
   When 15,000 or so Iowa Republicans pay $25 to vote, with the
price refunded by campaigns, the result could determine whether
Texas Governor George W. Bush remains as the undisputed
front-runner for the party's presidential nomination or whether the
contest is recast as a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   It also could determine whether candidates such as Lamar
Alexander and former vice president Dan Quayle have enough support
to maintain a viable candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth H. Dole, who is spending about $200,000 on her effort,
blamed the media Friday for hyping the event, but said, ``It's
become important.'' As she greeted workers at the Sigler printing
plant here, she urged them to ``break the glass ceiling and make
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is taking no chances. He is spending more than $750,000 in
an effort to bus in 5,000 Iowans to vote for him, including $43,000
just to rent a prime swath of grass outside the Iowa State
University coliseum where the vote will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's expenditure is extraordinary considering that
presidential candidates who accept federal matching funds are
barred by law from spending more than $1.2 million in Iowa
throughout the campaign, including during next year's crucial
caucuses. But Bush is allowed to ignore that law because he is not
accepting matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who is using his
personal fortune to finance the race, is skipping the federal funds
so he can spend to his heart's content in Iowa and elsewhere. And
Forbes is spending here _ at least $1.5 million, and perhaps much
more. As a result, he is given the best chance of upsetting Bush or
at least making it close.
</P>
<P>
   This is bad news for the rest of the Republican field, most of
which has far less money and little inclination to blow so much
cash on a straw poll that they can later claim was meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Bush is upset, the straw poll may have the biggest impact
on the campaigns of Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, and
Quayle. Both men have spent weeks in the state and are well-known,
and a finish in fourth place or worse could seriously hurt their
fund-raising and thus their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, in an interview at the pork tent at the state fair in
Des Moines, already has his spin ready in the event of a Bush
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money talks a lot more in a straw poll in one place than it
does in 2,100 precincts on a cold night in January,'' Alexander
said, contrasting the contest with the caucus.
</P>
<P>
   A wild card of the straw vote may be Gary Bauer, a former Reagan
domestic policy aide who previously ran the conservative think tank
Family Research Council. There is widespread speculation that Bauer
is drawing support from church-based groups, but Bauer has declined
to make any prediction about his strength.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, meanwhile, is playing down the event, having spent little
money here. Dole is running second or third in most polls, but the
straw vote is a bigger test of money and organization than
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Even though her husband, Bob Dole, tied to win the straw poll in
1995 and won the Iowa caucus, many of his supporters have scattered
to other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates on the straw poll ballot include: Senator
John McCain of Arizona, who is not competing because he opposes
subsidies for corn-based ethanol that are popular here; radio host
Alan Keyes, who is hoping for a strong showing from antiabortion
Iowans; and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who got into the race
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers find it galling that the presidential campaign is
being influenced so much by a fund-raising affair for the Iowa
Republican Party, which will receive the $25 paid by each person
who participates in the straw poll. It is hard to imagine a less
democratic exercise. Less than one-half of one percent of the
Republicans in a state that is nearly all-white and has a 2.5
percent unemployment rate will vote in a non-binding contest.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the rules allow the Bush and Forbes campaigns to
outspend their rivals by millions of dollars. For example, Forbes
has not only been criss-crossing the state, but also flooding the
airwaves with television commercials. That is the sort of
expenditure that usually occurs in the closing days of a campaign,
not on the eve of a straw poll 15 months before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders said the straw vote is fairer than in 1995, when
people from outside Iowa were allowed to participate. But while
this year's event is restricted to Iowa residents, the voting takes
place only at one location, meaning that many people must travel
for several hours each way to vote.
</P>
<P>
   That has led the campaigns to rent seemingly every bus in Iowa,
and hundreds from other states, in order to provide transportation
for their supporters. If that's not enough of an enticement, the
campaigns are paying for food, music, and celebrities to entertain
the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   For the candidates, the reality is that Campaign 2000 is
starting early because it is expected to be over so early. With
such a compressed primary schedule, a nominee in each party
probably will be selected within four to six weeks of the Iowa
caucus, which is to be held in late January or early February.

SMALL RISE IN PRODUCER PRICES EASES INFLATION JITTERS

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock and bond markets surged Friday after the government
released a reassuring report that showed a modest increase in
prices at the wholesale level in July, easing investor concerns
about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index rose 0.2
percent in July as the first decline in food prices since April
blunted the impact of a surge in energy prices. The July increase,
which followed an 0.1 percent decline in June, was below analysts'
forecasts and when the volatile food and energy components were
excluded, prices were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average leaped 184.26 points, its
biggest since mid-June, as interest rates fell as much as 1/10 of a
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   While most analysts believe the Federal Reserve will still raise
the target for a key overnight lending rate at its policy meeting
Aug. 24, the July producer price figures seemed to rule out any
need for a rate increase of more than a quarter-percentage point
and diminish the likelihood that further increases would be needed
to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   But other soundings could still change things, including the
government's report Tuesday on inflation at the consumer level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quite good number,'' Stan Shipley, a senior economist
at Merrill Lynch, said of Friday's report. ``Deflationary pressures
persist in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called core rate, which excludes food and energy, was
unchanged last month, after a decline of 0.2 percent in June. That
figure was also a bit lower than the consensus of forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, analysts found no immediate cause for concern about
inflation at earlier stages in the production pipeline even though
price increases in some categories of goods were enough that they
might become unsettling if they were to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of intermediate goods, like cloth, 0.6 percent, while
those of crude goods, like coal, declined 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The drought that has ravaged grain, vegetable and other crops in
much of the Northeast and Southeast had little impact on food
prices, which tumbled 0.9 percent, offsetting the combined
increases for May and June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to find any food commodities that rose in price
that could be attributed to drought,'' said Joe Kowal, an economist
at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, noting that growing conditions
in the Midwest have been excellent.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, other analysts said, that the drought actually
helped restrain the rise in producer prices as farmers and ranchers
sped livestock sales up because of a lack of affordable feed.
Prices of cattle for slaughter, for example, fell 2.4 percent in
July after rising 3.8 percent in June and price declines
accelerated for hogs and chickens for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Kasman, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, called the
latest inflation reading ``very benign'' but added that a long
period of steadily lower inflation was giving way to price
``normalization'' that would require vigilance at the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other Labor Department reports in recent weeks have showed wage
acceleration and continued drum-tight job markets, intensifying
jitters about inflation in the securities markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no problem here right now _ no reason to slam your
feet on the brakes,'' Kasman said. But he added that some of
Friday's data did show ``reasons to be a little concerned'' if
increases persisted into the autumn. But James Glassman at Chase
Manhattan said that strong productivity growth by manufacturers was
likely to prevent these from being passed along.
</P>
<P>
   One sensitive area is durable items like copper and plywood used
in the manufacturing process, an element of the intermediate goods
category. These materials, which also include brass mill shapes,
building board and glass, jumped 0.8 percent in July after rising
0.7 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Construction materials jumped 0.7 percent while chemicals and
other nondurables consumed by factories rose 0.4 percent following
an exceptional surge in June.
</P>
<P>
   Energy prices were sharply higher at all stages of production _
3.4 percent among finished goods, 2.9 percent among intermediates
and 3.7 percent for raw material. More than half the jump in
finished energy was due to a 12.7 percent jump in gasoline
following a 1.9 percent decline in June.
</P>
<P>
   The index for beef and veal slumped 3.4 percent after rising
more than twice as much in June, while the price of fresh eggs
jumped 7.1 percent, both moves possibly reflecting the effects of
drought.

GALAXY PUSHES FOR NO. 2 IN CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Edging ever closer to a playoff position, the Los
Angeles Galaxy finally is showing the form of its 1998
record-breaking season.
</P>
<P>
   And what could be better to aid its run than a matchup against
the Dallas Burn?
</P>
<P>
   When the teams meet tonight at 7:30 at the Rose Bowl in a key
Western Conference showdown, the Galaxy hopes its victory trend
continues in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy (13-8, 33 points) has won seven of its past eight
meetings against the Burn (11-11, 31 points) and is looking to
close in on the second-place Chicago Fire (34 points), which plays
host to Miami tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at a couple of the games where the Galaxy has
played Dallas,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid, who will be facing
the Burn for the first time, ``and I think part of it is just good
matchups. Dallas is just a team the Galaxy has had a lot of success
against.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has been having success against just about everyone
lately, winning eight of its past 10 to enter tonight's game as the
league's hottest team.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's U.S. Open Cup quarterfinal loss against
Columbus, the Galaxy put together one of its most impressive
efforts of the season, a 4-1 victory at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Zak Ibsen, Cobi Jones, Mauricio Cienfuegos and Seth George all
scored goals, with Cienfuegos picking up three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has struggled recently, winning only four of its past 10,
although the Burn boasts one of the league's leading scorers in
Jason Kreis.
</P>
<P>
   Kreis has 14 goals and 10 assists in 22 games. Dallas is the
league's second-highest scoring team with 37 goals, trailing only
D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas always plays us tough and because the league standings
are so close right now, it has that much more importance,'' Galaxy
defender Paul Caligiuri said. ``The game's actually worth six
points instead of three because if you win it, obviously you jump
ahead. We're kind of on an upswing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burn is coming off a humbling 2-1 loss Wednesday to the
Rochester Raging Rhinos of the A-League in the quarterfinals of the
U.S. Open Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Dallas' cross-country travel schedule, Schmid said he
didn't think that would have an impact tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same for both teams so I'm not worried about it,''
Schmid said. ``We're going in with equal rest as Dallas so that
makes it OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schmid also realizes the significance of tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important because we definitely want to finish in the top
two in the division. That's within our reach now,'' Schmid said.
``This game is important in terms of achieving that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   When Schmid took over for fired coach Octavio Zambrano, he said
it would take 10 games for the Galaxy to show what it could really
do. So what's been the difference lately?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a good job of finishing opportunities and we're
defending with fairly good compactness,'' Schmid said.
``Offensively, we've got different options to go to. (Midfielder)
Roy (Myers) has been a big plus for us and different people have
stepped up at different times, even with people hurt right now.
We've found people to step in and do a job.''

 &HT;    Turner Broadcasting delays launch of women-oriented cable
channel
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been a busy year for Turner Broadcasting. So
busy, in fact, that the Atlanta-based cable TV programmer has
decided to scale back ambitious plans to launch three new channels
within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a unit of Time Warner, said it would indefinitely
postpone the launch of the Women's Network, a channel that was
announced two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South, a regional channel, and Boomerang, a second
cartoon channel, will still launch as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Network was to have begun airing after the middle of
next year. Now some industry observers think it may never air.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is a personal setback for Pat Mitchell, one of Turner
Broadcasting's top programmers. As president of CNN Productions,
Mitchell had worked for years to champion the idea of a channel
pitched to women.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, on business in Baltimore, Md., could not be reached
for comment Friday. The postponement also reflects a cultural
change at Turner Broadcasting, which used to fearlessly launch new
channels that many thought were ill-advised.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years Turner Broadcasting has been a unit of
Time Warner. The New York-based media conglomerate, much more
focused on controlling costs and producing returns, is less willing
to gamble on risky new ideas _ at least in cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Network, which was announced with great fanfare in
June, was canceled unexpectedly. Few of Turner Broadcasting's
rank-and-file in Atlanta knew of the decision until reading about
it Friday morning in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cancel the channel was made Thursday evening in
New York at a meeting between Gerald Levin and Ted Turner, chairman
and vice chairman, respectively, of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The two were concerned that the Women's Network, which would be
costly to produce, would take a long time to become profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Women's Network faced considerable competition
for viewership. For one, there's Lifetime, marketed primarily to
women, which has some 70 million subscribers. Another group, led by
famed cable TV programmer Geraldine Laybourne, is trying to begin a
channel for women called Oxygen. Laybourne already has signed up
some big cable operators, including the 5 million subscribers of
Charter.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Turner and Levin decided it better to focus their
company's resources on new channels more likely to gain quick
acceptance. Those channels are Turner South, a regional channel set
to air Oct. 1, and a second 24-hour cartoon channel called
Boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Levin nor Turner would comment, but the company released
a prepared statement that confirmed its reported strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said, in part, ``TBS has decided that it is not in
the company's best interest nor in the best interest of our
affiliates to actively pursue the creation of the Women's Network
at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the time being, we feel it best to concentrate on the
development of the other two networks preparing to launch.''
</P>
<P>
   What made the Women's Network so costly was a strategy to air
largely original programming. That is, after all, Mitchell's
expertise. She planned to fill her channel's airtime with women's
interest shows about cooking, fashion, world events and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Shows were to have been made in a partnership with Conde Nast's
large portfolio of women's interest magazines. Those magazines
include House and Garden, Glamour and Mademoiselle.

 &HT;    Turner Broadcasting delays launch of women-oriented cable
channel
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been a busy year for Turner Broadcasting. So
busy, in fact, that the Atlanta-based cable TV programmer has
decided to scale back ambitious plans to launch three new channels
within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a unit of Time Warner, said it would indefinitely
postpone the launch of the Women's Network, a channel that was
announced two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South, a regional channel, and Boomerang, a second
cartoon channel, will still launch as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Network was to have begun airing after the middle of
next year. Now some industry observers think it may never air.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is a personal setback for Pat Mitchell, one of Turner
Broadcasting's top programmers. As president of CNN Productions,
Mitchell had worked for years to champion the idea of a channel
pitched to women.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, on business in Baltimore, Md., could not be reached
for comment Friday. The postponement also reflects a cultural
change at Turner Broadcasting, which used to fearlessly launch new
channels that many thought were ill-advised.
</P>

POLICE TO DROP ETHNIC REFERENCES IN PEPPER SPRAY TRAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Police Commissioner Ronnie Watson apologized
Friday for his department's practice of instructing officers that
pepper spray, which is used to temporarily ``calm situations,'' may
be ineffective against Latinos, Indians and other ethnic groups who
eat spicy food. Watson said the department will stop teaching the
unsubstantiated instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that these comments were made,'' Watson said
referring to news reports that Cambridge officers were taught some
ethnic groups may have a built-in immunity to pepper spray. ``There
is no empirical or scientific evidence to support these
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Watson said that ``we have met with our instructors
to ensure that all future training includes only material that is
part of the Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council's
curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   The instructions were not part of the current written training
material, said Cambridge Police spokesman Frank Pasquarello.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper spray, a mixture of cayenne pepper and natural oils
sprayed from a pressurized container, is a nonlethal device used by
law enforcement officers. It is effective only when sprayed
directly into the face or eyes, and causes severe burning for about
45 to 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Most police departments have policies regulating the use of
pepper spray, which is to be used to incapacitate people who are
resisting arrest and only after a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Medical specialists and pepper spray manufacturers said there
was no scientific evidence that any particular ethnic group has
been desensitized to pepper spray when it was sprayed in their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Pasquarello said the statements about pepper spray made by
officer Frank Gutoski were not intended to be derogatory, but were
instructions he had received as a part of his training, and passed
onto others. ``All he was trying to say was that if you sprayed
someone and that person kept coming at you, there may be many
reasons why it isn't working, such as weather conditions,''
Pasquarello said.
</P>
<P>
   Pasquarello said the office did receive several calls from
members of the Cambridge community about the issue. The police
department does not plan to discipline or reprimand Gutoski for his
statements, Pasquarello said.
</P>
<P>
   But the apology is not enough for Nicolas Carballeira, director
of policy and planning for the Latino Health Insituate and chair of
the governor's Latino-American Advisory Commission. ``It is
certainly the right step and in the right direction,'' said
Carballeira. ``But we would also like to see effective corrective
measures taken for the people who have already been trained with
this misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Carballeira said the Latino community would like to
see what steps will be taken to reprimand or discipline the people
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the people who are supposed to protect us are making
these types of generalizations, it's time to get serious,'' said
Carballeira, who noted that Latinos spend $4.8 billion in goods and
services in Massachusetts each year. ``It's time we receive the
respect that is due.''

 &HT;    UPS to say how it might pay tax bill
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service is expected to disclose Monday
how it will deal with at least part of what could be a $1 billion
tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure would come in the package delivery company's
quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the U.S. Tax Court agreed with the Internal Revenue
Service that UPS owes $64.9 million in back taxes for 1983 and
1984. Penalties and interest could push UPS' bill for the two years
to $200 million to $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also wants additional taxes for later years. If the IRS
continues to win its case in court, UPS could owe $1 billion or
more, according to published reports. The company does not dispute
the estimate.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has been setting aside an undisclosed reserve for its
potential liability, spokesman Ken Sternad said Friday. The company
had a ``fiduciary'' responsibility to do so, he said, ``although we
anticipated winning this case and still have the option of
appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   How the outcome of the tax case will affect UPS' planned public
offering is not clear, according to analyst Jeffrey L. Pittsburg of
Pittsburg Institutional Services, who follows competitor FDX.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it could affect pricing somewhat,'' he said, referring
to the initial public offering price, which has not been set. The
company has said it hopes to have the offering before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what they do, I'm thinking I would like to buy
(the stock) in any case,'' Pittsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate this case will impact our plans for the
IPO,'' said Sternad. He said UPS still hopes to go public this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The company will amend earlier SEC filings related to the
planned public offering, Sternad said, but no timetable has been
set for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   On the tax issue, UPS has several options:
</P>
<P>
   _ It could appeal, but only after reaching agreement with the
IRS on exactly how much it owes under the Tax Court decision, and
after the court makes the decision final.
</P>
<P>
   Winning on appeal ``would be an uphill battle for UPS,'' said
attorney Jonathan E. Jackel of Burt, Maner &AMP; Miller, a Washington
firm that represents corporations in tax disputes. ``As a matter of
practice, the Tax Court is considered to be the expert on
interpreting federal income tax law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there are grounds for appeal,'' Sternad responded.
``We think the judge is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   _ UPS could pay what the IRS says is due. It has the wherewithal
to do so: $3.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, as of
March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Paying the bill would have two advantages. One, it would stop
the clock on interest charges on the unpaid taxes. Interest is
piling up at a current rate of 10 percent, according to the IRS,
although the rate changes quarterly. Two, it would free UPS to seek
a refund of the taxes in U.S. District Court or U.S. Claims Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at all the options,'' Sternad said.
</P>
<P>
   The major issue in the tax case is the money the company's
customers pay to cover the possible loss of a package or damage to
its contents.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Court ruled that UPS engages in ``sham transactions''
with a Bermuda insurance company it formed, in order to avoid
paying income taxes on profit from that service.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, if UPS changes the way it accounts for the damage
and loss service charges because of the Tax Court decision, it
could report higher profits.
</P>
<P>
   That's because UPS doesn't count as revenue the money it charges
to cover damage and losses. If it did, profit from the service
would be added to the company's bottom line.

<P>
   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan _ The young women, some stylishly dressed
in high-heeled sandals and colorful tunic and pants, others
shrouded completely in black, spilled out of the gleaming white
Victorian mansion that houses Pakistan's first and only publicly
financed graduate school for women.
</P>
<P>
   Most are from socially conservative Muslim families who would
have never allowed their daughters to attend a coeducational
university. Some have lived so strictly secluded that the only men
who have ever seen their faces are their grandfathers, fathers and
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But they have come to Fatima Jinnah Women University to earn
master's degrees in an environment that their parents can tolerate.
Except for a few gardeners, all staff members, from the vice
chancellor to the deans to the professors to the janitors, are
women.
</P>
<P>
   Tauseef Fatima, 25, begged her parents for the chance to earn a
master's degree in education here, and they consented, though only
on her promise that she would leave if they found her a husband. At
the university, she has listened to scholars lecture about the
rights of women in Islam _ to divorce, to have property, to think
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am from the Sindh Province and men are very dominant
there,'' she said. ``So these were new ideas for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a state-supported graduate school for women was a new
idea that made many Pakistani women who are educators or other
professionals uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   The university is financed by the province of Punjab with the
enthusiastic backing of its chief minister, Shabaz Sharif, who also
happens to be the very powerful younger brother of Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the prime minister was pushing legislation to
make Islamic law supreme, some Pakistani women who are educators or
other professionals feared that the creation of a university just
for women was another sign of creeping fundamentalism in Pakistan.
The nation's founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, was a barrister with a
taste for hand-tailored suits and silk ties and a more liberal,
tolerant vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you saying _ that we're separate, but unequal?''
Maleeha Lodhi, editor of The News, an English-language daily in
nearby Islamabad, asked tartly. ``This kind of segregation fosters
the forces of conservatism, not modernism.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasreen Rehman, director of the Mahbub ul-Haq Human Development
Center in Islamabad, was also uncomfortable with the idea of a
segregated university.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rehman knows what women are up against in Pakistan. In 1998
the research institute she directs published a report on education
in South Asia that laid out the baleful statistics: Only a quarter
of the women in the country can read, compared with half the men.
More than half the girls of elementary school age are not in
school.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Rehman changed her mind about the wisdom of a university
for women after she visited it. Young women can study here and feel
secure and comfortable, just as they do at women's colleges in the
United States and England, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was present when Aziza Al-Hibri, a law professor at Richmond
University in Virginia, addressed the student body, telling them
that it was up to women to interpret the Koran for themselves and
not to rely on the say-so of men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're no pushovers, the girls in that university,'' Ms.
Rehman said. ``They asked Dr. Al-Hibri very difficult questions
about women's rights in Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Syeda Natiqabatool, 24, is one of the students who has found the
university to be a place where she can remove the veil that always
covers her face when she is in the presence of men outside her
immediate family, even of her own cousins, and take part fully and
casually. She hopes one day to teach Islamic studies in a women's
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can walk freely in this university,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The university's animating intelligence is Najma Najam, formerly
a professor of psychology at Punjab University and and now the
first head of the university, with the title of vice chancellor. A
wife and a mother of two adolescents, she describes herself as a
practicing Muslim who wears her hair short, plays tennis, drives
and enjoys an evening at the movies. ``I live a modern life,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She took on the job of starting this new university on Dec. 3,
1998, with what she called ``a staff of two _ a night watchman and
myself,'' and opened for classes on Dec. 28, quickly conjuring up a
faculty, an administrative staff and a curriculum. ``There was
nothing, not even furniture,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She did, however, have a beautiful building to house the new
university: a mansion that once belonged to a fabulously wealthy
family of Sikh hoteliers who had fled to India in 1947 when
Britain's subcontinental empire was divided into Pakistan and
India, unleashing sectarian violence. Its walls are still encrusted
with hand-painted Persian designs in gold leaf and from its
ceilings hang crystal chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for admission to the university, named for the sister
of Jinnah, the nation's founder, was great. While there is a
tradition of women's undergraduate colleges with limited graduate
programs, Fatima Jinnah Women University is the first
research-oriented graduate school for women.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 women applied for the 350 spots in the first class.
By this fall, there will be 1,000 students. And Ms. Najam dreams of
a student body of 6,000 10 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition is about $150 a year and most of the students are from
lower-middle-class families. The entire university, with a faculty
of 35 and a support staff of 35, runs on a budget that would just
about pay the salary of the president of a very modest American
college: $116,000. Ms. Najam herself earns slightly under $5,000 a
year, and assistant professors make a little over $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to build an endowment, but so far the university's
account at the First Woman Bank of Pakistan contains only about
$300 donated by a retired army officer.
</P>
<P>
   The young women here have generally come for practical reasons.
Farida Saleem, 21, who excelled at statistics and economics in
college, is aiming for a degree in business administration. She is
resigned to the fact that her father will allow her to work outside
the home only if family finances go bad, but she still regards a
master's degree as a kind of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essential to have something in your hands,'' she said.
``If at any time I need to work, it will help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saima Talat, 27, and a student of English literature, plans to
teach. Her parents will find her a husband within a couple of
years, but her master's degree will still be an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan is suffering economic problems,'' she said. ``So the
women have to work, too.''

 &HT;    Bronner Brothers staging its 52nd annual hair show
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Bronner Brothers International Hair Show
opens its doors at the Georgia World Congress Center today, it
won't be a run-of-the-mill show.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there will be exhibits, just as there are at any industry
trade show. But what sets Bronner Brothers apart from others is a
heavy dose of glitz, glamour and music, and tons of hair.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 52nd year for the event, one of the largest shows
for the ethnic beauty products industry.
</P>
<P>
   Several events are open to the public, including a comedy show
today and the Hair Battle Royale on Monday, which carries a $10,000
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers expect more than 100,000 stylists, manufacturers and
distributors to attend the show, whose theme is Hair Odyssey 2000.
The show ends Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has become larger,'' said Darrow Bronner, show
director and a vice president of Bronner Brothers, an ethnic hair
care products maker. ``It's a multibillion industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the show drew about 40,000 and had 300
exhibitors. This year, he expects 400 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like the show will remain in Atlanta. Bronner recently
said that Orlando, Fla., convention officials tried to get the show
to move there, but that such a move is unlikely now.
</P>
<P>
   The show was held in Orlando in 1996, when its scheduled time
conflicted with the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel Atlanta is our home base,'' he said. ``We're really
not looking to move anywhere outside of Atlanta.''

DROUGHT PUTS PLANTS AT NATIONAL ARBORETUM IN JEOPARDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RENWICK McLEAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the U.S. National Arboretum, a mainstay on the
capital's cultural landscape for more than 70 years, the distress
signs are everywhere. Leaves are scorched brown, branches have
wilted and meadows crunch underfoot. Sensing the end is near, trees
sprout pine cones and fruit abundantly in a last desperate attempt
to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   The 446-acre outdoor museum in northeast Washington is in danger
of losing a significant portion of some of its plant and tree
collections because of this summer's drought, scientists at the
arboretum say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's depressing to see, especially when you've put so much
work into it,'' said Scott Aker, a horticulturist at the arboretum,
which draws more than 400,000 visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   Intensive irrigation is expected to preserve the core
collections, but several specimens in the crab apple, maple, spruce
and other sections have little chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one won't make it,'' Aker said repeatedly as he toured
the grounds, pointing to a dying dogwood or azalea bush. ``That big
white oak, probably 100 to 150 years old, won't make it either.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the worst drought the arboretum has faced, its
scientists say, exacerbated by the fact that the previous two
summers were dry as well. As evidence, they point to specimens that
were here when the national garden was founded in 1927 and have
weathered everything nature has thrown at them until this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And little relief is in sight. At this stage, a few isolated
rainfalls will not do the trick, the scientists say. A prolonged
series of rains is needed to restore moisture to the soil, which is
dry to a depth of 12 to 18 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say the staff is in panic mode yet,'' Aker said.
But the situation could become more dire if the District of
Columbia imposes restrictions on water use as neighboring Maryland
has done.
</P>
<P>
   At Brookside Gardens in Wheaton, Md., for example, the staff is
scrambling to keep the collections alive with hand-held hoses, the
only method of watering permitted under the statewide limitations.
</P>
<P>
   If the District followed suit, ``we would have to make some very
difficult decisions,'' Aker said.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members at the arboretum spend virtually all of their time
on irrigation, changing sprinkler heads, lugging hoses around and
picking their brains for creative ways to get water to
hard-to-reach areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plumbing does not reach all of our collections,'' Aker
said, so the staff has to load water tanks onto a truck and drive
them to the outlying areas, a time-consuming process that is only
moderately effective.
</P>
<P>
   The arboretum, a research and educational division of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, received $7.9 million in federal funds
in the current fiscal year. It also receives private contributions
gathered through Friends of the National Arboretum, a nonprofit
group.
</P>
<P>
   Aker said that normally some of the money would be used to
upgrade the irrigation system, which, he said, is ``nowhere near
modern.'' But this year all of the attention is focused on getting
water to the plants. ``We are in survival mode right now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Specimens that have been the most difficult to acquire and would
be the hardest to replace, such as the bonsai trees and other Asian
collections, are the top priority. ``We can't just run out to the
nursery and buy more,'' Aker said.

WARREN BEATTY FOR PRESIDENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For what it's worth, no bull: Warren Beatty is
thinking of running for president.
</P>
<P>
   It's a role the actor, director and former Hollywood Lothario
has never been cast in before. He did play a senator unable to
resist rapping the truth in last year's ``Bullworth,'' and his wife
once starred as an environmental lobbyist who captured the
president's heart.
</P>
<P>
   But politics has always been a sideline for Beatty, if a
passionate one. Now the long-time Democratic activist and avowed
liberal is weighing whether to take it center stage. He's that
displeased with the national debate on campaign finance reform and
other issues important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a surprise, but it's not a shock,'' said William Bradley,
a Sacramento-based political analyst and friend of Beatty's who has
heard him mull the idea of a candidacy of some sort for years.
``Could he win? I don't know. But I've been talking to him about it
and I think it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Few political observers give Beatty much of a chance, however,
whether he goes up against Al Gore and the other Bill Bradley in
the Democratic primary, or joins Jesse Ventura in the Reform Party
_ a possibility he has hinted at. Even Beatty has conceded there
should be a better candidate than him. But he has also said he
doesn't want to discount the friends and activists encouraging him
to give it a go.
</P>
<P>
   A Beatty candidacy, of course, would be the ultimate
intersection of celebrity and politics. Unlike Ronald Reagan or
even Sonny Bono, he has never held any elected office. He has never
been a candidate of any kind. But he did campaign hard for Robert
Kennedy and George McGovern some three decades ago and, more
recently, for Gary Hart. And he knows how to tell and sell a story,
although several of his more recent movies have done less than
stellar business at the box office. He has the ability to make an
increasingly apathetic America listen, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take this as a joke,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at Claremont Graduate University. ``He wants to
have a conversation with the country and he has the bully pulpit of
celebrity to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has only hinted at political ambitions, Beatty is
already attracting attention, from voters as well as the media.
</P>
<P>
   Arianna Huffington, the syndicated newspaper columnist who first
raised the talk of a Beatty candidacy this week, said she has been
inundated with e-mails from potential Beatty supporters ever since.
Many wanted to know where to send their $100, an amount that
pollster and Beatty pal Pat Caddell suggested as an appropriate
donation for individuals interested in funding a real grassroots
campaign. It's a response that would do the character Sen. Jay
Bullsworth, so sick of selling his soul for donations that he
arranged his own murder, proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that energy is available. Someone could theoretically
start a web site, a whole movement about bringing Warren Beatty to
Washington,'' Huffington said.
</P>
<P>
   William Hillsman, who knows something of outsiders triumphing
against long odds after helping Jesse Ventura become governor of
Minnesota, said he would not rule out a Beatty victory just yet.
While Hillsman would not say whether he is in discussions with the
star, he did give him a decent chance at victory if he runs as a
third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What America doesn't understand about Beatty yet is how long
and deep his involvement in politics goes,'' said Hillsman,
president of North Woods Advertising in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   At best, however, some political analysts said Beatty could
siphon enough liberal and celebrity-driven votes to make a small
showing in the Democratic primary. In a three-way general election,
they added, he'd likely nick the party he has helped for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bullworth dream may have worked as a movie, but it
wouldn't work as a reality,'' said Bruce Cain, a political science
professor at the University of California at Berkeley. ``Let's say
he played out his fantasy in terms of speaking frankly and speaking
to the people. That's what Ross Perot did. . . But what would
happen to Beatty after he raises money from unions or environmental
groups. Does he continue to speak his mind or does he suddenly feel
the same pressures as everyone else?''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley insisted his friend would not be interested in
simply conversing with the country, then letting someone else sit
in the Oval Office. He would not drag his wife Annette Bening and
their three young children through the rough and tumble of a
national campaign unless he meant to win. And he would not put the
Hollywood crowd, already committed to other candidates, in the
position of snubbing an Academy Award winner unless he knew he had
an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's serious; he's not laughing,'' said Frank
Mankiewicz, vice chairman of the Hill &AMP; Knowlton public relations
firm and another friend of Beatty's. ``He's willing to be
president. I'm not so sure he's willing to go through a campaign.''

WATER RIGHTS AN ISSUE IN GOLAN HEIGHTS

<P>
   KIBBUTZ ORTAL, Golan Heights _ If Israel withdraws from the
Golan Heights, Eitan Sadeh, wants to know, what will happen to the
country's water supply?
</P>
<P>
   The question has been on the minds of many of the 17,000 Israeli
settlers on the Golan Heights as they contemplate the possibility
that their homes and lands may soon revert to Syria's control.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with high mountains in the north and natural springs in
the center, the Golan plateau has provided Israel with roughly
one-third of its water since Israel captured the heights from Syria
in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   The water trickles down mainly from Mt. Hermon, a ski resort in
winter months, and the nearby Banyas Springs. Then it flows through
tiny tributaries until it reaches the biblical Sea of Galilee,
which is actually a freshwater lake. From there, Israel's national
water carrier takes it to farms and cities.
</P>
<P>
   While water has often been a problem in this semidesert climate,
particularly in southern Israel, the region is gripped by the worst
drought in decades, and many Israelis are convinced the country
must protect scarce water sources in any land-for-peace agreement
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is very crucial,'' said Moshe Inbar, an Israeli
water expert who heads the department of geography at the
University of Haifa. ``We must reach an agreement that all waters
flowing into the (Sea of Galilee) belong to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria is demanding that Israel withdraw from the heights all the
way to the shores of the Sea of Galilee, the border that existed
June 4, 1967, the day before Israel captured the region. That would
give Syria access not only to water on the Golan Heights, but also
the right to tap into the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Israel has balked at giving up that much. An
alternative, if Israel agrees to cede the region at all, would be
to move to what is locally known as the ``international border,''
the boundary decided by Britain and France after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   After the creation of Israel in 1948, Syrian soldiers slowly
pushed the international border southward, eventually making their
way to the shores of the Sea of Galilee and creating a new de facto
border, the so-called ``June 4 line.'' The difference is only a
matter of a few yards, but it would keep the Syrians far enough
away from the Sea of Galilee to keep them from dipping their toes
in the water, as one Israeli commentator put it.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights would
spell the end of Israel's largest bottled mineral water company,
Eden, which supplies Israelis 65 percent of their bottled drinking
water, according to a company spokeswoman. The water comes from a
natural spring found in the center of the plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Israel's water problems pale compared to those faced
by the Palestinians and the Jordanians. Jordan rations water year
round.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Inbar predicts, it will be Israel's agriculture,
which accounts for 60 percent of the country's water consumption,
that suffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe no more citrus,'' he said. ``Ten years from now, the
famous Jaffa oranges maybe will disappear.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even though the NASDAQ composite index rallied late
last week, it is down 8 percent from its July 16 high, close to the
10 percent drop that Wall Street considers a correction.
</P>
<P>
   These stocks deserve a rest. At its peak, the NASDAQ was up 31
percent this year, compared with the 22 percent rise in the Dow at
its high and the 15.4 percent increase in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   But the NASDAQ has dropped further than the other indexes,
raising a troubling issue that was hidden as the market rose:
Hanging over the market are an immense number of shares in big
NASDAQ stocks, including top technology companies, in the form of
option grants awarded to executives and employees.
</P>
<P>
   Companies of all kinds have issued oceans of options in recent
years. As long as stocks were rising, option holders hesitated to
exercise them, waiting for even further gains. Now, with many
stocks _ especially NASDAQ stocks _ well off their highs,
transforming paper profits into real gains is mighty tempting.
</P>
<P>
   How big is the overhang? Bob Gabele, director of insider
research at First Call/Thomson Financial, calculated all the option
grants made by companies in the NASDAQ 100 stock index from 1994 to
1998. A staggering 4 billion shares were granted, worth $220
billion at recent prices. That amounts to roughly 9 percent of the
market value of the entire NASDAQ 100 index.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an avalanche-in-waiting,'' said Baruch Lev, professor
of accounting and finance at New York University's Stern School of
Business. ``And this avalanche may fall at the worst time of all.''
</P>
<P>
   If the market slows or a recession hits, expectations for these
shares will fall, Lev said. Employees who can exercise their
options and sell shares will do so, thereby depressing an already
declining market.
</P>
<P>
   An option grant is exercisable only if its so-called strike
price is lower than the prevailing market price. But given the
hefty gains registered by NASDAQ every year since 1994 _ the index
is up almost sixfold _ most option grants are exercisable now.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems said in its 1998 annual report that the average
strike price of its option grants _ 1.562 billion shares _ was
$25.23. Cisco stock closed Friday at $63.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Companies report their option grants in the footnotes to their
financial statements. To calculate the overhang, take the number of
shares provided for in those grants and divide it into the total
shares the company has outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much of a fall in stock prices to make option
holders itchy, said Steven E. Hall, managing director at Pearl
Meyer &AMP; Partners, a compensation consulting firm. When stocks
plunged last fall, Hall said, ``everybody got stomachaches looking
at their stocks. All of a sudden people started saying, `Maybe I
don't want as much of my pay in stock.'''
</P>
<P>
   Studying the effect of declining stock prices on option grants
at 60 companies, Hall found that a 15 percent drop in stock price
translated to a 25 percent decrease in the value of options held by
chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America's love affair with options worked well as
stocks rose. Giving options in lieu of cash keeps employee costs
down and helps financially strapped start-ups. But when stock
prices no longer rise, companies will be forced to pay more in cash
to workers, driving up costs.
</P>
<P>
   Lev points to another concern about an options avalanche.
``Firms in the last four to five years increased debt
significantly, mainly to repurchase stock so they can provide it to
managers and employees,'' he said. ``So debt is very high, the
market slows down, people are dumping their shares. There is a
significant risk here.''

   EL-CENIZO (El Cenizo, Texas) _ While most towns along the
U.S.-Mexico border are battling to keep illegal immigrants out,
this tiny locale on the outskirts of Laredo is embracing them. El
Cenizo recently passed two ordinances, one that makes it a ``safe
haven'' for illegals and another that makes Spanish the town's
official language. The action is troubling to federal officials and
has English-only advocates warning of the break-up of the United
States along lines of race and language. By THADDEUS HERRICK.

CHRISTIAN IDENTITY LEADER SAYS FURROW HAD SOUGHT `TRUTH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dave Barley recalls welcoming Buford O. Furrow Jr.
to his church, America's Promise Ministries in Sandpoint, Idaho,
just like the pastor would any newcomer who wanted to hear the
``truth'': that God's chosen people are white, American, Christian
men with northern European roots.
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI visited Barley on Thursday and asked if he knew
Furrow, the suspect in six Los Angeles hate shootings two days
before, the pastor acknowledged he did. ``He came here about two
years ago, and he came about two times, and that was about it,''
Barley said in a telephone interview. ``I don't know why he came. I
believe he was associated with the Aryan Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, investigating Furrow's links to white supremacist
groups like the Aryan Nations in northern Idaho, had good reason to
question Barley. He is one of the leading lights in the Christian
Identity movement, a loose federation of fringe ministries
preaching an anti-Semitic, racist message that claims America is
threatened by the power of Jews, who are agents, even descendants
of Satan, and by minorities, who are inferior to the white race.
</P>
<P>
   Barley denies that he incites his followers to violence, and he
condemns Furrow for ``a very ungodly and awful thing'' in allegedly
murdering Joseph Ileto, a Filipino-American postman, and shooting
three children, a teenager, and a 68-year-old woman at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, Calif., on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not sit back and say, `Hey, great, he went after the
Jews, he is our hero,' '' said Barley, who in photos bears a
striking resemblance to Furrow. ``Give me a break. That would make
people think that we hate Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people I do not hate Jews, but I am against Judaism and
Zionism, because they are not for Jesus Christ,'' Barley added.
``As a race, Jews have a right to exist, and if you had people
going out and shooting anybody just because they are different _
Jews, blacks, Asians, homosexuals _ that would be anarchism. We
aren't anarchists. That would be insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Identity's tenets are racist, insane, and incendiary,
according to scholars on contemporary Christianity, and its
theology is increasingly being embraced by right-wing paramilitary
groups, neo-Nazi skinheads, the Ku Klux Klan, and survivalists as a
justification for waging a holy war against groups they hate and
fear.
</P>
<P>
   Because Christian Identity's teachings are literally apocalyptic
_ followers believe God's chosen people must destroy Satan's army
at Armageddon _ violence against Jews and minorities is on the rise
with the approach of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we ramp up to the millennium, we can expect to see a period
of ritual cleansing _ racial scapegoating and acts of violence _
aimed at those groups perceived as evil and wrong,'' said Chip
Berlet, senior analyst with the nonprofit Political Research
Associates in Somerville, Mass. ``As we ramp down from the
millennium and these disappointed extremists realize the world
didn't come to an end, we could be in for a period of ritual
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, this situation will be with us for some time, and
it is getting worse as it gets to the year 2000,'' Berlet said.
</P>
<P>
   Barley says the media and groups that monitor hate crimes
conspire to distort the teachings of Christian Identity and brand
its mostly peace-loving followers as terrorists, murderers, and
``kooks.'' He says his church is not connected either to white
supremacist Richard Butler, a longtime Christian Identity pastor,
or to Butler's Aryan Nations group that Furrow joined in 1995 in
nearby Hayden Lake, Idaho. ``There is too much Hitler-worship going
on there,'' Barley added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Christian Identity, which is estimated to have from
35,000 to 50,000 followers nationwide, is what Mark Potok of the
nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center calls ``the glue that binds
the radical right together,'' and it appears to be the common
demoninator in a series of recent hate crimes. For example:
</P>
<P>
   --Authorities in California say Benjamin and James Williams,
brothers recently charged in the murder of two gay men and the
firebombing of three synagogues in the Sacramento area, have been
involved in the Christian Identity movement.
</P>
<P>
   --Benjamin Smith, who went on a Fourth of July weekend rampage,
shooting Asians, Jews, and a black man in Illinois and Indiana, was
a follower of the World Church of the Creator, an anti-Semitic sect
in East Peoria, Ill., closely aligned with Christian Identity.
</P>
<P>
   --Eric Rudolph, the fugitive wanted for the Atlanta Olympic
bombings in 1996 and attacks on abortion clinics, has been linked
to the Christian Identity movement.
</P>
<P>
   --A book called ``War Cycles, Peace Cycles,'' by Richard Kelly
Hoskins, a prominent Christian Identity writer whose works
reportedly have inspired terrorist acts and bank robberies, was
found in Furrow's van. Butler, the Christian Identity pastor, is
believed to have married Furrow and Debra Mathews, widow of Robert
Mathews, a founder of the Order, a white supremacist-terrorist
group.
</P>
<P>
   Those who monitor the Christian Identity movement _ mostly
academics and organizations that track hate groups _ get the bulk
of their information from the Internet, where many of the
ministries maintain websites for spreading their doctrine, selling
publications, and promoting radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   America's Promise Ministries, for example, has only 40 members
in Sandpoint, but a much larger virtual community can read Barley's
monthly newsletters, which accuse Jews of controlling the media,
corporations, and the White House, and can purchase books titled
``America: Free, White, &AMP; Christian,'' and ``Who Killed Christ?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conquer we must, for our cause is just,'' is the motto of the
Kingdom Identity Ministries in Harrison, Ark. A doctrine statement
on its website calls homosexuality ``an abomination before God and
should be punished by death,'' and Jews ``the literal seed of
Satan...a curse to true Israel...an evil race'' that will have its
ultimate end on Judgment Day.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of this modern-day Christian Identity movement are in
nineteenth-century England, where an ideologue named John Wilson
popularized British Israelism, a theory that Northern European
Christians were the descendants of the lost tribe of Israel and
that the birthright of God's chosen people belonged to white
Anglo-Saxons, not Jews. Howard Rand, a Haverhill lawyer and
stalwart of the Massachusetts Prohibition Party, imported the ideas
to the United States in the 1920s, created the Anglo-Saxon
Federation of America, a white supremacist group, and published
widely on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Identity theory percolated for years _
industrialist Henry Ford was intrigued by it _ but in the 1940s and
1950s a group of anti-Semitic California ministers spun a more
radically racist theology. The Jews, they maintained, were
descendants of Cain, offspring of Eve and Satan, and people of
color were subhuman ``Mud People,'' created by the devil as lazy,
soulless parasites.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Lamy, a sociology professor at Castleton State College in
Vermont and an expert on the millennium, says forms of Christian
Identity are flourishing now because right-wing extremists can plug
almost any threatening group _ feminists, gays, government
officials, Jews, immigrants, African-Americans _into its
``millennial myth'' that the end of human history is near and evil
must be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Buford Furrow or the Unabomber are motivated to
violence by emotional and psychological problems, not
philosophies,'' Lamy said. ``But now, when something happens that
tips them over the edge, they are more likely to act on their
ideology or theology because we're in an apocalyptic age.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some momentous end-of-the-world scenario, they are the
martyrs,'' Lamy said.

CHINESE LEADER ACTS TO STRENGTHEN HIS AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TAIWAN-ISLAND) 
(mk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In an atmosphere of crisis, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin is fighting on several fronts at once, trying to exert his
personal authority in new ways.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an exceedingly difficult political challenge from
Taiwan, where President Lee Tung-hui seems to be spoiling Beijing's
dream of reunification, Jiang is not retreating, but is rather
taking the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that he threatens force against Taiwan, Jiang
is conducting twin political campaigns: one against Falun Gong, the
spiritual movement that was outlawed last month, and the other
against laxness in the Communist Party apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, state media reported a major policy address by Jiang,
his first since the leadership emerged from an annual summer
conclave at the seaside resort of Beidaihe. Jiang spoke not about
Taiwan or Falun Gong, or even about Communist Party discipline.
Instead, he ventured into a fourth area where he would like to make
a personal imprint: economic reform, in which he is exerting
greater influence.
</P>
<P>
   Why juggle so many balls in the air at one time? With the Taiwan
issue virtually unsolvable, political experts here say, Jiang is
taking the offensive in other areas to extend and strengthen his
authority in case Taiwan does not turn out well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oct. 1 is the key date,'' a political analyst in Beijing said,
referring to the 50th anniversary of Communist Party rule, an
occasion for an enormous political pageant. ``Jiang is reacting to
events, but he is also asserting himself in a way that makes him
the unquestioned leader at an important time.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, when China's leaders conclude their highly secretive
summer conclave, experts look for clues to what was decided, and
characteristically come up with little. While many guess at whether
moderates or conservatives scored more points, all appearances this
year point to a stronger hand for Jiang, who likes to portray
himself as being simultaneously in the middle and above it all.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, political experts in Beijing were surprised by a
headline that streamed across the top of the People's Daily, the
Communist Party's mouthpiece: ``Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang
Zemin Discuss Materialism and Atheism.''
</P>
<P>
   That might sound like so much Communist Party drivel to an
outsider, but party historians doubtless noted the milestone. It
was the first time that the newspaper had placed Jiang on an even
stage with Mao and Deng, each considered giants of China's
revolutionary struggle, and the timing of such a grand assertion
can hardly be coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   When Deng passed ultimate control of China's leadership to Jiang
in the early 1990s, Jiang chose Taiwan as one of the main issues
that would define his leadership. The goal of reunifying Taiwan
with mainland China had been beyond the grasp of Mao and Deng, and
this was clearly an issue where Jiang could distinguish himself.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang chose his trusted mentor, the former Shanghai Mayor Wang
Daohan, to open negotiations with Taiwan. Wang, a flexible and
creative politician, began talks with a Taiwan counterpart in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Taiwan has proved more difficult than Jiang seemed to
expect. Lee rebuffed repeated attempts to give the talks substance,
and then shocked Beijing in July this year by asserting that Taiwan
would now see China in a ``special state-to-state relationship,''
discarding the earlier framework that saw the two as part of one
conceptual nation.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Lee's move as a possibly irreparable step away from
reunification, Jiang now faces an excruciating dilemma. Acquiescing
to Lee's action opens Jiang to attack from hawkish critics that he
is losing Taiwan. Yet taking military action risks the great
humiliation that would come from an effective counterattack by
Taiwan's forces, and from drawing U.S. forces to Taiwan's defense.
</P>
<P>
   A major element of Jiang's leadership has been to bring China
into closer cooperation with the United States, China's biggest
trading partner. That stance could be ruined by a conflict with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials recently warned Washington that they may be
forced to ``punish'' Taiwan with some kind of military strike, a
message that China's media have been trumpeting for a month,
apparently in the hope that Washington would be able to force Lee
to retract his stance. Yet Lee shows no sign of retreating.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang may try to muddle through a middle ground, making a
limited military move that satisfies China's hawks, without causing
the disruption that would come from an all-out war. Yet on such a
delicate issue, mixing the potentially explosive matters of
sovereignty and military might, the situation is highly
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Another plank of Jiang's leadership is economic growth, which
many experts believe is crucial to maintaining the acceptance of
Communist Party rule by restive workers in urban areas, where
unemployment is growing fast. Economic growth could also be
severely damaged by any military action.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's policy address, Jiang seemed to try to steer a
middle course, stressing the need for economic growth while being
vigilant on military issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competitiveness in our overall national strength is
increasingly a decisive factor in shaping a country's fate,'' Jiang
said. ``We are on the verge of a new and rare opportunity, but at
the same time we face grave new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only by unceasingly enhancing our economic strength, defensive
strength and national cohesiveness can we establish an unbeatable
position in international competition that grows more intense each
day, and effectively protect our national sovereignty and national
dignity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until recently, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji was seen to be in
charge of China's economic reform program. Yet Zhu's position
appears to have been weakened after his trip in April to the United
States, where he was accused by conservative rivals of having
offered too many concessions to try to win China's entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, appearing at an international horticultural
exhibition in Kunming, in China's southwest, Zhu denied reports
that he might resign. Yet while other leaders met at Beidaihe, he
was pictured prominently in the media as he inspected flood waters
in central China.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu was also conspicuously absent from the stage in northeast
China where Jiang delivered his policy address on economic reform,
where several other leading officials did appear. Instead, Zhu was
pictured in Friday's media at the horticultural exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zhu does not appear to have been completely sidelined,
his authority over economic reform seems to have been curtailed.
That paves the way for a greater hand in economic reform for Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese experts believe that Jiang opened the campaign
against Falun Gong 10 days after the Taiwan crisis erupted in order
to engage in an easily winnable political movement to draw
attention away from a more difficult one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jiang appears to have detected in Falun Gong a genuine
threat to the Communist Party's role as the undisputed power in the
nation, and also to have seen an opportunity to mobilize the
Communist Party apparatus behind him as Falun Gong is stamped out.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, China's official bluster about Taiwan continues. One
newspaper, the China Business Times, devoted its front page on
Thursday to an analysis of potential military conflict, confidently
predicting that Taiwan forces would not be able to withstand an
onslaught from the mainland for more than four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts say, however, that the Chinese army is woefully
equipped for an amphibious assault on Taiwan. That may be why,
during the last crisis in 1996, China lobbed a few missiles into
the ocean near Taiwan, talking tough as it took essentially
harmless action.
</P>
<P>
   Limited military action is still possible, military experts say,
like the seizing of one of the small islands that Taiwan controls,
even though they hug the coast of China. But tough-sounding threats
from Beijing have been part of official policy for 50 years, during
which China has yet to actually move on Taiwan.

GAILEY TRYING TO MAKE THE COWBOYS BETTER DAILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Every day at 3 o'clock, or whenever they
get around to it, The Ticket broadcasts Cowboys coach Chan Gailey's
daily press briefings from Wichita Falls. It's ``live'' radio, or
semi-live, depending on whether the Hardline boys are in the middle
of their esoteric opening or, more important, Gailey's mood.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, some days Chan just isn't very ``live,'' period.
</P>
<P>
   Some astute marketing genius at the station has dubbed this
training camp feature ``Gailey Daily.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that daily, by increments and inches, this football
team gradually is coming to bear, for better or worse, Gailey's
indelible stamp. More and more, this is becoming his football team.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, don't try to sell that to the Cowboys' modest,
take-no-credit head coach, who shakes his head and resorts to his
best Georgia drawl to wave off such notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it in terms of control and power,'' Gailey
said one day recently after a morning practice. ``I look at it in
terms of what's best for the football team. Jerry and Stephen
\RJones\S and I have discussions about what needs to happen and how
things need to go. We come to a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good working relationship. I'm not into who has the
power and who has the control. I'm into doing what's right for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the daily Gaily stamp we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you,'' owner Jerry Jones said, unsolicited, ``how
impressed I am and continue to be with Chan.''
</P>
<P>
   He's the same coach who came out of nowhere to take the Cowboys'
job even when close friends in the fraternity were telling him he'd
be making a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year wiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know our players better,'' Gailey said. ``I have a better
idea about what people can do, what their strengths are, what their
weaknesses are. I have a year more of experience. Where the exact
places are that that comes into play, I don't know, but hopefully
I've learned some things from having been through them last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a head coach before, so I had a little bit of an
idea about what was involved, but I've been willing to adjust and
listen to other ideas, realizing that I might not have every
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Gailey what his biggest mistake was last year and he's
stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't evaluate things that way,'' he said, because he
doesn't really like negative questions, ``but if you ask me what I
did really good last year, I don't have an answer for that one
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan was to develop as much as depth as we could this
off-season. We tried to do that last year, but, the way things
worked out, a lot of things happened that kept us from doing what
we wanted to do. If I start listing them, then I become an
excuse-maker and I refuse to do that. The bottom line is that we
didn't do it, and we just need to move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   He is convinced that this year's team will be better than last
year's squad, which cratered in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more knowledge of the system, so we should be better
whether we brought anybody else in or not,'' Gailey said. ``We try
to see a weakness and then we try to shore it up the best we can.
Sometimes the salary cap doesn't allow you to do exactly what you
want to do _ Jerry would do anything, if it wasn't for the cap _
but you do what you can. You always want to improve your speed, and
we think we've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the team's personality. If Gailey stands for
anything, it's integrity. No one hurts more than Gailey when
there's an off-field problem that reflects badly on the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has had to come to grips with reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to avoid all that off-field stuff, but guys are
human,'' he said. ``When something happens, you have to decide if,
(1) this is a bad person and if they are, how you can extricate
them from the team; and (2) even if they're not a bad person, is
the behavior detrimental to the team? Is the action becoming too
much of a distraction? If it is, then you have to find a way to
rectify it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a hard line. When we were growing up, they used to
draw a line and if you walked over that line, you were wrong and
you were punished for it. That line's not there any more. Everybody
comes from different backgrounds, they grew up different, they have
different sets of standards and values and you have to take all
that into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is different players who have different
standards and backgrounds, and you're trying to mesh them into a
team and sometimes they don't understand how somebody else grew up
or perceives right and wrong. We're trying to get everybody on the
same page and still let everyone be their own person.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Gailey's daily challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the chance to be a very good football team. We
really do,'' Gailey said, ``but we have to play with consistency.
Not 12 games worth, not nine games worth, but 16 games worth. Then
we go make a run at the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistent: That's Gailey in a nutshell.
</P>
<P>
   Same guy, same time, same station, every day.

 HOW TO PLAY THE TREASURY BOND BUYBACK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15)

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans on occasion have suffered various shortages _ of
gasoline, for example, or pennies or sensibly priced Internet
stocks. Never in memory, however, have they even imagined a
shortage of government debt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the first budget surpluses in a generation emerging,
the government is moving to make its obligations a little bit
scarce. That is, if anything amounting to $3.6 trillion can be
thought of as ``scarce.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced earlier this month and still lacking
details, is to buy back some outstanding Treasury bonds and to sell
fewer new ones. The government will eliminate one of three auctions
a year it holds for bonds with the longest maturity, 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   This prospect, many analysts believe, not only offers the chance
of a modest profit to some bond holders, but also suggests that
some rethinking may be in order on the part of those supercautious
investors who put their faith in Washington's promises.
</P>
<P>
   A shrunken supply of Treasuries implies higher prices and lower
returns, thereby making competing high-quality bonds, especially
the $1.1 trillion issued by federal agencies and
government-sponsored organizations, like the Federal National
Mortgage Association, more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how William H. Gross, managing director of Pacific
Investment Management and a prominent figure in the world of bonds,
recommends playing the buyback, which isn't slated to occur until
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start to buy what the government is going to buy'' several
months from now, he suggested. ``Individuals can actually front-run
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   However, transaction costs are significant relative to the
potential profits, in the view of William C. Dudley, a vice
president at Goldman Sachs. You may need to make a six-figure
commitment to benefit enough to compensate for broker fees and
other costs.
</P>
<P>
   But other things being equal, the buyback program provides a
cushion if rates rise, because the government is acting as a
support for bond prices. If they fall, it can only give your
portfolio some extra juice.
</P>
<P>
   You might suppose the government would target its most expensive
debt, such as its 14 percent bonds due in 2011 or its 15}s of 2001,
for buybacks, which will be conducted through dealers. But
specialists say you would probably be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This is because such bonds now sell at prices way above their
face, or maturity, value. The government is required to treat any
amount it pays above face value as an extra budgetary expense
rather than a run-of-the-mill refinancing. That is something
Washington presumably wants to minimize. And so, analysts say, the
more likely issues to be repurchased are those due from 2015 to
2025 with coupons of between 7 percent and 9 percent. Today, these
trade at far smaller premiums to their face value.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gary Gensler, undersecretary of the Treasury for domestic
finance, cautioned that budgetary concerns would not necessarily
bar the buyback of double-digit coupons since other factors,
including market conditions, would also affect the choice.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving interest costs, the government is hoping
to improve the liquidity of benchmark issues _ such as the 30-year
bond auctioned last week _ by trimming the number of older,
competing ``off the run'' issues, such as the bonds sold last
August and now due in 29 years. Off-the-runs now yield about
one-quarter of a percentage point more than their newly minted
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking inactive ones out and issuing more
on-the-run,'' said William Quan, senior economist at Aubrey G.
Lanston, a specialist in government securities. That will save the
government interest payments in the short term and insures more
demand in future auctions.
</P>
<P>
   With one of the goals being to shorten the average length of
outstanding debt, another focus will likely be on issues with 15 to
25 years left until maturity, most of these with coupons in the
high single digits. And it's almost certain that the Treasury won't
be bidding for any bonds with call features under which it can
force redemption, many of these, not surprisingly, carrying the
highest coupons.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of trying to guess which Treasuries the government
will seek to retire, investors may well decide to shop more
profitably elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bound to encourage a widening of interest-rate
differentials'' between Treasuries and the debt of federal agencies
and corporations, said Henry Kaufman, proprietor of a New York
advisory firm bearing his name. ``That's where the opportunities
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Agency debt includes bonds of the Federal Home Loan Bank as well
as those of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. _ the latter two actually private
companies chartered by the government. Their debt already yields
between one-half and three-quarters of a point more than Treasuries
of similar maturity. That differential will probably be wider in
the future due to the lower rates offered by increasingly scarce
Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   If you insist on a federal stamp of approval, don't forget one
obvious alternative: certificates of deposits available at your
local bank. The six-month variety is yielding nearly a percentage
point more than a comparable Treasury bill _ though, of course,
you'll pay both state and federal taxes.

NEW CHIEF HOPES TO MEND A BROKEN CHEROKEE NATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: map is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers

 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAHLEQUAH, Okla. _ As a member of the Cherokee Nation and a
student of its history, Chad Smith need only look to his family
tree to find a famed leader of his tribe. Redbird Smith, his
great-grandfather, was a patriot who went to prison rather than
accept the federal policy that deprived the Cherokees of millions
of acres.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, Smith will take office on Saturday as the
principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, and, like his
great-grandfather, who served in the Cherokee Senate, he is
assuming leadership at a time of crisis. For the last four years,
the Cherokees have engaged in political infighting so bitter that
it almost undermined their constitution and ultimately led to
intervention by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the priorities of his administration, Smith, a
48-year-old lawyer from the Tulsa suburbs, replied simply,
``Healing.''
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 200,000 members, half of whom live here in
northeastern Oklahoma, the Cherokees are the country's
second-largest tribe, behind the Navajos. And they have enjoyed a
degree of prosperity and autonomy that has made them a model to
other tribes. Now Smith must restore confidence in the tribal
government not only among Cherokees but also among federal
officials, who stepped in two years ago at the height of the
tribe's crisis, after members brawled outside the tribal
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important that the tribe come back together,
and I think it will,'' said Rennard Strickland, dean of the
University of Oregon School of Law, who is half-Cherokee and has
written five books about the tribe. ``The Cherokees have a very
long history of being able to heal these kinds of tribal divisions.
It has been a long 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Cherokees, the last four years alone have seemed
interminable. The election of Joe Byrd as principal chief in 1995
followed the disqualification of his runoff opponent by the tribe's
highest court. That opponent, George Bearpaw, was ruled ineligible
because he had once pleaded guilty to an assault charge, though the
conviction was later expunged. Many Cherokees regarded Byrd's
victory as tainted, and his predecessor, Chief Wilma Mankiller,
refused to attend his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the tribal government, with headquarters here at
Tahlequah, teetered on collapse. First, Byrd dismissed 15 members
of the Cherokees' marshals service who had executed a search
warrant of his office as part of an investigation into the
possibility of financial wrongdoing. Then, at the urging of Byrd,
eight members of the tribal council _ the seven other members were
absent _ ousted by impeachment the three justices on the court who
had issued the warrant. And on June 20 of that year, an armed
security force hired by Byrd seized the tribal courthouse and
locked out all the employees, a move tantamount to taking over the
judicial branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed that every month we would have a new problem,'' Ms.
Mankiller said the other day. ``Just when we would think things
wouldn't get any worse, they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom came on Aug. 13, 1997, when the fired marshals, led
by their director, Pat Ragsdale, tried to take back the courthouse
at the behest of the three impeached justices. A fight broke out
with Byrd's security force, and town police officers and county
deputies arrested Ragsdale. federal officers eventually came to
Tahlequah (pronounced TAH-luh-kwah), and Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt helped mediate the dispute. The justices were ultimately
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 election, with a field of nine candidates, including
Chief Byrd, became a referendum on his administration. Respected
leaders like Ms. Mankiller and Julian Fite, a former U.S. attorney,
endorsed Ragsdale in the primary, but Smith, who had finished third
in 1995, built a coalition with an appeal to Cherokee tradition,
heritage and culture. He had worked as a tribal prosecutor, as well
as a public defender in Tulsa, and had served in two tribal
administrations. He had also taught Indian law and history at
several colleges, including Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith's candidacy was not without problems: It came out
during the primary that he had fathered three children outside his
marriage. But his wife, a former Miss Cherokee, issued a statement
titled ``In Support of My Husband,'' and when Smith emerged as
Byrd's runoff opponent, the defeated candidates and their backers
rallied behind him. He won by 1,600 votes, of about 13,000 cast, in
the runoff balloting last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of coalition that came together to bring in new
leadership and defeat this administration was really something that
I haven't seen in a long, long time,'' Ms. Mankiller said.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Smith says his ``defining moment'' came on June
20, 1997, the day Byrd's officers seized the courthouse. County
deputies had cordoned off the building, essentially enforcing the
chief's takeover, but Smith ducked under the police tape. As he
began to walk toward the courthouse to protest, he was tackled and
arrested. He says he considered the seizure of the courthouse a
challenge to the legitimacy of the Cherokee Nation's government and
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges facing Smith and his new administration are
formidable. The Cherokees, who have no reservation per se but
exercise certain jurisdictional rights in 14 northeastern Oklahoma
counties under agreements with the state and federal governments,
operate on an annual budget of $150 million, about $90 million of
it from Washington. But the government, having found a lack of
accountability in the use of federal money, has placed the tribe
under a monthly draw for those grants, rather than yearly. Byrd
himself also faces misappropriation-of-funds charges brought by
tribal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Byrd denied any wrongdoing and said
that he had never overstepped his constitutional bounds. He said
that he would leave the tribe with a $12 million surplus in the
fiscal year and that under his leadership improvements had been
made in the tribe's high school and its business, Cherokee Nation
Industries, which builds computer boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving the goose that lays the golden egg,'' said Byrd,
who remains popular among the people from whom he sprung, the
tribe's many rural Oklahomans.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and his allies are far less certain of the tribe's fiscal
health. Ms. Mankiller, whose daughters are now working on Smith's
transition team, said initial financial reviews had found a
bookkeeping mess. She said only one independent audit of government
finances had been conducted since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he planned to institute new rules and procedures to
ensure the tribe's fiscal integrity. He also hopes to promote
economic development, improve services and promote the Cherokees'
culture and heritage. At the inauguration, he said, he will plant a
tree on the courthouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It symbolizes rebirth,'' he said. ``We reach into our history,
and we try to honor it and remember it.''

ROBERT FRANK: ECONOMIST WHO WOULD REIN IN GALLOPING CONSUMPTION
WITH A TAX  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct spelling of `galloping' in hed)   By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. _ On the bulletin board of Robert H. Frank's office
at Cornell University are two glossy photos.
</P>
<P>
   One is of a Porsche 911 Turbo, price $105,000. The other is of a
Patek Philippe Calibre '89 timepiece, price $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   They are not there as objects of lust, but they are not there
quite as objects of mere censorious academic disapproval either.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they symbolize the subject of Frank's work on the
psychology and utility of spending and the relative virtues of
public and private consumption. Indeed, Frank, whose newest book is
``Luxury Fever'' (Free Press, 1999), has become the popular
economist of the moment and academia's most conspicuous critic of
the dizzy spend-athon of the '90s. He argues that people are caught
in an arms race of consumption and that tax policies need to be
changed to encourage public investment over private spending.
</P>
<P>
   Frank's new-found celebrity _ he has become an opinion-page
regular of various newspapers and an ascendant talking head on
television _ has not come without criticism. Even some friendly
economists fault his work for being long on supposition and short
on data. And conservative economists say the government has no
business encouraging or discouraging people from buying luxury
goods they want.
</P>
<P>
   But even some who see his prescriptions as political nonstarters
concede that Frank has ventured into one of the most intriguing
thickets in economics and modern life: why people spend money, what
they spend it on, whether they spend it on the right things.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's smart for each individual may not make sense for the
group,'' said Frank, 54. ``It's very often smart for one, dumb for
all. It's my core idea. I've been pushing it for 25 years, but when
I wrote about it back in 1985, no one wanted to discuss it. I'm
glad people are listening now.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who has an undergraduate degree in mathematics, a masters
degree in statistics, and a doctorate in economics, has taken a
textbook route from cloistered academic to op-ed page regular and
talking head.
</P>
<P>
   His early books, like ``Choosing the Right Pond: Human Behavior
and the Quest for Status'' (Oxford University Press, 1985) focused
on rivalry and cooperation in economic and social behavior and were
written for a largely academic audience.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, Frank has emerged as a purveyer of
deceptively simple ideas that have skillfully tied economic issues
to broad social problems. In 1995, he and his co-author, Philip J.
Cook, published ``The Winner Take-All Society,'' which argued that
our economy and public life is being warped by a society
increasingly dominated by a few big winners and many losers.
Instead of thousands of privately owned coffee shops, there are now
thousands of Starbucks. Students, instead of happily going to their
local college, are funneled into a national sweepstakes in which
the lucky few get into Harvard. The outcome, they argue, is a
high-stress society that directs too many resources in the wrong
direction and generates wasteful spending patterns.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Luxury Fever: Why Money Fails to Satisfy in an Era of
Excess,'' Frank updates many of the ideas of ``Choosing the Right
Pond,'' to the Land Rover-stock options-Chateau Latour era. In the
earlier book, he examined the ways, as he saw it, in which ``people
come into the world equipped with an inner voice urging them to
rank as high as possible on whatever social hierarchy they belong
to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new one, he analyzes the boom in luxury spending, whether
for a $5,000 Viking-Frontgate Professional Grill, a $17,500 Patek
Philippe wristwatch, a $1,800-a-night suite at the Four Seasons
Resort in Palm Beach, Fla., or a $48,000 Lexus LX450 sport-utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   He argues, as he did in ``Choosing the Right Pond,'' that
spending choices have more to do with comparative values than
absolute ones. A 3,000-square-foot house that would be a palace in
Japan, for example, or even in 1970s America, no longer measures up
if your neighbor's house has 4,000 square feet. If competitors are
wearing $1,500 suits to job interviews, you need to do the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are other critics of consumption, many of them allied with
the notion of ``voluntary simplicity,'' which argues for
individuals to scale down their lives and demands.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unlike them, Frank contends that hyper-consumption can make
sense for individuals. If they want the best school district for
their child, it might make sense to buy an overpriced house in an
exclusive town. If others are driving enormous sport utilities
vehicles, people might not be safe in an economical,
environmentally friendly Honda Civic. Like a crowd of people at a
concert, who all decide to stand because the row in front of them
has done so, individual behavior _ standing at a concert, instead
of comfortably sitting _ can sometimes make sense if it is dictated
by group dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   The problems arise when the needs of the individual are contrary
to the needs of the group. The result of luxury fever, he argues,
is that individuals work too many hours and undergo too much
stress; that society neglects too many critical public needs,
ranging from better roads to cleaner air and water, at the expense
of often-frivolous private ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The left basically got it wrong from the beginning,'' said
Frank, who votes Democratic and is clearly closer to the left end
of the spectrum than the right. ``They said the market is bad
because the firms are too powerful and they take advantage of us.
They manipulate us through advertisements. They control the
political process. It's totally wrong. If there's something really
good out there, you'll buy it with or without advertising and if
there's a crumby thing, the ads can make you try it once, but you
won't come back. So corporations have an incentive to spend their
advertising dollars on things you are going to like.''
</P>
<P>
   The right, he said, gets it wrong by putting all its faith in
the wisdom of the market and the idea that individual demands give
the best outcomes for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, they do,'' he said. ``But often they don't. When
whatever I want has negative consequences for someone else, then
the invisible hand doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   To Frank, the solution does not lie in the good intentions of
the ``voluntary simplicity'' movement or the imposition of luxury
taxes on yachts or diamonds. Instead, he says, it lies in a
progressive tax on consumption _ not the conventional sales tax,
under which all purchasers pay the same thing, but a tax on total
spending, with rates increasing as spending increases. Consumption
would be calculated, essentially, by subtracting savings from
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The tax would act like boxing gloves or steroid bans, he said,
to keep the competition at a more sensible level by deterring
runaway spending on luxuries: the biggest houses and biggest boats
and costliest cars would tend to get smaller and less costly and
the restraints on spending would ripple down through society, just
as the luxury arms race now ripples up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I love stuff,'' said Frank, who has a Saab and BMW in
the garage of his 1911 Arts and Crafts-style house in Ithaca, N.Y.
``I like cars. I like food and wine. I buy rugs and lamps. You
can't change human nature. You can just change the rules of the
game. You don't eliminate the race. You just make it cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Many mainstream economists applaud the idea of a consumption
tax, and say the idea makes sense, however dim its political
prospects may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you don't use the argument Frank does about
consumption, it's an excellent way to encourage savings,'' said
Kenneth Arrow, a retired Stanford University economist and Nobel
laureate. And many liberal economists applaud Frank's ability to
put broad issues about consumption and public investment on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   To many free-market conservatives, however, Frank's scholarship
and newfound celebrity are equally suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin Rosen, an economist at the University of Chicago said
Frank's views on why people spend are based on supposition, not on
research. He said the government has no business telling people
what to spend money on, and the robust economy is eloquent
rejoinder to Frank's critique. And he argues that data showing an
alarmingly low savings rate fail to take into account the degree to
which a rising stock market has allowed people to accumulate wealth
in ways that savings figures do not measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should some guy in Ithaca be telling me what I should be
spending money on?'' he asked. ``How does he know why people spend?
He has no data, no proof. You can't have economic policy or
government involvement in the economy based on pure speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say an overall consumption tax is too crude an instrument,
one that would still allow people to spend on the most socially
harmful goods if they chose. Others said that a proposal, in
effect, to take resources from the rich and give them to the
government is the kind of solution only a liberal academic could
seriously propose at a time when politicians are battling over the
size of tax cuts. And conservatives argue that private spending is
more efficient than government spending, so a dollar taken from
consumption need not mean a dollar in services like better roads or
federal food inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Frank concedes that his argument can sound too simple,
particularly when he adds the seemingly contradictory kicker that
if people followed the incentives to save and invest rather than
spend, their extra earnings would allow them to spend even more
than they did earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the critics tend to give credit to Frank for being
onto something truly vexing and insufficiently examined in American
life at a time houses built in this country have doubled in size
since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hirshleifer, a retired University of California at Los
Angeles economist, reviewed ``Luxury Fever'' unfavorably in the
publication ``Reason.'' But he concluded: ``Still, I am inclined to
defend Frank in one important respect: as a moralist and a
Jeremiah. If our society is to remain at its barely civilized
level, from time to time we do need to be reproved for the
vulgarity of wasteful consumption, not to mention the in-your-face
boorishness currently recommended by ideologies of
self-assertiveness and self-esteem.''
</P>

   Frank sees his work as scholarship, not moralizing. But he is
comfortable with the degree to which his work has taken economic
issues and raised overarching social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been natural for me to think of everything as an
economic question,'' he said. ``It's all choice. It's all scarcity.
You want to do more of one thing, you have to do less of another.
Money is just a unit of accounting to think about how much we care
about different things. I think one of the problems with economics
is that it has insisted on too narrow a model of human nature, too
impoverished a view of social interaction. You can't explain
everything as trying to squeeze our every ounce from the bottom
line.''

RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES VIE FOR STRONG SHOWING IN IOWA POLL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DES MOINES _ Becky Bell, a corn and soybean farmer from Malvern,
Iowa, bounded up to Patrick Buchanan at the State Fair here Friday
with words of encouragement on the eve of the Republican Party's
straw poll. ``Good luck, Pat!'' she said as the candidate, sporting
a red, white and blue tie, broke into a smile.
</P>
<P>
   But moments later, when Drew Ivers, Buchanan's state chairman,
tried to sign up Mrs. Bell as a backer, she demurred, saying she
was still browsing _ and was quite taken by Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's between him and Bauer,'' said Mrs. Bell, 46. ``It's a
hard choice. We need someone with principles and values who stands
up for Americans. We need it for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivers, who ran Buchanan's operation here in 1996, knew Mrs.
Bell's dilemma all too well. He told her that he had almost gone
with Bauer himself before he signed on with Buchanan again several
months ago. ``I had to wrestle with it, too,'' he said. ``If I was
in a foxhole, I'd have equal faith in Pat Buchanan and Gary
Bauer.''
</P>
<P>
   There are really two contests going on in Saturday's important
but nonbinding straw poll. Beyond the big-money rivalry between
Texas Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and publishing mogul Steve
Forbes, a hard-fought competition is under way among several
contenders hoping to emerge as the champion of religious
conservatives. These candidates make the case that Bush, despite
his success winning over some conservative leaders, is too
pragmatic to champion causes like halting abortions, encouraging
prayer in schools and taking sex and violence out of movies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike four years ago, when Buchanan had much of the
conservative field to himself, this time he finds himself in
competition with Bauer; former Vice President Dan Quayle; radio
talk show host Alan Keyes, and even Forbes, who is making an
energetic play for social conservatives. Elizabeth Dole, though
more moderate on social issues than the others, has also emphasized
her Christian beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not frustrated by it at all,'' said Buchanan, who faces an
uphill drive to replicate his third-place finish in the straw poll
four years ago. ``But it's a tougher race in terms of folks' being
well organized early and knowing the importance of it. But you go
with the flow. You've got to adjust and adapt to the conditions,
and we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The dream of these contenders is to pull a surprise Saturday by
following the model of Pat Robertson, who stunned the political
establishment, not to say the two leading contenders, Sen. Bob Dole
and Vice President George Bush, when he triumphed in the straw poll
of 1987. Relying on networks of loyal, grassroots backers based in
churches, he captured 34 percent of the vote and immediately
emerged as a national leader of religious conservatives. But
Robertson lost the 1988 Republican nomination; and in fact, no
victor in the straw poll has ever made it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Most campaigns expect Forbes and Bush to take the top two slots
in the straw poll, a significant early test for the candidates even
though not an impartial indication of voter sentiment. Forbes, who
in his campaign four years ago enraged religious conservatives on
the eve of the Iowa caucuses by asserting that ``the Christian
Coalition does not speak for most Christians,'' is pumping
resources into winning them over this time.
</P>
<P>
   One glossy mailing the Forbes campaign sent throughout Iowa
declares, ``Steve Forbes has become the leader of America's
conservative movement.'' Another mailing features a baby on the
cover, with the headline, ``If you don't respect this child. . .,''
followed inside by a photograph of a judge with the headline, ``You
won't wear this robe.'' The mailing assures Republicans that Forbes
``won't appoint judges to the federal bench if they do not value
unborn children.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Forbes, several Republican strategists and organizers
here raised the prospect that Bauer, who has worked through the
churches to build an aggressive grassroots network, has the
potential to emerge as a force. He also benefits from the
grassroots network established by the conservative organization he
headed, the Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Bauer, as a result of the fact that he has worked the
churches _ it's a niche he has found _ he can do well,'' said Rep.
John Kasich, R-Ohio, withdrew from the race in July.
</P>
<P>
   At event after event, the Bauer campaign distributes cards
asking people to sign up to be ``a contact at my church'' or to
become ``a part of the Bauer Prayer network.'' They also pass out
copies of testimony Bauer delivers at churches in which he says,
``I know that you, with Christ working in your lives, can help
transform our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said in an interview, ``I've heard this sort of buzz that
I might do better than expected.'' But then, perhaps seeking to
contain expectations, he played down the role of the churches. ``In
the last four or five months, I have visited a number of
churches,'' he said. ``This is not a Pat Robertson-type operation.
But when somebody writes and says, `I'm a supporter of yours and I
go to such and such a church,' of course we say to them, `try to
find some people in your church.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At a picnic last Sunday in the tiny town of Huxley, Joyce
Andrews, 38, greeted Bauer with other supporters who chanted,
``Bauer Power!'' and told the candidate, ``I saw you at church this
morning.'' She turned to a friend and gushed, ``He was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has not ruled out the possibility of seeking the Reform
Party's nomination should he fare poorly Saturday. And many
Republican strategists say Quayle might have to bail out unless he
places well. His campaign chairman, Kyle McSlarrow, said he was
closely watching Forbes because ``he really cuts into our base.''
</P>
<P>
   McSlarrow said he was trying to get Reggie White, the Green Bay
Packers star who called homosexuality ``one of the biggest sins in
the Bible,'' to appear on behalf of Quayle at the straw poll. But
he conceded that White has also been a staunch backer of Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the battle for conservative issues is only
beginning, several conservative groups placed a two-page
advertisement in The Des Moines Register on Friday calling on the
candidates to sign pledges affirming the strength of marriage and
opposing ''the promotion of homosexuality as normative in America's
public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle insisted that he had no idea how he will do. ``I'm just
focused on getting as many people as we can that support us to
Ames, Iowa,'' he said. ``I don't know how the other candidates are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer offered this assessment: ``I can't get my arms around it.
I'll go to an event and there will be 75 people there, and I'm
floating until my next stop. And then I get out and there's two
people _ and one of them is there by mistake. And I'm thinking,
`Why did I do this.?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Donald and Betty Hanson, Bauer supporters from northeast
Iowa who are in their late 70s, said they were hopeful. ``He's a
man of integrity _ and nothing is impossible with the Lord,''
Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hanson added, ``The Lord is in control.''

NOT ALL RYDER REMARKS ARE CHARITABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Officially, the word from the Ryder Cup rebels
on the U.S. team is that they would be happy with a chance to
direct charitable donations generated by the event and no longer
are pushing to be paid for their services.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara and Phil Mickelson _ the
four players singled out Tuesday for selfish attitudes by U.S.
captain Ben Crenshaw _ all reiterated yesterday that they would be
satisfied with a say in directing donations from the Sept. 24-26
event, which is expected to generate a $23 million profit.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow players, however, question if that truly is the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's bull,'' said Paul Azinger, a three-time Ryder Cup
participant. ``It wasn't about charity at first. That's just spin
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Players present in a Tuesday meeting with Ryder Cup officials
said Davis Love III expressed exasperation with the play-for-pay
quartet when he told them: ``Let's be honest, this isn't about
charity. It's about putting money in your pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, players would receive a tax break from such donations.
But Duval seemed mystified that people would question the sincerity
of his charitable intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know how that works. I'm not at all looking for
a tax break,'' Duval said. ``That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in the estimation of Brad Faxon, who suggested the U.S. team
would be better off with lesser players willing to represent their
country for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``This talk about the money going for charity is a crock,''
Faxon said. ``I know a lot of guys ... who would pay to play on
that team. I think we would be better off having them than the guys
who are complaining about how much they're not getting.''
Second-guessing semantics After helping stir up the Ryder Cup
controversy by terming the event ``an exhibition'' and scoffing at
its $5,000 travel stipend, David Duval said he regrets making those
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't have joked about the stipend,'' Duval said. ``And
calling it an `exhibition' might have been a poor choice of
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is exactly the term Tiger Woods continues to use in
reference to the event, much to the chagrin of its organizers and
Ben Crenshaw. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a winner's check?,'' Woods asked.
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it's an exhibition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Duval drew the ire of Crenshaw when he joked about
the Ryder Cup's paltry travel stipend by saying he ``just might
take that money and retire.'' Kendall's record day Skip Kendall
broke the Medinah Country Club course record in yesterday's second
round, bagging seven birdies in his first 10 holes en route to a
7-under 65. Kendall, who opened with a 74, collected eight birdies
and one bogey in eclipsing the previous mark of 66, held by five
others, including first-round leader Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only missed one fairway all day, and I birdied that hole,''
Kendall said. ``It was one of those rounds you dream about,
especially in a major.'' Many happy returns After withdrawing from
the tournament Thursday morning, Steve Elkington gave his golf bag
to a young spectator and headed to a Chicago hospital to visit his
caddie, Joe ``Gypsy'' Grillo, who was hospitalized with chest
pains.
</P>
<P>
   One problem.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington forgot to remove a pouch filled with personal items,
including his wedding ring and some prescription medications,
before giving away the bag. So he asked TNT announcers to make a
plea during yesterday's telecast for the return of those items.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, Scott Kent of Winfield, Ill., received a call
at work from a neighbor who had seen the telecast and knew that
Elkington had given his bag to Ryan Kent, Scott's 4-year-old son.
By 6 p.m., tournament officials had reunited Elkington with his
pouch and Ryan Kent had a souvenir _ as well as a story for the
ages _ as a memento of his first trip to a professional golf
tournament.

COLOMBIANS OUTRAGED AS BELOVED HUMORIST, PEACE ACTIVIST SHOT TO
DEATH

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Jaime Garzon, who was Colombia's most beloved
humorist and an occasional go-between in the nation's peace
process, was shot dead Friday by two motorcycle gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, 38, was shot four times in the head and chest while
driving to the Radionet station in Bogota, where he was host of a
popular morning program, Colombian police said.
</P>
<P>
   As his Jeep Cherokee slowed through an intersection, the gunmen
opened fire, a witness told Bogota's Caracol television station,
where Garzon also worked. ``There was nothing we could do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians were outraged. Television and radio stations carried
extensive coverage of the investigation, and the entire country
seemed to go into mourning. A friend, actor Luis Fernando Orozco,
explained Garzon's appeal. ``It's as if, in the United States, they
had assassinated Woody Allen,'' he said, adding: ``It's the
equivalent of killing Charlie Chaplin.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said they suspected that Garzon was slain by gunmen for a
right-wing death squad. According to friends and police, Garzon had
received death threats in the past week and was trying to arrange a
meeting with the country's top paramilitary leader, Carlos Castano,
to discuss the warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Garzon's comedy routines and his work as a radio and
print journalist, he was also a committed peace activist. He had
promoted talks between Colombia's rebel groups and the government
to end the 35-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Navarro Wolf, a Colombian congressman, said Garzon had
told him about the threats. ``I told him 'Jaime, this is serious.
In this country, they kill people.'
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point,'' the congressman said, ``he had bodyguards, but
then he got tired of it. This morning, he was by himself.``
</P>
<P>
   Tearful fans placed flowers, messages and Colombian flags at the
scene of the slaying. University students demonstrated in the
streets, and protests against political violence were planned for
Saturday in Bogota and other Colombian cities.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana canceled a trip to the Colombian
interior and named a commission to investigate the killing. The
government put out a $268,000 reward for information leading to
arrest of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaime identified with the feelings of average Colombians. Like
all Colombians, I am very sad,'' said Pastrana, who vowed that the
gunmen would be captured and punished.
</P>
<P>
   Police launched a citywide dragnet, impounding more than 600
motorcycles and detaining a handful of people. But they refused to
say whether they considered anyone as a suspect in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon rose to fame through his scathing political satire and
spoofs of figures ranging from Pastrana to Napoleon to talk-show
host Larry King.
</P>
<P>
   In one long-running gag, while impersonating the Colombian
president, Garzon would call up ambitious politicians and offer
them ministerial posts.
</P>
<P>
   His most famous TV character was a toothless, down-and-out shoe
shine man who would polish the footwear of the rich and famous
while making biting social commentary.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he traveled to the Colombian jungles with a camera
crew to shine the combat boots of a Marxist guerrilla leader.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pastrana named Garzon to a commission to jump-start
negotiations with the rebel National Liberation Army, or ELN, the
smaller of Colombia's two major guerrilla groups. Following several
guerrilla kidnappings, Garzon served as an intermediary between
rebels and families of hostages. He also arranged several press
conference for rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Such activism may have angered the paramilitaries, who number
about 5,000 and have been waging a terror campaign against the
rebels and their civilian supporters, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything indicates that Carlos Castano was responsible,''
one high-ranking police investigator told Radionet.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitaries, who have at times received covert support
from the Colombian army, have criticized the government's peace
strategy. They have also killed journalists, human rights workers
and government officials whom they have branded as guerrilla
collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement, the main paramilitary umbrella group denied
involvement in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not willing to accept responsibility for acts that are
contrary to our struggle and are recklessly attributed to us,''
said the statement, signed by the United Self-Defense Groups of
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of government ministers, journalists, actors and
friends visited the Radionet studios to denounce the crime and pay
tribute to Garzon. Throughout the day, the station played ``Taps.``
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is the most dangerous nation in the hemisphere for
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Pastrana condemning the Garzon murder, the
Miami-based Inter American Press Association noted that 82
Colombian journalists have been slain in the past decade.

LATIN AMERICAN DRUG CARTELS SAID TO EXPLOIT GAP IN U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ The withdrawal of the United States from
military bases in Panama, combined with the refusal of Venezuela's
new government to allow its airspace to be used for U.S.
surveillance and pursuit flights, has created a huge gap in
regional anti-drug interdiction that trafficking cartels are
exploiting, say U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness has emerged since May, when the United States
returned Howard Air Base, from which 2,000 anti-drug flights a year
had been operating, to Panama, as required by the Panama Canal
Treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Three alternate sites have been found, but they either are not
yet able to function at full capacity or their effectiveness has
been sharply limited by political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very clever people, and they are watching us very
closely,'' Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House's
Office of National Drug Control Policy, said of the drug cartels
during a four-nation South American tour in late July. ``So if you
have an enormous hole in the middle of the equation, it will have a
fundamental change on the effectiveness of these solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Washington, one Pentagon official
expressed hope that ``by the end of the year, we should be up to 85
or 90 percent'' of the flight capacity that existed before the end
of operations in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The official would not estimate the number of drug shipments now
getting through as a result of the problem, but conceded that at
the moment, interdiction efforts are ``not doing so well in the
source zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Bruce Bagley, a professor at the University of Miami
who is an expert on the Latin American drug trade, the United
States ``is not without other assets that can be used,'' in the
area, like satellite photography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it is a setback, it is not a disaster,'' Bagley said
of the Venezuelan policy. ``Colombia is the principal focus of
growing and processing cocaine now, and the lack of rights to
overfly Venezuela does not inhibit efforts as significantly as many
analysts in Washington have suggested.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagley said that although interdiction ``doesn't work very
well'' and is ``barely a holding action,'' the alternative is ``to
do nothing, to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is not a grower of coca, the raw ingredient for
cocaine, or heroin poppies. But it shares a long, poorly patrolled
border with Colombia, which produces 80 percent of the cocaine
consumed in the United States, and more than 100 tons a year of
that drug were estimated to have passed through Venezuela last
year, before flights were banned.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had hoped to negotiate an agreement with
Panama that would have allowed the use of Howard into the next
century . But after announcing in December 1997 that such an accord
had been reached, Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares
reneged.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to close the gap, the Netherlands in April agreed
to grant the United States ground and air access to and use of
selected airfields in the Dutch colonies of Aruba and Curacao,
which lie just off the Venezuelan coast.
</P>
<P>
   A similar agreement has been signed with Ecuador, which allows
U.S. drug surveillance planes to fly from a military base in the
coastal city of Manta.
</P>
<P>
   The Manta flights are intended to monitor drug trafficking up
the Pacific coast of South America to Mexico, which is the main
drug route to the United States. But the runway there is neither
long enough nor can it take the weight of sophisticated electronic
surveillance aircraft. That makes flights from the two Dutch-held
islands ``extremely important,'' a Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   Without overflight permission from Venezuela, though, the
flights from Aruba and Curacao are of limited use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be a truly multilateral effort,'' said Niek
van Zutphen, the Dutch ambassador in Caracas, referring to aerial
surveillance and interdiction. ``If you leave one weapon so
explicitly unused, you give yourself a handicap and make things
very easy for the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a 45-year-old former army
colonel who took office in February promising a social revolution,
has stated explicitly that he will not countenance what he regards
as a violation of his country's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuela is historically very zealous about everything
occurring on these two islands, because we consider that it affects
our national security,'' said Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose
Vicente Rangel in an interview. He added: ``We cannot accept that
planes leave from these bases,'' and said he ``absolutely ruled
out'' any possibility that Venezuela will change its position.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel noted that the Chavez government has cooperated with the
United States in other areas of the anti-drug war, including the
installation of three radar centers near Colombia or on drug routes
and has ``captured more drugs in five months than were seized all
of last year.''
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that Venezuela has the drug interdiction
situation well under control and thus does not need outside
interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have complied with our responsibilities without any need
for bases in Curacao and Aruba or overflights that we do not
consider to be convenient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey said that since the closing of Howard, ``there
have been seven criminal penetrations of Venezuelan airspace that
have had unsuccessful endgames because there is no endgame in
Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Some key members of the U.S. Congress are growing impatient with
the Venezuelan stance. They warn that if Chavez's position does not
change soon, the United States could retaliate by refusing to
certify that Venezuela is collaborating fully in the anti-drug war,
a step that would deprive it of trade and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Venezuela isn't cooperative, and the amount of trafficking
increases as a result of that, then it would certainly affect the
certification process,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.,
chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we are hard-pressed in our efforts, and until we are
able to establish some alternative facilities, which is going to
take quite a while, we will continue to have a major strategic
gap,'' Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration is eager to avoid such a
confrontation. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves outside the
Middle East and in recent years has become the United States'

<P>
   Despite the public rebuffs they have received, U.S. officials
remain hopeful that Chavez can be persuaded to change his mind.
Even before McCaffrey's visit, State Department and other
delegations sought to lay out the U.S. case to him, pointing out
that drug traffickers are regularly violating the sovereignty he
says he holds dear.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Chavez has been so focused on politics and the
economic situation that he frankly hasn't spent a lot of time up to
now on drug stuff,'' said a U.S. official who monitors the issue.
``Our goal is to help him and his administration get oriented as to
how we see the drug threat regionally and how it affects Venezuela
specifically, and use that as a basis to move forward on
cooperation.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Down and almost out of her 1999 French Open final against
Martina Hingis, the indomitable Steffi Graf narrowed her eyes,
squared her shoulders and stalked to her changeover chair. That
Saturday in early June, she gave herself a terse pep talk that
would, in a matter of minutes, reignite her powerful strokes and
reduce her top-ranked opponent to a sobbing runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last time you'll sit in this chair, so you better
make her earn it,'' Graf told herself about the Grand Slam event,
definitely her last in Paris and potentially her last ever.
</P>
<P>
   After making a career of ignoring whatever and whoever was
across the net, not out of arrogance but out of a conviction that
what mattered most was the purity of the strokes she produced with
her racquet, Graf had done it again: 29 years old, with an ache in
her back and a tug in her heart that told her there might be no
more Slam finals in her future.
</P>
<P>
   Graf steeled herself to win her 896th _ but in that moment her
most important _ match.
</P>
<P>
   That was the way she wanted to go out, as a winner, and just
after winning her seventh French Open, Graf calmly announced that
she'd never be back again: ``This is an incredible moment that I've
had; I just want to keep it the way it is.'' Keeping things close
to perfect on the tennis court had been a way of life since she
turned professional at 13; playing for the memories was something
she began to do this year in earnest because she suspected that,
for her, there would be no next year.
</P>
<P>
   Graf's perfectionist strivings and unreachable forehands carried
her to 107 singles titles as well as a virtual monopoly of the
number one ranking at the extended peak of her 17-year career, but
Friday from her home in Heidelberg, Germany, she announced her
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, she had said that her French Open and
Wimbledon campaigns would be her last. Friday, less than a month
before the U.S. Open, where she was still scheduled to compete, she
said that her nonpareil career was over, effective immediately.
With her decision, she joined a Hall of Fame roster of 1999
retirees that include Michael Jordan in basketball, John Elway in
football and Wayne Gretzky in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel the time is right to move on,'' said the
30-year-old Graf, only the fifth player and third woman beside
Maureen Connolly (1953) and Margaret Court (1970) to accomplish a
Grand Slam by winning the sport's four crown jewels, the Australian
Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open, in a calendar
year, in 1988. Later that year, she won the gold medal at the Seoul
Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   A partial list of Graf' other accomplishments are equally
remarkable:
</P>
<P>
   _ She is the only player, male or female, to win all four Grand
Slam events four times.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1987, she reached the final of every event she played,
which no other player has done since the Open era began in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   _ Her on-court earnings surpass $21 million, the most for any
female athlete in any sport.
</P>
<P>
   _ She assumed the No. 1 ranking for the first time on August 17,
1987, and her 186 consecutive weeks at the top remain unmatched by
any player, male or female. In all, Graf accumulated a record 377
weeks at No. 1 and finished more seasons at the top than any other
player: from 1987-1996, she ended the season ranked No. 1 eight
times in 10 years, another untouched record.
</P>
<P>
   But records and rankings meant little to Graf.
</P>
<P>
   She said Navratilova's record nine Wimbledon titles were safe
from her, and after collecting her 22nd slam crown in Paris this
June, she denied that the proximity to Court's record 24 would
serve as inspiration for prolonging her career.
</P>
<P>
   Graf's motivational forces were internal, not external. And she
never longed for the sort of rivalry shared by Navratilova and
Evert because her main opponent was always herself. Perfection was
her goal in every match, and her consistent pursuit of perfection
left her with a 902-115 win-loss record and a winning percentage of
.887, second only to Evert's .900.
</P>
<P>
   Graf later said her victory at Roland Garros against top-ranked
Martina Hingis, her only title this year and her first Grand Slam
title since she won the 1996 U.S. Open, was all the more special
because it happened unexpectedly. Sidelined by leg and back
problems this spring, Graf had entered the French Open merely to
gird herself for Wimbledon, her favorite tournament, and not to
eclipse the field and tie Evert's record of success there. Less
than a month later despite ``running on fumes,'' she reached the
Wimbledon final, only to lose to Lindsay Davenport, who by then was
the new No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Despite saying after Wimbledon and the French Open that she
would never play those tournament again, the German had been
characteristically secretive about her retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   The introverted Graf, wary of trying to combine actual
competition with the distracting hoopla of a farewell tour the way
her predecessors Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova had, preferred
to say that she had no plan to quit and would compete until she
stopped enjoying the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Graf, renowned for being a self-starter, notorious for her
marathon practice sessions and incessant off-court training
regimen, realized that she'd lost her resolve after losing in the
Wimbledon final and preparing for the summer hard court season in
advance of the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivation to perform at the highest level was no longer
there, and the fun had gone out of practicing and training,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She did not trace her retirement to the wear and tear of
cumulative injuries. Nor did she blame the hamstring pull that
provoked her to abandon what turned out to be the last match of her
career, a second-round loss against Amy Frazier last week in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Graf pinpointed the dissipation of what had been her
most reliable, and most feared, mental attribute: her unflagging
will to excel. In the end, said Graf, it wasn't her finely-honed
body but her finely-tuned motivation that began to fail her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt right after Paris and Wimbledon that the motivation
wasn't what it was in the past,'' said Graf. ``I thought long and
hard after Wimbledon about where I wanted to go and what I wanted
to do with my tennis, and for the first time in my career, I didn't
feel like going to a tournament.'' While her abdication was not
without tears, the 3rd-ranked Graf said she had no regrets about
the timing of her decision, which comes two weeks before the start
of the U.S. Open, a slam she's won five times: ``I've done
everything I wanted to do in tennis. I haven't had one second
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   What Graf had experienced lately, said her longtime coach, Heinz
Gunthardt, were second thoughts not about retiring but about
continuing to play: when Graf first mentioned retirement two years
ago during a lengthy recuperation from knee surgery, Gunthardt
cautioned her about leaving the game too soon. This year he didn't
dissuade her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt she had earned the privilege to quit anytime she likes;
after all, what was there that she hadn't already accomplished at
least once,'' Gunthardt said of the only player, male or female, to
win all four slams at least four times. ``The French was like a
fairy tale ending, and Wimbledon came close, but even during
Wimbledon she was running on empty a little bit; she didn't enjoy
it as much as she'd expected she would, and she was completely
empty afterward. Steffi was never one to play for records or
titles: she played for love of the game, and when you take that
away, what's there?''
</P>
<P>
   Initially coached by her father, Peter, whose skirmishes with
German tax authorities over his misrepresentation of her more than
$20 million in prize money eventually led to a jail term, Graf
broke into the game in 1982 at 13, the youngest player to turn
professional.
</P>
<P>
   By her own measure, she not an instant success: skinny and
lacking in strategy, it took the gangly teenager more than three
years to win the first of her 107 WTA titles. But the first, a 6-4,
7-5 defeat of Evert at Hilton Head in 1986, was a harbinger of
bigger upsets soon to come. Later that year, Graf ambushed the
top-ranked Navratilova in the Berlin final, and in 1987, Graf
captured her inaugural slam championship with a 6-4, 4-6, 8-6
decision against Navratilova at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Graf was, according to Evert and Navratilova, emblematic of a
new generation of power player: insulated by an entourage, largely
uninterested in the game's history, obsessed with excellence,
satisfied by nothing less than a championship.
</P>
<P>
   While Graf has been upstaged by a rash of teen-age newcomers
_Hingis, Venus and Serena Williams, and Anna Kournikova _who seem
to model their on-court hauteur after hers, her tunnel-vision quest
for the perfect match isn't likely to find replication in a new
generation of players for whom image looms almost as important as
results.
</P>
<P>
   And in Germany, a tennis-hungry nation stung also by the
official retirement of Boris Becker, the loss of Graf has
devastating implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without her, I'm not very optimistic about the future of
women's tennis in Germany,'' said Karl Weber, head of the German
Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
   But Phil de Picciotto, president of Graf's U.S. management firm,
Advantage International, specified that her future plans include
sponsorship of several German prospects and some consulting work
with the German Fed Cup team. Graf will also embark in December on
a six-month exhibition tour that opens in South Africa, a nation
she's never visited, but one where she's involved in charity work
with underprivileged children as well as the World Wildlife
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always so disciplined in her tennis that everything
else was a distanced priority,'' he said. ``I think she's relieved
and calm that she can finally explore some of the other sides of
her personality. Once she saw her motivation level diminish, but
still being a perfectionist, she knew it was time to make it
official and leave tennis.''

FOR STOCK TECHNICIANS, GLOOM AMID ALL THE CHEER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as stocks rose like a phoenix from their slump late last
summer and advanced to new highs this year, market technicians
looked at their charts and grumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Major averages are now off their peaks, but the technicians are
still edgy. In the charted world of new highs and new lows,
advance-decline lines _ which measure the number of stocks rising
in price against those that are losing value _ and 200-day moving
averages, these are not sunny days.
</P>
<P>
   Trends are important to the technicians, who are paid to follow
the movements of stocks and bonds, not companies or industries or
the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The trends just now are troubling them. Alan R. Shaw, director
of technical research at Salomon Smith Barney, took some time last
week to talk about those trends, and about why the Dow Jones
industrial average might still wind up at 20,000 in the next few
years despite his concerns. Here are excerpts from the
conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. To the uninitiated, technical analysis looks a lot like what
the folks who compile and massage baseball statistics do for a
living. Is that a fair comparison?
</P>
<P>
   A. We are navigators as well as scorekeepers. We try to read the
charts and maps and figure out the course we are covering as well
as see if the trend we are witnessing might be in the process of
reversing itself.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the charts telling you?
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the things we have learned is that if you go back
through history, if you see a divergence between the
advance-decline line and price averages, there has always been,
with some degree of time lag, a period when the averages give up.
</P>
<P>
   The advance-decline line is the army, and the average, the Dow
for example, is the general. If we start to witness a trend where
the army is in a phase of retreat, if it continues, history is
replete with evidence that the generals will follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the advance-decline line has had a lack of confirmation
with the market averages since April 1998. And in the last week or
so there have been a number of sessions when the number of stocks
falling in price was extraordinarily greater than those which rose
in price.
</P>
<P>
   This is not positive stuff. It is telling you the phase of
direction is in retreat. And you can also see this regression in
the ratio of stocks making new 52-week lows to those that are
hitting new highs. That is worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some analysts are arguing that interest rates have risen too
much, and that yields _ now well over 6 percent on the long bond _
will move lower from here. Do you agree?
</P>
<P>
   A. We went negative on bonds in early January and have remained
defensive since then, and we are worried about a further spike in
rates. I would not like to see bond yields move above 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptually, though, we still believe the long-term trend in
rates is down.
</P>
<P>
   And just as interest rates fell too much last fall because
investors sought safety in Treasuries, right now they are
overshooting on the upside.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You see the potential for an additional 15 percent to 20
percent correction in market averages from these levels. But you
are of the view that the market could go higher, much higher, after
that. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. Lots of things are at work.
</P>
<P>
   We think there is a likeness to 1957. We had a major shift in
market leadership around then, and we think that now there is a
shift from consumer goods to capital goods, with a primary emphasis
on technology. And there might be some evidence that the big bull
market that began in 1982 is possibly in its early stages of coming
to an end, with sequential toppings in sectors and groups.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market in the '50s and '60s started to top out in 1956
and 1957. But from 1957 to 1966 the Dow still doubled. But it did
so with a different leadership in which fewer and fewer stocks
participated. So we still think there is a chance the Dow could
reach 15,000 or 20,000 before this run ends.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sorts of stocks will get the market to those levels?
</P>
<P>
   A. We continue to believe that the only way the market will get
to 15,000 or more is if the technology sector continues to be the
leader.
</P>
<P>
   In technology, we like computer hardware companies like IBM,
Hewlett-Packard and Gateway, electrical equipment companies like
General Electric, Rockwell International and Solectron. We have
been very bullish on EMC, the leading computer peripheral company,
and on Intel and Texas Instruments, semiconductor companies.
</P>
<P>
   And we also like Tyco International, Minnesota Mining, Allied
Signal and Illinois Tool as diversified manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there groups you would avoid?
</P>
<P>
   A. In our view, many of the groups that were the leaders from
1982 to 1993, specifically food, tobacco and soft drinks, are in a
structural bear market.

   LOS ANGELES _ At age 76, Stan Lee is a popular guy. Fresh from
signing autographs last week for hordes of fans at Siggraph, the
country's premiere computer graphics show, the creator of
Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, X-Men and other modern superheroes
was trying to conduct an interview outside the Convention Center
here. But he kept getting sidetracked by well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to shake the hand of one of the greatest men of
this century,'' said Lance Powell, who works for the game company
Adrenalin Interactive Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why stop at this century?'' Lee asked, throwing up his arms in
mock frustration. ``I hate people like you!''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, whose grey-black hair and robust manner make him seem 10
years younger, is about to see how popular he is with Wall Street.
Stan Lee Media Inc., his first independent venture after more than
five decades with Marvel Enterprises, will begin trading Monday on
the NASDAQ market. Last week, the company completed its takeover of
Boulder Capital Opportunities Inc., a thinly traded company created
expressly to merge with another company. Monday, Boulder Capital's
ticker symbol, BCOI, will be replaced by SLEE.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Lee Media's mission: drive his millions of fans worldwide
to Stanlee.net, where he will introduce a new breed of Web-based
superheroes this fall. The company, based in Encino, Calif.,
intends to make money through licensing, electronic commerce,
advertising, sponsorship, Internet auctions, 3D movies, toys, TV
shows and anything else that Lee, his business partner, Peter Paul,
and their 42-person staff can dream up.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's name has already lured some heavy hitters. The
Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Mark Lasoff now works for
him; IBM, seeing a platform to promote its latest graphics
equipment, is outfitting his digital studio free, and Time Warner
Inc.'s Warner Bros. Online is promoting Lee's characters as part of
its 400,000-member Acme City online community, where fans can build
their own Warner Bros.-branded home pages free.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Warner Bros. Online will start offering 20 megabytes
of free Web space to anyone who registers at Acme City's Stan Lee
site.
</P>
<P>
   Lee did not need to convince Warner Bros. Online's president,
Jim Moloshok; as a kid he watched Lee's scary Spider-Man TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pleasure to work with the man who kept me up at
night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lee, ``I've never had more fun,'' he said, striding off
for a two-hour drive to a San Diego comics convention. ``I feel
like a kid again.''
</P>
<P>
   A kid with equity: Lee's 35 percent stake in Stan Lee Media is
worth nearly $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Paul, Lee and a small group of private investors
to skip an initial public offering _ through the merger with
Boulder Capital _ and leap right into the market was driven at
least partly by a desire to spare the aging icon grueling roadshows
and investor grilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be the best use of his energy,'' said Paul, a
lawyer who has brokered deals for celebrities like Salvador Dali
and Muhammad Ali. ``He's a creative guy, not a businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   That lesson was evident in Lee's last years at Marvel. Locked
into a lifetime contract as chairman that left him largely
powerless, Lee watched helplessly as overexpansion forced the
company to seek bankruptcy-law protection in 1996, and the
investors Ronald O. Perelman and Carl Icahn fought bitterly for
control. Today Marvel is controlled by Toy Biz, a consortium of
banks and an investment group.
</P>
<P>
   For Lee the ordeal proved a blessing. Eager to cut costs, the
new owners asked him to renegotiate his lifetime contract. Paul and
a New York lawyer, Arthur Lieberman, persuaded the group to name
Lee chairman emeritus of Marvel for a seven-figure salary, while
allowing him to spend most of his time at the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in my life, I can do things that belong to
me,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who met Lee 10 years ago while recruiting him to head a
nonprofit group, dreamed up Stan Lee Media while watching in
frustration as Marvel's button-down owners repeatedly bypassed Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took the century's most prolific storyteller and
character creator and relegated him to consultant status,'' Paul
said. ``They missed an opportunity to create greater franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee has churned out 28 new characters and 15 plot lines for the
company so far, enough to enable it to continue growing even if Lee
is no longer around.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to him excitedly discuss his first Internet project,
his absence is hard to imagine. ``It's about youthful beta testers
mystically transported over the Web to another dimension where an
evil warlord's super-villains are preparing to invade our
unsuspecting dimension through the Internet's enchanted Seventh
Portal,'' he explained. ``The frightening thought occurs to me:
what if this isn't fiction?''

HOW KOREAN PRIDE TRIPPED MICROSOFT AND SAVED A SOFTWARE MAKER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15)

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ As Microsoft Corp. expands its dominance of
the world's computer software markets, it has tried hard not to
ruffle the feathers of foreign governments and nationalists, who
often view the American software giant as a predator.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in maneuvering to gain control of the lucrative
market for Korean-language word processing software, it set off a
groundswell of opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have predicted that Koreans would have responded
the way they did to Microsoft,'' said D.H. Oh, managing director of
IDC Korea, a brokerage house here. ``It was probably the first time
that an entire nation, from the central government to corporations
to private citizens, combined forces to save a local industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale began a year ago, when South Korea's leading software
developer, the Hangul and Computer Co., was one step from
bankruptcy, a victim of poor management, Asia's financial crisis
and rampant software piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft agreed to inject $20 million into the Korean company.
In return, Hangul and Computer was to stop producing its own
popular word- processing software, which commanded 80 percent of
the word-processing market, and start selling Microsoft's
Korean-language Word, which then had less than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For a rather small investment, Microsoft seemed about to gain
control of South Korea's word-processing software industry, one of
the few markets in the world that the company did not dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was already by far the biggest player in the overall
Korean software market, which is estimated to be worth $5 billion
to $6 billion, but it played second fiddle to Hangul and Computer
in the word-processing sector.
</P>
<P>
   Once South Koreans _ well known for their nationalistic fervor _
got wind of the deal that would have extended Microsoft's
dominance, public outrage was so strong that Hangul and Computer
left Microsoft standing at the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company accepted a $10 million investment raised by
Korean computer-related businesses and associations that led a
nationwide campaign to save Hangul _ which many Koreans regarded as
a national technological treasure _ from foreign control.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign, the central government promised to
crack down on software piracy and began with its own computers,
many of which used unlicensed versions of Hangul and Computer's
software. Legitimate copies of the software _ named Hangul after
the Korean language _ were installed.
</P>
<P>
   Following that lead, thousands of guilt-stricken South Koreans
who were using pirated Hangul software either bought authorized
versions or donated money to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now, bolstered by a surge of government orders and a new
management team, Hangul and Computer has made a remarkable
turnaround. ``Our sales have climbed through the roof, we've
reduced our debt, we are attracting foreign investment and we are
developing new products,'' said Ha Jin Jhun, Hangul and Computer's
new president. ``You can say that we've fully recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   After reporting a net loss equivalent to $3.8 million for 1998,
the company projects that it will have net income of $4.9 million
this year. Revenues, which had tumbled to $11.7 million last year _
down nearly $7 million in two years _ are expected to reach $28.3
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since Hangul teetered on the verge of bankruptcy,
its market capitalization has grown fivefold, to $16.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jhun, who was brought in to restructure the company after it
backed out of the Microsoft deal, said his first order of business
was to refinance the company's debt and reduce its costs. He cut
the work force of several hundred by about 10 percent and shut down
unprofitable businesses, including publications, educational
programs and hardware distribution. He also slashed research and
development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Jhun then sought to capitalize on the national campaign to save
the company. The campaign encouraged Koreans _ both businesses and
individuals _ to destroy pirated copies of the software and buy
legitimate ones. (Last year, industry analysts estimated that 60
percent to 70 percent of all software programs in use in South
Korea were pirated.)
</P>
<P>
   To facilitate the purchases of legitimate copies, Jhun cut
prices, began selling the software in places as diverse as banks
and supermarkets and introduced a special edition that sold a
record 700,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to assure Hangul's long-term success, Jhun said, he
plans to turn the company into South Korea's ``largest and
foremost'' Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see our major revenue growth coming from the Internet,'' he
said, ``and we will soon introduce a one-stop-package service that
provides electronic commerce, cybertrading, e-mail, advertising,
and a virtual office all in one.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Do Haeng Heo, an analyst for Daewoo Securities, has issued a buy
recommendation for Hangul and Computer, which he predicts will post
a net profit of $9.25 million this year. He cited ``the
possibilities behind a take-off of the Internet business,'' which,
he said, is still in its formative stage in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, meanwhile, has continued its aggressive pursuit of
the South Korean software market, and its revenue has soared, too.
</P>
<P>
   Geun Kim, director of marketing for Microsoft Korea, said that
while South Korea is currently a marginal market for Microsoft in
dollar value, it has great potential because of the country's high
rate of personal computer use and high level of education.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Korea's revenues increased 110 percent last year, Kim
said, buoyed by rising orders from the public sector and individual
users. He expects revenues to reach $100 million this year, a 5
percent to 10 percent increase over last year. About 55 percent of
Microsoft Korea's total revenues come from software products like
Word and Office that compete directly with Hangul and Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft Korea and Hangul and Computer have been able to
register growth in revenue, analysts say, as the Korean software
piracy rate has fallen 10 percent in the last year, thanks in large
part to the campaign to save Hangul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this affair had a very positive impact on the
industry,'' Kim said. ``The industry and the public are better
served by having two healthy competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hangul and Computer's view is not so convivial. It has filed a
dumping charge against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft recently introduced a new version of its
Korean-language software _ one that offers many of the features
that have made Hangul's product so popular with South Koreans,
including a graphics function that allows users to incorporate
boxes, tables and graphs within the text.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the new version of Word can express the Korean alphabet in
more than 11,000 combinations, including those needed to represent
archaic words and expressions. Microsoft's previous version was
limited to a few thousand combinations and was viewed by many
Koreans, especially academics, as insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's new program has been selling well, especially since
the company slashed prices last month to match those of Hangul and
Computer. Microsoft says that it is offering discounts to schools
in an effort to capture young computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Those discounts led Hangul and Computer to file the dumping
charge against Microsoft with the South Korean Fair Trade
Commission, accusing the American company of selling its
educational software package at a steep discount to gain market
share in South Korea. The trade commission says that an
investigation of Hangul's complaint is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said that under a program started in July, schools can
buy any piece of its software for an up-front payment of 10 percent
of the normal end-user price, calculated on an annual license-fee
basis. Hangul had pioneered the use of such yearly license fee
arrangements in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``To pay $20 million to buy an entire software market is not
only cheap; it's unfair and it's wrong,'' Jhun said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is not content with just killing off local software
companies,'' he added. ``It wants to wipe out an entire industry,
and Koreans did not stand for that.''

REYNOLDS METALS, SOUGHT BY ALCOA, NOW HAS ANOTHER SUITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reynolds Metals Co. is now officially in play.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Alcoa Inc., the world's largest aluminum
producer, offered to buy Reynolds in a half-cash, half-stock deal
valued at $5.8 billion, another bidder emerged Friday with a
higher, all-cash offer. McCook Metals, a metals company owned by
the Chicago investment firm Michigan Avenue Partners, delivered a
letter to Reynolds management Friday, saying it wanted to buy the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Alcoa deal is anti-competitive and bad for the industry,
but we know that we can make Reynolds profitable again,'' said
Michigan Avenue chairman Michael Lynch. ``Ours was a friendly
bearhug letter, because we're one of the white knights out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter did not specify a price, but did say that McCook
would pay more than Alcoa. Analysts and investment bankers say they
think the offer is somewhere between $67.50 a share and $72 a
share. Alcoa's offer came to $65 a share.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Reynolds shares had already surpassed Alcoa's offer,
closing at $69.375, up $3. Shares of Alcoa fell $1.25 Friday, to
$66.50.
</P>
<P>
   How McCook will finance a Reynolds deal remains unclear. A spate
of wire service stories Friday said that the company was backed by
GE Capital Corp. and Bear Stearns. One even suggested that General
Electric Co. chairman John Welch was supporting the deal himself.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital has been involved in financing some small McCook
purchases in the past, but insists it has no part in the current
offer. ``We are not backing them for this bid,'' said Mary Horn, a
GE Capital spokeswoman. Bear Stearns also has not put up funds.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch would not divulge his funding sources. But he insisted
that ``We are a well received player in the aluminum business, Bear
Stearns is our adviser, and we have the financial capability to do
this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The new offer comes after widespread speculation that Pechiney
of France, the Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland and Alcan
Aluminium of Canada, the three big aluminum companies involved in
their own three-way merger, will come in with their own bid, either
as a group or separately. People familiar with those talks say that
the companies had felt no rush to make a counteroffer to Alcoa,
because they believed that an Alcoa-Reynolds hookup would be
scuttled by American regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that a deal between Reynolds and McCook, which
is small and has few products that overlap with Reynolds, would be
unlikely to trigger antitrust problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focused on the merger that we've announced, and we have
no plans for Reynolds right now,'' said Daniel Gagnier, vice
president for corporate affairs at Alcan, which will be the
surviving entity in the three-way merger. ``But anything's possible
and the situation is fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reynolds board is scheduled to meet Sunday to discuss the
Alcoa deal, and Louanne Nabhan, a Reynolds spokeswoman, said the
company would not comment on ``this new information that is
circulating in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa issued a statement saying, ``We are the only ones who have
a bona fide offer on the table for Reynolds to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reynolds shareholders, who have been pressuring Reynolds to
seek a buyer for some time, are now demanding that the board form a
committee, hire advisers and auction the company off. ``They've got
to open it up for a bidding war,'' said Edgar Wachenheim, chairman
of Greenhaven Associates Inc., an investment management firm in
Purchase, N.Y., that owns about 1.5 million Reynolds shares.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds shareholders have been furious ever since Reynolds
rejected a $60 a share offer from Alcoa in March; Alcoa's stock has
run up so nicely since then that by now, that deal's value would
have been close to $96 a share.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen of the largest Reynolds shareholders met in
New York last month to discuss their dissatisfaction with Reynolds'
apparent unwillingness to consider a sale. Yet investors say that
as recently as last week Jeremiah J. Sheehan, the chairman of
Reynolds, was telling them that he was not actively seeking to sell
the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry said, `If someone wants us, they can pick up the phone
and call,''' said Richard Grubman, an investor at Highfields
Capital Management, which owns 6.5 percent of Reynolds shares. ``We
said, `you've got to solicit the highest bid.''
</P>
<P>
   The board may not have the option of refusing. Reynolds' bylaws
say that its directors can be replaced at any time. Disgruntled
shareholders have implied that they would propose their own slate
of directors if the board does not solicit bids.
</P>
<P>
   Both Grubman and Wachenheim say they think Reynold's assets are
worth $95 a share, and that the company would be a bargain at $75.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Reynolds has gone through a major restructuring in the
last few years. It has sold its lackluster fabrication and canned
sheet plants. But it retained its lucrative packaging division,
which includes such well-known names as Reynolds Wrap, and its
aluminum smelting operations. Although Reynolds is a high-cost
producer in the United States, about 53 percent of its smelting is
in Canada, where costs are routinely lower than here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a much better-positioned company than Wall Street
or the press give its credit for,'' Wachenheim said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Reynolds had talked about spinning off its
packaging operations, which are highly profitable, to shareholders.
Wachenheim believes that if it had done so, the packaging company's
stock would be selling at $30, Reynolds itself would be selling at
$40, and by law, it would have protection against a takeover for
two years. ``It was probably a strategic mistake on their part,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Alcoa said it would sooner walk away from the
deal than pay even $70 a share. ``People who talk about Reynolds
being worth $95 are forgetting about taxes, about debt, about
operating profits that are only about $500 million a year,'' said
one person close to Alcoa's talks with Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Although the McCook bid came out of left field, many industry
specialists say it was a logical one. McCook's nucleus is a
fabricating plant in McCook, Ill., that Michigan Avenue Partners
bought from Reynolds in 1997. A few months ago it acquired an
aluminum rolling mill in Scottsboro, Ala., from Noranda, a Canadian
aluminum company. And, although it lost out in the bidding, it
tried to buy some smelting operations from the Columbia Falls
Aluminum Co. in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch is fast garnering a reputation among industry experts as a
hands-on manager who can wring costs out of money-losing
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no fly by night operation,'' said Lloyd T. O'Carroll,
a metals analyst at the brokerage firm Scott &AMP; Stringfellow. ``Mike
Lynch is building a real metals company by buying underperforming
assets and turning them around.''

MATSU ISLAND MAY BE FLASHPOINT IN CHINA-TAIWAN CONFLICT

<TEXT>
<P>
   MATSU, Taiwan _ If military conflict breaks out between China
and Taiwan any time soon, military experts say, it is as likely to
begin on this little island as anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A mere three miles off the coast of southeast China, Matsu still
belongs to Taiwan, which is more than 100 miles away. By its
location alone, Matsu is highly vulnerable to attack from the
Chinese army, and is guarded by a slim force of about 6,000 Taiwan
soldiers, roughly the same number of civilians who live here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet life is calm on Matsu, and there are few signs here that
military action is imminent. Beijing and Taipei may be engaged in a
rich shadow play, bickering over the terminology of sovereignty as
each side boasts about its military might. Ordinary people on Matsu
are going about their lives as they have for years.
</P>
<P>
   At the crest of a hill on one side of the island, the Wang
family store sells a variety of simple fare, virtually all of it
brought over from China despite an official ban on trading with the
mainland. Several members of an extended family spend the afternoon
sitting outside in the warm breeze, and talk flows easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why Lee Teng-hui is stirring things up again,''
Wang Chong-yu, the family patriarch, who has lived here since his
family came over in 1949, said, referring to Taiwan's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics,'' his son, Wang Chi-fan, 32, cut in.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, the son, said that when tensions flared in July, after Lee
asserted that Taiwan would deal with China in ``special
state-to-state relations'' rather than as two parts of the same
country, many traders in Matsu feared that the Taiwan authorities
might crack down on the heavy smuggling trade with China,
technically illegal but long permitted. But nothing has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem to be taking things too seriously,'' young
Wang said. ``Why should we?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to this,'' his father added. ``When there is always
danger, you don't feel the danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsu is, as a favorite Chinese phrase puts it, a ``problem left
over from history,'' one of many that abound in the bizarre and
potentially explosive conflict between Taiwan and China since
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces, defeated by Mao Tse-tung's
Communists, retreated to Taiwan in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Matsu and another set of islands called Kinmen, formerly known
as Quemoy, were the site of serious battles between the Communist
and Nationalist armies in 1949 and again in 1958. In an odd truce
that was negotiated in 1958, Taiwan and China agreed that military
forces on Matsu and mainland China would shell each other on
opposite days of the week, so that each could keep up the pretense
of fighting, albeit in a pretty nonserious way.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, China would fire at Matsu. On
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, Matsu would fire at China. On
Sunday, both sides would rest. That went on for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty silly,'' said Tsai Cheng-li, a 55-year-old
resident of Matsu. ``But you never knew when one would land on you.
A lot of people were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, residents of Matsu use old shell casings to drink beer,
toasting their brothers and sisters on the mainland, an act tinged
with irony.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, people on Matsu do indeed feel closer to mainland
Chinese than they do to their Taiwan compatriots, since they have
more contact with the mainland. As restrictions on boat traffic
between Matsu and Fujian province in China relaxed in recent years,
it became far easier to take a three-mile hop in a fishing boat
than a 100-mile journey by plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``If trouble breaks out, we'll go that way, not back to
Taiwan,'' Chen Siu-chen, a taxi dispatcher, said, pointing west
toward China.
</P>
<P>
   She laughed at the thought, as if it seemed pretty
inconceivable, after 50 years of threats and no action. Pressed,
she said she was being honest. If the Chinese army actually
attacked Matsu, she said, the quickest route out of harm's way
would be to get on a fishing boat and head for China's coast.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the recent tension, tourists still fly to Matsu every
day from Taipei, to peer across the slim stretch of water that
separates Matsu from the mainland. There are five flights a day,
and during the summer they are booked solid on weekends, even
though planes have to fly into mainland airspace to get here. There
are even more flights to Kinmen _ 16 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Ting, a research fellow at Taiwan's University of
Politics who specializes in military affairs, said China could well
choose to attack the relatively easy targets of Kinmen or Matsu.
But if it did so, he said, it would face the possibility of a huge
retaliatory strike of Taiwan missiles aimed at mainland cities.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has clear air superiority over China, Ting said, making
any amphibious assault on Taiwan difficult because China would lack
sufficient air cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan could cause a lot of damage to the mainland,'' Ting
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Matsu, most civilians seem to shrug off the possibility that
their home will be the site of military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be war,'' Ms. Chen said with a dismissive laugh.
``There's no point in war.''

PUTTER LETS GARCIA DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, ILL. _ If driving were all there was to golf, Sergio
Garcia would have had a great score.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize my long game was almost perfect,'' he
said. ``The way I was hitting the ball off the tee, I felt I was
going to have another good round. I thought 70, 69, something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but golf encompasses so much more. Spain's precocious golf
celebrity converted but one of seven legitimate birdie
opportunities. No 70. No 69. And surely no duplication of
Thursday's opening-round score of 66. Sergio Garcia shot a more
mundane 1-over-par 73. He's no longer the leader of the 1999 PGA
Championship. He's merely among 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``The putter did not work very good today,'' he said with a
sigh. ``I know you're going to have one of these rounds in every
tournament. I hope this will be the worst one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, so sage, so prescient, so casually knowledgeable and so
supremely confident. But why should we be surprised? He is, after
all, 19.
</P>
<P>
   Or is he?
</P>
<P>
   ``At 19 years old, I see far more composure with these players
and more experience,'' said playing partner Hale Irwin, 35 years
Garcia's senior. ``Sergio, for instance, played so many tournamnts
around the world. And he's won how many of those amateur events? If
I played in two or three tournaments a summer, I felt lucky between
working on a construction job for eight hours a day and playing
some golf at a daily fee course.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergio doesn't know from construction jobs. A son of a golf pro,
he is nothing less than the Spanish Tiger. He started playing at 3.
He was club champion at 12. He made his European Tour debut at 15.
He had a 32-1 record in match play as an amateur. He turned pro
earlier this year and he's already got a European Tour victory (the
Murphy's Irish Open). He also had that surreal British Open
experience (an 89-83 weekend), which, being 19, he has easily
erased from his memory bank.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday he set a competitive Medinah Country Club record
(since eclipsed by Skip Kendall) with a sizzling 66. That gave him
a two-shot lead. Asked if having a two-shot lead so soon in the
tournament were perhaps a bit daunting, he said, ``I think there's
nothing better than that. And if (Saturday) I can be four (up), I
can tell you that I'm not going to feel any pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pressure that got him Friday. As he correctly stated,
it was his putter, which was, plain and simple, a naughty little
(itals)nino.(unitals) Sergio routinely boomed drives 300-plus
yards, and most of them landed in the fairway. He routinely hit
crisp iron shots to the green. But given six legit (i.e. 15-feet or
less) birdie opportunities in the first 12 holes (and one more on
18), he nailed just one putt. It was one of those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I played pretty solid,'' he said. ``Better than
Friday. The putter just didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergio is listed at 5 feet 11 inches and 160 pounds, but he
really doesn't seem that tall and he could pass for 17, easy. You
can kind of figure out where Tiger's strength comes from, but how
this kid sends 'em out there three football fields long is a
definite puzzler. But he does.
</P>
<P>
   He went out for his second round of PGA play early in the
morning (8:19 CDT). He wore black slacks, a brown shirt, a black
Titleist baseball cap, and white shoes. He was neither chatty nor
distant.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly acknowledged the gallery, which would grow very
large by the 10th hole and remain big thereafter, with a tip of the
cap and a smile. He broke into a huge grin when someone shouted
``El Nino!'' on the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   He does not dawdle, either at the tee or out on the fairway. He
sizes up putts from every conceivable angle, but he makes his looks
brief, and when he gets over the ball he is just about ready to
hit.
</P>
<P>
   He has a reasonably calm demeanor, but he is no robot. He hung
his head after missing a 10-foot birdie putt on the fifth. He found
it necessary to ask for quiet before missing a 10-footer on the
seventh. He knew he had mis-hit a putt on the 11th, chasing after
the ball while waving his putter. He swung his club in anger when
his bunker (fourth) shot on the 583-yard par-5 14th wasn't close
enough to the pin for his liking (he had pushed a 3-wood into the
trees on his second shot).
</P>
<P>
   He was not self-absorbed. He twice applauded superb shots by
Irwin, for example, and he completely surprised Phil Mickelson, his
other playing partrner, on another occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed with him, both as a player and as an
individual,'' said the noted southpaw. ``He came up to me on No.
10, after I had gone 4 over on the first nine. He said, `Do you
mind if I say something?' I said, `Please do.' He said, `Let's have
a great back side.' I thought that was class.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was impressed that Irwin, who put himself into
contention with a 3-under 69, could hit the ball as well as he does
at age 54, but ``I certainly didn't think he played any better than
me.'' He is confident, bordering on arrogance. When someone asked
him if Irwin could teach him anything about Medinah, he replied,
``Learn? I don't know. I think I know how to play the golf course,
and I think I'm doing fine the way I'm playing the golf course. If
I putted well, it could be another great round, but it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He's good. He knows it. And so does everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talent in that young man,'' said Irwin, who
took off his own cap and waved it in El Nino's direction as they
approached the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   He's 19. Check back in 40 years. He'll probably be shooting his
age.

INTERNET STOCKS' RECORD? DEPENDS ON THE INDEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The (star) word should be replaced with the symbol)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15)  
(ART ADV: Graphic of components of the Dow Jones Internet index is

<P>
   Wonder how Internet stocks have been doing? It is not
necessarily easy to tell. Depending on which of a half-dozen
popular Internet stock indexes an investor looks at, shares of
companies in the wired world are up anywhere from 15 percent to 29
percent since the beginning of the year, and down anywhere from 23
percent to 41 percent from their highs of last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancies say more about the construction of indexes
than about the relative performance of the dot-com stocks. But in
the slump that has infected Internet stocks over the last three
months, a pattern has emerged: companies that sell products on line
have fallen from grace far more quickly than those that sell, well,
more esoteric things.
</P>
<P>
   To distinguish between the categories, look at the two
components of the Dow Jones Internet index, which has gained 32
percent this year. Dow Jones breaks down Internet stocks into two
categories: Internet commerce and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   The first category includes companies that sell goods or
services over the Web, like E(star)Trade Group, while the second
includes those that provide Internet access or services to those
using the Web, like America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet services segment is up 48 percent since the
beginning of the year, while the commerce segment is up just 6.5
percent over the same span.
</P>
<P>
   In January, as Internet stocks took off, the commerce stocks
soared highest, spurred by the holiday season success of retailers
like Amazon.com. More recently, they have been felled by the
collapse of the stocks of retailers like Egghead.com.
</P>
<P>
   The two industry segments have noticeably diverged since
mid-June, with service stocks rising 15 percent even as commerce
stocks have fallen 10 percent. In that time, technical problems
with its auction site put eBay's shares into a tailspin, while
stocks of online brokerage firms began suffering from fears of
slowing growth _ caused in part, by the slide in Internet stocks.

REVISED RULES ON GAYS IN MILITARY DISPLEASE GAY RIGHTS ADVOCATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon on Friday announced its first major
revision of guidelines for its ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on
homosexuals in the military, including a new requirement that
commanders seek approval from senior civilian officials at the
Pentagon before opening certain types of investigations of troops
who admit that they are gay.
</P>
<P>
   The revised guidelines failed to satisfy gay rights advocates,
who say that the new directives do not go far enough and that
pervasive hostility toward homosexuals in uniform continues to
result in violent harassment. They pointed to last month's brutal
murder of an Army private in Kentucky as evidence of the entrenched
hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, the Pentagon ordered that commanders
institute anti-harassment training at all levels of the military,
beginning with basic training, and that low-level military lawyers
consult with senior lawyers before opening an investigation of
anyone suspected of being gay.
</P>
<P>
   The new directives also require that commanders seek approval
from the military secretary they serve _ the Army secretary, in the
case of an Army commander _ before opening an investigation in the
dozen or so cases a year when ``a service member made a statement
regarding his or her homosexuality for the purpose of seeking
separation'' from the service.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement appears to have been designed to answer
criticism from gay rights advocates that the military has conducted
intrusive investigations into the sex lives of troops who admit
their homosexuality and are preparing to leave the service.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations, the advocates charge, are an effort to find
damaging information that can be used to force troops to pay back
military scholarships and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made it clear there is no room for harassment or threats
in the military,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said in issuing
the directives, which the Pentagon described as an attempt to spell
out the policy more clearly to avoid abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've instructed the military services to make sure that the
policy is clearly understood and fairly enforced,'' he said. ``The
department is determined to implement the homosexual conduct policy
with fairness to all concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   While the five-year-old ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy was
designed by the Clinton administration to make it easier for
homosexuals to serve in uniform, gay rights advocates contend that
the instances of anti-gay harassment in the military have actually
increased.
</P>
<P>
   And the numbers of gay and lesbian soldiers facing discharge
from the service has grown dramatically under the policy. Last
year, 1,145 people were discharged from the armed services for
homosexuality, compared to 997 in 1997 and 617 in 1994, the year
the policy took effect.
</P>
<P>
   The military continues to bar openly gay people from serving in
uniform. Under the policy, homosexuals can serve in the armed
forces as long as they do not discuss their sexual orientation, and
commanders are barred from asking troops whether they are gay.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines also remind commanders that they cannot open
investigations of the sexual orientation of troops without credible
information, that they must promptly investigate when troops
complain that they are being taunted because of the perception or
allegation that they are gay, and that those troops cannot be the
subject of retaliation for filing complaints.
</P>
<P>
   They also, for the first time, give a specific order to internal
investigators within each of the branches of the military _ the
inspectors general _ to review whether commanders and military
lawyers are carrying out the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy
properly.
</P>
<P>
   The new directives were the subject of heated last-minute
negotiations Friday between the Pentagon and the Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network, a prominent Washington group that represents
soldiers who are prosecuted over their perceived sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Network has considerable clout within the White
House, especially within the staff of Vice President Al Gore, who
is heavily courting the gay community in his campaign for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon's new guidelines seek to insure fairness, leave
no room for harassment and insure the law is better understood,''
said Alejandro Cabrera, a Gore spokesman. ``The vice president has
said that he believes the current policy should be implemented with
more compassion. He supports every effort to that end.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Benecke, a retired Army captain who is co-director of
the organization, said that while the group was pleased with the
wording of Cohen's statement and with some elements of the
directives, the new guidelines would leave many members of the
military vulnerable to harassment and violence. ``This is not a new
day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the guidelines, which have been delayed for months, did
not provide the sort of detailed direction to commanders that might
prevent the sorts of abuse that appear to have led to last month's
death of a soldier at Fort Campbell, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier, Pfc. Barry Winchell, was allegedly beaten with a
baseball bat by a member of his unit after his homosexuality became
known on the base, one of the nation's largest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We've pressed Secretary Cohen for two years now to tell
commanders the investigative limits and how to properly implement
these policies, and there's nothing in the package today that does
that,'' Ms. Bennecke said. ``What's here is inadequate to address
the magnitude of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon's senior spokesman, said that as a
result of Friday's negotiations with the Defense Network, there had
been changes in the wording of one of the new guidelines issued
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the guidelines had called called for low-level
military lawyers to consult with ``the general court-martial
convening authority'' _ a military term referring to senior lawyers
in the military criminal justice system _ before opening an
investigation of a service member's sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Those words were replaced with ``senior legal officers at higher
headquarters,'' which Bacon said was an effort to remove any
implication that the investigations were being handled as criminal
proceedings. ``We did not mean to leave that impression so we
changed it,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest
gay rights group, said that while the Pentagon's new guidelines
were ``welcome, in and of themselves they are not going to solve
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's going to take is a commitment from uniformed
leadership through the armed services stating unambiguously and
clearly that anti-gay harassment will not be tolerated under any
circumstances,'' he said. ``It's shameful that it has taken a
tragedy such as Private Winchell's death to wake up the leadership
to this problem.''

HOW NABISCO'S NEW COOKIE CRUMBLES 
</HEADLINE>

holdings stocks is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15)  
 (af)  
 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, kids argue about the best way to eat an Oreo cookie. But
since the breakup in June of the old RJR Nabisco into separately
traded food and tobacco companies, investors have been wondering
about the best way to own the stock of the company that makes the
cookies, along with Ritz crackers and other snack foods.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization has resulted in three publicly traded stocks.
The tobacco business, whose brands include Winston and Camel, was
spun out as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings. It now has nothing to
do with food, and could face billions of dollars in liabilities if
it ever has to pay damages to individual smokers or the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why the food business seems to be attracting
the lion's share of attention these days. Analysts also say the
business has sharply improving fundamentals. So for investors, the
question is which of the two stocks that track the cookie maker
represents the better bet.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company is Nabisco Group Holdings, which trades under
the ticker symbol NGH. Its only asset, now that the tobacco
business has been spun off, is 80.6 percent of Nabisco Holdings,
the operating company, whose stock trades under the ticker symbol
NA. (The remaining 19.4 percent has been publicly owned since early
1995.)
</P>
<P>
   Craig Albert of Sanford C. Bernstein favors the operating
company. At $39 a share, it is trading at just 17 times his
estimate of per-share cash earnings _ net income plus goodwill
amortization _ for 2000. That is about 10 percent cheaper than the
shares of its rivals, which include Kellogg and Keebler Foods.
</P>
<P>
   The riskier _ though potentially more lucrative _ tactic, some
other analysts say, is to buy shares of the parent company. At
$18.125, Nabisco Group shares trade at what analysts calculate as a
29 percent discount to the value of its investment in the operating
company. If it were trading at 100 percent of that value, the price
would be over $25, they note.
</P>
<P>
   The parent's stock yields 2.7 percent, versus 1.9 percent for
the operating company. And because the parent company's stock is
part of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, the shares are more
easily traded and therefore attractive to institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   The catch with the parent company's shares is that they carry a
potentially huge tobacco liability. While all the big states have
reached settlements with tobacco companies to recoup the cost of
treating smoking-related illnesses, the federal government or
individuals could still win big settlements or judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the discount that Nabisco Group shares trade at
relative to the operating company shares is a measure of the
market's fear that Nabisco Group could be liable for claims lodged
against the spun-off R.J. Reynolds, if the tobacco company cannot
meet its obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like Nabisco's food business, you should own it through
NA,'' the operating company, Albert said. ``The only reason to buy
NGH is if you believe the tobacco liability is mispriced,'' he said
of the parent.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts think it is. Nomi Ghez, a food analyst with
Goldman, Sachs, says the current discount on the parent company's
shares is far too high, especially since R.J. Reynolds has agreed
to indemnify its former parent against any claims that might arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way plaintiffs in smoking lawsuits could sue the
holding company is if the tobacco company goes bankrupt,'' Ms. Ghez
said, a risk she and others think is increasingly remote.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Cohen, a tobacco analyst at Goldman, Sachs, added, ``The
bankruptcy risk is considerably less than one in five based on our
evaluation of the legal challenges the industry faces and the
financial capabilities of industry participants to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Feldman, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, says that
the parent's discount has fluctuated from 18 percent to 34 percent,
mainly in response to tobacco litigation news. Such sensitivity can
wreak short-term havoc on its stock price, Feldman said, but he
added that he thought tobacco worries would recede over the next 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman expects the parent company's shares to rise 27 percent,
to $23, in 12 months, based on a 20.5 percent rise in the price of
the operating company's shares, to $47. That would shrink the
discount from the current 29 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some institutional investors are also tempted by the valuation
gap.
</P>
<P>
   David N. Dreman, head of Dreman Value Management in Jersey City,
thinks the parent company is attractive. ``The enormous spread
doesn't make a lot of sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Robinson, an analyst with Eaton Vance Management, a mutual
fund company in Boston that holds shares of both the parent and the
operating company stocks, also thinks liability fears are
overblown. R.J. Reynolds' ``huge cash flow cushion,'' he said,
strengthens its ability to withstand legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   And R.J. Reynolds has benefited from improved efforts by the old
RJR Nabisco to shore up its finances. A month before the breakup,
RJR Nabisco sold its foreign tobacco operations to Japan Tobacco
for $8 billion, and used the proceeds to slash its debt load, a
legacy of the $25 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are sanguine about the fundamentals of the food
business. They credit James M. Kilts, chief executive of the
operating company since January 1998, with the turnaround in its
business. After years of starving the flagship brands, Nabisco
began increasing its marketing expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nabisco's biscuit business responded immediately to the
increased spending,'' Albert said. The company has sold more
crackers and cookies year-to-year every quarter since the marketing
push began, after having lost market share for 14 consecutive
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ghez expects the operating company to earn $1.30 a share in
1999, up from $1.21 in 1998, reflecting double-digit growth in the
second-half of 1999.

ALLIES SHIFT AND NUMBERS TEASE AS GREENSPAN CHARTS A COURSE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After George Bush lost the presidency to Bill
Clinton in 1992, some Republicans blamed one of their own: Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan had first become involved in Republican politics
during Richard M. Nixon's 1968 campaign, and he had been a fixture
among the party's economic policy makers ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He had been appointed Fed chairman by Ronald Reagan and
reappointed by Bush. But in the eyes of Bush's supporters,
Greenspan had committed an unforgivable sin: failing to bring the
economy back to full strength quickly enough after the 1990-91
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton exploited the lingering economic angst masterfully in
1992, and ever since he has ridden an upturn that in hindsight was
well under way by Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is to suggest that Greenspan is by no means
unfamiliar with the rough and tumble of election year politics, or
with the many ways in which the Fed can become an issue. And it is
already clear, nearly 15 months before Election Day, that Greenspan
will figure into this political cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The first salvos against him have again come not from Democrats
but from Republicans. In Iowa, where the Republicans battling to
stay in the race against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for the
party's presidential nomination have become increasingly desperate
for attention, both Steve Forbes and Dan Quayle have attacked the
Fed and Greenspan for raising interest rates when crop prices are
plunging and farmers are hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates are too high, and while Alan Greenspan and the
Federal Reserve raise rates, commodity prices have plummeted,''
Forbes says in a 60-second radio spot being run in Iowa. Forbes
goes on to blame monetary policy together with ``bad economic
advice from the Clinton-Gore administration'' for the troubles
plaguing agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Populist rage from the farm belt at tight-money bankers is
hardly new; what is a bit confounding is that the present attacks
are coming from the conservative wing of the Republican Party,
Greenspan's ideological home.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Greenspan is an easy target for politicians of all
stripes because he never hits back, at least not publicly. Perhaps
more to the point in this case, some Republicans view Greenspan as
having sold out and become all but a member of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   They have watched with some unease over the past six and a half
years as Greenspan became chummy first with former Treasury
Secretary Robert E. Rubin and now with his successor, Lawrence H.
Summers, as well as with Clinton himself. And the party's more
ardent tax cutters were dismayed, if not aghast, when Greenspan
told Congress last month that the nation would be better off using
projected federal budget surpluses for debt reduction than for
reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton has framed the fiscal policy choice just that way
_ his prudent debt reduction plan versus irresponsible Republican
tax cuts _ Greenspan was seen as siding with the Democrats. No one
paid much attention to the Fed chairman's stated preference for tax
cuts over additional government spending, which in the eyes of most
Republicans in Washington is the real choice before the country.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress and the White House fail to work out a deal in the
next few months on splitting up the surplus, leaving the issue to
be fought out on the campaign trail, Greenspan's name will no doubt
be invoked repeatedly by both parties to bolster their positions.
</P>
<P>
   While fiscal policy can make for powerful politics, it is just a
sideline for Greenspan. The far more compelling issue for him could
be how high to push interest rates over the next 6 or 12 months if
the economy continues to roar along, setting off inflation alarm
bells.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, it will be a tough call; Greenspan would no doubt
prefer to avoid raising rates during a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, it could prove even trickier, since Greenspan is
still wrestling with the degree to which this technology-driven,
financial-market-centric, globally oriented economy can hold off
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a dozen years' experience on the job and a tough skin,
the Fed chairman has something else going for him. If there were a
Bush family grudge against him, it has been put aside, and Governor
Bush has sent clear signals that he would support Greenspan's
reappointment next year to a fourth four-year term. Vice President
Al Gore has been equally supportive.
</P>
<P>
   With that bipartisan support, Greenspan has considerable leeway
in formulating policy, as well as an opportunity to push ahead with
his slow but steady efforts to make the Fed more open in the way it
considers and communicates its interest-rate decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, demystifying the institution and making clear that
the rapidly changing economy is sometimes as difficult to read from
within the Fed as from without could prove the best insulation
against political attacks.

RED SOX GOT A REAL DEAL IN DAUBACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's baseball's deal of the year: Brian Daubach for Mo Money.
When Mo Vaughn said no to the Red Sox' five-year, $65 million offer
last fall, the masses of Nitwit Nation were on the march. How could
the team survive without Mo? Without his big bat? His (ahem)
leadership? His fan appeal? No one, they said _ through their
number one media outlet, WEEI, the home of Nitwit Radio _ could
replace Mighty Mo, let alone some unknown journeyman named Brian
Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the season is two-thirds over, and it's time to take a
look at the numbers and see how the multimillion-dollar man, Mo
Money, is doing compared to the $215,000 man, Brian Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of the tape going into Friday night's games:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(! used as column separator) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AB ! R ! H ! HR ! RBI ! Avg. &QL; 
Vaughn 338 ! 34 ! 92 ! 18 ! 64 ! .272 &QL; 
Daubach 266 ! 49 ! 86 ! 17 ! 53 ! .323 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think Bill Bavasi, the general manager of the Angels, would like
to have this signing back? Over the length of the six-year
contract, Bavasi gave Mo $80 million, including a $13 million
signing bonus, so Mo, with a $5 million salary this season, is on
the books for $18 million this year. Mo's entire contract is
guaranteed, so as poorly as he has been performing, if the Angels
wanted to send him to the minors, he would still have to be paid in
full. Conversely, Daubach, who did not get a signing bonus, has a
salary of $215,000 for this year, and if he is sent down to
Pawtucket, he gets paid at the rate of $42,000.
</P>
<P>
   To this humble scribe, the Angels are getting exactly what they
deserved. As soon as things started to go bad in Anaheim, Mo turned
on Bavasi just like he did Sox management. Mo has no qualms when it
comes to biting the hand that feeds him, no matter how much food it
puts on his plate. This is not to say Daubach is a better hitter
than Mo. What it does say is that when a team invests that kind of
money in a player, it should know for sure what it is getting. With
Mo, you never know.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Here's the Celtics' mindset regarding Antoine Walker as training
camp nears: They feel he doesn't want to play in Boston, but as of
now there isn't any team out there that will give them anything of
substance for him. So the Celtics/Rick Pitino are going to tell
Walker to play his heart out this season, get the team to the
playoffs, and prove to the rest of the league how great he is; then
the team should be able to trade him and get something decent in
return. In other words, Walker will be given a chance to work his
way out of town. Sounds fair to me . . . Want some good season
tickets to the Patriots, Red Sox, or Celtics? The US Bankruptcy
Court in Boston will provide an unusual opportunity to some
well-heeled fan to ``win'' the rights to season tickets for each
team. A businessman who is a longtime supporter of all three teams
had to file for personal bankruptcy under Chapter 11. The court has
decided his creditors would be best served by an auction of the
tickets, with the rights to the tickets being sold to the highest
bidder. The auction is scheduled to be held in the Federal Building
in Boston, located right next to the FleetCenter, Aug. 27 at 11
a.m. The Red Sox and Patriots are not pleased with the decision
because they hold the rights to all of their tickets. They have
informed the court, through Boston attorney Dan Goldberg, that they
will not fight the situation but want it noted that they consider
this an isolated case that will not set a precedent. The judge will
allow the businessman to keep his tickets, which are on the 25-yard
line at Foxboro Stadium, for six of the Patriots' l0 games this
season. The successful bidder at auction will get tickets for the
remaining four Patriots games this year and the rights to all
tickets to those seats in the future; any Red Sox playoff tickets
this year and the rights to the seats in question for all Sox games
in the future; and all of the businessman's Celtics tickets this
season and in the future. Attorney Steve Shamban, representing the
bankrupt fan, said two Celtics season tickets were auctioned off by
court order several years back and brought in $27,000 just for the
rights to those seats in the future. Paul E. Saperstein, who will
conduct the auction, said he thinks the tickets for each of the
three teams will go for substantially more than that.

   The irony surrounding the major league All-Star Game in Boston
last month is this: The Red Sox lost money while seemingly everyone
else in the city made a score. It cost the Sox close to $2 million
to put on all of the All-Star events . . . Willie Clay told some
folks with the Saints when he arrived at their training camp in
Wisconsin this week that Ty Law is close to signing a lucrative
deal with the Patriots. Clay signed for short money _ $200,000
bonus and $400,000 salary _ but can double his money if he starts
at least seven games this year . . . Have any of the European
players who will compete in the Ryder Cup asked for money for their
favorite charities? I think not. My understanding is when the Ryder
Cup takes place in Europe, the European version of the PGA keeps
the money, and when it's in America, as it will be this year at
Brookline, Mass., our PGA keeps the money. To me, there is nothing
wrong with players wanting some of the money going to charity, as
long as it it not their own charity. The PGA and the tour players
should sit down and pick out national charities related to golf
where the players' contributions could be directed.

<P>
   The Bruins will have a private luncheon for retiring executive
Tom Johnson next Tuesday at the FleetCenter. It's a fitting tribute
for Johnson, who has served the club so well for so long . . . The
plans for a new Fenway Park are on hold until Mayor Tom Menino
decides what Boston is willing to spend on the project. That, in
turn, will determine how much the Red Sox will have to spend . . .
Don't be shocked if the NFL doesn't put an expansion team in either
Los Angeles or Houston. The LA effort is all but dead, and some
owners don't think Houston can afford the going price for an NFL
team. Expansion franchises Cleveland and Washington went for close
to $600 million . . . You are not retired in the NFL until you send
an official letter of notification to the commissioner and your
team has placed you on the retired-reserve list. Neither Barry
Sanders nor Reggie White was on either list as of Friday. This
reporter heard from a source close to White this week that he would
love to come back and play. Green Bay doesn't have room for him
under the salary cap, and only a handful of teams would at this
point in time . . . Don't be surprised if Sox team doctor Arthur
Pappas decides to retire from that position in the next year or
two.

MEMBERS FACE STIFF RATE INCREASES AS HMO LOSSES MOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Faced with mounting losses, nearly all the state's
major health maintenance organizations are asking customers to
absorb double-digit premium increases beginning this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The increases, the largest in nearly a decade, are the
industry's responses to an alarming surge in health care costs that
HMO executives are at a loss to explain.
</P>
<P>
   They signal an abrupt end to years of modest premium increases _
and in come cases decreases _ during which HMOs claimed victory
over medical inflation using ``managed care'' techniques to
eliminate unnecessary health care.
</P>
<P>
   But the triumph has proved short-lived. Nationwide, HMOs are
calling for rate increases of 10 percent to 12 percent, according
to Jack Reichman, a director at Standard &AMP; Poor's insurance rating
service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Tufts Health Plan, the second-biggest HMO in
New England with 1.1 million members, Friday said premium hikes
will average ``in the low double digits.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon Community Health Plan in Worcester said it will raise
rates ``10 percent plus'' next year. The announcements follow a
similar decree by Harvard Pilgrim Health Health Care, the region's
largest HMO, to hike rates 12 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim, New England's largest HMO with 1.3 million
members, hasn't levied a double-digit increase since 1990, when
rates jumped 13 percent on average, according to company figures.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, which sells HMO Blue,
has not yet settled on its 2000 rates, but has predicted premiums
will go up.
</P>
<P>
   Most HMOs say the increases are needed to pay mounting medical
bills, which have pushed them into financial distress in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Friday reported a net loss of $48.9 million in
the first six months of this year on revenue of $1.5 billion. That
compares to a $5.3 million net loss in the same period last year on
revenue of $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   To help cut its losses, Harvard Pilgrim reported it has laid off
50 workers in the past two weeks as part of a previously announced
plan to eliminate ``hundreds'' of employees, said Alan G. Raymond,
spokesman and senior vice president of the Brookline-based HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts Friday posted larger-than-expected net losses _ $16.9
million on $988 million in revenue. Last year, the Waltham-based
HMO made money during the same period _ $500,000 on revenue of
$796.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting losses, just not in the double digits,''
said Richard Hallworth, Tufts chief financial officer. ``We've been
experiencing dramatic increases in (medical costs), but we're not
sure why it's happening. We're working to try to understand it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon, meanwhile, lost nearly $8 million in the first half of
1999 on revenue of $266.2 million, according to Jay Egan,
co-director of Fallon, which has 220,000 members. While the losses
were greater than the $2.2 million net loss incurred during the
first half of 1998, Egan said losses in the second quarter this
year were half what they were in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't continue to lose money year after year, but we feel
we're pretty well poised to turn the corner,'' Egan said. ``Our
strategy is to get better with every quarter. So far, we're on
target with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan said much of Fallon's losses stem from its effort to gain
customers. Such aggressive competition is partly to blame for part
of the industry's financial troubles, said Reichman of Standard &AMP;
Poor's. Vying to gain new members, HMOs in New England have
artificially pushed premiums below costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But raising rates is only part of the answer, Reichman said.
HMOs must also do better in reining in medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs exist today because employers did not want to keep paying
higher rates every year,'' Reichman said, hinting of a consumer
rebellion. ``Just raising rates every year will provoke an answer
from employers and from the government, which pays for Medicare and
Medicaid.''

   Shifting Gear To Computers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley visited the rust belt this week, when Scott G.
McNealy, chairman and chief executive of Sun Microsystems, showed
up at a press conference that General Motors called to tout its new
Internet unit, e-GM. Sun is handling all of GM's Web sites and
otherwise helping the auto giant get connected.
</P>
<P>
   McNealy, who grew up in the land of navy suits, as the Detroit
area is often known _ his father was vice chairman of AMC Motors _
showed up wearing faded jeans. Several GM executives, straining for
casual, had taken off their ties and changed into sport coats for
the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   McNealy insisted that they were committed to the wired world,
appearances aside. ``You wouldn't know it by looking at them,'' he
said. ``I see no body piercing, no tattoos.''
</P>
<P>
   McNealy, who now hails from Palo Alto, Calif., sees dollar signs
when he thinks of bringing computers to cars, because ever-longer
commutes are making for a captive audience. Just think of all the
``dashboard hours per day'' that GM captures, said McNealy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often think of the automobile as nothing more than a Java
browser with tires,'' he said. That's because all the major auto
companies, through the Automotive Multimedia Interface
Collaboration, have selected the Java computer language, ``rather
than going with Microsoft and putting control-alt-delete buttons on
every dashboard,'' McNealy added with a grin.

   When Frank Quattrone, the flamboyant West Coast investment
banker for technology companies, moved his operations in July 1998
from Deutsche Bank to Credit Suisse First Boston, a collective
titter could be heard throughout Silicon Valley. It was the second
time in two years that Quattrone had finagled a multimillion-dollar
compensation package for himself and more yet for his team of
bankers. Could he deliver for his new employer?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. As lead manager of initial public offerings sold in
the United States, Credit Suisse moved up to third place for the 12
months ended Aug. 1 from sixth for the 12 months prior (and 18th
two years ago). His partners also advised Ascend Communications
this year when it was bought by Lucent Technologies for $24
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrone and his group took out full-page ads in newspapers
this month lauding their recent achievements. Credit Suisse had the
building blocks, Quattrone said, adding, ``They were just missing
our technology team.'' &QL;

   Avon Joins the Fight Against Cancer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Avon is doing more than calling these days. Charles Perrin, the
company's chairman and chief executive, plans to lead hundreds of
Avon employees, from senior management to sales people, who are
walking, marching or jogging 55 miles in three days to raise money
to fight breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Perrin, 54, and his wife Sheila will be among the expected 2,400
walkers who will leave Bear Mountain on Friday, Aug. 27, and walk
through Rockland County and New Jersey to the closing ceremonies
for the Avon Breast Cancer 3-Day in Central Park on Sunday, Aug.
29.
</P>
<P>
   Perrin and his company are seeing to it that en route, the
walkers will have catered meals, hot showers and medical services,
plus shelter in tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very important program,'' Perrin said, ``and
I think it's important for the CEO to walk the talk.'' He's a
jogger and his wife takes aerobics classes. Even so, the Perrins
and their friends have been training for the event all summer.
</P>
<P>
   With similar events, backed by Avon, in Chicago, Los Angeles and
Atlanta this year, Perrin predicts that about $20 million will be
raised to help women with the early detection of breast cancer.

SUSPECT IN DESERT KILLING ALLOWED TO RETURN TO BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. _ Composed and businesslike, murder suspect Raffi
Kodikian won temporary freedom Friday after a judge said he could
return home to Boston until he stands trial on charges that he
killed his best friend and buried the body in a crude grave in a
canyon desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine right now,'' Kodikian, 25, said after a 10-minute
hearing in Eddy County Magistrate Court, where he was ordered to
surrender his passport and be ready to return to New Mexico at a
judge's command.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, dressed in brown hiking boots, blue jeans, and a white
T-shirt, said he wanted to offer his sympathies to the family of
David Coughlin, the man Kodikian said he stabbed twice in the chest
last weekend in a remote area of Carlsbad Caverns National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to, but I can't,'' Kodikian said in a brief
sidewalk interview after the hearing. His lawyer said his client is
bound by a court order not to contact any possible witnesses in the
case against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really can't say anything,'' said Kodikian's father,
Howard, his voice choked with emotion. ``Our condolences go out to
them. We know they're hurting. We're just sorry about the whole
situation. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian has told authorities that he and Coughlin, 26, of
Millis, Mass., had gotten lost in the desert park and had run out
of water. Desperate and dehydrated, Kodikian told them, his
longtime friend begged him to end his misery.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy County Magistrate Judge Monte L. Lyons presided over
Friday's hearing. He noted Kodikian's clean record and the fact
that the local prosecutors did not object to allowing Kodikian to
return Boston, and to his father's home in Doylestown, Pa. In
exchange, Kodikian agreed to air-mail his passport back to the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, who was released Tuesday on $50,000 bail, also waived
his extradition rights if he violates the conditions of his
release, which also include a ban on the use of drugs, alcohol, and
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get into any problems,'' Lyons told
Kodikian.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian told Lyons that he would like to contact two people _ a
former girlfriend who he said is ``a mutual friend of mine and
Dave,'' as well as Coughlin's roommate. ``I was hoping to speak to
him _ not about the case,'' Kodikian told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   But after Gary W. McCandless, the local sheriff's chief of
detectives, told the judge that both friends are potential
witnesses, the judge declined Kodikian's request. ``I'll have to
get back to you on that,'' Lyons told him.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Kodikian and his father, Friday's unscheduled hearing
was attended only by the judge, McCandless, Eddy County Sheriff
M.A. ``Chunky'' Click, and a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Click said detectives from his department and FBI agents
interviewed Kodikian again Friday morning. Kodikian told them about
events leading up to Coughlin's death in the desert last weekend,
which was discovered when a National Park Service ranger approached
the Massachusetts men's campsite in Rattlesnake Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I killed him,'' Kodikian allegedly told Ranger Lance Mattson,
who discovered Coughlin's body under a blue cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Click called Kodikian cooperative, well-mannered, and
respectful. He said he is not considered likely to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities expect to decide next week whether Kodikian, now
charged under an open count of murder, will face prosecution by
state or federal authorities. A preliminary hearing scheduled for
Thursday most likely will be waived, said Click.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement sources said that while prosecutors have strong
evidence against Kodikian, including his incriminating statements
to the park ranger and a journal that officials have called
tantamount to a signed confession, the case is far from open and
shut.
</P>
<P>
   They say Kodikian has two likely defenses: that the desert heat
and sun diminished his capacity to tell right from wrong, or that
he was near-delusional at the time of the stabbing. Both arguments,
the sources said, could be compelling before juries.
</P>
<P>
   But Click, who has said he is skeptical of Kodikian's account,
said he is confident a thorough investigation will yield the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that Mr. Kodikian was moderately to severely
dehydrated. But there's no question that Mr. Coughlin was very much
alive'' when Kodikian stabbed him, Click said.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian and Coughlin were on a cross-country trip to Santa
Barbara, Calif., where Coughlin intended to study environmental
science this fall.
</P>
<P>
   As Kodikian traveled back to the East Coast, officials here were
preparing for forensics tests on items found at the canyon camp
site, including the hunting knife authorities believe was used in
the stabbing, a poncho and plastic cover with a red stain, a rock,
a blue T-shirt, a sock, and a bedroll.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Deputy District Attorney Les Williams said under New
Mexico law, Kodikian's trial must start six months after he is
formally arraigned in court.

 &HT;    Springer silences talk of possible Senate run
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Three weeks of ``Springer fever'' ended Friday
as Jerry Springer announced he won't give up his chair-throwing,
hair-pulling television talk show to seek the Ohio Democratic
nomination to run against U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine.
</P>
<P>
   And, as far as state Sen. Rhine McLin is concerned, it might be
better for her party to give up altogether on next year's U.S.
Senate race than to run a relatively unknown candidate, such as
former Columbus-area state Rep. Richard Cordray, against DeWine, a
Republican from Cedarville who's in his first term.
</P>
<P>
   Springer, a former Cincinnati mayor and city councilman, issued
a statement announcing his decision. News that he was considering
the race _ partly at the urging of Hamilton County Democratic
Chairman Tim Burke _ first surfaced in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   ``As tempting and attractive as the notion of serving in the
U.S. Senate is, what I suspected might be the case is, in fact, the
case,'' Springer said. ``My current contractual obligations and
commitments here in the United States as well as in England, make
it impractical if not impossible for me to make a run for the
Senate at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer said he appreciated the interest expressed by Ohio
Democrats and hinted that eventually he may try a return to
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, before my talk show most of my adult life was spent in
public service. I loved it. I look forward to returning to it. Just
not now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McLin was not one of the Democrats encouraging Springer,
although she had not been as critical as U.S. Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, who called the idea of a Springer candidacy a
``joke.''
</P>
<P>
   McLin said Cordray, who has lost races for the U.S. House and
Ohio attorney general, is not ready to face DeWine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Cordray. He needs to run for the state Senate. He's way
ahead of himself. ... I'd rather see us not run someone than to
make a mockery of it,'' McLin said.
</P>
<P>
   The state party should concentrate on recruiting good candidates
for the state Legislature and getting a head start at taking on
Sen. George Voinovich (R-0hio) when the former governor comes up
for re-election in 2004, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cordray, who has formed an exploratory committee to determine
whether he should run against DeWine, said Springer's decision was
the right one for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have been a mistake,'' Cordray said. ``He is
associated in the public mind with an approach to people and values
that is dramatically out of step with the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordray, who was state solicitor under Ohio Attorney General Lee
Fisher, said he will decide in a ``matter of weeks'' whether to
run.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Democratic Chairman David Leland said he talked briefly
with Springer on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus is to find a candidate that will be aggressive and
will fight for Democratic Party values and will beat Mike DeWine in
the year 2000,'' Leland said. He said other Democrats besides
Cordray may come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, the Hamilton County chairman, said he was disappointed by
Springer's decision and said Springer could have defeated DeWine.
He said that those who criticized Springer don't know him well.
</P>
<P>
   Burke called Cordray a ``very talented guy'' and said he would
be a ``viable candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Republican Chairman Robert Bennett kept up the ridicule he
started when talk about Springer first surfaced. Democratic leaders
might not be done searching for candidates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they're interviewing candidates like Marilyn Manson,
Madonna or Ru Paul,'' Bennett said.

SPORTS COLUMN: OLD MAN OF MEDINAH HAS A SHOT TO WIN THE PGA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ With a red 5 next to his name on the scoreboard,
Hale Irwin was walking to the 17th tee Friday when a voice in the
grandstand yelled, ``You're not 50.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest golfer in this PGA Championship looked up, smiled and
said, ``You're right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale Irwin isn't 50, he's 54, the monarch of the Senior PGA
Tour. And as he marched to a 3-under-par 69 for 139 halfway through
this PGA, he was hailed with warm applause at every green from
those who remembered him winning his third U.S. Open Championship
here at the Medinah Country Club in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   After holing a 45-foot birdie putt on the final green in that
Open to force an 18-hole playoff with Mike Donald, Irwin celebrated
by running around the green, slapping hands with fans in the
grandstand. The next day he won with a 10-foot birdie putt on the
first extra hole of what evolved into a 19-hole playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Although Irwin is only four strokes off the lead, he's probably
too old to win, but you never know. And if he did win, he would be
the oldest golfer ever to win a major tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Boros was 48 when he won the 1968 PGA at Pecan Valley in
San Antonio, Texas., and Jack Nicklaus was 46 when he won the 1986
Masters. And don't tell Irwin he can't win at 54.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go back to 1975, I finished third in the U.S. Open here
at Medinah, so I have had success here,'' he said. ``I feel
comfortable playing the golf course. It doesn't mean it's not
challenging. Far from it. But it's the kind of course that I think
elicits my better golf. Can I continue that? Possibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin has a reputation for playing well on the toughest
traditional courses; he won his other two Opens in 1974 at Winged
Foot and in 1979 at Inverness. And Friday he outplayed 19-year-old
Sergio Garcia, the Spanish prodigy who skidded to a 73, and
29-year-old Phil Mickelson, who had 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm longer than I used to be,'' Irwin said, ``but when I'm
comparing my distance to Garcia and Mickelson, I can't compete. I'm
hitting 4-irons, they're hitting 7-irons. But my irons are pretty
good, I keep the ball in play. I make a putt every now and again. I
control my game and get the most out of it. That's my game.''
</P>
<P>
   That game produced 20 victories, including those three Opens,
and nearly $6 million in prize money on the PGA Tour. Ever since
Irwin turned 50, that game has dominated the Senior PGA Tour _ 26
victories, including one Senior Open and three PGA Seniors, and
more than $9 million in prize money. And that game impressed
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprised me the way he hits the ball,'' the Spanish
teen-ager said. ``I knew he was a great player, but I didn't know
he was that good. He hits the ball very straight, he rarely misses
a fairway and he's a good putter.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin isn't even listed in the Ryder Cup standings, but he was a
member of five cup teams, including his memorable halved singles
match with Bernhard Langer in 1991 that assured the Americans'
recapture of the trophy from the European pros. So he was asked, if
he were to win this PGA, would he be an asset to this year's team?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we getting paid?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the laughter from his audience over his allusion to the
Ryder Cup controversy about the American golfers' request for
payments that would be donated to charity, he quickly added, ``I
would pay to play, to tell you the truth.'' And then he addressed
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team has a personality right now that I'm not sure that I
know,'' he said. ``It's not like the teams I've been on. I think
the best thing we could do for the Americans is to put all of this
furor behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled looking at the leader boards here and seeing names
such as Lee Westwood, Sergio Garcia and Miguel Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all going to be on that other Ryder Cup team,'' he
said. ``I think our guys better buckle down and think about playing
golf. And could I be an asset? Well, very possibly. The Country
Club, that's the kind of course I could play. But my better chance
for the Ryder Cup team came two years ago in the PGA at Winged Foot
because I was probably playing a little bit better than I am right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time Hale Irwin is at Medinah and if anyone can win a
major at 54, he can.

U.N. GIVES FORCES AUTHORIZATION TO DETAIN, EXPEL TROUBLEMAKERS IN
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ The U.N. administration gave its troops
and police extra powers Friday to detain and even expel
troublemakers from town or from Kosovo altogether, in a new attempt
to control the violence and ethnic tension in the province.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation, which was signed by the U.N. special
representative, Bernard Kouchner, is a direct reaction to the
tussles French troops have had with noisy demonstrators in this
divided city over the last week, according to a spokesman for KFOR,
the NATO force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   French peacekeeping troops were clearly expecting the new
regulation and welcomed it as a ``supplementary tool'' as the
looting and arson of early weeks gives way to demonstrations and
even attacks on peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule allows police and soldiers to ban someone from an
area, or detain them for up to 12 hours, if they are thought to
present a threat to public peace and order, including infringing on
someone else's human rights or jeopardizing public or private
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a preventative tool,'' said Hansjoerg Strohmeyer, legal
adviser to Kouchner. ``It allows us to remove people who are
instigating violence through hate speech or provocations, and it
can be done within 10 minutes. It means the person can be removed
from the city limits or even from Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily demonstrations of several hundred people are
occurring in Mitrovica as Serbs and ethnic Albanians gather and
trade insults, and even blows, on either side of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians have been protesting the division of the city
and the creation of a Serbian quarter on the north side of the Ibar
River. They say the peacekeepers have failed to provide the freedom
of movement and security necessary for them to return to their
homes on the north side.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian population, swollen by refugees from other towns and
villages, have made Mitrovica the last main town on the road north
to Serbia, a last outpost of Serbian defiance in Kosovo. The Serbs
stand guard on the bridge and seek to prevent Albanians from
crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the demonstrating is orchestrated, aimed at the media
and the authorities, and the crowds of mostly young men and youths
disperse once they have made their point. But recently the
demonstrations have turned violent , and one French soldier
suffered a head injury.
</P>
<P>
   The French peacekeepers say their priority is to keep the two
sides apart in order to prevent violence. They point out that
Mitrovica, with its 50,000 Albanians and 20,000 Serbs, compares
favorably with other towns in Kosovo and has had only five murders
in two months, out of over 200 in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is obvious that Mitrovica is tense and unhappy. The
Albanian side is a wasteland of burned shops and houses and
makeshift market stalls among destroyed rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian side has an eerie, run-down feel. Many shops are
empty or boarded up, and elderly shaken looking civilians walk the
streets slowly, not venturing far from their apartment blocks.
Thickset men sit around in street cafes, scrutinizing the strangers
who venture over the bridge into the Serbian quarter.
</P>
<P>
   There have been four grenade attacks in the area in recent
weeks, the latest on Tuesday when grenades were fired across the
river and landed close to a Serbian restaurant and an apartment
building. The attack raised tensions sharply and the Serbs
retaliated against the Albanians, approximately 700 of whom still
live in the Serbian section.
</P>
<P>
   Alban Kadriu, 20, a young Albanian shop worker, was ordered out
of his apartment two days ago by 20 Serbian civilians who came to
his building. After having survived the entire war in the
apartment, protected by a Serbian neighbor, Kadriu, his mother, two
brothers and his sister were told to leave after the grenade
attack.
</P>
<P>
   They moved a few blocks away to his uncle's house on the edge of
the Serbian district and never mentioned the incident to the
peacekeepers. Asked why, Kadriu shrugged. ``They are sitting in the
cafe with the Serbs, drinking with them,'' he said of the French
troops. ``They are not doing any good at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he welcomed the new regulation, as did most Albanians who
see the Serbian demonstrations as threatening reminders of the
`ethnic cleansing' during the war. ``It is good. They should have
done that in the beginning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs were more cautious, some approving the regulation but
some wary that it would be used only against Serbs. ``How will they
use their power?'' asked Snezana Pavlovic, 29, who was selling
coffee and newspapers in a kiosk. When told Albanians could be
detained too, she asked cynically: ``Do they have enough room for
them on the other side?''

</P>
<P>
   What's the perfect accoutrement for a date in the 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   How about the ``Get Lucky Pak,'' a wallet-sized package offering
a LifeStyles condom and a sample of new Dental Dots, dime-sized
pads soaked in mint toothpaste with adhesive backing to adhere to
the index finger for a quick cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to get some press on it, maybe on late-night TV,''
said John Stoltzfus, president of Dental Dots Inc. ``While it's a
serious product for good oral hygiene, it does lend itself to the
tongue-in-cheek approach,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The disposable fingertip toothbrush is the brainchild of
Stoltzfus' late identical twin brother, Bob, who during a long
illness was unable to get to the bathroom to brush his teeth. John
left his career in commercial real estate, developed special
equipment to make the product and founded Dental Dots in Reseda,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The new, patented toothbrush sells in blister packs of six for
about $2 in drugstores and other outlets. The promotion with
LifeStyles condoms is one of the racier for the company. Stoltzfus
is also talking to the hospitality industry, especially airlines
and hotel chains, about serving travelers in a hurry.

   GOOD NEWS ON INFLATION SENDS MARKETS UP SHARPLY
</P>
<P>
   Stocks soared following news that inflation was not a problem
last month at the producer level. July's Producer Price Index rose
by just two-tenths of a percent. The so-called core Producer Price
Index, which excludes food and energy prices, was unchanged last
month. The Dow Jones industrial average surged 184.26 points, or
1.71 percent, at 10,973.65. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
jumped 29.52 points, or 2.27 percent, to 1,327.68. The
technology-laden Nasdaq composite rose 88.32 points, or 3.46
percent, to 2,637.81.
</P>
<P>
   In the inflation-sensitive bond market, the benchmark 30-year
bond jumped 1432, to 1001232. The bond's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.10 percent from 6.27
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. MORGAN SUED BY SUMITOMO
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan was accused of lending at least $535 million to a
copper trader in the mid-1990s, money that helped fuel a trading
binge that inflicted $2.6 billion in losses on the Sumitomo
Corporation. The information was disclosed in a lawsuit filed by
the Japanese bank this week.

   TEAMSTERS SEEK END TO SUPERVISION
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after federal officials gained a strict supervisory
role over the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in an effort
to rid it of mob control, the union's new leadership is pushing
hard to get the government out.
</P>
<P>
   WIRE TRANSFERS RAISE QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Many of the estimated six million Mexicans who live and work in
the United States send money to relatives in Mexico. But as the
wire transfer business has boomed, more customers have complained
about the costs. Class-action lawsuits have accused the dominant
wire transfer companies of profiteering, while internal debates at
the two companies over wire transfer rates are said to have led to
the departure of high-ranking Hispanic executives in the United
States and Mexico.

<P>
   DAEWOO UNIT GETS $3.2 BILLION BID
</P>
<P>
   An investment group led by a little known California businessman
has agreed to buy most of Daewoo Electronics, the consumer
electronics unit of the troubled South Korean conglomerate.
Daewoo's president, Yang Jae-yeol, left, said that Walid Alomar &AMP;
Associates, based in Beverly Hills, will pay $3.2 billion for the
Daewoo Electronics assets and operations in North and South
America, Western Europe, Japan and South Korea. The price includes

GRAF ENDS GRAND CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an unseasonably cold and windy night in south Florida,
prompting a handful of fans to build a small bonfire in the
makeshift stands overlooking the tennis court where the sport's
reigning queen, Chris Evert, was playing against a teen-ager with
blond ambition. This was in February, 1985, at the inaugural Lipton
Championships, which was being held at a temporary site in DeLand.
Despite the elements, the business-like Evert dispatched her
opponent before the last embers of the fire had died.
</P>
<P>
   But those who had come to watch Queen Chris give a free tennis
lesson to a virtual unknown were impressed by the tall, slender
15-year-old from Germany whose loss that night could be attributed
more to inexperience than a lack of talent or will. Tennis often
devours its young, leaving teen-age phenoms physically and
psychologically scarred, but there was something about Steffi
Graf's resolve even then that hinted she might be special.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, no one could have predicted that Graf would
exceed expectations and become the most dominant player in the game
_ perhaps the best player and athlete in the history of women's
tennis. Now, 14 1/2 years after that cold night in Florida, and in
the autumn of her career, Graf has announced her retirement.
</P>
<P>
   She goes out in style, winning this year's French Open for her
22nd Grand Slam singles title and reaching the final of Wimbledon.
But at 30, the succession of injuries and the demands placed on a
globe-trotting tennis pro have taken their toll. The player whose
signature shot earned her the nickname ``Fraulein Forehand'' is
leaving on her own terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning Roland Garros was an unbelievable moment for me and
getting to the finals of Wimbledon so soon after was incredible,''
Graf said in a news conference yesterday in Heidelberg, Germany.
``I just felt the motivation to perform at the very highest level
was no longer there, and the fun had gone out of practice and
training. I have come to the stage in my career when it is time to
start looking at other things. I just feel the time is right to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Her list of accomplishments equals or surpasses those of any
tennis legend. Graf won 107 singles titles and spent 377 weeks
ranked No. 1 in the world _ a record for any tennis player, woman
or man. She emerged a top player in the final years of the
Evert-Martina Navratilova era and forged her own spirited rivalries
with Gabriela Sabatini and Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Graf apart from her contemporaries and all but four
other players in the history of the sport, however, is the Grand
Slam she won in 1988. In a tour de force unrivaled in tennis'
professional era, Graf won the Australian Open, French Open,
Wimbledon and U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   She then capped an extraordinary year by winning the gold medal
in the Seoul Olympics, becoming the only player in history to win a
Golden Slam.
</P>
<P>
   She won with that remarkable forehand that she hit with
laser-like precision, a slice backhand that was unspectacular but
rarely exploited, and athleticism that enabled her to cover the
court like a tarp on a baseball infield. She was fast and loved to
run; during the Seoul Olympics, she was drawn to the track and
field events. She said wistfully that she would have loved to have
been a sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   Although she quickly earned the respect of her peers and the
game's icons with her results, Graf was not readily embraced off
the court during the early years.
</P>
<P>
   Because women believed that they were treated like second-class
citizens compared to men, the women's tour was like a loosely
formed sorority. Billie Jean King, then Evert and Navratilova were
the sorority leaders. But as prize money increased, thus raising
the stakes, younger players led a more solitary existence. Graf did
not join the sorority and was perceived as aloof. Her father, Peter
Graf, was considered domineering and was widely resented by the
leaders in the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   The players' choice was Argentina's Sabatini, who was
personable, had the looks of a model and a game that could have
rivaled Graf's if she had ever been motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Sabatini was Graf's opponent in the final of the 1988 U.S. Open,
the last obstacle between Fraulein Forehand and the Grand Slam.
With two publicists from the women's tour openly cheering for
Sabatini in the press box, Graf dismissed her rival and joined Don
Budge, Maureen Connolly, Rod Laver (twice) and Margaret Court as
winners of the Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   She was only 19 and dependent on her father to handle her
business affairs and the politics of the sport. Peter Graf was
difficult to deal with, although fiercely protective of his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Graf and Boris Becker had emerged as larger-than-life characters
in Germany, unable to visit their homeland without being engulfed
in a sea of paparazzi and reporters. Peter Graf talked about the
boys bearing gifts who would scale the picket fence in front of
Graf's home in Bruhl, Germany, and knock at the door. He talked
about the occasional threats against his daughter and the love
letters from obsessed young men. He would never tell her about any
of this.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, there was a glimpse of what life might have been
like had Graf not wielded a tennis racket with such impunity. On
the weekend before his daughter began her quest to complete the
Grand Slam at the U.S. Open, Peter Graf invited a journalist to
dinner at the home of friends in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Steffi played pinball with the journalist's 8-year-old son; she
set the table and cleared the plates after each course. Later that
evening, she went to her room and danced alone in the dark to her
favorite music on the stereo. She blushed when her father knocked
on the door and she was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   As the years unfolded, she began speaking more often on her own
behalf and became the best advertisement for the women's game. But
there were more hardships on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Graf was found guilty by association when one of
her misguided fans dashed from the stands at the German Open in
1993 and stabbed Seles in the back. Seles had overtaken Graf as the
No. 1 player and was gaining an upper hand in their rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1996, Graf's father was found guilty of income-tax
evasion by the German government and sent to jail. There were also
reports that he was having an extramarital affair. Steffi stood by
her father throughout the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   And there were the injuries. Navratilova and Evert occasionally
intimated that Graf exaggerated her aches and pains, but the
injuries were serious enough to sideline her for extended periods
during the last few years of her career. Ironically, Graf said that
her history of injuries had no part in her decision to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not been forced into this decision by my injuries,''
she said at yesterday's news conference. ``Right now, I'm perfectly
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   She will embark on a farewell tour of exhibitions at the end of
the year, visiting places she has never been. Always stoic in
victory and defeat, she may even shed a tear or two as she did
after defeating Martina Hingis to win the French Open in early
June.
</P>
<P>
   She will continue to be associated with tennis, she said,
working with youth groups and the German federation. But now, she
can fade into the background where she always felt more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing left to accomplish,'' Graf said. ``I am very
happy and relieved to have made this decision and I look forward to
what the future brings.''

 &HT;    Botched smuggling of 132 Chinese in Georgia sets records
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ The discovery Thursday of 132 Chinese men in a
secret compartment of a ship is the biggest and most sophisticated
smuggling case immigration and port officials in Georgia say they
have ever encountered.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth major instance over the last 15 months in the
United States in which smugglers stood to profit by transporting
Chinese into this country, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Reese, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Ports Authority,
said Friday she could not recall another large-scale case of
immigrant smuggling in Savannah in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something of this scale is just unprecedented,'' said Reese,
adding that 2,169 ships docked at the port authority or nearby
private docks last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service transported the
stowaways and the ship's 28 crew members to jails in DeKalb and
Fulton counties Friday afternoon. The stowaways, 51 of them between
the ages of 14 and 17, were on the ship for at least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   All of the people seized from the ship spent Thursday night at a
National Guard armory in Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Fischer, INS district director, said agency officials
plan to interview the stowaways today and Sunday, hoping to
discover their destination _ the ship was headed for Georgetown,
S.C., after its scheduled stop in Savannah _ and whether an
employer awaited their arrival. The INS brought in agents from New
York who speak Chinese to help interrogate the detainees.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials will decide whether to file charges against the
ship's crew members. Authorities had not charged anyone as of
Friday night. The INS can legally detain the stowaways and crew
members because they are in this country illegally, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Savannah is seen as a gateway to the United States for
illegal immigrants, as are many seaports. Illegal immigration
problems in Savannah have not significantly worsened in the last
few years, he said, but they have not improved, either.
</P>
<P>
   Congress ordered the INS last year to spend more money to help
local law enforcement agencies crack down on illegal immigration in
11 states that do not share a border with Canada or Mexico. Georgia
is one of those states, and the INS identified four regions in
which it plans to bolster its presence, including Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Smuggling Chinese nationals into the United States has become
big business in the last few years. Investigators say criminal
organizations in China typically charge each passenger $30,000 to
$47,000 for the trip, usually aboard a ship and very often in
squalid conditions where disease, rape and hunger can be rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gilhooly, INS spokesman for 25 states in the eastern
United States, said the agency intercepted 700 Chinese being
smuggled into this country in 1996. The number rose to 1,100 in
1998, and 1,900 so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the aliens come here for work, he said, but they often
spend years repaying the debt they owe to smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent interceptions:
</P>
<P>
   _ In May 1998, 23 Chinese aliens waded ashore on an affluent New
Jersey beach after a small boat they were riding in ran out of
fuel. INS agents found a much bigger boat in the waters nearby. The
captain and his engineer were convicted of smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   _ In September 1998, the INS discovered 174 Chinese nationals on
a ship near San Diego, Calif. The captain and four crew members
were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   _ In December 1998, investigators charged 30 people in a scheme
to smuggle 3,600 Chinese into New York City over a two-year period.
Organizers of that ring charged $47,000 a trip and made about $170
million, Gilhooly said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Chinese nationals who were detained in those cases
are awaiting deportation. Gilhooly said an immigration judge
reviews any requests for political asylum, but he did not know
whether such requests were made in the three 1998 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smugglers put human beings at risk,'' he said. ``The
linchpin in smuggling is that people are profiting from human
misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a tip two weeks ago, the U.S. Coast Guard on Wednesday
used a dog trained to sniff out humans in searching the Prince
Nicolas, a cargo ship from Cyprus owned by Cosmomar Shipping, when
it was six miles off the coast. They found nothing suspicious,
Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   INS agents searched again after the ship docked. ``We had a
sixth sense that something was wrong,'' Fischer said. On Thursday,
officials inspected the ship after it docked in Savannah and
discovered a secret hatch that was welded shut to conceal the
Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese slept in bunks and had air conditioning, but they
shared tight quarters and had to use a hole in the floor as a
restroom. ``This was not part of the Carnival cruise line,''
Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be immigrants were carrying large sums of American
money, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said the government probably will order medical
examinations to see whether any of the detainees have tuberculosis
or other diseases that could be easily transmitted in a jail. He
said his agents planned to seize the 40,000 ton ship, which is more
than two football fields long.
</P>
<P>
   Waves lapped against the massive black hull of the Prince
Nicolas on Friday afternoon. American and Cypriot flags flew near a
``SAFETY FIRST'' slogan and a ``DANGEROUS CARGO'' warning stenciled
by rusting metal equipment. Giant ropes anchored the ship to a dock
in one of two deep-water ports maintained by the Georgia Ports
Authority.

 &HT;    No farewell tour as Graf retires
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Steffi Graf rested her case Friday. The argument is
whether she's the greatest women's tennis player in history.
</P>
<P>
   In a teary press conference near her home in Heidelberg,
Germany, the 22-time Grand Slam singles champion announced that she
was retiring immediately, declining to stay on for a final farewell
at the U.S. Open next month.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left following a 17-year career that earned her more
than $20 million is for historians to decide where Graf ranks among
the all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steffi is definitely one of the greatest tennis players of all
time, and she is the all-time greatest singles player,'' said
Billie Jean King, who won Wimbledon six times, one fewer than Graf.
</P>
<P>
   King made that assessment based on Graf's singles record in
Grand Slam championships. Graf's 22 major titles are second to
Margaret Court, who won most of her 24 prior to the open era.
</P>
<P>
   Graf is the only player to win each of the four majors at least
four times each, and in 1988 she won them all, joining Court in
1970 and Maureen Connolly in 1953 as the only women to achieve the
Grand Slam of tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, a lithe 5 feet 9, was the superior athlete of her time,
hopping and sprinting along the baseline to crunch the most famous
forehand in women's history. She was the pre-eminent player for a
decade, finishing No. 1 a record eight times. She won at least one
Grand Slam each year from 1987 to '96. Starting with her Australian
Open title in 1988, Graf won 20 of the next 33 majors she entered
and made the final of six others.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what simmered in her personal life, Graf was virtually
incomparable when the stakes were highest. She was 107-30 in
finals, the best of any player in the open era. She won all six
majors she played in 1995 and '96, winning 42 straight matches.
</P>
<P>
   Graf turned pro in 1982 as a bony 13-year-old and won her first
title four years later in '86, beating Chris Evert at Hilton Head,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Graf made the final of every tournament she entered and
opened the year with 45 straight wins, still a tour record.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, perhaps her greatest, Graf won the four majors
plus the Olympic women's singles title for a ``Golden Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Graf won 86 of 88 matches, the second-best record in
history behind Martina Navratilova's 86-1 mark in 1983. Graf held
the No. 1 ranking from Aug. 17, 1987, to March 10, 1991, for a WTA
Tour-record 186 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the rise of Monica Seles, two-fisted off both sides
with groundstrokes more powerful than anyone before her. The
contrast in styles _ Graf's speed and forehand against Seles' will
and fearless baseline assault _ made for a potential rivalry of the
ages.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of Seles' stabbing in 1993 by a Graf fan in Hamburg
was also a loss for Graf. How many Grand Slam titles did Graf win,
her critics ask, because of the absence of Seles?
</P>
<P>
   Head-to-head, Graf won 10 of their 15 meetings, with a 4-1 edge
after the stabbing, and a 3-0 record before Seles' first major
title, the 1990 French. They were 3-3 in between, when both were at
the height of their powers.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Graf was unchallenged as the sport's pre-eminent
player for the next three years despite personal turmoil. Her
father and coach, Peter, was imprisoned for tax evasion on her
income in 1995, a year when Graf won three more majors.
</P>
<P>
   It was Graf's body, not her spirit, that began to wane. In 1997,
she missed Wimbledon and the final seven months of the year
following knee surgery as Martina Hingis ascended to No. 1 while
asserting that Graf was finished.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in her final comeback, Graf scored what she called
her most meaningful victory of all when she stunned top-seeded
Hingis in the French final. Graf announced then she'd played her
final time in Paris. She made it her last Wimbledon, too, after
reaching the final against Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   It was assumed she'd stay on until the U.S. Open, which she had
won five times. But Friday, 10 days after pulling out of the San
Diego tour stop because of a hamstring injury, Graf, 30, said she'd
play no more.

STATE DID NOT COMMIT FURROW, DESPITE DOCUMENTED MENTAL HEALTH
DANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (See also LA-SHOOTING) 
(bl) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Washington state mental health system got an
extensive look at Buford O. Furrow Jr. in the months before he
admitted to opening fire in a Jewish community center and killing a
postal worker in Los Angeles on Tuesday. What the experts saw was a
man who twice slashed his arms so deeply they required stitches,
drank alcohol until he blacked out, and espoused a deep hatred for
anyone who is not white.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite lengthy evaluations at mental institutions here,
and no shortage of resources, Furrow was never ordered to remain
under long-term state psychiatric care. Instead, after serving
nearly six months in jail for trying to stab two workers at a
private hospital near Seattle, he was released under parole
supervision and required to take medication to control psychotic
impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Furrow should have fallen under this state's standard
for involuntary commitment to a mental institution is a question
now shadowing the ground where the justice system meets psychiatry.
Furrow was an avowed racist who told a court last year that he
fantasized about committing a mass killing. His temper and violent
threats were so grave that the officer who arrested him for assault
in the Seattle area last year said he nearly had to shoot Furrow in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's attorney in the case had said he would plead not guilty
by reason of insanity. But Furrow pleaded guilty, court records
show, avoiding what could have been a lengthy confinement in a
mental facility.
</P>
<P>
   And while mental health experts here say Furrow did not slip
through the cracks of a strained system _ as has happened with
troubled people in other states _ they say his case is the latest
high profile crime to raise questions about whether states should
tighten the laws on holding violent, mentally ill people in
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does society do with these people?'' said Dr. Renee
Binder, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California
at San Francisco and the chairwoman of the American Psychiatry
Association's Council on Psychiatry and the Law. ``Most people
would say that being a racist with violent fantasies is not against
the law. Racism is not something that is designated as an illness
that can be treated by mental health professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   New York officials recently agreed to expand state authority to
force mentally ill patients to undergo treatment or face
involuntary commitment, joining nearly 40 states, including
Washington, that have enacted similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Furrow's home state of Washington, the debate is over whether
he met the requirements of someone who should have been held in a
mental facility instead of serving a few months in jail for
assault. The Washington state law, similar to the standard of most
states, says the person must have a mental disorder and pose a
threat to harm himself or others, in the eyes of professional
examiners.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Furrow slashed his hands up with a knife and told
police he wanted to shoot people at random in a mall. Those
statements, alone, along with his threats to stab two women at a
mental hospital, where he was trying to be admitted, should have
been enough to bring a civil commitment case against Furrow, some
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person went to a psychiatric hospital to ask for help,
pulled a knife on two women, stated very clearly that he was
homicidal and suicidal, and is tied into a Nazi hate group,'' said
Sherry Storm, the mental health ombudsman for King County, which
covers the Seattle area court system. ``All of those things put
together would seem to make a pretty strong case that he poses a
threat to himself or others.''
</P>
<P>
   But other officials say Furrow was simply a violent, hateful
man, and that trying to blame the shootings on the failures of the
mental health system is futile. They note that Furrow had only one
run-in with the law, that he had a college degree in engineering,
and that he held numerous jobs, including employment at Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I have is that people are trying to build a case
that this killing was done because the man was insane,'' said King
County Executive Ron Sims. ``What he did was cowardly, repulsive
and a very irrational act. But mental illness was not the cause.
Hatred was. This guy came out of a culture of hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   National groups representing the mental health profession are
also reluctant to tie the shootings to a failure in the system.
They cite the case of Andrew Goldstein, the schizophrenic man who
pushed a woman to death in New York, or Russell Weston Jr., who
killed two people in the U.S. Capitol, as examples of how
potentially violent, mentally ill people who sought treatment were
largely ignored. But with Furrow, they say, the case is less
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all understand that Goldstein and Weston should have had
more treatment,'' said Bill Emmett, deputy executive director of
the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, an advocacy group based
in Arlington, Va. ``But we're not that eager to have Furrow's case
equated with Goldstein and Weston. We simply don't have enough
facts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Confidentiality laws prohibit officials from disclosing details
about Furrow's mental health record. But court records show that
last year, during his first encounter with the criminal justice
system, he was extensively examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it is not a question of whether we have the
resources,'' Amnon Shoenfeld, a supervisor with the mental health
professionals who evaluate inmates for King County. ``We always
have adequate beds.''
</P>
<P>
   Of about 5,000 people referred for evaluation in this county
every year, nearly half are sent to some form of involuntary
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Within a day of Furrow's arrest last Oct. 28, mental health
officials sent him to to the psychiatric ward at Harborview Medical
Center in Seattle _ a large public hospital. Later, he was sent for
several weeks of evaluation at the Washington state mental facility
south of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If the experts concluded that he posed a significant enough risk
to merit long-term involuntary commitment, it was never reflected
in the court record. The record shows that he returned to jail in
King County on Dec. 11, and stayed there until his release May 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``With civil commitments, you're always trying to strike a
balance between protecting society and the rights of the
individual,'' said Dr. Binder.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's court-appointed attorney in last year's assault case,
Leona Thomas, told the court she planned to enter a plea of
not-guilty by reason of insanity. But Furrow entered a guilty plea
instead.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Furrow avoided what could have been a sentence of
up to 10 years of involuntary confinement in a mental facility. He
was sentenced to 5 1/2 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case like that, when a person pleads guilty, most people
think that's a way of getting off,'' said Ms. Storm. ``The real
question is whether the judge should be forced to accept the guilty
plea or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case, King County Superior Court Judge Harriet
Cody, did not return phone calls requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Cody did require, as a term of Furrow's release, that
he stay on his medication, refrain from drinking alcohol and not
own a gun. State officials say Furrow met his parole requirements,
as near as they could tell, until later this summer when he left
the state.
</P>
<P>
   By requiring Furrow to stay on an anti-psychotic medication, the
state has considerable leverage over him, in the eyes of Ms.
Binder. ``In some cases, that sort of requirement is stronger than
civil commitment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has been through several well-publicized cases
in which mentally ill people who were allowed to remain free
committed violent crimes. Two years ago, after a mentally ill man
stabbed to death a retired Seattle firefigther after a Mariners
baseball game, the law was changed, making it easier to refer
people to mental evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   This state's law also prohibits the family from committing a
member who is older than the age of 13 to a mental facility.
Furrow's father, Buford Furrow Sr., wanted his son to be under
closer supervision of a mental health care system as a condition of
parole, said the family's neighbor in the town of Old Nisqually,
Wash., Clint Merrill, in a brief interview Friday.

 &HT;    Wallace pole ends Gordon's streak
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ Friday the 13th at Watkins Glen had these
frightful developments: a 3 1/2-hour rain delay that wiped out most
of the practice time, a road kill by Dale Jarrett, and Jeff Gordon
failing to win a road course pole for the first time in four races.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace weathered the stormy conditions to grab the pole
for Sunday's Frontier at the Glen with a track-record qualifying
lap of 121.234 mph. He breezed around the 2.45-mile course in
72.752 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It's Wallace's first pole since Bristol in April, 14 races ago.
</P>
<P>
   Road course specialist Boris Said, who also drives in the NASCAR
truck series, will start on the outside pole after qualifying the
No. 14 Ford second with a lap of 120.915 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars are like women, they've all got their own
personalities,'' Said said of his temporary move. ``I like all
women and I like all cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, whose streak of four consecutive road course wins is at
risk Sunday, qualified third at 120.632 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett qualified ninth on a lap
that included an encounter with a woodchuck in the inner loop. ``If
I could have gotten in there quicker, we wouldn't have been there
at the same time,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to keep sacrificing animals like this. In '96 I hit a
bird in the (Daytona) 500 and won that. In July, I hit a turtle in
practice at Daytona and we won that race. Now I've hit a woodchuck.
I'm sure the animal activists out there are gong to be after Dale
Jarrett, but I'll assure you, there's nothing I'm trying to do. I'm
not aiming at 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's qualifying lap may have been a surprise only to him.
He was fast when the cars took to the track on rain tires for some
morning practice. The drivers quickly changed to regular tires when
the track dried.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace got in only six laps, including a field-fastest
103.840 mph, before the rains wiped out the remainder of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte lost a transmission in his No. 18 Pontiac on a
practice lap, hit the wall on the inner loop and had to go to a
backup car to qualify 22nd.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield provided the only qualifying-run adventure,
spinning out on his attempt and finishing slowest among the 49 cars
at 105.768 mph. ``When your lap ends with the crew congratulating
you for keeping the car off the wall, that's usually not a very
good sign,'' Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace got the congratulations that counted most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done much to the car, except put some spring
rubbers in the back and adjust the chassis a little bit,'' Wallace
said. ``We put some timing in the motor and leaned the thing out a
little bit, and the thing really came alive.

 &HT;    Holtz giving Gamecocks a case of Lou-mania
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ South Carolina finished 1-10 in 1998, the worst
season of the program's 105. But its fans couldn't be more excited
about this fall if the Gamecocks were the defending national
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Two words.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old grandfather hasn't coached in two years and has
not won a game at South Carolina. But the impact he's had on this
town and this state is off the charts. It is called ``Lou-mania''
and these are some of its effects:
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite four consecutive losing seasons, the school has set a
record for season-ticket sales with more than 53,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the spring, after listening to Holtz's pep talks, the
always-generous South Carolina boosters set a record by forking
over $8.3million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hotels in and around Columbia were booked faster than ever.
Restaurant owners are expecting a record season. ``We ought to put
him on the front of our travel guide,'' said Lou Fontana, a
representative of the South Carolina Department of Parks,
Recreation and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   _ A football clinic for women started by former coach Sparky
Woods had never drawn more than 800. More than 1,200 showed up this
summer to see Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe so much enthusiasm exists for a team that
will have to overachieve to finish fourth in the SEC's rugged
Eastern Division. South Carolina just doesn't have the depth of
division rivals Tennessee, Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But one day in Columbia makes it clear that the town is buying
what Lou Holtz has to sell _ hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally our fans are looking at the schedule and counting how
many games we can win and wondering if we can go to a bowl game,''
said Kerry Tharp, South Carolina's longtime sports information
director. ``This year it's different. They are just excited that
something very positive is happening. They're not worried about the
present, because the future looks bright.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope is not confined to the fans. Strong safety Arturo
Freeman was a preseason All-SEC choice last year before tearing up
his right knee in practice. If not for the injury, Freeman would be
in an NFL camp now. He believes it was fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything happens for a reason,'' said Freeman, whose
knee is 100 percent. ``I think my injury happened so I could come
back and play for somebody the caliber of Coach Holtz. I really
feel blessed.'' To break from its history of mediocrity, South
Carolina needs the kind of exposure Holtz generates _ and the
ability to translate it into better recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 89 Gamecocks teams that have played at least eight games
in a season, only one has won more than eight; the 1984 team went
10-2. South Carolina has played in nine bowl games, winning one.
Things got tougher in 1992 when the school joined the SEC and was
placed in a division with Tennessee, Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be competitive with those teams, we've got
to go out and get the kind of athletes in the numbers that they
do,'' athletics director Mike McGee said. ``Lou Holtz gives us
instant credibility in that regard. He can go into any home in
America and sell our program. That's a tremendous boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz has made no promises about how fast he can turn things
around. He knows that the program can improve significantly and
still not measure up to the top of the SEC. But he knows he has all
the ingredients to win. ``To me there's not a question of if we can
win,'' Holtz said. ``The only question is when, and I can't answer
that, because of the toughness of the schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with a tough schedule, things are going South
Carolina's way. The Gamecocks' opener, at North Carolina State on
Sept. 4, normally would not make a ripple. Because it's Holtz's
first game on the sideline in two years, ESPN has chosen it for a
Saturday prime-time telecast. The following week's game at Georgia
also will be televised.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do is get out there and let people know what
we have here at South Carolina,'' Holtz said. ``We have a great
university in a great state. We have a great product to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   And at long last, South Carolina has hope.

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ It was the sort of telephone call a small
businessman dreams of. The caller promised to increase by perhaps 5
percent the $1.6 million annual revenue of the computer sales and
service company that Gary C. McLendon founded in Fayetteville, 16
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely 10 weeks later, however, McLendon is struggling to
absorb hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses to an overseas
credit card scam that has consumed the company's cash reserves and
devoured his equity in its building. ``Here I am _ 54 years old and
starting over again,'' McLendon said.
</P>
<P>
   There were several calls, actually, the first crossing the
Atlantic in May. A man who identified himself as ``John Monga'' of
London inquired after computer chips retailed by McLendon's
company, GCM Computers.
</P>
<P>
   Not one or two or a half-dozen of the chips _ Intel Pentium
III-450s and Pentium III-500s, then priced as high as $700 apiece _
but 20. The caller said that Whitehall had commissioned him to
upgrade a large number of British government computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `Oh, boy,''' McLendon recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Monga's enterprise, which he identified as Maple Solutions Ltd.,
needed overnight delivery; would McLendon mind accepting a Visa
payment?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, especially after the credit card company authorized
the transaction. McLendon shipped the chips. His eyes were not wide
shut, not completely; two days later he checked his account and
found that, indeed, the $20,000 payment was there.
</P>
<P>
   Within 72 hours, GCM Computers, which can be found on the
Internet among the thousands of computer companies, was receiving
calls from people who identified themselves as London associates of
Monga who had learned from him of McLendon's ability to provide
Pentium chips quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A man who called himself Calvin Anderson called. An ``Edwin
Reynolds'' called. ``So did some guy with an eastern name, but even
he had a very British accent,'' McLendon said. All wanted chips.
All wanted immediate delivery. All wanted to pay with a Visa or
Mastercard.
</P>
<P>
   McLendon obtained electronic authorizations for all of them. But
nine days after his first shipment to his new British customers,
McLendon received a different sort of telephone call, from Simmons
First National Bank of Pine Bluff, which processed GCM's bank card
transactions. A Visa authorization had been canceled, and as part
of its legal contract with the bank, GCM was now responsible for
covering the amount. The bank was debiting GCM's account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could cover it, so it wasn't that big a deal,'' McLendon
said, especially since within minutes Reynolds was on the other
line, ``buying time,'' apologizing for a bookkeeping error that had
prompted the charge back to GCM's account and promising to set
things right at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know what a chargeback was,'' said McLendon, who
was nonetheless reassured. ``I thought, whew, this isn't as bad as
I thought it was. It was worse. The personal Visa account number
that Reynolds provided to make good the debt was denied
authorization. And the wire transfer Reynolds promised in a
subsequent telephone call never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The next day it was Simmons Bank calling again, advising
McLendon that it had been in contact with Scotland Yard and,
regrettably, GCM Computers' British business had crashed. ``All the
charges were coming back,'' McLendon said. In the 10 days since its
first London order, GMC had dispatched some $1 million in computer
parts to Monga and his associates. After some shipments that
McLendon was able to recall, his outstanding balance with Simmons
Bank was about $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the sum nor the episode was unusual. Law enforcement
officials say the fraud ring that hit McLendon and several other
United States computer companies (including two others in Arkansas)
consisted primarily of Nigerian nationals operating from Britain
and the United States. A joint investigation by Scotland Yard and
American authorities has produced several arrests with more
expected, according to James E. Mackin, a spokesman for the Secret
Service in Washington, which investigates credit card fraud.
</P>
<P>
   David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a credit card
industry newsletter published in Oxnard, Calif., said: ``These
people aren't bumbling thieves. They're pros, and they're highly
intelligent and highly organized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some get arrested, sure,'' Robertson added, ``but others come
along right after them, like a stream of ants.'' Most credit card
organizations do not break down, or disclose, fraud losses incurred
by merchants independent of those borne by banks, but a spokesman
for Visa U.S.A. said they account for about 10 percent of total
fraud losses, which would put the merchants' share well into the
tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Mastercard International alone experienced $526 million in
fraudulent transactions last year _ eight cents of every $100 in
transactions, an increase of almost 14 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the losses, experts say, are driven by the Internet, and
with electronic commerce growing, merchants will have to be
vigilant about protecting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   McLendon, who had assumed that his liability was virtually nil,
was caught in a little-noticed clause of bank credit card
agreements that puts merchants at risk for charges not recorded on
the premises. Had Monga and his associates flown to Fayetteville
and signed for the computer chips rather than using fax, telephone
and e-mail, McLendon would be home free.
</P>
<P>
   McLendon's lawyers concluded that his best option was a
settlement with Simmons Bank. That agreement was signed in late
July, and while it prohibits either party from discussing its
terms, McLendon says he bears the brunt of the losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credit card system is badly broken, and it badly needs
repair,'' McLendon said. Should a stolen card be used in a sale, he
insists, ``There's nothing to alert the merchant that anything's
wrong'' until the card's rightful owner sounds the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy May, the chairman of Simmons, a $1.7 billion bank holding
company and processor of credit card transactions, said, ``The
industry believes there are adequate safeguards'' for merchants. At
the same time, May acknowledged, it would be naive to consider any
security system in the Internet age foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson agrees. Even as the industry deploys ever more
advanced technology to thwart thieves, he said, ``These are very
sophisticated criminals, and they've defeated every known security
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on 10 days that shook his world, McLendon concluded,
``It was a hell of an education.''

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEPORT, Maine _ First came the indoor trout pond. Then there
was the barnlike addition devoted to children's clothes and
accessories. Now comes what is perhaps the ultimate sign that L.L.
Bean, the 87-year-old arbiter of what's what in rugged outerwear,
is going after cosseted baby boomers in a big way: the company's
Maine Hunting Shoe, its first product and essential icon, has been
revamped to make it more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in the boot are subtle to the naked eye. What was a
vulcanized, hand-formed rubber sole is now molded in a
machine-driven method that the company says saves money and results
in a lighter, warmer, better-fitting product. ``It may look the
same on the outside,'' declares the literature that accompanies the
new boot, which is still arrestingly utilitarian-looking, ``but
there's an inside story.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recent changes within the privately held company _ based,
as it has always been, here in this tourist mecca of outlet stores
and lobster shacks _ reflect an even bigger effort to recast the
venerable L.L. Bean into a more up-to-date mold.
</P>
<P>
   The company has added a new brand aimed at working women,
expanded its home-furnishings department and ``turned up the
volume'' on its children's line, as one executive put it. Even more
startling, Bean plans to develop a bigger retail presence _ once
unthinkable in a company that made its name in mail-order _ by
opening three to five full-scale stores along the Eastern Seaboard.
The first is scheduled to appear by next summer in a sprawling
suburban mall at Tysons Corner, Va., outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   All this is meant to counter plateauing sales at L.L. Bean,
which does not publish a financial statement but says it sold just
over $1 billion worth of gloves, parkas, kayaks, coffee tables,
boot-shaped chocolates, rifles, fly rods, lamps, duffle bags,
snowboards, men's dress shirts, dog beds, khakis, blazers, skirts,
pillow shams, knapsacks and bathing suits last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company witnessed enormous growth until recently. In 1967,
it had just under $5 million in sales. Lately, however, the
commercial environment has grown more complicated, with shifting
consumer tastes and the explosion of electronic commerce _ two
areas where Bean has been slow to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   Now the goal, says Leon A. Gorman, who has been Bean's president
for the last 32 years, is to increase sales at a double-digit rate
every year, to about $1.4 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman outlined the challenges facing the company in a lengthy
memo last year. Among his points was that the company's traditional
attitude toward profits _ that they would emerge naturally if
customers were treated well and stakeholders were well served _ had
to go. ``This attitude was naive, perhaps, on our part, although it
served us well for many years,'' Gorman told his staff. ``In
today's environment, however, we are going to have to focus much
more intently on profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Some see risks, however, in moving further into
bricks-and-mortar retailing. ``It's going to be intriguing to
watch, because often you find the folks who are successful with
catalogs are not successful with stores, and vice versa,'' said
Kenneth M. Gassmann, a retail analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co. in
Richmond. ``J. Peterman? We all know what happened there.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Peterman, whose catalogs were famously wordy and eccentric,
declared bankruptcy earlier this year after a high-speed expansion
into retail stores that didn't do well.
</P>
<P>
   But Bean executives, pointing to successful examples of
outdoor-oriented companies like Patagonia, a unit of Lost Arrow,
and REI that have expanded beyond mail order into retailing around
the country, insist that they have examined the issues carefully
and expect the concept of additional stores to work. While the
company has a handful of factory outlets in four states, and
through a partnership has a dozen or so boutiques in Japan, it says
its new, large stores will bring in many new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 1.5 million Bean customers within five miles of
Tysons Corners,'' said L.L. Bean's general manager for retail,
William P. Shea, an exuberant proponent of the retail concept, so
much so that Gorman, his boss, refers to it as ``Bill's baby.'' He
added: ``And that's before we arrive. Just wait till we arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea plans to move as many as 100 Bean employees to work in the
new store, ``to transfer the culture,'' as he put it.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman, a serene, athletic 63-year-old, is emblematic of the
old-school L.L. Bean, which his grandfather started in 1912.
Committed to as much domestic manufacturing as possible, especially
if it's located in Maine, he was pivotal in the effort to revamp
the Bean boot, whose rubber soles will be made by a small factory
near Lewiston, Maine (Another small factory made the old soles.) He
supports sturdy causes like the Nature Conservancy, the Boy Scouts
and the Maine chapter of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he talks of brand loyalty like someone fresh
out of an M.B.A. program, citing the self-assessment and subsequent
reorganization the company went through last year as priming it
well for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the initiatives in motion now that will provide
substantial growth opportunities in the years ahead,'' Gorman says,
looking slightly embarrassed about the management-speak that has
invaded his vocabulary lately. Terms like ``brand management''
don't sound quite at home at a company that hacked its way out of
the wilderness, selling hunting gear and, when its thoughts turned
to domesticity, scratchy woolen blankets and chairs made from
snowshoes. ``I have to invent a new word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its cautious leanings, Bean set itself up for a
serious fall twice in the last two decades. First came its response
to ``The Official Preppy Handbook,'' a spoof of boarding-school
style, or lack thereof, published in 1980 that named Bean footwear
as part of the required wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman says now he wishes that distinction had passed the
company by. ``The women's apparel in particular got this frumpy
appellation,'' he said, calling it ``not really reflective of the
product line.'' The company geared up to handle an influx of
orders, which came and went, leaving Bean with excess capacity.
</P>
<P>
   More devastating was the company's blighted love affair with the
Japanese. In the late 1980s, the Japanese became heavy users of
Bean products, part of it a fashion trend, part of it stemming from
interest in the outdoors, and all of it helped along by the strong
yen. Sales to Japan built steadily, reaching 20 percent of the
company's overall business by 1995, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, the bottom dropped out of the Japanese
economy, taking most of Bean's sales to Japan with it. At the same
time, domestic sales were weak, and competition from longtime
rivals like Lands' End, which posted $1.4 billion in sales last
year, intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of the Internet. Bean had jumped on the
concept early, and its Web site was open for business by 1996. But
competitors roared by it, embracing improved technology that helped
consumers find their sizes, for example, while the Bean site
puttered along exactly the way it had started.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a very basic level, there are some things L.L. Bean really
needs to get on, including offering more sizing information and
more tools,'' said Evie Black Dykema, an analyst with Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``Overall, their site is very
thorough. It's basically their catalog, on line. But to realize
their full potential, they will need to expand their functionality
beyond what can be found in their catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   Other outdoor suppliers, like Lands' End and Recreational
Equipment Inc., or REI, have moved well beyond Bean's efforts in
cyberspace, she added. And other analysts were less charitable
about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really fell behind the pack by not picking up on
E-commerce soon enough and not being more aggressive with it,''
said Alan Mak, an analyst with Argus Research in New York. ``They
lacked the vision to see how powerful the Internet was as a retail
medium. And trying to play catch-up on the Internet is extremely
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem seems to have been the revolving door at
Bean's E-commerce division. Patricia Robles, the current executive
in charge, is the third person to hold the post in the last two
years. One recent departure was Tom Harden, an executive vice
president who left to work for an Internet mail-order gift company,
Send.com. But Ms. Robles insists that the company's revamped
Website, which is supposed to be available in October, will counter
all of the criticism by being as efficient, user-friendly and
up-to-date as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a company that's known to be conservative and traditional,
we really were out on the Web early,'' said Ms. Robles, whose
15-year career at Bean has included stints as a women's apparel
product manager and a manager of inventory control. ``The
disadvantages are that you put in early infrastructure and it
quickly becomes outdated. We did not move quickly to replace some
of the infrastructure, but we're doing that now.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's electronic commerce recently got improved status
within L.L. Bean, Ms. Robles said. ``We are really putting
significant resources into the Web,'' she said. The new site, she
explained, will include tips on where to go on outdoor excursions,
as well as what someone might need and how to order it from Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent addition is a brand called Freeport Studio, which
is supposed to appeal to working women with clothing that is
low-maintenance, relatively stylish and affordable. ``We're trying
to address the casualization of America,'' said Cindy Marshall, the
marketing executive for the line. ``We're certainly not
corporate.''
</P>
<P>
   The brand came out with its own catalog in January, and sales
are strong, Bean executives say. The line came about in response to
a letter from a longtime customer who bought other Bean products,
but pointed out that while they were useful on weekends, ``there
are only 52 weekends a year, and I need something to wear the rest
of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   She closed the letter by advising the company: ``Get with it.''

Graf calls it a career
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JODY GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   HoustonChronicle
</P>
<P>
   It has been the year of retirements, and now one of the best
ever to pick up a tennis racket is calling it quits.
</P>
<P>
   Steffi Graf, who turned 30 a week after winning the French Open
in June, called a news conference near her hometown of Bruehl,
Germany, on Friday to announce she is leaving the sport, effective
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt right after Paris and Wimbledon that the motivation
wasn't what it was in the past,'' Graf said. ``I have done
everything I wanted to do in tennis. After Wimbledon, for the first
time in my career, I didn't feel like going to a tournament. I went
to San Diego just to make sure, and I felt it right away. It is
time to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf is the latest in a list of sports legends to make 1999
their final year of competition, joining Michael Jordan, Wayne
Gretzky, John Elway and most recently Barry Sanders. All walked
away while still near the top of their sport.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego last week, Graf suffered another in an exhaustive
series of injuries that have plagued her career over the past two
years. She strained her left hamstring, causing her to retire from
a second-round match against Amy Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was thought she would play in the U.S. Open, which
begins Aug. 30. But she knew almost instantly her heart wasn't in
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, the decision (to retire) was very easy, maybe too
easy,'' Graf said. ``I was pulled back and forth, but when I made
my decision, I didn't think about it one minute afterward. On the
plane coming back from San Diego, I just started poring through
these magazines and thinking of all the places I could go.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few places she hasn't been. Graf has won tournaments
on six continents, the most notable being her 22 Grand Slams, two
shy of Margaret Court's record. But now she would like to travel
without a racket in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to enjoy the privilege of having time to do the
things I haven't had time to do before and to discover what I want
to do with the rest of my life,'' Graf said.
</P>
<P>
   Her spot in tennis history is established, with several records
that aren't likely to fall any time soon. She was the world's No. 1
player for a total of 377 weeks, the most of anyone _ male or
female _ in history. She held that ranking consecutively from Aug.
17, 1987, to March 10, 1991, a total of 186 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest achievement was a calendar, or ``Golden'' Grand
Slam. She won all four majors _ the Australian Open, French Open,
Wimbledon and U.S. Open _ in 1988, becoming one of only five
players to accomplish the feat. She also won the gold medal at the
Seoul Olympics that year. There were four years in which she won
three of the four major events, and she is the only player to win
all four Grand Slam titles at least four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steffi is a class act,'' said Bart McGuire, chief executive
officer of the WTA Tour. ``As a motivated, well-conditioned,
disciplined and competitive athlete, she has been a role model for
women athletes in all sports. She has been a catalyst for the
resurgence of women's tennis, especially in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steffi is leaving, characteristically, on her own terms. We
wish her well and hope that she will continue to be an ambassador
for women's tennis and for women's sports worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf has suffered chronic sinus and back problems, in addition
to various other pesky maladies. She missed most of 1997 with
injuries and underwent surgery on her left knee.
</P>
<P>
   She played only 44 matches in 1998 because of injuries and had
surgery on her right wrist. And she had played sparingly in 1999
before arriving at Roland Garros in May.
</P>
<P>
   That made her summer achievements that much more spectacular.
Graf won her first Grand Slam in three years, stunning even herself
as she rallied for a three-set come-from-behind victory over
Martina Hingis in the French Open final. A month later, she reached
the final at Wimbledon, only to lose to Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Graf bid an emotional farewell after both events, saying she
would not return. She called the French Open final her best ever
and even took out a half-page ad in the French sporting daily
l'Equipe to thank the French public for its support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you to all my French friends for the many years of
support and those unforgettable moments that I had the opportunity
to live in your company. From the bottom of my heart, thank you,''
Graf wrote in a message she had drafted in French and signed.
</P>
<P>
   She then made an impromptu retirement announcement in New York
in July, hinting 1999 would be her final season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am privileged to be able to leave when I wish without being
pushed toward the exit door,'' Graf said. ``It was not easy to make
this decision, but the competition had become too difficult for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   She retracted the statement, along with the two at the French
Open and Wimbledon, claiming she had spoken hastily.
</P>
<P>
   But this time she's certain. Graf turned pro at 13 and has spent
more than half her life traveling the circuit. She won her first
tournament at 16, beating Chris Evert at Hilton Head, S.C., in
April 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Graf beat Evert again 11 months later at Key Biscayne, Fla.,
becoming the youngest player (17) to pass $1 million in earnings.
She won at Roland Garros in 1987, beating Martina Navratilova for
her first Grand Slam title. She earned the No. 1 ranking for the
first time by the end of that year, two months after her 18th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 years in the sport, she finishes with 107 tournament
titles. She ranks third on that all-time list, trailing only
Navratilova (167) and Evert (157).
</P>
<P>
   Graf has proved she can overcome injuries. This decision wasn't
based on her physical health, but on her mental well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm perfect physically,'' Graf said. ``I've been
biking, doing everything. This is in no way about injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf will appear at the U.S. Open for one more en masse
interview with the international tennis media. And though she won't
compete in WTA Tour events, she plans to announce a series of
exhibition matches to serve as a farewell tour.

<P>
   The Glock semiautomatic pistol that Buford O. Furrow Jr. used in
his confessed killing of a mail carrier, after shooting five people
at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles, was sold last year by
an unlicensed vendor at a gun show near the north Idaho compound of
the Aryan Nations, the neo-Nazi group to which Furrow belonged,
according to interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The path of the Glock model 26, which was sold new by Glock in
1996 to a small police department in eastern Washington state, ran
from the department to a gun dealership owned by an officer in that
department to a paint dealer to a friend of that businessman.
</P>
<P>
   That friend, according to law-enforcement authorities in
Washington, is the person who sold the Glock in early 1998 at a gun
show in Spokane, Wash. That city is near Hayden Lake, Idaho, the
town that serves as the home enclave for the Aryan Nations and
other white supremacist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, gun collectors and others who do not have
federal firearms licenses can legally sell guns at gun shows _ and
they are not required to do background checks on buyers, as gun
stores must. The disclosure that the gun used by Furrow to kill the
letter carrier, Joseph Ileto, was bought from such a vendor may
restart a stalled debate in Congress over whether buyers at gun
shows should first undergo background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Senate passed a bill requiring that all
dealers at gun shows, including the 40 percent who do not have
federal licenses, conduct background checks on customers, allowing
three days for completing those checks. The House defeated such
legislation, which was also opposed by the National Rifle
Association as too restrictive, and the issue has remained a
political flashpoint between lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Furrow was the person who bought the
Glock 9-mm pistol early last year at the Spokane show.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Chester, a spokesman with the Seattle office of the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the agency still had not
determined how Furrow had acquired the Glock pistol or six other
weapons, including an Uzi assault-style submachine gun, that were
recovered from a car he had hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chester said Furrow may have recently traded for some
of those guns using others he had acquired while he was a federally
licensed firearms dealer between 1992 and 1995. Chester said there
were ``indications'' that some of those trades had occurred after
this May when Furrow was released from jail and was prohibited from
owning firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Michael Haymon of the Aberdeen, Wash., police department
said that when ATF agents came to that town on Thursday to
interview the man said to have sold the Glock at the gun show, they
found that the man and his wife were on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow had to acquire the weapon between January and October
1998 or after this May, because he spent the intervening time in
jail for threatening to stab a nurse at a psychiatric hospital. He
had gone to the hospital for help, saying he was having fantasies
of committing a mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   In a criminal complaint filed on Wednesday in Los Angeles,
federal officials said Furrow had confessed to killing Ileto, who
was of Filipino descent. Furrow described Ileto as a good ``target
of opportunity'' because he was ``non-white'' and worked for the
federal government, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Ileto on Tuesday came soon after Furrow had
sprayed a Jewish day center in Los Angeles with gunfire from an Uzi
assault-style machine gun. Five people were wounded in that attack,
including three children.
</P>
<P>
   More evidence emerged Friday that Furrow had spent considerable
time planning the Los Angeles attacks in a city that he apparently
knew little about, prompting some to wonder if he had help from
other conspirators, one of the major unanswered questions this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center here said that
police told him they had found maps in Furrow's possession on which
he had circled the Wiesenthal center, as well as other Jewish
sites, as potential targets for his attack. The Los Angeles Times
said that one of the other sites was the Skirball Cultural Center,
a complex next to the Getty Museum that is dedicated to Jewish
culture. Police would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The gun used to kill Ileto, which bore the serial number BSM901,
was one of two Glock model 26 guns that were purchased in January
1996 by the police department in Cosmopolis, Wash., from Glock
Inc., the Atlanta-area distributor for the Austrian gun producer.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Eisenhower, chief of police in Cosmopolis, a town of 1,600
near the port city of Aberdeen, said in an interview Friday that
the weapons were bought by his predecessor, Donald Lapacek, to
determine whether they were suitable for police work.
</P>
<P>
   After it was determined that the guns were too small, the
department swapped them for larger Glock models at Don's Guns, a
federally licensed gun store in Cosmopolis then owned by Donald
Dineen, a reserve officer in the town's police department.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dineen said he was with Eisenhower when police
in Cosmopolis were reached Wednesday by ATF agents tracing the
Glock 26. Dineen said he recognized the gun's serial number and
recalled that he had sold it to an area resident in February 1996
soon after getting it from police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun went to a local resident,'' said Dineen. ``Someone
I've known for 14 or 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dineen declined to disclose that person. But both Eisenhower and
Haymon said that person was Dave Wright, who works at the House of
Colors, a family-run paint store in Aberdeen.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief telephone interview, Wright would only say that he
had given all his ``information'' when interviewed by an ATF agent.
</P>
<P>
   Those Seattle-based agents had arrived Thursday in Aberdeen to
interview Wright and a friend, Andy Palmer, said Haymon. He said
that Wright had told the ATF agents that he had given Palmer
several guns including the Glock to sell at a Spokane gun show in
early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Haymon said that when authorities tried to contact Palmer's wife
on Thursday they were told that she and her husband had just left
on a week's vacation. Palmer's telephone number is unlisted.
</P>
<P>
   Dineen, the former firearms dealer, also said that the person
who had bought the gun from him, Wright, had said that he had given
it to a friend, Palmer, to sell at a Spokane gun show. He said
Palmer worked as a food broker and was a gun enthusiast, adding
that he did not believe he had a federal firearms license.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a gun dealer, he is a collector,'' Dineen said.
</P>
<P>
   John D'Angelo, an ATF spokesman, said the only record that the
agency has for a licensed dealer named Andrew Palmer is for the
operator of a pawn shop in Bainbridge, Ga.

   Senate and House lawmakers on a conference committee that is
expected to hammer out new gun control legislation are scheduled to
start that work when they return on Sept. 7 from a monthlong
congressional recess. In early August, when the conference
committee met, the lawmakers postponed any decisions, meaning that
the enactment of any new restrictions on firearms will not take
place until after most schoolchildren return to classes. The
nation's latest round of debate over gun control started in April
after two teen-age gunmen at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., killed 12 students, a teacher and themselves.

U.S. HOUSE MEMBERS' SEATS TO GET EXTRA LAYER OF SECURITY AT
CAPITOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When members of the House return from their summer
recess Sept. 8, they all can claim to have safe seats, even if they
are in trouble politically.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are installing bulletproof seat backs in all chairs on
the House floor, replacing flat metal plates inserted about 15
years ago after a Capitol bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The new material, a heavy fabric, is less likely to produce
ricochets and more likely to absorb or safely deflect bullets,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol police declined to give details about the seat-back
project but said it is among several new security measures at the
Capitol, including installation of better metal detectors, alarm
systems and surveillance cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just an ongoing security enhancement taking place,''
said Dan Nichols, spokesman for the Capitol Police. ``That's about
as far as I can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved $106 million last September for improved
security, including the addition of 240 new officers, after a
Capitol shooting left two officers dead. The shootings were in
hallways, not in the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   House officials would not disclose the cost of the seat-back
project because it is security-related. It is not part of the $106
million appropriated by Congress, Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many House members knew they had
bullet-resistant plates in their chairs in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know it,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Lexington, Mo.,
who is ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. ``We sit
around a lot waiting for votes. You'd think someone would have said
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitol police ordered the new material inserts at the request
of the House sergeant-at-arms, officials said. The material also
can be used in bullet-proof vests, furniture, vehicles and walls
and is intended to either trap bullets or have them fall to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Jeffries, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, said
he was unaware of the project but that it would have come with
Hastert's approval at the request of the sergeant-at-arms.
</P>
<P>
   There are 448 seats on the floor, 435 for House members. They
are attached in semi-circular structures, unlike the 100 individual
swivel chairs in the Senate. Several officials said they did not
think Senate chairs had bulletproof backing, but that could not be
confirmed because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials said it is highly unlikely anyone could get
into the House or Senate galleries with a gun because visitors have
to pass through metal detectors at the Capitol entrance and again
before entering the galleries.
</P>
<P>
   But the bullet-proof seat backs would provide cover on the
chance someone did open fire, as occurred on March 1, 1954, when
three Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire from the gallery and
wounded five members of the House.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants reportedly yelled out, ``Freedom for Puerto
Rico,'' as they fired 30 bullets from the House gallery. About 200
House members were present when the shots rang out. Bullets
splintered chairs and desks and chipped plaster from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Emerson of Missouri, who later became a congressman, was
chief page at the time of the shooting. Years later, he often told
the story of the shooting while giving House tours, said Jeffries,
who worked for Emerson from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He heard some pops and everyone started to duck,'' Jeffries
said. ``He said one bullet breezed over his head and lodged in a
marble column in the corner of the chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   House Parliamentarian Charles Johnson and former House Historian
Ray Smock said the metal plates were installed not after that
attack but after a bomb exploded in a second-floor Senate hallway
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was if someone started firing you could dive under
the seats and at least you'd have some metal protection,'' Smock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 19th century, guns and bombs were less of a threat
than other items visitors brought to the House and Senate
galleries, said Don Ritchie, associate historian for the Senate.
Even a horseshoe was a potential weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``During some heated debates, especially before the Civil War,
they had a number of cases where people threw objects, and one of
them was a horseshoe,'' Ritchie said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie said House and Senate members often carried guns
themselves. In 1835, Vice President Martin Van Buren regularly wore
a pair of pistols while presiding over the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In one celebrated incident during debate on the Compromise of
1850, Sen. Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri faced the gun barrel of a
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Henry Foote of Mississippi got mad at Benton during the
debate and pulled a pistol on him, Ritchie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other senators sort of grabbed Benton's arms and Benton
yelled out, `Let the assassin fire,' '' Ritchie said. The fracas
ended without a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only occasion when a pistol has been pulled on the
floor,'' Ritchie said. ``At least by a senator.''

SOME IN MISSOURI WONDER ABOUT POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT ON IOWA
NEIGHBORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHANY, Mo. _ Thirty miles away, voters will board buses today
for an event that could knock presidential contenders out of the
race. An army of journalists will eagerly await results.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse Jean Nichols if she's not excited.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols thinks the election is important. Unfortunately, she
lives in Bethany, on the wrong side of the political tracks.
</P>
<P>
   As global attention turns to the Iowa Straw Poll in Ames, some
voters in northern Missouri are viewing their neighbors with a bit
of envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have trouble getting any national candidates to this
county. That doesn't seem right,'' said Nichols, who leads the
Democratic committee in Harrison County. ``We vote and we have
things to say, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's straw poll is not an official vote, but Republicans can
register their support at the Ames rally. Candidates are scrambling
to position themselves behind frontrunner Gov. George W. Bush, and
analysts expect the poll to weed out some of the lowest finishers.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a quirk of a nominating process in which small states
such as Iowa and New Hampshire wield a lot of clout. Missouri, for
its part, moved its primary up to March to secure greater influence
in the national election process.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents complain that Bethany doesn't get the attention
received in Kansas City and St. Louis. Or even Lamoni, Iowa _ 30
miles north.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Bethany and Lamoni appear similar.
</P>
<P>
   Both are tranquil towns just off Interstate 35 with fewer than
3,000 residents. Their downtowns are dotted with small hardware
stores, barber shops, cafes and brick post offices just off the
town square.
</P>
<P>
   In both towns, you'll hear the same political dialogue about tax
cuts, Social Security, health care and the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   But Lamoni voters get to tell presidential hopefuls how they
feel.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Vice President Al Gore spoke in Lamoni at Graceland
College's commencement. He outlined his plan for education reform,
including shrinking class sizes and improving teacher quality.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander, a Republican candidate, was recently in Lamoni
to shake hands. He bought a quilt from Yesterday's Treasures
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Lamoni area has been host to candidates such
as Paul Simon, Pat Robertson, Michael Dukakis, Richard Gephardt,
Bruce Babbitt, Gary Hart, Morris Udall and George McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   The attention is enough to make some Bethany residents wistful.
</P>
<P>
   In a Wednesday column titled ``Those Lucky Iowans Have All the
Fun,'' Phil Conger of the Bethany Republican-Clipper lamented that
Mamie Eisenhower was the only national figure he could recall
visiting Bethany.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a political junkie like I am, you would also get a
little green-eyed thinking about a place like Iowa being hip-deep
in presidential contenders and reporters from the national news
media,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the big news in Bethany wasn't politics but the
relocation of the town library and the search for a new high-school
band director.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said she thinks Bethany residents would take greater
interest in government if they could meet the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But William Russell, a political science and history professor
at Graceland College, said that isn't necessarily the case.
</P>
<P>
   Although dozens of Lamoni residents will board buses for Ames,
most residents haven't paid much attention to the straw poll, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocks me how little many Iowans appreciate or take
advantage of their opportunity to do the major sorting of the
candidates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bethany residents say Iowa's prominent role doesn't bother
them.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Shelby, who leads the Harrison County Republican committee,
said he expects candidates to pay closer attention to Missouri once
the fall campaign begins. Missouri is considered a critical ``swing
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Hensley, part of a coffee klatch that meets at
McDonald's almost every day, agreed that Bethany voters shouldn't
worry.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he speculates that the Senate race between incumbent
John Ashcroft and Gov. Mel Carnahan will put Missouri on the
national political map.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we might get as much attention as Iowa and we
might get more,'' Hensley said. ``They can have their fun for
now.''

can now climb to their little hearts' content at the revamped LL
Bean store in Freeport. Such attention to image is meant to counter
plateauing sales at L.L. Bean, which does not publish a financial
statement but says it sold just over $1 billion worth of gloves,
parkas, kayaks, skirts, pillow shams, knapsacks and bathing suits
last year. (Herb Swanson/New York Times Photo) LITE

</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Just eight months after it started an ambitious
satellite telephone service that promised to communicate ``with
anyone, anytime, virtually anywhere in the world,'' Iridium LLC has
filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had been delinquent on a $90-million interest
payment and in default on more than $1.5 billion in bank loans,
said Friday that it was seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
while trying to reorganize its finances and attract new customers.
</P>
<P>
   The move came after weeks of intensive negotiations with
creditors broke down. A large group of bondholders filed a petition
in federal court Friday to force Iridium into involuntary
bankruptcy and speed up talks. Hours after the petition was filed,
Iridium filed for bankruptcy in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium, with heavy backing from Motorola Inc., the
telecommunications and semiconductor giant, has spent more than $5
billion to build a global communications system with 66
low-orbiting satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its global satellite service will continue to
operate even as executives attempt to come up with a plan that
would satisfy its creditors and the bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium now faces its ultimate test: it must restructure a huge
debt load, regain the confidence of its investors and find a way to
bolster sales of a satellite telephone service that many say is
outdated, outmoded and unpopular with consumers. If the company
cannot adequately restructure its debt and find a market for its
product, investors stand to lose billions of dollars. The worst off
would be shareholders, who would be paid last.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the company _ which have been plummeting for months
after it failed to attract heavy subscriptions _ were halted at
midday Friday after reports of the bankruptcy filing. Iridium had
declined $1.1875, to $3.0625, before NASDAQ halted trading. Shares
of Motorola, which owns an 18 percent stake in the company, makes
its equipment and operates its satellites, rose $5.25, to $93, in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the filing, executives at Iridium and its prime
benefactor, Motorola, continued to voice optimism about the
company's future, insisting that its satellite and telephone
technology is sound and that there is worldwide demand for its
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly a business that's going to flourish,'' said
John Richardson, the chief executive of Iridium, which is based in
Washington. ``The phone is working incredibly well. There is a
great deal of pent-up demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which has invested heavily in Iridium and guaranteed
more than $750 million in bank loans, said it would continue to
support the company and participate in the restructuring talks.
Executives say they believe Iridium will reorganize itself and then
build up sales as a set of new and more attractive satellite
telephones come to market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is not liquidation. This is an opportunity for Iridium to
seek protection from its creditors and restructure,'' said Scott
Wyman, a spokesman for Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill.
``Our hope is that Iridium can be successful if it restructures.''
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Iridium Corp. of Japan, the second largest investor in
the venture after Motorola, also said Friday that it supported the
company's effort to revamp itself by filing for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, however, have been highly critical of
Iridium. They say the company's product introduction last November
was a flop. There were technical glitches, phones did not work, a
huge marketing campaign that fared poorly, and customers complained
about huge, brick-sized telephones that were costly and failed to
work indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They launched a service but consumers didn't want a big,
clunky phone,'' said Walt Piecyk, an analyst at Paine Webber.
``Cellular telephone rates have gotten really cheap, and there's
just not a demand for their services.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Iridium and Motorola disagree. There is a new
management team in place, they say, and many changes have been made
to refocus the company. Richardson, who took over as chief
executive last April, says the company introduced its product too
early _ before the technology, marketing and distribution were
ready. And instead of using equity, the company saddled itself with
a huge debt load that made a blockbuster startup a necessity if the
company was going to keep up with interest and dividend payments.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the company has lowered its prices
significantly, from $3,000 to $1,500 and subscriber rates have
plummeted from $5 a minute to about $2.99.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company's focus is on restructuring. Investors have
offered to put up an additional $400 million to $600 million,
Richardson says. The company has the cash to operate for some
months, but it must move quickly to remove the ``clouds of
uncertainty'' that are preventing the company from making progress,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 days, Iridium hopes to restructure its debt, and if it
is to be a viable company, the company says it would have to make
substantial progress in increasing revenue by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the bankruptcy filing was triggered by the
company's failure to make good on its interest payment this week
and not a response to the bondholder filing earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had not concluded a financial reconstruction and we had no
other alternative but to file,'' he said. ``This process gives us
the breathing room we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Geczi, a spokesman for Weil, Gotschal &AMP; Manges, the law
firm that filed the bankruptcy petition on behalf of a group of
bondholders who represent about two-thirds of the more than $1.4
billion in debt, said their filing Friday came after talks with
Iridium had stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this was the way to get the process moving,'' Geczi
said. ``To the extent that their filing gets us there, we view that
as a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   To stave off liquidation, however, Iridium is going to have to
move quickly even as it competes against other satellite telephone
technologies. The company has failed to meet subscriber targets,
and though it says new equipment will resolve some of those
questions, many analysts believe the debt load is too huge to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders have already turned sour. Iridium went public in
1997, rose as high as $70 a share in May 1998 and has since
plummeted to penny-stock status, giving the company a market value
of about $60 million with a multibillion-dollar debt load.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a grand vision to make a phone call anywhere in the
world,'' said Jeremy Diamond, the publisher of Grant's Interest
Rate Observer. ``But at the end of the day the product didn't
overwhelm the market. It was like an Internet stock, it held all
the promise of making fortunes but it didn't happen.''

COWBOYS KICKERS MULL NEW RULE ON GAME BALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ They've beaten 'em with baseball bats,
baked 'em in ovens, washed 'em and tumble-dried 'em.
</P>
<P>
   They've kicked 'em, dropped weights on 'em, rubbed 'em down,
even soaked 'em in Carnation instant milk. NFL kickers book for
young kickers:]probably have more than 101 ways to break in
footballs for optimum performance.
</P>
<P>
   That's for the history books now. Beginning this season, the NFL
prohibits players from handling game balls during the week before
the game. Before the change, kickers for each home team were in
charge of breaking in game balls, usually to the specifications of
their quarterbacks, as well as their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would bring them in the racquetball court \Rat Valley
Ranch\S and kick them around in there,'' place-kicker Richie
Cunningham said. ``It's just a matter of wear and tear on the ball
and breaking the seams in and breaking the leather in. Whichever
way was best in doing that, that's what people would do. Everyone
had their own technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many techniques, NFL officials felt. The theory goes that
some kickers who play with quarterbacks who don't mind using a
roughed-up ball would hold an advantage over kickers whose
quarterbacks prefer a newer, or at least a less worked-in football.
So the NFL now requires a new football be used for every punt,
kickoff and field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like making a shortstop play with a brand new glove,''
Cowboys kicking coach Steve Hoffman said. ``It will make for a lot
less touchbacks and a lot fewer 57-yard field goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Which seems to be at least part of the NFL'splan. If Toby Gowin
can't boom every kickoff out of the end zone then there should be
more returns, more opportunities for highlight footage. If Gowin
can't produce five-second hang times, perhaps opponents will have
fewer fair catches, more returns and better field position.
</P>
<P>
   you have to be more consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   As Cunningham said: ``The sweet spot has been shrunk.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is griping among some]Some NFL kickers gripe that
their already-tenuous jobs were just made more difficult, others
say the playing field is now level. Hoffman, who says he likes the
rule, believes using a new football will reduce a field-goal
kickers range 5 yards, maybe more. It could cut Gowin's hang time
from five seconds to 4.6 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Kickers who play in cold-weather cities wince at the notion that
the playing field is indeed level. Footballs already carry poorly
in cold temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys kicking up in Green Bay and Cleveland and those
places, it's going to be tough on them,'' Cunningham said. ``One
thing us kickers do when we get ready to start the season is we
look at the schedule and see where the games are, because, I can
tell you, it makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The preseason should be enough to at least compare old vs. new
in moderate conditions and give coaches an idea if they need to
re-evaluate their philosophies on when to attempt long field goals.
</P>
<P>
   After one exhibition game, Cunningham and Gowin have yielded
little change. Gowin punted twice for an average of 47.5 yards
against Cleveland, surpassing his average of 43.4 yards last year.
His net average of 36.0 after one exhibition game nearly matched
his 1998 net average of 36.6.
</P>
<P>
   In one field-goal attempt, Cunningham made a 49-yarder. Last
season, Cunningham made 10 of 11 field-goal attempts from 40 to 49
yards, missing from 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go through a preseason and see if there is an effect. If
not then we've cried wolf,'' coach Chan Gailey said. ``We'll know
at the end of preseason if we need to change our thinking.''

BUSH CONFIDENT IN IOWA, DESPITE RIVALS' QUIPS ABOUT HIS INFREQUENT
VISITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IOWA-CONSERVATIVES) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANOLA, Iowa _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush swept into the home
of Bob and Shirley Lester in this town amid the cornfields of
central Iowa on Friday night to partake in a tradition of
presidential politics in this state: one-on-one campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush expressed confidence that he would continue to steam-roller
toward the Republican presidential nomination by meeting
expectations and triumphing in a straw poll Saturday sponsored by
the Iowa Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Standing with his wife, Laura, on the front porch of the
Lesters' house, Bush said, ``I hope you can join Laura and I to
send a message that I'm the right guy.'' He added, ``I'm running
with one thing in mind _ I'm running to become the next president
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush's visit here, though a common exercise for presidential
candidates, was relatively uncharacteristic of him. On his
high-profile first trip to Iowa, Bush had vowed to take his
campaign to every front porch of the state. But since then, he has
largely stayed clear of front-porch-style political events, while
most of his rivals have traversed the state for months, if not
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made little time for answering questions from ordinary
citizens at town meetings. And he has not yet even traveled to some
important sections of Iowa, including Council Bluffs on the state's
western border across the Missouri River from Omaha in one of the
state's larger media markets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush has stuck to his stump speech _ and has done
little to endanger his monumental lead in the polls and in
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Bush has campaigned in Iowa nine days since June 12,
when he announced that he would participate in the straw poll.
Almost every other candidate has been here far more times. In the
same period, for example, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and
publishing magnate Steve Forbes have been here nearly three dozen
times.
</P>
<P>
   While some acknowledge it may be wishful thinking, virtually
every one of Bush's rivals made it clear that they hoped the
governor's flouting of the Iowa tradition will ultimately cost him
with the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take up with Governor Bush why he passed up these
opportunities to talk with interested Republican activists,''
Forbes told reporters. ``I'm delighted to get our message out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest entrant to the presidential race, Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R- Utah, said: ``I've been here more days that George W. Bush. But
we only got in a few weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who has been here more than any candidate, groused,
``The rewards this year seem to go to those who avoid meeting with
the activists, who drop in the Des Moines airport two or three
times, rent a bale of hay and pretend they know Iowa _ and who say
they'll wait until next year to speak out on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle said: ``Sooner or later, the
American people are going to demand a discussion of the issues.
Maybe it's wishful thinking that we'll focus on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gary Bauer, the former head of the Family Research Council,
weighed in, saying that Republicans were disappointed because of
``the few times the governor actually shows up and takes
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday night what he thought of his opponents' criticism,
Bush said his campaign had gotten a late start because he had not
ventured out of Texas until the state Legislature adjourned at the
end of May. ``I have been working very hard in the state of Iowa.
We've had fantastic crowds, and we'll see what happens tomorrow.
We'll see whether or not in the limited amount of time I had to
come to Iowa that we have done what's necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director, explained that the
governor does not favor town meetings. ``We've chosen to have
community receptions where he can visit with people one-on-one,''
Ms. Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McKinnon, Bush's media consultant, who was looking for
footage for future commercials here Friday night ``if the light
gets good,'' said the rap was unfair. ``He's been to Iowa more than
he's been anywhere else.'' He added, ``There's still a lot of time
left _ and a lot of porches.''

IRWIN CHASING SNEAD, MORE MEDINAH GLORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Hale Irwin shimmied in his chair, mimicking the
moves he watched Payne Stewart make in the driver's seat of his
courtesy car before yesterday's round.
</P>
<P>
   Curious, Irwin tapped on the window to get Stewart's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He opens the door, and this music just knocks me over,'' Irwin
said. ``I don't know what it was, but it wasn't quite the Mamas and
the Papas or Elvis Presley or any of the stuff I'm used to. I like
all music, unless it's something that hurts my ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, 54, laughed as he shared the story. Just as he chuckled
when someone asked about 19-year-old playing partner Sergio Garcia
and he responded: ``You mean my grandson?''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, the 600-pound gorilla of the Senior Tour, clearly has
relished his underdog status this week at the PGA Championship. But
he reached a crossroads yesterday at Medinah Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the front-runners on the leader board after 36 holes,
Irwin (5 under par) can no longer be viewed as a courtesy inclusion
to the field because he won the last major championship played at
Medinah, the 1990 U.S. Open. Instead, he must be considered a
serious threat to break Sam Snead's record as the oldest winner in
PGA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
   Snead won the 1965 Greater Greensboro Open two months before his
53rd birthday. Irwin, competing at the PGA on a special exemption,
turned 54 on June 3.
</P>
<P>
   In yesterday's second round, Irwin threw down a 3-under 69,
dusting a pair of whippersnappers in his group _ Garcia and Phil
Mickelson (29) _ by four and three strokes, respectively. It marked
Irwin's second consecutive sub-par effort on the 7,401-yard layout,
the longest ever for a major championship played at sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the oldest player in the field is four strokes off the
lead at a course where he won in 1990 and finished third at the
1975 U.S. Open. And he's starting to think he can do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sit up here and tell anybody that I expected
to play like this,'' said Irwin, who has won five times in his past
nine starts on the Senior Tour, albeit on courses that usually are
700 yards shorter than Medinah. ``In my heart, I hoped to and
wanted to. But it's not always the easiest thing to do, especially
in an environment in which you're not terribly accustomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was Irwin, watching Garcia blast 3-woods past his
drives and wincing when Mickelson selected 7-irons from lies where
he would hit 4-iron. Through it all, Irwin has compensated by
keeping his shots out of Medinah's heavy rough while offsetting
seven birdies with just two bogeys through two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly impressed Mickelson, who said Irwin ``would still be
winning a tournament a year if he played on our tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin isn't so sure. But he sounds ready to make a run at
Snead's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hadn't entered my mind until the last few minutes,''
Irwin said after completing his round. ``And I won't give it much
thought. But I am pleased with how I played. I don't want to go
backwards and say I can't continue that. Just the opposite. I know
this course, and I've had success here.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he could make history here as well.

BRUINS BEGIN SHORT-HANDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was an offseason of emotion and tension,
headlines and investigations. But for UCLA, nothing symbolizes the
tumult as crisply as not having a preseason depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. With 12 players suspended and several others
injured, coach Bob Toledo doesn't have enough experienced bodies to
list a starter and reserve at each position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall not having a depth chart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven starters and four reserves are suspended for two games for
the handicapped parking fiasco. Another, Audie Attar, is out for
fighting. Add the quarterback quagmire, the kicking question and
the retirement last spring of three veteran reserves, and Toledo is
so desperate he may let tailback DeShaun Foster and receivers Danny
Farmer and Freddie Mitchell play both ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might use them at defensive back in passing situations,''
Toledo said. ``That's a real possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   With practice beginning today, here's a look at the positions
most affected by the suspensions:
</P>
<P>
   Defensive back: Two starters (safety Ryan Roques and cornerback
Marques Anderson) and one reserve (safety Eric Whitfield) are out.
That makes Jason Bell's return from heal surgery essential. Bell
doesn't have full strength and will practice on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready to go,'' said Bell, who was UCLA's most
dependable cornerback last season. ``I'm just taking it slow and
doing everything I can to get my strength back.''
</P>
<P>
   The other cornerback is anyone's guess. Sophomore Julius
Williams, red-shirt freshmen Lovell Houston and Joe Hunter, and
true freshman Ricky Manning will compete for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Stephens is solid at one safety, but the other spot is
wide open until Roques returns.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker: The projected starters, Ryan Nece, Tony White and
Ali Abdul Azziz, have been suspended; so has top reserve Robert
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Santi Hall temporarily has been moved to outside
linebacker. Reserve Billy Pieper probably will start on the other
side. And Ed Stansbury, who has not played a down at linebacker
after switching from quarterback last year, is expected to start in
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've labeled this my coming-out year,'' Stansbury said. ``Last
year, I gave myself time to learn the position. This year, I'm
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Two rookie linebackers probably will play. The top candidates
are prep All-American Marcus Reese; the Ball twins, Matt and Eric,
who have moved from defensive end; and unheralded recruit Asi Faoa,
who looks the part at 6-4, 240 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line: Starting guard Oscar Cabrera and reserve guard
Jim Ghezzi are out.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for the Bruins to start two red-shirt freshmen, Mike
Saffer and Blake Worley, sophomore Troy Danoff and seldom-used
senior Matt Phelan.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo does not want to play his true freshmen, Shane Lehmann
and Bryce Bohlander, but he may not have a choice if injuries
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we won't have to use either,'' Toledo said.

THE QUIET MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE KANSAS EVOLUTION CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVEN, Kan._ A couple of miles from Harold Voth's house, an
Amish woman in a long, plain dress and sunbonnet sits with three
small children in an open horse-drawn carriage.
</P>
<P>
   To some passers-by, the antiquated rig and the people in it
might be a curiosity. They seem out of place next to the
fast-moving cars and trucks on the four-lane stretch of Kansas 96.
</P>
<P>
   With a single vote this week on evolution, critics are accusing
Voth, elected last year to the Kansas Board of Education, of taking
Kansas back to the horse-and-buggy era and making the state a
national curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   In the struggle to adopt new science standards for Kansas
students, this 70-year-old retired school superintendent on
Wednesday became the sixth and deciding vote that deleted the
concept of macro-evolution from the state's recommended curriculum
beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the soft-spoken man from this hamlet between Wichita
and Hutchinson was being sought by television networks and
newspapers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   At home, his vote was being condemned by his education
supporters, including Gov. Bill Graves, and praised by his
political enemies, including the conservative Republican he
narrowly defeated in last summer's party primary.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy, something Voth has largely avoided most of his
life, was swirling around him, and he wasn't enjoying the
intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang and a woman on the other end told Voth, ``I
always thought Kansans were hicks, and now you've proved it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Voth, a tall, thin man with a passion for growing giant
watermelons, just shrugged off such criticism with a quiet,
understanding smile.
</P>
<P>
   This was a decision he agonized over for months. Now he was at
peace.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks he had worked with two conservative board members to
come up with a compromise between their anti-evolution position and
evolution supporters in academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped to make people only half mad, but I guess no one's
happy now,'' said Voth, who will become board chairman next year.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, he was considered a political moderate. He
replaced Wanda Morrison, a Hutchinson Republican who had held the
7th District board seat for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison decided not to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The board had been split between five conservatives and five
moderates.
</P>
<P>
   With Robin Jackson, a math and science teacher at a private
Hutchinson Christian school, campaigning to take Morrison's place,
teachers active in the National Education Association and political
moderates became alarmed. Jackson could tip the scales in favor of
the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   They needed a champion and turned to Voth.
</P>
<P>
   At first he refused. After all, he was trying to retire _
something he found difficult. For 28 years he had served the small
school district of Haven as its superintendent. Then three nearby
school districts asked him to fill in temporarily until they found
permanent superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   Voth, a Mennonite, was called again when the education
establishment faced the prospect of a Jackson victory. He had been
elected to the Hutchinson Community College board of trustees, a
prestigious job, and was considered a civic leader and pillar of
the community.
</P>
<P>
   Voth won the election by 29 votes, but Jackson, a former
chemist, wasn't bitter. The two remained friends, and Jackson
advised Voth during the evolution debate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when evolution supporters said students would be at
a disadvantage without the concept in the standards, Jackson
reviewed questions on ACT tests and found no reference to
evolution, information she passed along to Voth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat down with him and he listened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said she doesn't object to the teaching of evolution as
a theory. But she and other conservatives said the state board was
being asked to adopt this theory as fact, and they refused to go
that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not religion vs. science,'' she said. ``It's truth vs.
untruth. I think Harold is someone with a clear-cut idea of right
and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of those who supported him in the last election said
his vote disappointed them.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was Sherri Yourdon, a high school counselor in the
Nickerson School District in Reno County and a Kansas-National
Education Association board member.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt he ran as a moderate and would continue the GOP view
that Wanda Morrison did,'' she said. ``I thought he'd support the
(science) committee better than he did. It's really kind of a slap
in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yourdon said that as an educator, she understood his desire
to find a compromise. To remain a superintendent for almost 30
years, she said, Voth would have called on such skills many times.
</P>
<P>
   Yourdon said the Haven-Yoder-Mount Hope area is composed of very
conservative, religious people and that Voth's vote is a reflection
of that area.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Voth has gotten out of bed at 5:30 a.m. and driven
six miles to the Carriage Crossing Restaurant in Yoder for coffee
and conversation. After Wednesday's vote, he made the morning drive
and was greeted with handshakes and people saying, ``Thank you for
voting for the compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Voth said he was able to make his decision without worrying
about the politics. He doesn't plan to run for re-election when his
term expires in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't the easy route,'' he said. ``I was expected to
vote for a deadlock.''
</P>
<P>
   But Voth said those who believe this vote would end evolution
instruction will be disappointed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the same teachers, the same textbooks,'' he said.
``How much change are you really going to have?''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, he drove to his garden near Partridge to tend to
the large watermelon he hopes to take to the Kansas State Fair this
year. Two years ago, he grew a melon that weighed 174 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   This year's melon has suffered from the weather and his absences
while serving on the board. He'll have to work harder to get a
champion this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a reputation to uphold,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frugality has never been my problem. I've always made enough to
cover my rent or mortgage. I pay my bills on time. I've never been
in serious debt. And yet, compared with my parents, I'm a
spendthrift.
</P>
<P>
   I leave lights on in my Manhattan apartment. I'm a sucker for
the service economy: trainers, housekeepers, tennis pros. And every
time I buy an absurdly expensive suit, pay too much for dinner or
spring for an unnecessarily fancy hotel, I feel guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Not guilty enough not to blow $2,000 on a cool '60s-modern
credenza, but guilty enough to resolve to be more cost conscious in
the future. So I take the subway instead of a cab and think I'm a
hero _ until the next bout of buyer's remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a deeper kind of fiscal self-examination is called for.
So I got in touch with the authors of ``Invest in Yourself: Six
Secrets to a Rich Life'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1998) and offered to
subject myself to the ultimate humiliation: a frugality audit.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Marc Eisenson, Gerri Detweiler and Nancy Castleman,
the book's 328 pages blend self-help of the simple-abundance school
with hard-core financial belt-tightening tips and complicated
charts. Reading it you become convinced you could become a
millionaire by paying an extra $50 a month on your mortgage or by
buying used cars.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to cast a cold eye on my platinum card bill? A
frightening idea. There are things on those statements I don't even
want to admit to myself, much less expose to complete strangers.
</P>
<P>
   We traded e-mails. Eisenson and Ms. Castleman, a happily
unmarried couple for 19 years, live together on a farm in Red Hook,
N.Y., and publish a quarterly newsletter called the Pocket Change
Investor, which they describe as a guide to ``living better on
less.'' They wanted me to visit their bucolic paradise of organic
vegetables. But I felt that to be appropriately appalled by my
decadence, they needed to spring for train fare to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they made a series of requests. Information
about my monthly mortgage payment, which was recently doubled by
the purchase of a summer house, and my 401(k) situation. Phone and
utilities bills. Checkbook. A 1998 tax return.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Detweiler, for many years the director of a consumer group
called Bankcard Holders of America, asked me to keep a ``spending
diary,'' accounting for every penny I shelled out over a week. Ms.
Castleman and Eisenson wanted me to think not just about money but
about quality of life issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not financial planners,'' Ms. Detweiler e-mailed me.
``We're more `life style' planners, geared toward helping you
create more of the life you want on any income (not just when your
portfolio reaches a certain level and you can `retire').'' She
added, ``Where are you investing your time and energy well, and
where do you seem to fall short? What kinds of changes have you
been putting off because of money?''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I thought but didn't write back, if I had a lot of extra
time, I'd be using it. Changes? I'd buy a grotesquely huge house in
the Hamptons and spend my days by the pool ordering gimlets from my
houseboy!
</P>
<P>
   Defensive? Of course. Anything to avoid thinking too hard about
such things.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Invest in Yourself'' trio continued bombarding me with
subliminal frugality messages.
</P>
<P>
   From Ms. Castleman, re lunch: ``Are you by any chance allergic
to sunflower seeds?! (I usually use them in my pesto because
they're a lot cheaper than pine nuts, and we can't tell the
difference.)''
</P>
<P>
   How's anyone supposed to enjoy an overpriced bowl of pasta under
this kind pressure?
</P>
<P>
   The lunch date rolled around and the three of them showed up at
my apartment with a bowl of sunflower pesto in hand. Eisenson has a
long gray beard and the look of someone who checked out of the rat
race _ in his case, an electrical contracting business _ a long
time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Natural, R. Crumb's aging cartoon hippie? That's
Eisenson, only, it turns out, with a sense of humor and a savant's
skill at crunching numbers in his head. Ms. Castleman is wearing
the same sandals she wore to Woodstock in 1969. Literally. Ms.
Detweiler, who is about 20 years younger than her co-authors, lives
outside Washington, D.C., wore a suit and evinced a little less of
the converts' zeal than her collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   As we sat down to salad from Ms. Castleman and Eisenson's Red
Hook herb garden _ served in a bowl purchased for $1 in 1970 _ I
asked how long it took to grow the tomato we were eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 1,000 hours of labor,'' Eisenson said. ``That's a $50
tomato.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was why I mentioned it. If your time is worth X dollars an
hour, is it worth spending the time for less than that amount of
money in savings? Eisenson offered a sort of zen reply: ``There are
times when our time should be worth nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't going to win that argument, so I told them I needed a
car. I've never minded not having one, but with the new house, it
seemed to be a necessity. There comes a time in every man's life _
like at age 37 _ when he should stop having to borrow his
girlfriend's parents' Land Rover.
</P>
<P>
   They scoffed at the notion of leasing. ``Like buying your
grandfather a rented tuxedo and burying it,'' Ms. Detweiler said.
Eisenson contended that ``most millionaires drive used cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they started with the scare tactics, presumably based on a
careful scrub of my financials. ``If you bought a car, you could be
really tight,'' Ms. Detweiler said. ``It wouldn't take much to
upset the apple cart,'' Ms. Castleman added darkly.
</P>
<P>
   OK, forget the car. I wanted to get back to the stuff I misspend
money on right now, not hypothetical future squanderings. First, I
demanded a kitchen inspection. My bottle of Pellegrino was the
first subject of ridicule _ something wrong with New York City tap
water? _ then a box of funghi porcini in the cupboard. ``I can go
out into the woods and pick these,'' Eisenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Castleman moved on to my air conditioner, set at a
refreshing 65 degrees. ``It's nice out!'' she scolded.
</P>
<P>
   After our meeting, I was inundated with e-mails from Red Hook
alerting me to the 23 percent savings I could enjoy on my electric
bill if I turned the air-conditioning up to 72 degrees, 44 percent
if I went up to 78 degrees. Sure. I could probably
(italics)make(end italcs) money on the deal if I pushed the thing
up to 85 degrees, but I might die of heat prostration.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that I pay bills the day they arrive, take the
subway to work, eat in more than out, they looked disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're much too frugal,'' Eisenson said.
</P>
<P>
   I knew better. I've always spent too much money on clothes. When
I was in high school, my mother used to mock my vast collection of
shirts. So I compared notes with Eisenson on our polo shirts: my
neo-retro rayon J. Crew that has to be dry-cleaned, $65; his
secondhand Gap, five cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You paid $65, but really it cost you $100,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating the ``real'' cost in earned income is one of the
book's simplest and most useful suggestions. Always factor in what
taxes take out _ in my case, around 30 percent. At this rate, to
pay for a $14,000 car you have to make $20,000. Now figure out how
long it takes you to make that $20,000. Sobering.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   What makes the authors nuts, on the tax front, is the idea that
you should spend money to get a deduction. ``Every dollar you spend
in the hope of saving 30 cents is costing you 70 cents,'' Eisenson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still desperate to prove my profligacy, I handed over my latest
Visa statement. They studied it as if it were some ancient
parchment, full of cryptic words and incomprehensible numerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Mikimoto?'' Ms. Castleman asked, her eyes widening at
the accompanying charge.
</P>
<P>
   It's a jewelry store, I mumbled tentatively. Anniversary
earrings.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenson offered an alternative ``gifting'' philosophy: ``Take
over a chore your mate hates and let that be the present.''
</P>
<P>
   That was when I realized we were living in different worlds:
theirs and the real world of my girlfriend, who requires baubles
that can be either shown off or exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   I bid my guests farewell with promises to send them more
complete financial documentation of my paycheck-to-paycheck
existence and to keep a spending diary for Ms. Detweiler to review.
</P>
<P>
   I started the week of June 28:
</P>
<P>
   Monday: Forget completely.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: Subway ($1.50), oatmeal from company cafeteria (85
cents), cafeteria lunch ($6.60), ``American Pie'' (free press
screening), wine for a friend's sendoff ($12.98). Total: $21.93.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: More of the same, with some cabs, drugstore products
and $27.85 worth of developed pictures thrown in. Total: $77.80.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: Host Canada Day party ($79.87 for beer and bacon and
maple syrup), my housekeeper ($60), plus a bunch of other stuff,
like two pairs of Adidas running shoes ($119). Total: $295.22.
</P>
<P>
   Friday: Housekeeper again, for post-party cleanup ($20), stamps
at Mailboxes Etc. ($6.90), CD holder from The Wiz ($8.62), gas
(20.09), and _ the clincher _ (italics)returned(end italics) stuff
to Bed, Bath and Beyond (-$37.87). Total: $38.99.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of Ms. Detweiler's exercise, which even she agrees is
incredibly tedious, is to show you what you think you spend money
on versus what you actually spend money on. I think you're supposed
to be surprised at where it all goes. I had the opposite reaction.
I was amazed at how little I spend and resolved to live a little
better from now on. That 85 cents for oatmeal seemed sadly
Dickensian.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, I got an e-mail from Eisenson and Ms.
Castleman breaking down some savings options. Dump the health club,
to which I hardly ever go (saving $1,000 a year). Mow my own lawn
($2,340 a year). Buy cheaper and fewer clothes ($600). Raise the
temperature (Con Ed wouldn't give them figures on that one). Buy
cheaper wine ($520).
</P>
<P>
   Each dollar amount was accompanied by a ``what you'd have to
earn'' amount: $1,538 for the health club, $3,600 for the lawn guy.
How they arrived at some of these numbers I'm not entirely sure,
but I got the point.
</P>
<P>
   I could be more frugal.
</P>
<P>
   It made me think about my late father, who considered my mother
a reckless spender, even though she was known as the thrifty one
among her friends. They both came from comfortable upper
middle-class backgrounds. But she had lived through the Depression,
in Canada, and he through the Spanish Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Both had seen that it was possible to have everything taken away
in a trice and I always figured that was why they saved all those
bits of old string. He would do things like measure the amount of
water in the kettle before boiling it.
</P>
<P>
   My mother still mails me back uncanceled American stamps from
Canada, so that I can re-use them. They litter my apartment, like
tiny rebukes to my wasteful ways, until I finally get around to
soaking them off the old envelope paper and gluing them on a new
one.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weekends ago I went to my first warehouse club, a
hangar-sized temple to frugality called B.J.'s on Long Island. On
the way in I silently disdained all the people rolling giant
flatbed carts piled high with toilet paper and frozen swedish
meatballs toward the 800-items-or-less cash register. On the way
out, I had filled two of those carts myself. Grand total: $531.47.
But the important thing was how much I (italics)saved.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   By substituting sunflower seeds for pine nuts, Nancy Castleman's
pesto recipe may offend culinary purists. But for the frugal
gourmet, it is one more way to save.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Castleman and her co-author and companion, Marc Eisenson,
figure they consume a pint of sunflower pesto weekly, and thus 6.8
pounds of sunflower seeds a year. At the health-food store where
they shop in Rhinebeck, N.Y., the seeds cost 99 cents a pound,
versus $10 a pound for pine nuts. So their annual saving, on a
nut-for-nut basis, is $61.27 a year.
</P>
<P>
   By Ms. Castleman's calculations, the pine nut premium would cost
an extra $94.25 in pretax dollars. But opting for sunflower seeds
and investing the savings for 25 years at an average 8 percent
return would yield $4,855.78 _ an impressive harvest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NANCY'S PESTO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From www.investinyourself.com Time: 10-15 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   20-25 cloves (5 heaping tablespoons) chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sunflower seeds
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   6 cups well-packed basil leaves (more or less). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Traditional recipes have you use a mortar to pound, or
pestare, the ingredients _ thus the name of the dish. It goes a lot
faster with a food processor or blender.
</P>
<P>
   2. Either way, combine the garlic and sunflower seeds with the
oil and honey, and a little of the water. Gradually add the rest of
the water.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add the basil, 2 cups at a time. Process until everything is
well blended.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 cups of pesto.

MONETARY AND SPIRITUAL RICHES IN 6 STEPS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Part hard-nosed advice about personal finance, part touchy-feely
self-help, ``Invest in Yourself: Six Secrets to a Rich Life''
argues that for readers who can learn to shave a few cents here, a
few dollars there, monetary and spiritual riches await. For anyone
too frugal to buy the book, here, in summary form, are the authors'
``secrets'':
</P>
<P>
   MAKE YOUR OWN LIFE-STYLE DECISIONS Besides return on investment,
consider time, energy _ even fantasies _ as equally manageable
assets in your portfolio. That might mean downsizing from a
two-income household to a one-income one, say by moving to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   PUT YOUR FAMILY FIRST Your love for your family isn't judged by
how much you can buy them. The book quotes Paul Tsongas, the late
Massachusetts senator: ``Nobody on his deathbed ever said, `I wish
I'd spent more time at the office.'''
</P>
<P>
   BE IN BUSINESS FOR YOURSELF Jobs are no longer secure. Think of
yourself as a consultant, not an employee. Freelance on the side.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR TAKE-HOME PAY To paraphrase Ben Franklin:
A dollar saved is $1.40 you'll never have to earn, assuming a 28
percent tax bracket. Wealth is having slightly more than you need;
poverty is having slightly less _ so adjust accordingly. When you
are about to buy something, ask: If I didn't need it yesterday, why
do I need it today?
</P>
<P>
   TURN YOUR DEBTS INTO INVESTMENTS A typical $100,000 mortgage
costs $250,000 over 30 years. Prepay $25 more a month and you'll
save more than $20,000 in interest. Paying down credit card debt
returns the equivalent of as much as 20 percent on a taxable
investment, which beats the Street.
</P>
<P>
   MAP OUT YOUR OWN FINANCIAL FUTURE Don't adopt financial habits
just because they're popular. For example, college is not a
parental tithe; think of it as the six-figure investment it is.
Likewise, determine how much you really need for retirement, not
what planners want you to invest. Consider a working retirement.
Touch the nest egg; you don't have to end up with a big estate.

HOLLOWED-OUT BOOKS COULD OPEN YOU UP TO ROBBERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do they have a deal for you!
</P>
<P>
   Preying on fears that banks won't be ready for Y2K, mail order
firms are peddling hollowed-out books in which consumers can stash
cash they withdraw from their banks.
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau believes that, in at least some
cases, the books may be robberies in the making. Many of the
companies are unknown and have no track record, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that produce these `book safes' ship them directly
to the customer's home,'' according to the bureau. ``Once shipped,
these companies have each purchaser's address and are able to
easily keep tabs on who has cash stashed in their homes. Thieves
can then be sent out to steal the customer's cash, because they
know exactly where the money is hidden _ on the book shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one of several Y2K ripoffs that Better Business Bureau
offices have heard of around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In one scam, a caller claiming to be a government employee tells
senior citizens they will not get their Social Security checks
after the first of the year, and their paper money will be no good.
The scammer tells senior citizens to turn all assets into paper
money and mail it to him so he can convert it into gold and mail it
back. ``Of course, the con artist keeps all the cash,'' the bureau
said.
</P>
<P>
   And here's yet another age-old scam with a Y2K twist:
Replacement magnetic strips for your credit card. The typical
scammer will offer to make your credit card Y2K ready by sending
you a new magnetic strip for your charge card. But first, you must
forfeit your card number.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau and the federal government have published brochures
to alert consumers to such scams:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Year 2000, Your Bank and You,'' is available at
{www.fdic.gov} or by calling 1-800-934-FDIC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year 2000 and You'' is available at
{www.bbb.org//library//y2k.html} or by writing the CBBB Publication
Fulfillment Department, 4200 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va., 22203.
</P>
<P>
   ``The BBB's brochure will help consumers and businesses alike to
recognize the most common Year 2000 scams and to take proactive,
common sense steps to protect against problems that might arise
from Y2K,'' said James L. Bast, president of the Council of Better
Business Bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet also offers some good advice regarding financial
records, generators and stockpiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carefully evaluate offers for Y2K resource//survival//disaster
kits,'' the bureau said. Kits, which are being sold for $299 plus
$22 shipping, provide toothpaste, flares, flashlights, pancake mix,
emergency candles, chili, bleach, aluminum foil, Kool-Aid and Spam.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer can ``easily build your own kit for around $50,'' the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Dave Higgins and Ken Orr of Topeka said they got
tired of reading all the silly things being said about the Year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly it struck us like a wet marmot,'' the two wrote in
the introduction to their new Y2K quote book. ``Let's feature
stupid quotes on the Web and give away a prize for the stupidest
one we find! We had no idea what a deep well we had stumbled
into.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest competition, Kansas City's own Teresa Loar,
co-chairwoman of the Mid-America Regional Council's Y2K Elected
Officials Task Force, got a Duh Award under the heading, ``Stupid
Politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   We quoted her as saying she did not plan to make any special Y2K
preparations at home: ``I seldom plan an hour ahead, anyway,'' she
said. Yet City Councilwoman Loar also said she expected that there
might be ATM glitches and traffic-signal snarls. She was nominated
by five readers from across the country, Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   You can read all the goofiness at {www.duh-2000.com}. To
nominate an item for the Duh-2000 contest, e-mail the quote (just
not any of ours) and the Web address citation to
{contest &LR; duh-2000.com}
</P>
<P>
   The person submitting each month's winning quote receives a free
six-pack of HeaterMeals, a pre-cooked and sealed shelf-stable
entree that heats itself, plus a copy of the quote book.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Connolly, chief operating officer of the Boston Federal
Reserve, says the government may consider upping its Y2K cash
cushion by $20 billion to provide a ``super abundance'' of currency
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other federal regulators say they sense Y2K is
less of a concern than at this time last year. So far, no banks
have sought extra cash because of Y2K concerns, said Rose Pianalto
with the Federal Reserve in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Reserve officials keep $150 billion in cash on
hand, but because of Y2K they said earlier this year they would
boost that amount by $50 billion.
Calls continue to flood the federal government's Y2K call center
since it opened its doors in a two-story brick building in the
Appalachian foothills of Cumberland, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The government's Federal Information Center has added 60 phone
lines just for Year 2000 queries. The special number _
1-888-USA-4Y2K _ logged 134,439 calls from Jan. 7 to June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The center has one mission: ``We want to provide the facts to
the public, and our reading of the facts is that the public should
be calmed,'' said manager Stephen Smith. Hot-line staffers advocate
personal preparedness, storing a couple weeks' worth of food and a
little spare cash.

OFFICIALS MONITORING CONDITION OF BABY GORILLA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON -- Officials at Zoo New England are anxiously watching
the development of a baby gorilla, the first one ever born at its
Franklin Park Zoo, after its mother recently started showing signs
of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo personnel this week were quietly celebrating the arrival of
the 4-pound baby and were pleased that the newborn gorilla and
mother Kiki were progressing well following Sunday's dramatic
birth.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials had hoped to begin exhibiting the baby gorilla to
the public this week but have delayed plans until they are sure it
will survive. Until then, the zoo is keeping the baby gorilla under
wraps and no photos or public viewing will be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday afternoon, Kiki and the four other adult gorillas
at the park contracted a common gorilla illness _ diarrhea. If the
illness spreads, it could endanger the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's caused by a protozoan that is very common in apes and
when they get stressed it causes diarrhea,'' said Dr. Hayley
Weston, chief veterinarian. Changes in the gorillas' routines, such
as the addition of the baby to the troop, can be stressful and
cause the ailment to flare up, she said. ``We started medication,
decreased the stress, we're cleaning up as soon as possible so that
it won't spread and now we're just going to sit back and wait and
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the adult gorillas have been placed on a 10-day course of
medication. The baby gorilla, whose sex is still unknown because
workers have not yet had an opportunity to get close to it, shows
no signs of illness and doctors are cautiously optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the dehydration that we're worried about. Any newborn
that gets diarrhea is'' life-threatened ``because its body mass is
so small that it can get dehydrated,'' Weston said. ``I don't think
that we'll have to step in, but if the baby got sick enough and the
mom couldn't keep her strong we step in . . . put fluids in her and
get her back quickly to her mom.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the 17-year-old western lowland gorilla and her
baby had been doing fine since Kiki gave birth without
complications around 11 p.m. in a gorilla holding room.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials, an outside veterinarian and an emergency response
team of human doctors have been on standby for weeks in case she
experienced problems in childbirth or required a caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to interrupt the bonding process, zoo workers have
not approached the baby to determine the sex and haven't yet
selected a name.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials were concerned that Kiki, who was ``hand-raised''
by humans as a baby, would not have mothering instincts and would
reject the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a hand-raised female you will often have the
biggest difficulty,'' said Dan Beetem, the zoo's curator of
mammals. ``It could be that she could not know a way to love (the
baby) or that she would not be able to find a breast to nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   But the normally 230-pound gorilla has apparently taken to
motherhood splendidly, according to Weston, who said Kiki was
``certainly a success story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiki's a really good mother, very nurturing, very gentle. She
cradles it all the time. I don't think she's put it down yet,''
Weston said. ``She strokes it and kisses it and inspects the
fingers and toes. We thought she'd be a good mom and she is
definitely showing her mothering instincts.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the zoo staff actually demonstrated mothering
behavior for the gorilla to mimic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a baby doll that one of the keepers would carry around
and carry like a gorilla for a few months off and on and the
horticulturist's wife (who recently had a baby) would actually
breastfeed so that Kiki could see. She came in twice a week so for
a few months and Kiki was very interested in the whole thing. She
wanted one of her own,'' Weston said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the gorillas at the zoo are western lowland gorillas, an
endangered species found in western African countries. There are
about 700 of them in captivity in the world, about 365 of them are
in zoos in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki and the gorilla father, Kit, are considered ``genetically
valuable'' under a process called the Species Survival Plan. The
SSP is a way to coordinate breeding with endangered species _ a
kind of computer dating service to pick compatible gorillas.
Because they are very social animals and there are so few in
captivity, we are ``trying to prevent inbreeding,'' Beetem said.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki, who was born at the Bronx Zoo, is on loan from the
Philadelphia Zoo. The father, Kit, was a gift to the Franklin Park
Zoo from the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're turning the corner. We've been pushing for many years to
have a gorilla birth and we haven't had one in 16 years and that
was at Stone Zoo,'' said John Linehan, Zoo New England's vice
president of living collections, who has been at Franklin Park for
18 years. ``We've had males brought here (for breeding) who didn't
work out. We've finally achieved one of our goals.''

MAN WHO SOUGHT EXECUTION CHANGES MIND
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ After arguing for nearly four years in New
Jersey courts in favor of his own execution, a convicted murderer
has reversed himself and told his lawyer to appeal his death
sentence in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The condemned prisoner, John Martini, 69, changed his mind
earlier this week, about six weeks before his scheduled execution
by lethal injection on Sept. 22, his court-appointed lawyer, Alan
L. Zegas, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' Zegas said of Martini's decision. ``He was
always very emphatic about it. As time progressed, he became more
determined to submit to execution.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Zegas said, the fast-approaching execution date and pleas
by the Catholic chaplain at Trenton State Prison and the 14 other
inmates on death row there prompted Martini to drop his wish for a
speedy execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, what everyone had talked about in the
abstract had become real for him,'' Zegas said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Martini acceded to the admonitions of the prison
chaplain, Sister Elizabeth Gnam, and his fellow inmates on death
row to continue appealing his death sentence, Zegas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their feeling was once the first person is executed, it makes
it easier to execute the next,'' Zegas said, recounting the
explanation Martini gave Wednesday during their meeting at the
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gnam ``very much wanted him to live,'' Zegas said his
client told him.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not spoken to Sister Gnam about Martini
abandoning his desire for a speedy execution. Chris Carden, a
spokesman for the corrections department, said Sister Gnam did not
want to discuss her conversations with Martini.
</P>
<P>
   Martini began seeking a speedy execution in late 1995 in New
Jersey Superior Court here. The state Supreme Court rejected his
request in 1996 and ordered that the appeals that were filed
against Martini's wishes by the New Jersey public defender's office
proceed routinely through the state court.
</P>
<P>
   Martini had barred any federal appeals after his case was
resolved in the state court system. On July 27, the state Supreme
Court rejected the public defender's final appeal for Martini. A
few hours later, in a ruling that surprised the state Department of
Corrections, Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Gaeta, who sits in
Hackensack, set an execution date for Martini _ Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Martini was sentenced to death for the 1989 kidnapping and
murder of a Bergen County businessman, Irving Flax, of Fair Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when his appeal came before Gaeta, Martini testified
that he viewed execution as a form of absolution for his murder of
Flax. Psychiatric tests found Martini mentally competent.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeals since then, Zegas, who opposes capital
punishment, has argued that Martini's wish for execution should be
granted based on constitutional rights of privacy and religious
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But judges focused instead on that contended Martini did not
receive adequate legal representation in his murder trial because
the trial jury never heard evidence that might have convinced them
to sentence him to a life in prison instead of death.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court rejected the final appeal in July. At
Martini's insistence, state judges have sealed the evidence and
kept it confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Friedman, an assistant public defender, said Friday he
planned to meet with Martini at the Trenton prison on Monday to
confirm that he has changed his mind, and then ask the state
Supreme Court to postpone the execution. Then, he said, he plans to
start an appeal in U.S. District Court. ``If this pans out, we'll
be nothing short of thrilled,'' Friedman said.

GRAF TAKES STARTLING, BUT UNDERSTANDABLE, STEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ The women's tennis tour came to this
seaside town with Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport juggling the
No. 1 ranking _ and got upstaged Friday by somebody half a world
away in Heidelberg, Germany. That somebody, an all-time somebody,
was Steffi Graf, who startlingly said that's all, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Far from washed up, but _ she said _ nonetheless finished, Graf,
whose swift and relentless legs carried her to a 1988 Grand
Slam-plus Olympic gold, and 22 major titles, is
uncharacteristically walking to the nearest exit. She is walking at
the tender, though physically and mentally battered, age of 30.
</P>
<P>
   Steffi wouldn't be the first of her breed to proclaim retirement
(e.g. Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Margaret Court) and then
reappear, homesick for the road, and to win more championships.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubting Fraulein Forehand's sincerity of the moment.
But if she sticks to her announcement, Friday will be remembered,
in the words of 27-year-old rival Arantxa Sanchez Vicario as, ``A
very sad day for the game. And for me. I feel very bad about it. I
can't believe it. Steffi was playing so good, winning the French,
in the final at Wimbledon. I can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the year of hail and farewell for the gods: Jordan,
Elway, Gretzky, Sanders, Becker. And now Graf.
</P>
<P>
   She always played with the vivacity of the girl I first spied at
Flushing Meadow in 1983, on a back court, beating up on another
junior. She was a rookie pro, flying at balls with bloodthirsty
eagerness to bruise them beyond recognition, especially with that
distinctive bludgeon of a forehand.
</P>
<P>
   Steffi dealt with each point as an opportunity not to be missed.
She couldn't wait for the next, the next, and the next, moving
between them like somebody late for the last bus.
</P>
<P>
   But, she says, ``After Wimbledon (a 6-4, 7-5 title bout loss to
Davenport), for the first time in my career, I didn't feel like
going to a tournament. To make sure, I went to San Diego (last
week) and I felt it right away. It's time to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably didn't help that a strained left hamstring caused
Steffi to surrender in her first start following Wimbledon to No.
26 Amy Frazier, 4-6, 7-5, 2-1. That was her ninth loss of the
season against 33 wins, the last of a 17-year career during which
she batted .886 _ 902-115 with 107 singles titles _ and was the
universe's No. 1 a record eight years between 1987 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Graf should have traveled with the guys from MASH. She prevailed
over more wounds than St. Sebastian, played hurt so often. Her
heart was so big that you thought she had two of them. She drove
herself as if she were a mule team. ``I'd have to drag her off the
practice court at times when she shouldn't have been out there at
all,'' says her longtime coach Heinz Gunthardt.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she says it wasn't the injuries, the constant
rehab, and the frustrating layoffs that convinced her to quit. The
fun was gone. And Steffi felt that there was no way to eclipse her
French Open victory over Hingis. It was a victory that punctured
Graf's normal reserve, opening a teary floodgate.
</P>
<P>
   A primadonna, no doubt, cool and wary, she was a stoic's stoic,
finding sanctuary in a tennis rectangle, a haven from the emotional
storms created by her wayward father, Peter Graf. A court was her
safe house where she could do what she loved most and did best,
without having to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving at No. 3 _ ``on her own terms as an all-time singles
player,'' says Billie Jean King _ Graf combined supreme athleticism
with dauntless desire. That and her fearless thrusts with the
finely sliced backhand and the mother of forehands kept her among
the elite, the top 10, for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   She was debatably the finest to flap a racket. Certainly she's
unique in winning all four majors at least four times _ seven
Wimbledons, six French, five US, four Australian _ to wind up two
behind Margaret Court's record total.
</P>
<P>
   For me she's in the top five ever, a list headed by Martina
Navratilova.
</P>
<P>
   Graf feels her final major triumph, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 over Hingis
two months ago in Paris, was her magnum opus. Though magnificent,
it didn't quite measure up to two masterpieces against Sanchez
Vicario, the 1995 Wimbledon final (4-6, 6-1, 7-5) and the 1996
French final (6-3, 6-7, 10-8).
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many memories to feast on. The goddess-to-be's
first title, Hilton Head in 1986, came at the expense of another
goddess, Chrissie Evert, 6-4, 7-5, from way behind in the second.
Evert, winner of their first six encounters, said, ``She's gonna be
hard to stop now.'' Chrissie couldn't in seven more tries.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hall of Famer, Tracy Austin, remembers Graf's
professional debut in 1982. ``Stuttgart. I was on the other side of
the net. Steffi was 13 and about this thin,'' Tracy holds up one
finger, ``but she was hitting the ball so hard. I wondered, who is
this? I beat her, but I knew we'd be hearing from her.''
</P>
<P>
   So we have. Hearing no more? The comeback sirens will sing, and
I for one hope they catch her ear.

 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the early morning Friday, New York time, came word
that Steffi Graf was announcing her retirement from tennis after 17
years.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Graf's decision caught the tennis world by
surprise. She was scheduled to play at the U.S. Open later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open, the loud tennis center of the world, would have
been a fitting place for a send-off. Yet Graf's announcement, made
from distant Germany, was appropriate. When you think of Graf, the
word that keeps coming to mind is precisely that: distant.
</P>
<P>
   Graf was the opposite of her countryman Boris Becker, who
endeared himself to fans with exuberance and smiles, dancing and
joking. Graf was never the minstrel; she didn't dance, didn't smile
a lot, pandered to neither the news media nor fans. Steffi Graf was
tough.
</P>
<P>
   The fitting final snapshot of her career occurred in July after
her final match at Wimbledon, where she had won seven
championships. This would be Graf's last hurrah. Other players
might have bowed, or blown kisses, or, at the very least, waved.
Not Graf.
</P>
<P>
   In typical fashion, after her loss to Lindsay Davenport in the
final at Wimbledon, Graf _ knowing she would not play there again _
walked off Center Court without a wave to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Through so many trials and tribulations, when her business and
her family's business were so mercilessly put on the street, Graf
learned that fans are consumers. They consume news. They consume
gossip. And they will consume celebrities if allowed. Graf chose
not to be consumed. She steadfastly maintained a chilly distance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Graf became the second-youngest player to enter the WTA
tennis ranking. She was 13. Friday, Graf's voice cracked
intermittently as she explained her decision to leave.
</P>
<P>
   She was walking away because the thrill was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weeks after Wimbledon weren't easy because, for the first
time, I wasn't feeling pleasure or joy,'' Graf said.
</P>
<P>
   Her legacy in tennis as a player is phenomenal: 22 Grand Slam
tournament titles, two fewer than Margaret Court's record of 24.
Graf is one of only three women to win more than 100 tournaments,
collecting $21 million in prize money, and she was ranked No. 1 for
a record 377 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her seven Wimbledon titles, she also won four
Australian Opens, six French Opens and five U.S. Open titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toughness in the big points, toughness in dealing with the
injuries, that's what Steffi Graf is all about,'' Tracy Austin, a
two-time U.S. Open champion, said.
</P>
<P>
   Graf's legacy as an advocate for women in tennis is far less
certain, though. The pillars of the game, Billy Jean King, Martina
Navratilova and Chris Evert, rebuffed a young Graf instead of
nurturing her. In hindsight, Evert admits they may have hurt Graf
and, ultimately, may have hurt women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we let Steffi slip through the cracks,'' Evert once
said. ``But I was a little turned off by some of the comments to
the press. She said her only responsibility was to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf's narrow focus on tennis allowed her to survive when her
world off the court was in shambles. There were several episodes.
In 1990, German newspapers made public the rumors of her father's
extramarital affair with a model and other personal problems he
reportedly had. Finally, there was the investigation into her
father's handling of her finances and tax affairs, which resulted
in his receiving a jail sentence in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable part of Graf's legacy is that,
through all the turmoil, she won. She won precisely because her
sanctuary was tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that keeps me playing now comes from inside,'' Graf
once said. ``The will to be as good as I possibly can. The outside
things are not my reasons to keep on. I've got so much money, so
many endorsements and offers, and I've been No. 1 since I was 18
years old. Really, I've had it all already. But the tennis itself,
I know I can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of her career, Graf maintained a distance and kept her
innermost self to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Graf extricated herself from tennis after 17 years and
from incalculable tears. She is free to pursue joy, live life
wherever and in which ever way she chooses, free of rackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to enjoy the privilege of having time to do the
things I haven't had time to do before,'' Graf said, ``and discover
what I want to do with the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffi Graf is retired. Finally, the chill is gone.

Youth served in Garcia, but senior Irwin has moment
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Hale Irwin competed in his ninth PGA
Championship four months before Sergio Garcia was born. Irwin, 54,
also had won two of his three U.S. Open titles before El Nino was
even El Bebe.
</P>
<P>
   But kids these days . . . they have no grasp of history.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Garcia, 19, was asked what he thought of Irwin after
they had played the second round of the PGA together and Irwin had
bested the precocious Spaniard by four strokes, producing a 3-under
69 on the vast Medinah track he has been tearing up for almost a
quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was a great player,'' Garcia said. ``I didn't know
he was that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the tournament _ Irwin's 85th major as a pro and
Garcia's third _ they are four shots behind leader Jay Haas, 45.
Garcia also was asked which was the more impressive feat: a
teen-ager in contention or a codger?
</P>
<P>
   That answer the kid got right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both,'' Garcia said, winking.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin has been the recent scourge of the Senior Tour, winning
five of the last nine tournaments he has entered and sharing third
place in two, including the U.S. Senior Open. But those successes,
worth almost $1.6 million, haven't come on courses such as Medinah,
at 7,401 yards the longest to host a major at sea level.
</P>
<P>
   And the intensity level of the competition on the flat-belly
circuit is just slightly more intense than Irwin has encountered of
late. Senior golf is a gravy train, a final dash for some easy cash
for the nifty 50s such as Hale. Irwin admits when he watches Garcia
pulverize a golf ball he realizes the two of them are playing a
vastly different game.
</P>
<P>
   And Garcia's is one with which he remains barely familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young people now come out, and they hit the ball
full-out and blast away and go for it, and they're very straight,''
Irwin said. ``It's an awesome thing when you have the controlled
power they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to do something else along the way to make up for
that. When I'm comparing my distance with Garcia and (Phil)
Mickelson, those two specifically, I can't compete. Still, my irons
are pretty good. I keep the ball in play. I make a putt every now
and again. I control my game and get the most out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these young guys, they're hitting shots with irons I can't
even begin to contemplate, which is why I'm over where I play. I'm
hitting 4-irons where they're hitting 7-irons. That gets your
attention very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, as physically gifted for his age as anyone who ever
picked up a 4- or a 7-iron _ the Bear and the Tiger included _
doesn't know enough about golf to realize what questions he should
ask a Hale Irwin when he spends four hours in close proximity.
Mostly, they made small talk, Garcia said. Such as?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really important,'' he said. ``We were talking about
clubs (as in Pings, not nightspots), those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Their worlds are as vastly different as their games. After all,
Irwin's two children are much older than Garcia, who happens to be
the same age as Haas' caddie's son. Hale said he has little
recollection of what it felt like to be 19. But he's certain he
didn't feel like Garcia does, self-assured and convinced of his
lucrative future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I played in two or three tournaments a summer,'' Irwin
recalled, ``I felt lucky between working on a construction job for
eight hours a day and playing a little golf at a daily-fee golf
course. The difference between these kids coming out now vs. when I
was 19 is just light-years. I pretty much learned how to play golf
on the tour. My game was held together with gum and sticks. I see
far more composure with these players and more experience. I'm not
painting an `oh, poor guy' picture. It's just the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But what separates golf from most other sports is that a
54-year-old and a 19-year-old can line up side by side and, using
their respective assets, chase the same prize. Irwin's length might
be ill-suited for Medinah, but his reservoir of knowledge is an
equalizer. He finished third in the 1975 U.S. Open here, then drew
on that success to win the '90 Open.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia bullied the real estate into submission Thursday,
fashioning a 66. It counterpunched Friday when his putter betrayed
him intermittently.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's 69, meanwhile, was accomplished with a gentle caress. He
stayed within himself and kept to a minimum his, uh, senior
moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to perform at this level,'' Irwin said, ``I'm very
pleased with that. I don't want to sit up here and tell anybody
that I expected to play like I did today. In your heart you hope to
and you want to, but it's not always the easiest thing to step into
an environment with which you're not terribly accustomed.''
</P>
<P>
   El Nino could be Hale's grandson, making it clear neither should
be where he is today, pursuing a major golf championship. But
that's golf. Brains and brawn count the same.

SUMITOMO SUES J.P. MORGAN FOR ROLE IN COPPER DEBACLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan)  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., one of the most prestigious banks
in the nation, has been accused of lending at least $535 million to
a copper trader in the mid-1990s whose trading binge inflicted $2.6
billion in losses on Sumitomo Corp., one of Japan's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   The information was disclosed in a lawsuit by Sumitomo that was
unsealed Friday evening in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
Sumitomo filed the suit earlier in the week, seeking $735 million
in compensation from Morgan for its role in the trading scandal,
which came to light in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Corp. and UBS AG of Switzerland have also been
sued recently by Sumitomo in connection with the scandal. Chase
purportedly lent the trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, about $500 million,
according to that suit, which Chase has contested.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan, which prides itself on being one of the country's
most cautious lenders, is the only bank to have been singled out by
U.S. regulators for its role in the scandal. In 1997, the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York reprimanded Morgan for lax controls and
supervision in its commodities lending business, largely because
Morgan was more financially dependent on Sumitomo as a client than
other banks.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Golden, a Morgan spokesman, declined to comment on the
amount of money his bank lent Hamanaka, but he described Sumitomo's
suit as ``meritless'' and said the bank intended to ``contest the
allegations vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is a leading provider of the complex financial
instruments known as derivatives and has been an aggressive
advocate of looser regulatory controls over the lucrative products.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan structured the loans to Hamanaka as derivatives, which
allowed him to account for them as trades rather than simple loans
_ a move that may have allowed him to borrow money more freely.
</P>
<P>
   Hamanaka was Sumitomo's star copper trader and earned the
moniker of ``Mr. 5 Percent'' for the portion of the copper trading
market he was believed to have controlled. He built up a huge
position in copper with the aid of more than $1 billion lent him by
U.S. and other banks. When copper prices moved against him,
Hamanaka incurred the huge losses that Sumitomo absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hamanaka was sentenced in Japan to eight years in
prison for forgery and fraud. Sumitomo has received heavy fines
from U.S. and British regulators because of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Morgan's loans to Hamanaka were
approved by the bank's risk committee, which was aware that the
amount of money Morgan was lending to the trader was unusually
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.P. Morgan, in one series of transactions alone, loaned
Hamanaka roughly $535 million disguised as complex derivatives
transactions,'' Sumitomo said in a statement released Friday night.
``When those transactions came due, Hamanaka was secretly forced to
pay J.P. Morgan almost $1.2 billion to satisfy the debt _
representing an effective interest rate of 150 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``J.P. Morgan knew, or should have known, that Hamanaka lacked
the authority to engage in such transactions _ transactions which,
on their face, were completely unrelated to Hamanaka's normal,
authorized copper transactions and were plainly usurious loans
provided for the sole purpose of supporting Hamanaka's illicit
copper trading,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Morgan executives, including Keith
Murphy, a managing director, courted Hamanaka enthusiastically in
the early 1990s as the bank tried to expand its metals business.
The executives, according to the suit, portrayed Morgan as a worthy
partner because ``the credit risks involved in the kinds of very
large transactions for which Hamanaka was known could be
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who is also named as a defendant in the suit, resigned
from Morgan in the wake of the scandal. His current whereabouts
could not be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said that an e-mail from one Morgan executive to a
colleague in 1993 stated that ``the most important element'' in the
bank's relationship with Hamanaka was ``confidentiality.'' The suit
contends that Morgan took this promise to a ``ridiculous and
unlawful extreme by actively assisting Hamanaka in his efforts to
keep his transactions with J.P. Morgan hidden not only from the
outside world, but from Hamanaka's own superiors within Sumitomo.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Glock semiautomatic pistol that Buford O. Furrow Jr. used in
his confessed killing of a mail carrier, after shooting five people
at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles, was sold last year by
an unlicensed vendor at a gun show near the north Idaho compound of
the Aryan Nations, the neo-Nazi group to which Furrow belonged,
according to interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The path of the Glock model 26, which was sold new by Glock in
1996 to a small police department in eastern Washington state, ran
from the department to a gun dealership owned by an officer in that
department to a paint dealer to a friend of that businessman.
</P>
<P>
   That friend, according to law-enforcement authorities in
Washington, is the person who sold the Glock in early 1998 at a gun
show in Spokane, Wash. That city is near Hayden Lake, Idaho, the
town that serves as the home enclave for the Aryan Nations and
other white supremacist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, gun collectors and others who do not have
federal firearms licenses can legally sell guns at gun shows _ and
they are not required to do background checks on buyers, as gun
stores must. The disclosure that the gun used by Furrow to kill the
letter carrier, Joseph Ileto, was bought from such a vendor may
restart a stalled debate in Congress over whether buyers at gun
shows should first undergo background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Senate passed a bill requiring that all
dealers at gun shows, including the 40 percent who do not have
federal licenses, conduct background checks on customers, allowing
three days for completing those checks. The House defeated such
legislation, which was also opposed by the National Rifle
Association as too restrictive, and the issue has remained a
political flashpoint between lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Furrow was the person who bought the
Glock 9-mm pistol early last year at the Spokane show.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Chester, a spokesman with the Seattle office of the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the agency still had not
determined how Furrow had acquired the Glock pistol or six other
weapons, including an Uzi assault-style submachine gun, that were
recovered from a car he had hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chester said Furrow may have recently traded for some
of those guns using others he had acquired while he was a federally
licensed firearms dealer between 1992 and 1995. Chester said there
were ``indications'' that some of those trades had occurred after
this May when Furrow was released from jail and was prohibited from
owning firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Michael Haymon of the Aberdeen, Wash., police department
said that when ATF agents came to that town on Thursday to
interview the man said to have sold the Glock at the gun show, they
found that the man and his wife were on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow had to acquire the weapon between January and October
1998 or after this May, because he spent the intervening time in
jail for threatening to stab a nurse at a psychiatric hospital. He
had gone to the hospital for help, saying he was having fantasies
of committing a mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   In a criminal complaint filed on Wednesday in Los Angeles,
federal officials said Furrow had confessed to killing Ileto, who
was of Filipino descent. Furrow described Ileto as a good ``target
of opportunity'' because he was ``non-white'' and worked for the
federal government, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Ileto on Tuesday came soon after Furrow had
sprayed a Jewish day center in Los Angeles with gunfire from an Uzi
assault-style machine gun. Five people were wounded in that attack,
including three children.
</P>
<P>
   More evidence emerged Friday that Furrow had spent considerable
time planning the Los Angeles attacks in a city that he apparently
knew little about, prompting some to wonder if he had help from
other conspirators, one of the major unanswered questions this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center here said that
police told him they had found maps in Furrow's possession on which
he had circled the Wiesenthal center, as well as other Jewish
sites, as potential targets for his attack. The Los Angeles Times
said that one of the other sites was the Skirball Cultural Center,
a complex next to the Getty Museum that is dedicated to Jewish
culture. Police would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The gun used to kill Ileto, which bore the serial number BSM901,
was one of two Glock model 26 guns that were purchased in January
1996 by the police department in Cosmopolis, Wash., from Glock
Inc., the Atlanta-area distributor for the Austrian gun producer.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Eisenhower, chief of police in Cosmopolis, a town of 1,600
near the port city of Aberdeen, said in an interview Friday that
the weapons were bought by his predecessor, Donald Lapacek, to
determine whether they were suitable for police work.
</P>
<P>
   After it was determined that the guns were too small, the
department swapped them for larger Glock models at Don's Guns, a
federally licensed gun store in Cosmopolis then owned by Donald
Dineen, a reserve officer in the town's police department.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dineen said he was with Eisenhower when police
in Cosmopolis were reached Wednesday by ATF agents tracing the
Glock 26. Dineen said he recognized the gun's serial number and
recalled that he had sold it to an area resident in February 1996
soon after getting it from police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun went to a local resident,'' said Dineen. ``Someone
I've known for 14 or 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dineen declined to disclose that person. But both Eisenhower and
Haymon said that person was Dave Wright, who works at the House of
Colors, a family-run paint store in Aberdeen.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief telephone interview, Wright would only say that he
had given all his ``information'' when interviewed by an ATF agent.
</P>
<P>
   Those Seattle-based agents had arrived Thursday in Aberdeen to
interview Wright and a friend, Andy Palmer, said Haymon. He said
that Wright had told the ATF agents that he had given Palmer
several guns including the Glock to sell at a Spokane gun show in
early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Haymon said that when authorities tried to contact Palmer's wife
on Thursday they were told that she and her husband had just left
on a week's vacation. Palmer's telephone number is unlisted.
</P>
<P>
   Dineen, the former firearms dealer, also said that the person
who had bought the gun from him, Wright, had said that he had given
it to a friend, Palmer, to sell at a Spokane gun show. He said
Palmer worked as a food broker and was a gun enthusiast, adding
that he did not believe he had a federal firearms license.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a gun dealer, he is a collector,'' Dineen said.
</P>
<P>
   John D'Angelo, an ATF spokesman, said the only record that the
agency has for a licensed dealer named Andrew Palmer is for the
operator of a pawn shop in Bainbridge, Ga.
</P>

<P>
   Senate and House lawmakers on a conference committee that is
expected to hammer out new gun control legislation are scheduled to
start that work when they return on Sept. 7 from a monthlong
congressional recess. In early August, when the conference
committee met, the lawmakers postponed any decisions, meaning that
the enactment of any new restrictions on firearms will not take
place until after most schoolchildren return to classes. The
nation's latest round of debate over gun control started in April
after two teen-age gunmen at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., killed 12 students, a teacher and themselves.

Rockets sign top pick Thomas, near deal with Barkley
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JONATHAN FEIGEN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The revolving door that had the Rockets spinning this week began
turning in the other direction Friday when Charles Barkley moved
close to signing with the team, rookie Kenny Thomas did sign, and
the chances of acquiring Jazz guard/forward Shandon Anderson
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets owner Leslie Alexander said Friday the team was close to
an agreement with Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect Charles will definitely be back,'' Alexander said.
``We have been talking to him, and we haven't reached a deal yet. I
think we will soon, but nothing's done until it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander did not offer specifics about the contract other than
to say it was a one-year deal. Barkley, 36, who averaged 16.1
points and 12.3 rebounds for the Rockets last season, was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Besides progress on that front, the Rockets also made headway in
trying to land Anderson. Considered the Rockets' top outside
free-agent target, Anderson has narrowed his list to three teams,
including the Rockets, his agent, Dan Fegan, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fegan would not identify the other teams Anderson is
considering, but before narrowing his list, Anderson, 25, had
considered Indiana, San Antonio and the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The news was not as good regarding Rockets guard/forward Sam
Mack, who also is a free agent. After meeting with Milwaukee on
Thursday, Mack, 29, was in San Antonio on Friday, according to his
agent, Bill Duffy. The Suns also have indicated they want to sign
Mack, Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milwaukee was interested,'' Duffy said. ``They want to sign
Sam. They were impressed with his workout, and they were impressed
with his conditioning. They definitely want him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Rockets) don't show too much interest in Sam Mack. My
feeling is they have done three or four long-term contracts in this
last year that maybe they regret. I don't think Sam should be
penalized for that. I wasn't asking for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack had been looking for a five-year deal, but Duffy said his
client probably would accept a four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rockets, after a tumultuous week in which assistant
coach Bill Berry and senior executive vice president Robert Barr
moved on and word Scottie Pippen had asked to be traded to the
Lakers had become public, bringing in the potential of a
first-round pick was welcome and well-timed.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source familiar with the deal, Thomas signed for
$2.7 million over three seasons, with the Rockets holding an option
for a fourth year at $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of being with the Rockets and being able to
play in the NBA,'' Thomas said. ``That's the important thing. It
really hasn't hit me yet. I'm just happy to be a Rocket. All the
signing and the paperwork is all done now. All I have to do is come
in here and perform.''
</P>
<P>
   As welcome as the signing was for the Rockets, it was as
well-timed for Thomas. Unable to play this summer because of a
badly sprained ankle, Thomas was cleared to begin workouts Monday
and was officially a Rocket by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty hard, because before Monday I didn't play for a
month and a half,'' Thomas said. ``Playing basketball my whole
life, it was kind of difficult not being able to play. But I'm
playing now. I'm getting in shape now. I'm dying now, but it's
going to be all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``My leg's better. It's 100 percent. I just started working out
this week, and I'm trying to get in shape right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-8, 260-pound forward taken with the 22nd pick, Thomas
averaged 17.8 points and 10 rebounds last season at New Mexico. He
became the first Western Athletic Conference player ever to collect
1,800 points, 1,000 rebounds and 200 blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny Thomas is an outstanding talent and we are thrilled to
have him as part of our team,'' executive vice president of
basketball Carroll Dawson said. ``He is a very versatile player who
is good at post-ups, and he passes the ball extremely well. We're
excited to get him into camp with the rest of our team and get him
adjusted to the NBA game.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he has a good idea what he can bring the Rockets
when he gets in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just Kenny Thomas basketball,'' he said. ``Just being able to
play my type of basketball, rebound and trying to score and
whatever role I'm going to have.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15)  
 (af)  
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ Here in the Mojave Desert, in huge hangers
guarded by armed sentries and high fences, the government and its
two biggest defense contractors are engaged in a high-stakes,
high-risk experiment aimed at building a fighter aircraft that will
dominate the skies and protect the nation's security for decades to
come.
</P>
<P>
   The project is still in its early stages, with the competing
airplanes given the code names X-32 and X-35 and workers admonished
not to utter a word.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of what the Pentagon promises will be a
``winner-take-all'' contest, either the Boeing Corp. or the
Lockheed Martin Corp. will land what should be the biggest military
contract ever. For both companies, this is a must-win competition:
The winner will collect nearly a third of a trillion dollars _ and
the loser could be out of the military aircraft business
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the companies' competing teams of engineers, test
pilots, computer experts and factory workers are at work here,
where the scrub soil gives way to an outpost of chain motels and
fast-food restaurants, preparing for a flyoff early next year.
</P>
<P>
   After that, and another year of testing and analysis, the
Pentagon will make its pick. The winner will build a Joint Strike
Fighter in three versions: one able to fly off carriers for the
Navy, another to land on ground for the Air Force and a third that
can hover into hot spots for the Marines. Nearly 5,000 of these
planes are expected to be made, to replace nearly all the fighter
planes flying today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plane is the future,'' said Richard Aboulafia, director
of aviation for the Teal Group, a Fairfax, Va. consulting firm.
``It will be the fighter plane for all the services. It will be the
fighter plane for all the world.''
</P>
<P>
   More than an airplane, the Joint Strike Fighter is an
unprecedented test of cutting-edge technology, of how the Pentagon
does business, of how wars will be fought. And it has profound
implications for both the domestic military-industrial base and the
nation's security well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an increasingly skeptical Congress _ just last month,
the House voted to delete funding for the Air Force's new F-22
fighter from next year's defense spending bill _ and a history of
eye-popping cost overruns, the Pentagon decided it needed a fresh
approach to procurement. And it is starting with the largest
contract it has.
</P>
<P>
   The order is a tall one: Design a single-engine, single pilot
fighter that can be used by all three services and sold to overseas
allies. It must fly faster than the speed of sound, be invisible to
enemy radar _ and be produced for the bargain-basement price, by
fighter aircraft standards, of around $30 million an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In building this plane, the Pentagon for the first time is
making cost as important as performance. Boeing and Lockheed are
being told not to build the best plane they can, but the best the
government can afford _ both in terms of its initial price tag and
in maintenance costs over time.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being the Cadillac of the air, the Joint Strike
Fighter is designed more as a Chevrolet _ but with a Saturn-style
attention to innovation and cost control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program is about building an affordable fighter plane,''
said Gen. Michael A. Hough, the Pentagon's director of the Joint
Strike Fighter program. ``It's the real deal. The country is going
broke trying to pay for the latest airplane. We want to build it
like your car _ just put gas in it and go.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is an attempt to break one of Augustine's Laws, a
not entirely satirical calculation developed by Norman R.
Augustine, the former Lockheed chief executive, that says the price
of military aircraft is growing so fast that by the year 2054, the
nation will be able to afford only one airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Strike Fighter will replace a generation of planes,
some of which are 30 years old: Lockheed's workhorse F-16 and
Northrop-Grumman's A-10 attack planes for the Air Force; the
Marines' Harrier short take-off and vertical landing planes, built
by Boeing and British Aerospace; and the Navy's carrier-based F-14
from Northrop and F/A-18 from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   It is designed to work in tandem with the F-22, a far more
expensive ($80 million) and sophisticated two-engine plane designed
to eliminate enemy aircraft in initial air-to-air combat. The Joint
Strike Fighter is designed to follow as part of a ``hunter-killer''
team, dropping bombs once the F-22 clears the skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to replace older and outmoded aircraft for all three
services, and we could not afford to develop three different
planes,'' said Darleen Druyun, the Air Force's top acquisition
executive. ``So it made sense to make a family of vehicles _ three
planes with the same motor, the same avionics and 60 to 80 percent
common parts, but with variations for all three services.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison with earlier aircraft development programs is
stark.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I threw the requirements over the fence and a
plane came back, and we didn't think about costs,'' said George K.
Muellner, a retired Air Force general who once headed several
acquisition programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter program,
and is now a Boeing employee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the Pentagon's sentiments, questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can a plane that is three variations on a theme _ 80 percent
the same for all, and otherwise modified to meet each service's
special needs _ actually work? Or will it be a compromise that
satisfies no one _ like the F-111, a Vietnam-era plane for all
three services that was both costly and wildly unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the Pentagon really stick to it's ``winner-take-all''
strategy, an approach that some analysts say would most likely
leave the Defense Department with only one tactical aircraft
supplier? Or will the military _ or Congress _ feel that the work
must be split to keep two military aircraft makers in business,
even if this increases program costs and reduces efficiency gains?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved is mindful of the fate of the McDonnell
Douglas Corp., which was cut from the Joint Strike Fighter program
and, as a result, forced to merge with Boeing in 1997 _ in spite of
rosy statements at the time from Harry Stonecipher, then
McDonnell's chief executive and now Boeing's president, that ``this
does not mean we are out of the military aircraft business.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Can the Pentagon really shed its old, expensive ways? It says
it wants an aircraft designed and produced using the best
commercial practices to simplify the plane and lower costs over its
operating life. But will the military begin to tinker and increase
the price tag?
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if the F-22 program is canceled or drastically
reduced from the 339 planes now on order, would the Joint Strike
Fighter's capabilities be upgraded in ways that could make it more
expensive? Just this month, Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of
staff, warned that cancelling the F-22 could lead to a costly
redesign of the Joint Strike Fighter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are Boeing and Lockheed up to the task? Boeing has already
been forced to drastically redesign its plane to provide better
control on carrier landings, trading a swept-wing design for a more
conventional one. Lockheed, meanwhile, has had few design changes,
but has faced cost overruns in the $100 million range and been
forced to scramble its plans for next year's demonstration tests to
stay within budget.
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the plane sell? Plans call for the Air Force to buy 1,783
planes, the Marines 609 and the Navy 408, along with 150 for
Britain's Royal Navy, which has invested $200 million in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon estimates that other countries will buy an
additional 2,000 planes. But European countries might decide
instead to support European offerings _ the French Rafale, the
Swedish Gripen or the British Eurofighter _ even with their higher
price tags and lower performance capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   And Congress, in another round of budget-cutting, could cut back
on Joint Strike Fighter purchases, raising the price for each
plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, the Joint Strike Fighter is a good idea,'' said
Eugene Carroll, a retired two-star admiral, who is deputy director
of the Center for Defense Information, a Washington nonprofit
organization that has been critical of military spending. ``So far,
it's retained an air of common sense that we are looking for in an
era when we are not facing a high-tech major power.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll sounded a note of caution: ``If we can build this
meat-and-potatoes airplane, let's press on. But let's not do the
same thing to it that we've done in the past and get the
requirements jazzed up so much its goals can't be met.''
</P>
<P>
   In a setting that seems lifted from the ``X-Files,'' the two
companies are building competing ``concept demonstration models''
to show the government early next year. Spy planes and space
shuttles are designed in utmost secrecy here, but it's hard to hide
the Joint Strike Fighter program.
</P>
<P>
   On the highway coming into town from Los Angeles, there's a huge
billboard of a fighter zooming over the motto: ``Boeing, the Best.
JSF.'' Leaving town, you come upon Lockheed's billboard _ its
fighter with the single word ``Imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside two huge hangers _ one at Lockheed's Skunk Works, the
other at Boeing's Phantom Works _ each company is making a pair of
airplanes, one of which will be reconfigured during the Pentagon's
flyoff to demonstrate the requirements for different services.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, they are only carcasses of titanium and composite,
electronics and wires. But by year-end, they will become airplanes
_ at a cost of about $500 million for each pair. The government's
total tab for the development process is about $2.2 billion,
including $832 million to Pratt &AMP; Whitney for the engines for all
the planes.
</P>
<P>
   The real question here is just how serious the Pentagon is about
``winner-take-all.'' Can the Pentagon come to the desert, hand one
company a golden prize and leave the other empty-handed?
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says yes. ``I've been ordered to pick a winner,''
said Hough. ``I don't know how you can have two winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, both companies take the Pentagon at its word, though
observers argue that the nation cannot afford to be reduced to a
single supplier of tactical military aircraft. Or, they say,
political pressures will be such that both companies will get some
business. That, though, could sharply escalate the costs of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If you split it down the middle, you lose economies of
scale,'' said Loren Thompson, a military industry analyst at the
Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va., research group. ``But if
you get a tactical aircraft monopoly, the presumption is you would
get less innovation, higher prices and lower performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Air Force's Ms. Druyun says a winner can be picked
without harming the nation. ``We're always concerned about the
industrial base,'' she said. ``But when I look out and see what
will be there in 2010 and 2015, it is still apparent that there
will be a viable industrial base in the fighter aircraft
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Korb, a military analyst with the Council on Foreign
Relations, said the project was so large that no matter which
company won, the other would get plenty of subcontracting work.
``It's not a winner-take-all, but a winner-will-do-better
program,'' said Korb.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a critical difference between being a prime
contractor and being a subcontractor. The prime has control over
the project. It gets the most money. And, since it is where all the
engineering, design, computer and high-end action is, it is where
all the creative and talented people want to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who gets the money is the guy who makes the
decisions,'' said Harry Blot, Lockheed's deputy program manager for
the fighter. ``If you lose, you may make as many parts as you want,
but you won't have the design authority. It's interesting work that
keeps engineering teams together.''
</P>
<P>
   Meullner of Boeing, the former Air Force acquisitions head,
questioned whether the government ``has the guts'' to pick just one
producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping it will be winner-take-all,'' he said. ``Our
defense budget cannot sustain two production lines.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wall Street has not focused on the contest. The final
payoff is at least a decade away _ an eternity for Wall Street. And
the market's conventional wisdom is the program will be split:
Lockheed will build the Air Force version and Boeing the Navy and
Marine planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no clear indication as to which way the program is
going,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research in Newport,
R.I. ``So there's nothing of this program reflected in either
company's stock.''
</P>
<P>
   For the military, the focus is much clearer. Driving the program
is the Marine Corps, which wants its own new plane not dependent on
Navy carriers for takeoffs and landings. The Navy, happy with the
F-18, and the Air Force, going all out for the F-22, were more
reluctant converts. The key in getting them on board, according to
Muellner, was to minimize ``scar penalty'' _ the price that one
service pays for the requirements of another.
</P>
<P>
   So, with careful planning, the Air Force and Navy got what they
wanted _ a stealthier plane with more range than existing fighters.
And in Congress, where both the Air Force and the Navy have taken
their share of hits of late, the leathernecks command great
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marines have impressive powers of outlasting their
doubters in getting the things they want,'' said Wolfgang Demisch,
a managing director at Wasserstein Perella and Co. ``And they
really want this plane.''

WARREN BEATTY FOR PRESIDENT? 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE WRITE THROUGH  
 (Eds: Corrects spelling of Bulworth throughout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For what it's worth, no bull: Warren Beatty is
thinking of running for president.
</P>
<P>
   It's a role the actor, director and former Hollywood Lothario
has never been cast in before. He did play a senator unable to
resist rapping the truth in last year's ``Bulworth,'' and his wife
once starred as an environmental lobbyist who captured the
president's heart.
</P>
<P>
   But politics has always been a sideline for Beatty, if a
passionate one. Now the long-time Democratic activist and avowed
liberal is weighing whether to take it center stage. He's that
displeased with the national debate on campaign finance reform and
other issues important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a surprise, but it's not a shock,'' said William Bradley,
a Sacramento-based political analyst and friend of Beatty's who has
heard him mull the idea of a candidacy of some sort for years.
``Could he win? I don't know. But I've been talking to him about it
and I think it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Few political observers give Beatty much of a chance, however,
whether he goes up against Al Gore and the other Bill Bradley in
the Democratic primary, or joins Jesse Ventura in the Reform Party
_ a possibility he has hinted at. Even Beatty has conceded there
should be a better candidate than him. But he has also said he
doesn't want to discount the friends and activists encouraging him
to give it a go.
</P>
<P>
   A Beatty candidacy, of course, would be the ultimate
intersection of celebrity and politics. Unlike Ronald Reagan or
even Sonny Bono, he has never held any elected office. He has never
been a candidate of any kind. But he did campaign hard for Robert
Kennedy and George McGovern some three decades ago and, more
recently, for Gary Hart. And he knows how to tell and sell a story,
although several of his more recent movies have done less than
stellar business at the box office. He has the ability to make an
increasingly apathetic America listen, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take this as a joke,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at Claremont Graduate University. ``He wants to
have a conversation with the country and he has the bully pulpit of
celebrity to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has only hinted at political ambitions, Beatty is
already attracting attention, from voters as well as the media.
</P>
<P>
   Arianna Huffington, the syndicated newspaper columnist who first
raised the talk of a Beatty candidacy this week, said she has been
inundated with e-mails from potential Beatty supporters ever since.
Many wanted to know where to send their $100, an amount that
pollster and Beatty pal Pat Caddell suggested as an appropriate
donation for individuals interested in funding a real grassroots
campaign. It's a response that would do the character Sen. Jay
Bulworth, so sick of selling his soul for donations that he
arranged his own murder, proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that energy is available. Someone could theoretically
start a web site, a whole movement about bringing Warren Beatty to
Washington,'' Huffington said.
</P>
<P>
   William Hillsman, who knows something of outsiders triumphing
against long odds after helping Jesse Ventura become governor of
Minnesota, said he would not rule out a Beatty victory just yet.
While Hillsman would not say whether he is in discussions with the
star, he did give him a decent chance at victory if he runs as a
third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What America doesn't understand about Beatty yet is how long
and deep his involvement in politics goes,'' said Hillsman,
president of North Woods Advertising in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   At best, however, some political analysts said Beatty could
siphon enough liberal and celebrity-driven votes to make a small
showing in the Democratic primary. In a three-way general election,
they added, he'd likely nick the party he has helped for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bulworth dream may have worked as a movie, but it wouldn't
work as a reality,'' said Bruce Cain, a political science professor
at the University of California at Berkeley. ``Let's say he played
out his fantasy in terms of speaking frankly and speaking to the
people. That's what Ross Perot did. . . But what would happen to
Beatty after he raises money from unions or environmental groups.
Does he continue to speak his mind or does he suddenly feel the
same pressures as everyone else?''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley insisted his friend would not be interested in
simply conversing with the country, then letting someone else sit
in the Oval Office. He would not drag his wife Annette Bening and
their three young children through the rough and tumble of a
national campaign unless he meant to win. And he would not put the
Hollywood crowd, already committed to other candidates, in the
position of snubbing an Academy Award winner unless he knew he had
an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's serious; he's not laughing,'' said Frank
Mankiewicz, vice chairman of the Hill &AMP; Knowlton public relations
firm and another friend of Beatty's. ``He's willing to be
president. I'm not so sure he's willing to go through a campaign.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Like millions of Mexicans, Miriam Sagaon Rojas
worked for a time as a factory laborer in the United States to earn
dollars when things were hard back home. And like millions of
Mexicans, she dutifully sent some of her earnings back to her
parents, using a Western Union wire transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The money arrived quickly and safely. But Ms. Sagaon, 20, was in
for a rude surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until I got back to Mexico did I find out how expensive it
is,'' Ms. Sagaon said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the estimated six million Mexicans who live and work in
the United States send money to Mexico. But as the cross-border
wire transfer business has boomed, some customers have been
complaining that they pay too much to deliver cash to needy
relatives at home.
</P>
<P>
   The two dominant companies in the business _ Western Union
Financial Services, a unit of First Data Corp. of Atlanta, and
Moneygram Payment Systems Inc. of Englewood, Colo. _ have paid
costly settlements in class-action lawsuits that accused them of
profiteering by changing customers' dollars into Mexican pesos at
artificially low rates and failing to tell them about it.
</P>
<P>
   And some former employees say that internal debates at Western
Union about wire transfer rates have led to the departures of
high-ranking Hispanic executives in the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, Western Union and its California-based
subsidiary Orlandi Valuta have dismissed two high-level Hispanic
executives in the United States and two in Mexico. Two other senior
executives in the United States resigned. The circumstances of
their departures remain unclear, but all of them said they had
expressed strong differences with the company over the rates it
charged for wire transfers to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Western Union declined to comment about these former employees,
saying that to do so would violate standard corporate policy unless
the former employees gave written consent, which none of them had
done. But in a statement, the company denied that any executives
had been dismissed for stating an opinion. Western Union said such
accusations ``appear to have been made by certain disgruntled
employees and are untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said, ``Western Union has a long and an
excellent record of serving and employing people in the Mexican and
all Hispanic communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Money sent from abroad is the lifeblood of many Mexican
communities, where it keeps children in school, pays rent and
builds homes. The amounts are growing each year. Mexico's central
bank has estimated that more than $6 billion was sent to Mexico
from the United States in 1998, making these remittances the
third-biggest source of foreign revenue after oil and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Mail is often tampered with or lost in Mexico, and banks charge
high fees to cash checks, so demand for the services provided by
Western Union and Moneygram is high.
</P>
<P>
   The currency exchange rate used by money transfer services
reflects the power they have to determine what the customer
ultimately pays. Western Union exchanges customer dollars at 90
percent of the benchmark exchange rate set by the central bank,
sometimes less.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the U.S. Congress found that Western Union gave
better exchange rates in countries where customers had a wider
range of options, including India, Spain, Canada and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Western Union also charges transfer fees ranging from $12 to
$25. Although fees have fallen recently in response to litigation,
sending $100 to Mexico can still cost about $25.
</P>
<P>
   Several Hispanic executives who had problems with Western Union
said they believed these fees were unfair to Mexican immigrants in
the United States who had limited financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Western Union has become its own worst enemy simply because it
is so greedy,'' said Alejandro Urtiz, who was director of Hispanic
development at Western Union until being dismissed in January.
Urtiz said Western Union had accused him of trying to establish a
competing electronic transfer company. He denied the accusation and
said he believed he was dismissed because he criticized the
company's prices.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Bidegain was dismissed in December as director of sales
for Orlandi Valuta, the Western Union subsidiary. Bidegain said he
believed he had been dismissed for speaking out against the
company's exchange rate at a Western Union convention in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Elias Mercado, who arranged Western Union's joint venture with
the Elektra appliance stores in Mexico in 1994, said he was
dismissed as head of Mexican operations two years later. According
to court records in Mexico, he had written a report urging the
company to offer what he called a more equitable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado won a wrongful-dismissal lawsuit in Mexico and was
rehired and assigned to work in Colorado. He declined to comment on
his case.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ziverts, a Western Union spokesman, said the prices
charged for transfers to Mexico reflected the quality of the
service, which includes toll-free operators and the delivery of
cash in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Western Union's prices have been coming down, and critics
say the drop in prices is a result of legal pressure.
</P>
<P>
   A class-action lawsuit filed against Western Union and Moneygram
in U.S. District Court in Chicago accused the companies of failing
to disclose exchange rates. When the lawsuit was settled in May,
Western Union agreed to pay $2 million to Hispanic community
organizations, and Moneygram agreed to pay $300,000. The companies
also agreed to make $375 million in discount coupons available to
anyone who had wired money to Mexico since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Ayres, an executive vice president of Moneygram, said his
company had made the exchange rate information on its remittance
forms easier to understand. The company's settlement payment, he
said, was more a good will gesture than an admission of guilt.
``This was just a way to get it resolved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers who represented Mexican-American communities said
they were frustrated with the Illinois settlement because it barred
further suits against the companies on the same ground, and because
the discount coupons provided more business to the companies.

LEVI'S OPENS MEGASTORE ON UNION SQUARE  
 BY CAROL EMERT
</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. enters the ranks of high-tech,
entertainment-oriented retailers with a showy megastore opening
Tuesday on Union Square.
<P>
   Levi's, whose sales have been skidding for two years, has pulled
out all stops to generate shopper buzz. If it works, 300 Post St.
will be the jeansmaker's first successful attempt at operating its
own retail space in the U.S., following a number of botched
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The project means enough to family-owned Levi's that it is
spending approximately $60 million on its 15-year lease. That
doesn't include the cost of building the store, which one source
estimated at a minimum of $5 million, ``and probably a lot more
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the souped-up Metreon shopping center and ultra-hip
Niketown close by, Levi's has managed to stuff its
24,000-square-foot ``Levi's Store, San Francisco'' full of unique
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   A custom-tailoring service uses light rays rather than a
measuring tape to size up customers. Computer stations identify
shoppers by their fingerprints. A hot-tub-sized pool is available
for shoppers who want to sit in water and shrink their
shrink-to-fit jeans; they can dry off in a waist-high glass booth
filled with warm air.
</P>
<P>
   The four-level store, decked out in galvanized metals, warm
woods and cast concrete, affords Levi's a rare chance to control
the presentation of its merchandise. It is designed to reflect the
best qualities of the Levi's brand: originality, cool, and youthful
verve.
</P>
<P>
   One of Levi's most debilitating problems is its reliance on
other companies, from Sears to corner denim shops, to sell its
clothes. Meanwhile, vertically-integrated competitors like Gap
Inc., which control their own products and selling space, are
gaining market share.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's Store visitors will likely be surprised at the gamut of
fashions made by the 146-year-old company, including trendy
European labels and hip American styles sold only in specialty
boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   One of the European lines is a revival of Sta-Prest, a Levi's
brand discontinued decades ago. The stretchy, polyester-blend
shirts and pants come in shades of gray and blue, and resemble
1950s workmen's uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's Vintage Clothing reproduces gold miner styles from the
1800s, like baggy jeans with oversized suspenders. The company's
new Red Line, prominently featured in store windows and on the
ground floor, ranges from dark denim pants to dressier pieces such
as a $500 black leather jacket and a flouncy skirt made of shiny
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's basic Red Tab line, the uniform of the Woodstock era,
accounts for more than half of the product mix, but is relegated to
the third floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to think of us as more than a maker of
five-pocket jeans,'' said Karen Childress, general merchandise
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Customization is a major theme of the store, based on Levi's
belief that today's youth want clothes that reflect their
individuality. In a workshop on the third floor, shoppers can alter
or ornament their jeans for $8 to $125.
</P>
<P>
   Pants can be converted into skirts, straight legs can be made
into bell bottoms, leather fringes can be sewn into seams. The
workshop also contains one of the store's most unique elements, a
laser that sears designs into clothing. (The laser doesn't hurt the
fabric, but it does produce a thin waft of smoke.)
</P>
<P>
   Levi's has also updated its ``Original Spin'' program, formerly
called ``Personal Pair,'' a custom-tailoring service for
hard-to-fit customers.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers can don a body suit and enter a dark booth, where light
beams are projected on them. Computers read the reflected light
rays and, if all goes well, take more accurate measurements than an
old-fashioned measuring tape. The jeans cost $55.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected features pop up in every nook of the Levi's Store.
</P>
<P>
   On level two is a miniature version of Spundae, a Haight Street
record shop, including a live DJ spinning vinyl. In a nearby photo
booth, shoppers can take a photo of themselves and e-mail a digital
version to 10 friends for $3.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``vortex,'' a cylindrical staircase that curls up the
center of the store, arty film clips are shown on multiple screens.
A catwalk leads shoppers to a fourth-floor art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with all the new technologies, the Levi's Store has
run into some glitches. For example, the fingerprint-identification
feature, designed to recognize and greet customers as they log onto
Web-surfing PCs throughout the store, worked half the time in a
recent demonstration. (The fingerprinting is voluntary and the data
is deleted every 24 hours, according to Levi's.)
</P>
<P>
   Levi's new megastore contrasts sharply with the company's past
attempts at retail. In 1991 the company announced plans to open 10
test stores in Ohio. A handful were opened and all but one have
since closed.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the company planned to open as many as 50
Original Levi's Stores in the United States, some in partnership
with a store operator called Designs Inc. The Original Levi's
Stores failed miserably, in part because they sold pants at full
price in malls where nearby stores sold them at deep discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stores looked goofy, they had bad locations, bad
assortments and high prices,'' said one source close to the
company. The OLS division bled tens of millions of dollars, sources
said. Closings followed, leaving 13 full-priced Original Levi's
Stores, down from a high of 30 in 1997. Similarly, the company
announced, and then retreated from, grand plans to open shops for
its Docker's khaki line.
</P>
<P>
   Today the only profitable domestic Levi's stores are its
outlets, which are used to liquidate unpopular merchandise,
according to sources close to Levi's. Designs Inc., which no longer
runs any full-priced Original Levi's Stores, continues to open
outlets to get rid of unwanted clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's vice president Janie Ligon downplayed the company's
retail mistakes. She said a strategic decision was made to
concentrate on a few urban locations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one store can do only so much for the troubled
jeansmaker. But Tuesday's grand opening culminates Levi's longtime
goal of operating a showcase location in its hometown. The company
has acknowledged that, with its pricey lease, chances are close to
nil that the new locale will ever make a profit _ but that's not
the goal, since its main function is promote the Levi's brand.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the megastore will hurt local
Levi's sellers such as Macy's. Just across Union Square from the
Levi's Store, Macy's operates a large Levi's department that
includes an Original Spin custom-tailoring service. Macy's says it
isn't worried. ``There is enough business to go around,'' said a
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   A local jeans boutique manager said she doesn't expect the
Levi's Store to hurt her business. ``When the Diesel store opened
up we were concerned, but it hasn't affected our business and I
expect the same with Levi's,'' she said.

STATE DID NOT COMMIT FURROW, DESPITE DOCUMENTED MENTAL HEALTH
DANGERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Washington state mental health system got an
extensive look at Buford O. Furrow Jr. in the months before he
admitted to opening fire in a Jewish community center and killing a
postal worker in Los Angeles on Tuesday. What the experts saw was a
man who twice slashed his arms so deeply they required stitches,
drank alcohol until he blacked out, and espoused a deep hatred for
anyone who is not white.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite lengthy evaluations at mental institutions here,
and no shortage of resources, Furrow was never ordered to remain
under long-term state psychiatric care. Instead, after serving
nearly six months in jail for trying to stab two workers at a
private hospital near Seattle, he was released under parole
supervision and required to take medication to control psychotic
impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Furrow should have fallen under this state's standard
for involuntary commitment to a mental institution is a question
now shadowing the ground where the justice system meets psychiatry.
Furrow was an avowed racist who told a court last year that he
fantasized about committing a mass killing. His temper and violent
threats were so grave that the officer who arrested him for assault
in the Seattle area last year said he nearly had to shoot Furrow in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's attorney in the case had said he would plead not guilty
by reason of insanity. But Furrow pleaded guilty, court records
show, avoiding what could have been a lengthy confinement in a
mental facility.
</P>
<P>
   And while mental health experts here say Furrow did not slip
through the cracks of a strained system _ as has happened with
troubled people in other states _ they say his case is the latest
high profile crime to raise questions about whether states should
tighten the laws on holding violent, mentally ill people in
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does society do with these people?'' said Dr. Renee
Binder, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California
at San Francisco and the chairwoman of the American Psychiatric
Association's Council on Psychiatry and the Law. ``Most people
would say that being a racist with violent fantasies is not against
the law. Racism is not something that is designated as an illness
that can be treated by mental health professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   New York officials recently agreed to expand state authority to
force mentally ill patients to undergo treatment or face
involuntary commitment, joining nearly 40 states, including
Washington, that have enacted similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Furrow's home state of Washington, the debate is over whether
he met the requirements of someone who should have been held in a
mental facility instead of serving a few months in jail for
assault. The Washington state law, similar to the standard of most
states, says the person must have a mental disorder and pose a
threat to harm himself or others, in the eyes of professional
examiners.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Furrow slashed his hands up with a knife and told
police he wanted to shoot people at random in a mall. Those
statements, alone, along with his threats to stab two women at a
mental hospital, where he was trying to be admitted, should have
been enough to bring a civil commitment case against Furrow, some
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person went to a psychiatric hospital to ask for help,
pulled a knife on two women, stated very clearly that he was
homicidal and suicidal, and is tied into a Nazi hate group,'' said
Sherry Storm, the mental health ombudsman for King County, which
covers the Seattle area court system. ``All of those things put
together would seem to make a pretty strong case that he poses a
threat to himself or others.''
</P>
<P>
   But other officials say Furrow was simply a violent, hateful
man, and that trying to blame the shootings on the failures of the
mental health system is futile. They note that Furrow had only one
run-in with the law, that he had a college degree in engineering,
and that he held numerous jobs, including employment at Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I have is that people are trying to build a case
that this killing was done because the man was insane,'' said King
County Executive Ron Sims. ``What he did was cowardly, repulsive
and a very irrational act. But mental illness was not the cause.
Hatred was. This guy came out of a culture of hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   National groups representing the mental health profession are
also reluctant to tie the shootings to a failure in the system.
They cite the case of Andrew Goldstein, the schizophrenic man who
pushed a woman to death in New York, or Russell Weston Jr., who
killed two people in the U.S. Capitol, as examples of how
potentially violent, mentally ill people who sought treatment were
largely ignored. But with Furrow, they say, the case is less
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all understand that Goldstein and Weston should have had
more treatment,'' said Bill Emmett, deputy executive director of
the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, an advocacy group based
in Arlington, Va. ``But we're not that eager to have Furrow's case
equated with Goldstein and Weston. We simply don't have enough
facts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Confidentiality laws prohibit officials from disclosing details
about Furrow's mental health record. But court records show that
last year, during his first encounter with the criminal justice
system, he was extensively examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it is not a question of whether we have the
resources,'' Amnon Shoenfeld, a supervisor with the mental health
professionals who evaluate inmates for King County. ``We always
have adequate beds.''
</P>
<P>
   Of about 5,000 people referred for evaluation in this county
every year, nearly half are sent to some form of involuntary
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Within a day of Furrow's arrest last Oct. 28, mental health
officials sent him to to the psychiatric ward at Harborview Medical
Center in Seattle _ a large public hospital. Later, he was sent for
several weeks of evaluation at the Washington state mental facility
south of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If the experts concluded that he posed a significant enough risk
to merit long-term involuntary commitment, it was never reflected
in the court record. The record shows that he returned to jail in
King County on Dec. 11, and stayed there until his release May 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``With civil commitments, you're always trying to strike a
balance between protecting society and the rights of the
individual,'' said Dr. Binder.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's court-appointed attorney in last year's assault case,
Leona Thomas, told the court she planned to enter a plea of
not-guilty by reason of insanity. But Furrow entered a guilty plea
instead.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Furrow avoided what could have been a sentence of
up to 10 years of involuntary confinement in a mental facility. He
was sentenced to 5 1/2 months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case like that, when a person pleads guilty, most people
think that's a way of getting off,'' said Ms. Storm. ``The real
question is whether the judge should be forced to accept the guilty
plea or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case, King County Superior Court Judge Harriet
Cody, did not return phone calls requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Cody did require, as a term of Furrow's release, that
he stay on his medication, refrain from drinking alcohol and not
own a gun. State officials say Furrow met his parole requirements,
as near as they could tell, until later this summer when he left
the state.
</P>
<P>
   By requiring Furrow to stay on an anti-psychotic medication, the
state has considerable leverage over him, in the eyes of Ms.
Binder. ``In some cases, that sort of requirement is stronger than
civil commitment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state has been through several well-publicized cases
in which mentally ill people who were allowed to remain free
committed violent crimes. Two years ago, after a mentally ill man
stabbed to death a retired Seattle firefigther after a Mariners
baseball game, the law was changed, making it easier to refer
people to mental evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   This state's law also prohibits the family from committing a
member who is older than the age of 13 to a mental facility.
Furrow's father, Buford Furrow Sr., wanted his son to be under
closer supervision of a mental health care system as a condition of
parole, said the family's neighbor in the town of Old Nisqually,
Wash., Clint Merrill, in a brief interview Friday.

TWO LINEMEN CHOOSE USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC has picked up oral commitments from defensive
lineman Jamaal Williams of St. Augustine High in San Diego and
offensive lineman Kenechi Udeze of Verbum Dei.
</P>
<P>
   Williams (6-foot-5, 250 pounds) has played just one year of
organized football. He attends the same school as former USC
defensive lineman Darrell Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Udeze (6-5, 310), who attended camps at USC and Michigan this
summer, was also being recruited by Iowa and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside potential is tremendous on both of these guys,''
said Rick Kimbrel, managing editor of PrepStar recruiting magazine.
</P>
<P>
   USC now has five oral commitments. Quarterback Matt Cassel of
Chatsworth, offensive lineman Joe McGuire of Servite and safety
Jason Leach of Bishop Amat had previously committed.
</P>
<P>
   No Steele: JC transfer linebacker Markus Steele of Long Beach
City College will not practice this weekend, because his summer
transcripts have not been processed and mailed to USC. Steele will
not practice before Monday, and it is possible he will not be
eligible until midweek.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if wide receiver Craig Mitchell will be out until at
least midweek, because he needs two junior-college transcripts to
be processed.
</P>
<P>
   They are the only two players on the roster who are not in
Irvine for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey hurt: Starting left tackle Brent McCaffrey may not
practice for the first week, after puncturing his foot on a bed
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an injury ... which is a little more significant
than we had thought,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``We'll
probably be very cautious with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman making impact: Hackett was pleased with the true
freshmen offensive linemen who had their first practices earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucais MacKay has started working at the center position and
is very impressive,'' Hackett said. ``Probably the most impressive
of the bunch is Lenny Vandermade. The two tackles, Eric Torres and
Nate Steinbacher, are very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis ready: Defensive tackle Ennis Davis and running back
Malaefou MacKenzie will be limited to one practice per day to open
training camp. Both tore ligaments in their knees last season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he feels fine, although his quadriceps muscles are
not quite 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Soward passes: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward passed a running
endurance test Friday morning, after being forced to stop midway
through his first try Thursday, when his legs hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Practice dates: USC opens practice today at UC Irvine. The
Trojans will practice every day at Irvine until Aug. 27. Practice
sessions are scheduled at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. Practices are open to
the public every day except Aug. 19, 21 and 24.

CALIFORNIA GROUP TO BUY DAEWOO ELECTRONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An investment group led by a little-known
California businessman has agreed to buy most of Daewoo Electronics
Co., the consumer electronics unit of the sprawling but troubled
South Korean conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Walid Alomar &AMP; Associates, based in Beverly Hills,
said Friday that it had agreed to pay $3.2 billion for the assets
and operations of Daewoo Electronics in North and South America,
Western Europe, Japan and South Korea. The price includes the
assumption of an undisclosed amount of Daewoo debt.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the investment group, Walid Alomar, is a 56-year-old
engineer from Saudi Arabia who designs systems for refineries but
has been involved in other international business projects in
energy and telecommunications. Other participants in the investment
group were not identified and Alomar was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which both sides said they hoped to complete Sept. 9,
is part of an effort to reduce the crippling debts of Daewoo Group,
one of the largest of South Korea's family-controlled
conglomerates, which are known as chaebol. Daewoo's creditors and
the South Korean government are forcing the conglomerate into a
drastic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase would create a rare American-owned consumer
electronics company, since most American manufacturers left the
low-profit business years ago under intense competition.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase also represents a reversal of the trend a few years
ago when South Korean companies were buying American ones. LG
Electronics bought Zenith, the American television set
manufacturer, while Daewoo Electronics itself tried to buy Thomson
Multimedia, the French company that owns the former RCA and General
Electric consumer electronics businesses. The deal was stopped by
opposition in France.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar is buying about 80 percent of Daewoo Electronics'
operations, with sales of about $3.3 billion, said Steven Kalabar,
a member of the investment group. Daewoo is not a big force in the
United States under its own brand name but makes products sold by
others, like monitors for some Compaq and Hewlett-Packard
computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price is nearly 10 times the market value of Daewoo
Electronics. But Kalabar said if Alomar had purchased the entire
company, it would have had to assume all of its more than $4
billion in debt, a prohibitively huge sum.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar was born in Saudi Arabia to Iraqi parents and then
studied engineering in London, said Kenneth Chiate, his attorney.
Alomar now has American citizenship, and, contrary to news reports
from South Korea, is not related to any Saudi prince or Cabinet
member, Chiate said.
</P>

 &HT;    Graf bows out
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Steffi Graf, one of the greatest women's
tennis players in history, retired Friday, saying her motivation
had waned and the joy had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not having fun anymore,'' Graf said, adding that she had
``nothing left to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf retires ranked No. 3 in the world, the highest-ever ranking
for a retiring player.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Wimbledon, for the first time in my career, I didn't
feel like going to a tournament,'' she said. ``It is time to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   In her 17-year career, Graf won 22 Grand Slam singles (second to
Margaret Court's 24), 107 tournaments and spent 377 weeks, longer
than any other man or woman, at No. 1 in the world. Graf turned 30
in June and has struggled with a variety injuries but said they did
not play a part in her retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm perfectly fit,'' she said during the
announcement in Heidelberg, Germany, near her hometown of Bruehl.
``This is in no way about injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis observers in South Florida, where Graf owns a second home
in Boca Raton, weren't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll be missed,'' said promoter George Liddy, who ran the
Virginia Slims tournaments, among others. ``I'm not surprised. I
thought it was the proper time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of just five players to win all four Grand Slams _ plus
Olympic gold, making it a 1988 Golden Slam _ in a single year, Graf
has enjoyed some of her best results in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 1998 knee surgery, Graf won the French Open, then
reached the final at Wimbledon, losing to Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really expecting her to kind of end her career at the
U.S. Open,'' said Davenport, the Wimbledon champion and defending
U.S. Open champion, ``so it is a little bit of a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I thought was really great was the older she got and the
more she was winning, probably in the mid-'90s, the happier it
seemed to make her,'' Davenport said. ``When she was playing in the
'80s and just dominating, she never looked that happy and I think
she really learned to appreciate the game the older she got and
more she played.''
</P>
<P>
   Her appreciation seemed to peak with the French Open victory,
where she beat top-ranked and top-tennis brat Martina Hingis in the
final. John Evert, brother of Boca Raton's Chris Evert and former
agent to Jennifer Capriati, said he thinks when Graf was injured
she felt she could still compete at the top. The players who
replaced her while she sat out much of 1997 probably challenged
her, even though she denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think once she came back and she proved that she could beat
them, that probably was the pinnacle of her career,'' said Evert,
who runs the Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton. ``I don't think
she has anything left to prove to herself now.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf told fans in Paris, during her victory speech, that she
wouldn't be back, and she repeated that sentiment after losing at
Wimbeldon.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't seem happy about it at Wimbledon. She answered
some questions but not others. She later said it was ``a mistake''
to announce her retirement from those tournaments during such an
emotional time.
</P>
<P>
   Graf's outstanding results and her devastating forehand _ the
leaping crusher that earned her nickname ``Fraulein Forehand'' _
will go down in history as one of the best ever. But her classiness
and grace might be better remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's the only one who modeled herself after Chrissie
(Evert),'' Liddy said. ``They both started young and their
essential contribution was their good manners they showed to other
players. You'll be hard pressed to find that kind of conduct in
today's top players.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf said she decided she'd had enough of the travel and the
tennis life on a plane to San Diego two weeks ago. A few days
later, she strained a hamstring and had to retire from a
first-round match against American Amy Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be her final match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weeks following Wimbledon weren't easy for me,'' Graf
said. ``I was pulled back and forth, but when I made my decision I
didn't think about it one minute afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   The final tournaments of the summer certainly have been thinking
about it, though. Officials in New Haven, Conn., where Graf was
scheduled to play starting Aug. 23, took dozens of calls from media
and corporate sponsors Friday.
</P>
<P>
   USTA officials, along with many U.S. fans, also had hoped Graf
would make a final run at a major title on the hard courts of the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed she's not going to be at the U.S. Open to
take some bows, even if she loses in the first round,'' said Jim
Martz, longtime tennis writer and editor of Florida Tennis. ``She
should take her 10-minute standing ovation. She deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf said she plans an exhibition farewell tour. She then hopes
to travel _ without her tennis bag _ and work with her marketing
company and developing juniors in Germany. She probably won't move
to her Polo Club home full-time, as Jana Novotna plans to when she
retires.
</P>
<P>
   She earned nearly $22 million in prize money as a player, more
than all other players except Boris Becker and Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   But Graf probably will keep the Boca Raton home for the same
purpose she's always had it _ as an escape. She likes to shop, go
to concerts and follow the Miami Heat, but otherwise, she's rarely
seen out on the town.
</P>
<P>
   Graf also played a good bit of her career in the South Florida,
though. She played in one of Liddy's tournaments in Bonaventure
soon after turning pro in 1982 at 13 years, four months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't get very far and of course nobody knew who she
was,'' Martz said. ``Except that she was a phenom from Germany. She
didn't speak much English then and she was awfully shy.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the court, she was determined, almost fierce, despite the
pigtails. Buchholz saw her three years later at the first Lipton in
Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``She played Chrissie (Evert) in the semifinals,'' Buchholz
said. ``I remember watching that match and seeing her hit that
forehand and you knew then that she was going to be a great tennis
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf went on to win Lipton five times, starting in 1987. That
was 11 months after her first tournament title in Hilton Head,
S.C., and two months before her first major championship, the
French. In August 1987, she reached No. 1 in the world for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she dominated three generations of tennis players
and nearly two decades of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brought a lot to the game,'' Evert said. ``She'll probably
go down as the greatest player of all time with her record.''

AGE HAS AN AFTERNOON AS MEDINAH TURNS CUDDLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ On a day when the leaders shot in the 60s, a
player born in the '50s led the way.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Haas, a 45-year-old veteran who has not won on the PGA Tour
since 1993, played like someone in the prime of life Friday.
Shooting a 5-under-par 67, after an opening-round 68, Haas led by
one stroke over Mike Weir of Canada after Friday's birdie-filled
second round of the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Haas was 9-under for the tournament (135), just ahead of Weir
(136, 68-68), and two strokes ahead of Tiger Woods, who started his
5-under-par day with birdies on the first three holes. Lee Westwood
of England was alone in fourth place at six under, while four
players were deadlocked at 5-under _ the 54-year-old Hale Irwin,
Stewart Cink, the first-round leader Sergio Garcia of Spain, and
Skip Kendall, who set the Medinah Country Club course record with a
65.
</P>
<P>
   The barrage of birdies was the theme of the day, as the leader
board was covered with red numbers, unusual for a major
championship. Rain Thursday and Friday softened the greens,
allowing players to fire approach shots at the pins and diminishing
the speed of the greens. Haas used his accuracy off the tee and a
pure putting stroke to keep going lower and lower, reaching
10-under before his only bogey of the day at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Can Haas, who has not contended at a major tournament since the
1995 Masters, win his first major at an age when most players are
looking forward to the Senior Tour? He was eager to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played a long time out here without a major win, and I'm
disappointed that hasn't happened,'' said Haas, who led the 1995
Masters after 36 holes but finished tied for third. ``I'm not
devastated by it, but we all think we can do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of days I've been nervous. But it's a good
nervous because I'm playing well. I need to embrace that. I need to
enjoy the fact that I will be nervous, because that's what I've
worked for my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the year's final major has been the least demanding.
Jose Maria Olazabal shot 8-under par to win the Masters. Payne
Stewart was the only player who finished under par at the U.S.
Open. And at Carnoustie, where Paul Lawrie won the British Open
(290, 6-over par), the rough was so deep and the fairways so narrow
that some players were defeated before the tournament started.
</P>
<P>
   But Medinah, the 7,401-yard course that was billed as the
Monster of the Midwest, has been a hospitable beast. On Friday,
many players left the golf course smiling. At Carnoustie, players
left the course looking like dazed boxers who had just been
pummeled.
</P>
<P>
   In these conditions, anyone under par _ like David Duval
(3-under), Jim Furyk (3-under), Lanny Wadkins (3-under), Nick Price
(3-under), Nick Faldo (2-under), Colin Montgomerie (2-under), Fred
Couples (2- under) and Davis Love III (1-under) _ remained well
within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot a solid 67, finishing with seven consecutive pars,
despite ending his round in steady rain. While he has played
consistently in this year's majors, whatever he does this weekend
will go a long way toward defining his year. He has won four times
worldwide in 1999, including three times on the PGA Tour, but he
has not won a major since his record-setting victory at the 1997
Masters. If he wins the PGA Championship, an excellent year will
become a great one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep giving yourself chances,'' said Woods, who
tied for third at this year's U.S. Open and tied for seventh at the
British Open. ``You're not going to win every time. I've proven
that. But I'm playing well now. It's not that I put less pressure
on myself at majors. It's just that I'm a better player. When
you're striking the ball well, outwardly it looks as if you are
feeling less pressure. Inside, it's a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will feel the pressure this weekend, but Haas will have
the comfort of having his 18-year-old son, Jay Jr., as his caddie.
Haas' son has caddied for his father several times, but this is the
first time father and son will work together in contention at a
major. The elder Haas said he had complete faith in his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust him,'' Haas said. ``He agrees with everything I say,
and that's his job as a caddie. On No. 12 today, I was between a
4-iron and a 5-iron. I said, `I think it's a four.' He said, `I
like four.' That's good for me. I have to make the decision
ultimately. And just to have him out there to talk with him, walk
with him, is fun. He's been an inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   The least known of the leaders is Weir, a 29-year-old
left-hander who is looking for his first career victory but who
finished second at the Motorola Western Open in July. This is his
first PGA Championship, and he won't forget it. As his name crept
up the leader board, some fans in his gallery started to sing ``O
Canada.'' Weir's game was better than the singing, as he made six
birdies to reach 10-under par before making bogeys at Nos. 16 and
17.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had told me before the week that I'd shoot 68-68, I
would have taken it,'' said Weir, one of only five left-handed
players on the PGA Tour. ``Hopefully I'll be in this position again
come Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who started the day with a two-stroke lead, shot a 73,
but that score was misleading. Putting was Garcia's downfall, as he
missed birdie attempts from 12 feet, 9 feet, 7 feet, 8 feet, 13
feet and 18 feet. But if he keeps striking the ball as well he did
through the first 36 holes, the championship could still belong to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed, because I probably played better
than I did yesterday,'' Garcia said of his opening-round 66. ``I'm
a little mad because I didn't deserve a 73. But I still have a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for many people, but Haas will wake up
Saturday halfway to a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get that many opportunities to win majors, I don't
care who you are,'' Haas said. ``Obviously, I'm not going to have
20 more chances.''

DEFENDING THE RYDER CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In less than a decade, the once-obscure Ryder Cup match between
the best US and European golfers has become one of the world's
premier sporting events. The reason: It is different. Its format is
varied, including pairs and match play. It occurs every two years
and takes three days, not the four of the weekly tournaments. It is
a team contest; there is no purse for individual players.
</P>
<P>
   So when Germany's Bernhard Langer slid a 6-foot putt past the
last hole on a windy South Carolina course in 1991, he did not lose
$50,000 or $100,000; he lost something much bigger: Europe's claim
to the Ryder Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Continental pride and the drama produced by a series of close
matches in recent years have built a huge following. Much of that
is threatened by several American players whining about money.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing short of a three-day hurricane could prevent this year's
Ryder Cup from being a huge success next month at The Country Club
in Brookline, Mass. But the future of the event will be in jeopardy
if bickering and one-dimensional thinking aren't laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods and David Duval are among those suggesting that the
talent in the event should be better rewarded, at least through
charitable contributions. Their view is understandable from one
perspective. This year's Ryder Cup will gross something over $60
million, according to estimates, with more than $20 million left
after expenses. With this in mind, it might be reasonable for the
organizers to share a bit more with the players.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, however, each player receives $5,000 _ roughly the
amount paid to tour players who make the cut but don't challenge
the leaders _ and automatic qualification for a later, $5 million
tournament. Plus, the Professional Golfers' Association has pledged
$13 million to a new outreach program.
</P>
<P>
   The point that Woods, Duval, and others are missing is this: If
the tournament changes so that the putts are for $100,000 instead
of for team, country, and pride, the Ryder Cup will lose its
uniqueness _ and its success.

GRABBING FOR STRAWS IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If someone tried charging $25 per vote to help elect a
president, he would earn himself universal contempt and possibly
even a jail cell.
</P>
<P>
   But in Iowa they are charging $25 per vote to help nominate a
president. A lot of people are taking it to be a serious exercise
in democracy.
</P>
<P>
   One reporter says George W. Bush ``must win'' the Republican
Party straw poll at the University of Iowa in Ames Saturday evening
and Lamar Alexander ``must do well or die.'' Another reporter says
the straw poll could supplant next year's Iowa caucuses in
narrowing the field.
</P>
<P>
   Such comments should be ridiculous 15 months before the next
election _ and would be, except that the people taking the event
most seriously are the candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has predicted victory and is spending heavily to produce
that result. Pat Buchanan has suggested that some candidacies may
end Saturday night. If the straw poll does have tangible impact, it
will be only because the contestants agreed to be measured on this
bizarre scale.
</P>
<P>
   Big money is far more likely than big ideas to be the winner of
the straw poll, which favors organizers, TV ads, mailings,
transportation, and entertainment, all of which can be purchased. A
planned debate before the straw poll was canceled because too many
of the leading candidates refused to participate. Yet most
long-shot candidates are working the straw poll because the
compressed primary season next spring will be even harder for them.
</P>
<P>
   A straw in the wind indicates which way the wind is blowing, but
only at that moment in that place. A straw man is a scarecrow _
something pretending to be what it is not.
</P>
<P>
   A straw poll is similar. Saturday night's event in Iowa may give
a few thousand paid-for participants more than the snapshot
significance they deserve. In this badly contorted presidential
season, disfigured by big money and a botched calendar, it may be
politics, but it is not democracy.

<P>
   Finally. After shimmering on the horizon for months, impossibly
distant, the vacation begins. How rich a person feels on that first
morning, for there is no greater treasure than time.
</P>
<P>
   A mere Sunday cannot compare with the bonanza of vacation days
stretching languidly into what feels like infinity. No Sunday night
shadow here. No ``leisure'' crammed with ``have-tos.'' The dry
cleaning can wait.
</P>
<P>
   The pulse quickens as one packs the suitcases, then the car,
feeling a little like Marco Polo _ something that rarely happens
when loading up for the weekly trip to the dump. At its start, a
vacation is an uncharted course. Even if a person is returning to
the old cottage or a favorite beach, he or she returns with a new
block of time, capable of yielding all manner of discovery and
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the garage with way too many books wedged into
canvas bags, enough camera and hiking equipment to open a store,
and creative expectations on overdrive _ ``I'll write the first
chapter of the novel!'' _ a person prepares to launch into the
country with no clocks.
</P>
<P>
   But first there is one more tour of the house to check doors,
windows, pet food dishes, plants, and lights. There's the
inevitable hesitancy one feels when turning the last lock, because
it seems as though something vital has been left behind. That
something is, of course, the daily routine with all its demands,
clamoring to go along. Its grip will loosen as the car pulls out of
the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Passing familiar landmarks on the way out of town, the
vacationer smiles, knowing he or she is not going to stop at any of
them, for the luscious new block of free time is transporting car,
passengers, and bulging bags to a place far away from the mundane
neighborhood grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   If the vacation is a good one _ and most of them are _ a person
returning home will see that store as welcoming rather than boring.
The rested spirit regains perspective, which is, after all, the
point. The novel is optional.

AN $80 BILLION GIVEAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 15, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When politicians in Washington talked about ``ending welfare as
we know it,'' they didn't mean the corporate kind. That is
abundantly clear in the $792 billion, 10-year tax cut bill Congress
will send to President Clinton after the summer recess. The bill _
touted as tax relief for the average citizen _ contains more than
$80 billion in new tax breaks for corporations. The lucky
beneficiaries include oil, gas, and timber companies, executives
who eat a lot of business lunches, and firms producing energy from
chicken excrement.
</P>
<P>
   It is a kind of Washington parlor game to juxtapose rhetoric
with reality. When House Speaker Dennis Hastert calls the bill ``a
good deal for the American people,'' is he talking about the
families who pay high electric bills in his state or the utility
companies that will be able to write off the costs of
decommissioning their nuclear power plants to the tune of $1.1
billion?
</P>
<P>
   When Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways
and Means Committee, says the bill ``is about downsizing the power
of Washington and upsizing the power of the people,'' doesn't he
really mean the power of special-interest lobbyists who use
campaign contributions to ensure a favorable tax status for their
clients? Insurance companies, for example, get $1.2 billion in new
tax shelters, and multinational corporations will be able to write
off their interest payments overseas _ a whopping $36 billion in
savings, according to figures provided by the Joint Committee on
Taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Tax breaks are a popular way to give away goodies because they
do not show up as spending programs in the budget. But they are not
free. The provision that increases the write-off for business
meals, for example, will cost $1.3 billion a year _ more than
Massachusetts spends on its entire ``transitional assistance''
welfare program.
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate tax breaks are useful for encouraging research
and development or getting companies to create jobs in blighted
areas. But this bill is bloated with expensive gifts that could
otherwise go to Social Security or health care. It is time for
Washington and corporate America to break this cycle of dependency.

<P>
   The ``Made in USA'' label ought to mean that a garment was not
made in a sweatshop. Too often that is not the case with clothes
made in Saipan, a US outpost in the central Pacific. The settlement
of a lawsuit guarantees that there will be independent monitoring
of factories in the US Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, including Saipan, but it is not enough to guarantee that
workers are protected from substandard wages and working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is a step toward focusing attention on the
Northern Marianas, where loopholes in federal law allow textile
companies to import foreign workers with no regard to immigration
laws and to pay them the local minimum wage, which at $3.05 an hour
is $2.10 less than the federal figure. Many end up working 70 or 80
hours a week without overtime and live in crowded, company-owned
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   Saipan, largest island in the Northern Marianas, is also
attractive to manufacturers because they avoid tariffs and can
market their products as if they were made in the 50 states. They
import thousands of workers who are grateful for the $3.05 an hour.
Local and federal labor protections are not vigorously enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement by four companies, including Nordstrom and J.
Crew, to settle the suit offers hope that working conditions will
improve. Verite, an Amherst-based group that will monitor the
settlement, will face formidable obstacles in establishing a
permanent presence on an island that is closer to China than the US
mainland. It may also face problems with an indigenous power
structure that has close ties to garment manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this private initiative, the federal government should
improve its efforts to monitor the enforcement of labor laws, and
Congress needs to look closely at the minimum wage exception.
Representative George Miller of California has filed a bill that
would raise the Northern Marianas wage to the federal level. This
could prompt Saipan's factories to move to a nation where the wage
is even lower, and the economy of the islands would be weaker.
Still, the federal $5.15 minimum is hardly munificent, and if
``Made in the USA'' is to mean anything, it ought to imply a
commitment to this basic standard of pay.

JEAN DRAPEAU, 83, LONGTIME MAYOR WHO RESHAPED MONTREAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean Drapeau, who in nearly three decades as the autocratic
mayor of Montreal brought both grandeur and grandiosity to his
city, died Aug. 12. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Drapeau, who left office in 1986, had been in fragile health
since suffering a stroke several years ago. He had been in the
hospital since July 5. Throughout Canada, Drapeau is remembered as
the mayor who turned Montreal from a declining, crime-beleaguered
city into an international gem by bringing it a subway, a world's
fair, an Olympics, a Major League Baseball team and remarkable
architectural projects.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Bourque, the current mayor, observed that when Drapeau
became mayor in 1954, ``parts of the city were very poor and
Montreal was a divided city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought Montreal into the Modern Age.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, said Drapeau had won ``a
rightful place among the ranks of the finest leaders and statesmen
that Canada has ever produced.''
</P>
<P>
   More muted, but nonetheless evident in public recollections,
were mentions of some of Drapeau's more quixotic and extravagant
projects that continued to burden the city with debt long after he
left office. The most striking example of both the heady days of
preening in the 1960s and '70s and the fiscal hangover that
followed in the '80s is the stadium with the retractable roof that
was built for the 1976 Olympics at a cost that Drapeau originally
projected at $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   By 1991, when a 55-ton chunk of concrete fell from the outer
wall of the stadium, forcing the Montreal Expos to find another
place for their home games, the bill for its building and repair
had risen to $2 billion, forcing city residents to pay a special
property tax. A federal Canadian commission investigating the
Olympic expenditures laid most of the blame for vast overruns on
Drapeau, charging that no cost limit were ever set by him.
</P>
<P>
   For his part Drapeau dismissed such criticism by saying, ``The
Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby.``
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his reign, some extravagant projects reduced
his popularity and criticisms sprouted. Nick Auf Der Maur, an
elected councilman and a columnist for the Montreal Gazette, who
praised the mayor for having been ``a master builder,'' scorned his
go-it-alone style of governance. He said he and 56 other councilmen
were being paid salaries of $22,000 a year ``to come down once
every two or three months and approve two or three hundred
resolutions the Mayor had put together.``
</P>
<P>
   In an obituary Friday in The Montreal Gazette, Drapeau was
likened to Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago as ``the last of a breed
of North American big-city bosses.`` But as a boss, he had his own
style, projecting the modesty of a neighborhood fellow who drove
his own car, lived in the house he always lived in and retired on a
city pension of $29,000 and valued his own counsel above any other.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his career the mix worked well, both to build up
Montreal and its allure and to secure Drapeau's reputation, not as
a great democrat, but as a man who changed the face of a great
metropolis. Once, he had described his vision: ``Let Toronto be
Milan and Montreal can be Rome.``
</P>
<P>
   And indeed despite the questionable projects, there were many
more successes: the rubber-wheeled subway, the towers of Place
Ville-Marie, the Habitat housing complex designed by Moshe Safdie.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Bourque noted that Drapeau also ``improved quality of
life by planting trees, creating parks and opening swimming
pools.`` Years ago, Drapeau had spoken of what the grandeur of a
city can mean to even its poorest residents. ``People's lives do
not have to be drab and dreary and wrapped in old newspapers. They
deserve something for the soul and noble visions.``
</P>
<P>
   A man of medium height with a pencil mustache and dark eyes and
a presence that The New Yorker once described as ``commanding
without being aggressive,'' Drapeau was a descendant of French
settlers who arrived in Montreal in 1642, the year it was founded.
</P>
<P>
   In a city then known for its gangsters, bordellos and gambling,
Drapeau became a crusading prosecutor, and was elected mayor in
1954 as the candidate of the Civic Action League. In office he
stressed vigorous law enforcement and achieved a reduction in crime
statistics. A passionate opera lover, he also put through his first
big building project, a 3,000-seat concert hall whose financing and
location had been a matter of inconclusive debate for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Drapeau soon came into conflict with the City
Council and the Quebec political machine led by Maurice Duplessis,
who defeated him in 1957. Regaining the mayor's office in 1960, he
began a streak of triumphs that ended only when he stepped down 26
years later. This tenure coincided with Quebec's silent revolution,
a period of French Canadian resurgence in which the power of the
Catholic Church and Duplessis lessened sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Drapeau quickly found ways to reduce the prerogatives of the
Council and intensified his building program. A few days after Le
Metro, the transit system opened in 1966, a mayoral election was
held in which Drapeau won his fourth term by a vote that fell just
short of unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marie-Claire, whom he married in
1945, and his sons, Pierre, Michel and Francois.

COMMENTARY: WHAT TONY SOPRANO COULD TEACH BILL CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CHANGES ``possiblity'' to ``notion'' in 5th graf) (Eds., in 1st graf, the double parentheses should be set as single
brackets) 
(yn) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this late date in the Bill Clinton melodrama, it's no scoop
that the man has long been in serious need of a good shrink. If
anything, the compulsive lying may be the least of his aberrations.
I'm still amazed that so little has been made of this curious
sentence in the Starr report: ``The longer conversations ((between
the president and Monica Lewinsky)) often occurred after their
sexual contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there another man in creation who talks to women more after
sex than before?
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a scoop that Clinton's ills are rooted in his
childhood, since that's the case with most troubled people, not
just a reckless, cigar-fixated product of the redolently Freudian
venue of Hot Springs, Ark. The real question raised by the entire
Talk magazine fracas is why a man of his age, resources and
intelligence _ not to mention public duties _ has not had proper
help for a treatable condition. Had he sought it, he, his family
and the country would all be happier today.
</P>
<P>
   This question, however, was rarely raised in the fatuous debate
over whether Hillary Rodham Clinton had made an ``abuse excuse''
for her husband by citing his travails as a 4-year-old to her Talk
interviewer, Lucinda Franks. That debate was easily resolved: it's
there in black and white that Ms. Franks, not Mrs. Clinton, brought
up the subject of Bill Clinton's rough childhood, and it's also
there in black and white that Mrs. Clinton said of her husband,
``He's responsible for his own behavior whether I'm there or 100
miles away.'' But if the First Lady was guilty of only trying to
explain her husband's history and not, as was widely charged, of
floating an excuse for his adult transgressions, she, like him, is
hardly off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has some dysfunction in their families,'' Mrs.
Clinton also says in Talk. ``They have to deal with it. You don't
just walk away if you love someone _ you help the person.'' Those
are the right things to say, but there's no evidence either in the
highly detailed interview or the public record or in her husband's
now excessively documented private behavior that Mrs. Clinton
actually helped steer her husband to effective professional help,
despite her stated knowledge of the symptoms and history of what
she calls his ``weakness.'' Though the president did submit to some
welcome pastoral counseling _ or at least did so once the
impeachment wolf was at his door _ the White House has repeatedly
knocked down the notion that he has received any psychological
treatment from a doctor. Instead, as Ms. Franks reports, enabling
and denial still rule, even now: ``Public office has prevented the
president from seeking therapy, but friends told me they expect him
to after leaving the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about too little, too late. This is compartmentalization at
its most self-destructive. Public office should no more prevent a
president from seeking psychotherapy than it should prevent him
from seeking chemotherapy. And the Clintons, of all people, should
know that better than anyone _ they've made mental-health care a
political cause. In the 1992 campaign they joined with Al and
Tipper Gore to court boomers by talking openly of their past
experiences with family counseling, occasioned by the drug bust of
Clinton's half-brother and the hospitalization of the Gores' son
after he was hit by a car. ``By not confronting problems early,''
Clinton said all too prophetically at that time, ``you end up
making things worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly _ and just two months ago _ the Clintons and the Gores
held a full-day White House Conference on Mental Health. The
supposed point of that event, they said, was to counter the myths
of mental illness, thereby encouraging the frightened or
embarrassed to seek help. ``Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed
of, but stigma and bias shame us all,'' said Clinton in a radio
address. If mental illness is left untreated, he said at the
conference, ``the loss of human potential is staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his lofty preaching to the rest of us, perhaps it was
fear of just such bias that explains (but does not excuse)
Clinton's inability to seek treatment for his own condition, even
at the cost of putting himself and everyone around him through
hell. Perhaps he felt that while a sports hero like Mark McGwire or
a TV news star like Mike Wallace or even the country's most popular
fictional Mafia boss, Tony Soprano, can flourish after going public
with their mental-health histories, such revelations still condemn
a chief executive to charges of weakness. But isn't it weaker to
let one's emotional problems metastasize rather than address them?
What does it say about our culture that it may be easier for a
president to live down having oral sex with an intern in the Oval
Office than having oral discourse in a doctor's office?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lynn Rivers of Michigan, the only current member of the
House or Senate to talk openly about battling a mental illness
(manic depression, for 20 years), points out that politicians would
rather admit to alcoholism or drug abuse than to receiving
psychiatric care, even perhaps for a milder ailment. The record
does not contradict her. She and the late Florida Gov. Lawton
Chiles are the only two front-rank American politicians to be open
about their histories since Thomas Eagleton was thrown off the
Democratic ticket in 1972 after admitting he had been treated for
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it could be argued that we are retrogressing rather than
progressing in attitudes about mental illness in public life.
Joshua Wolf Shenk, who is writing a book about Abraham Lincoln's
lifelong bout with what would now be diagnosed as depression, notes
that Lincoln called melancholy ``a misfortune not a fault.''
Lincoln wrote and spoke openly of his ``moods &AMP; gloom,'' Shenk
says, and friends regarded that melancholy as a source of concern
and sadness, but not shame.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the White House conference, Tipper Gore tried to
counter the taboos that can surround mental illness by going public
about her own experience with depression. But for all her good work
on behalf of this issue, Mrs. Gore gave a mixed message similar to
that of the Clintons. As the otherwise approving Rivers puts it,
the vice president's wife ``could have contributed more by being
more specific.'' Mrs. Gore refused to describe the duration or most
details of her treatment, and was careful at each stop of her
staged self-outing, from USA Today to ``Oprah,'' to avoid use of
the word ``doctor,'' let alone a doctor whose professional title
might include the prefix ``psych-.'' (She said she had been treated
by a social worker rather than a psychiatric social worker.) Even
as Mrs. Gore made a cause of stamping out the shame associated with
being treated for mental illness, her mystifying circumlocutions
sent the signal, consciously or not, that she wasn't entirely free
of shame herself.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of Washington's halting efforts to address this
subject _ and most lawmakers would prefer to avoid it altogether _
can be far more profound than the Starr report. The more
obfuscation and fear that surround mental illnesses of all types
and their treatment, the less hope we have of ameliorating public
policy and prejudices that leave these illnesses undertreated,
untreated and mistreated. At the gravest end of the mental-health
spectrum, this failure produces catastrophes that are fast becoming
a fixture of the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Columbine, no one stated our predicament
more acutely than Dr. W. Walter Menninger, of the famed clinic
bearing his family's name in Topeka, Kan. Speaking to the American
Psychiatric Association in Washington, he pinpointed the national
hypocrisy: ``We recognize incidents of mental illness, and at the
same time we stigmatize people who suffer from it or seek help to
deal with it. We say `seek treatment,' but at the same time we
limit access, and availability, and insurance to pay for it, and in
the end make it more difficult to get treatment. There is a
disconnectedness between what we say we need as a society and what
we do as a society.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of this schism between words and actions, and the
piecemeal mental-health system it leads to, cut across all
demographic and cultural lines. As the White House sex farce was
preventable, so, conceivably, was the tragic rampage of this week's
shooter, the latest human time bomb who appears to have entered
that so-called system only to fall through its cracks.

IMPERILED WALK OF FAME HAS HOPEFUL SECOND REEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Florence Otway's little slab of movie-star history on
St. Marks Place, her 50-foot-long homage to actresses who once had
Betty Boop eyes and ultrashort, ultrawavy hair, got a reprieve from
repaving Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Department of Transportation, who on
Thursday called the strip of cement signatures a safety hazard,
said Friday that a work crew would sidestep that sidewalk when it
replaced the others in the East Village next month. Mrs. Otway's
husband, Howard, created the sidewalk in 1971 when he turned a
theater at 80 St. Marks Place into a revival house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have the contractor go over there,'' the
Transportation Department spokesman, Mark Patterson, said. ``We're
not going to do that. We'll tell them not to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reprieve _ sparing imprints from the likes of Ruby
Keeler, Myrna Loy and two Joans, Crawford and Blondell _ may only
be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department told Mrs. Otway that she must fill
out a ``sidewalk, curb and roadway application'' and that the
sidewalk would have to be approved by the city's Art Commission, an
11-member panel whose duties include screening and approving
proposals for landscape architecture and ``street furniture'' on
city-owned property. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is an ex officio
member.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what the Art Commission's standards for
sidewalks are. Calls to the commission were not returned Friday;
the mayor's press office said that the commission's executive
director, Deborah Bershad, was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said that if the Art Commission approved the
application, it would go back to the Transportation Department.
``We will meet with the applicant to enter into an agreement
whereby any responsibility for liability for maintenance is
transferred from the city to the owner of the property,'' he said.
``It's up to them afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Otway said that was more or less what she was told by Leon
W. Heyward, the deputy commissioner for street and arterial
maintenance, who rang her doorbell shortly before 5 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They went outside to look at Mrs. Otway's shrine to pert faces
and velvet voices of the silver screen _ and, in a sense, to her
husband, an actor and author who died in 1994. ``It was raining,
and water was collecting in the little round heel,'' she said. ``It
was either Ruby Keeler or Joan Blondell. He said a woman in high
heels could trip and fall there. I've never in 28 years known
anyone to catch a heel there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Transportation Department softened its position
_ on Thursday, the agency had said it would remove the sidewalk if
Mrs. Otway did not repair it _ preservationists were defending it
as a near-landmark. (It is too new for landmark status. The
Landmarks Preservation Commission does not consider anything under
30.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Grauman's, but not nearly as organized,'' said Frank
E. Sanchis 3rd, the executive director of the Municipal Art
Society, an organization that has championed historic preservation
in New York City. ``It's a patchwork. There's garbage cans sitting
on top of some of them and Ruby Keeler's footprints were filled
with cigarette butts when I went by.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, it was well worth saving. ``It's one of those
little things that makes life more interesting,'' he said.

Boeing, sees its civilian experience as its ace in the hole in the
Joint Strike Fighter competition. It figures it's in a better
position than Lockheed to bring a commercially oriented mentality
to a program that is heavily cost-driven.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the competition ``will allow us to do what we do best
for the next 30 to 40 years for the benefit of the free world,''
said Frank Statkus, Boeing's manager for the program. ``We do not
anticipate losing the JSF.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Lockheed, Boeing has taken its knocks recently. The company
was battered by its decision to overproduce commercial jets at
bargain basement prices to gain global market share. The strategy
boomeranged into billion-dollar losses, even as its rival, Europe's
Airbus Industrie, ate into Boeing's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, executives at Boeing, which has received $662 million
from the Pentagon for its version of the fighter, say they know how
to build affordable aircraft that can be maintained at low cost.
Already, they say, Boeing can ship parts to any airline anywhere in
the world within two hours to cut costly down time, and they have
begun a similar program for the C-17 military cargo plane.
</P>
<P>
   They say, too, that the company is well schooled in building a
single plane in different flavors for different customers on a
single production line. For example, the commercial 777 is
available in three versions with many common parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis this time is not on higher, faster, bigger or
better, but on affordability,'' said David Brower, who is in charge
of cost control on the fighter project.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's campus-like setting here certainly is more civilian
than military in its feel, with the aura of a quiet engineering
think tank. The uniform is khakis and polo shirts with Boeing logos
_ and lots of plastic tags around workers' necks.
</P>
<P>
   The company contends that it is building affordability into its
design; for instance, executives say, Boeing's lift system for the
Marine version of the fighter is safer, simpler and lower in cost
than the Lockheed version.
</P>
<P>
   They dismiss criticism that overall design changes have been so
dramatic that the demonstrator plane to be flown next year will
look little like Boeing's final proposal. Changing from a bat wing
to a conventional tail has saved weight, added flexibility and made
the plane easier to land on carrier decks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a design change,'' said John L. Priday, manager of
Boeing's Phantom Works in Palmdale, Calif. ``It's a maturation of
the design process.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Boeing begs to disagree with anyone who thinks the
company has shortchanged design in its jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cool plane,'' said Brower, a former military pilot.
``Pilots want a robust plane to engage and kill a target without
putting themselves in harm's way. And if they do get in harm's way,
they want to be able to defend themselves. I look at it, and I wish
I were an aviator again.''

LOCKHEED'S TICKET TO THE FUTURE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The nation's biggest military contractor,
Lockheed Martin, has a long history of making fighters, but lately
the company has been hammered on a number of fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Its bread-and-butter product, the F-16, is coming to the end of
its production cycle, with around 4,000 planes already made. The
future of the F-22, on which Lockheed is the prime contractor, is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The company has suffered production delays on its C-130J
military cargo plane and has experienced costly launch failures in
its military missile program.
</P>
<P>
   So the view from Fort Worth, where Lockheed's version of the
Joint Strike Fighter is being designed and where the F-16 is made
in a mile-long plant that could, someday, turn out the new plane,
is that this program is the ticket to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the fighter house of America,'' said James A.
Blackwell, president of Lockheed's aeronautics sector. ``The Joint
Strike Fighter is the future of this house. Our corporation has
made it the top business priority, bar none. There's no one that
doesn't work on JSF daily.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Blot, Lockheed's deputy program manager for Joint Strike
Fighter, added: ``This is the main design effort for the next
century in tactical aircraft. Unless you are designing this, there
are not many other things out there to design. We need to be prime
on this program.''
</P>
<P>
   With that level of urgency, Lockheed is spending $719 million in
government funds to develop a relatively traditional-looking plane
that resembles a scaled-down F-22. Its major innovation is in the
Marine version, where the vertical lift-off system allows for a
heavier plane with a smaller engine.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Lockheed's Fort Worth facility is like coming to a
military installation. Officers from around the world fill the
lobby _ South Africa's defense minister, a delegation from Britain
and one from the United Arab Emirates were all there on a single
day. Tall, slim men in test pilots' jump suits wander the hallways.
</P>
<P>
   The company says this activity sets it apart from Boeing _ a
sign of its longstanding ties to foreign military buyers and its
history as more of a military than a commercial airplane maker.
</P>
<P>
   Long dogged by cost overruns on its military projects, Lockheed
is engaged in a large-scale re-engineering effort on the factory
floor where F-16s are churned out.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese-style production techniques have helped cut the
manufacturing cost of each F-16 to around $25 million, a 40 percent
reduction in the last decade, even with lower production runs,
according to a recent congressional report. Blue-collar workers
with Texas twangs now sprinkle their language with terms like
kaizan, meaning continuous improvement, and talk about
Japanese-style meetings in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this new corporate attention to costs, Lockheed still
managed to roll up $100 million in overruns on the Joint Strike
Fighter program _ some because of accounting problems, some due to
production issues. By altering its plans for how it will use its
two concept planes to demonstrate the three versions of the fighter
in next year's flyoff, the company is back within budget.
</P>
<P>
   With such a strong emphasis on costs in the program, Lockheed
knows it cannot win on the plane's performance alone. Just off the
factory floor, the company is building a display for workers about
the benefits of ``lean manufacturing.'' The final panel? A mock
front page of The Fort Worth Star-Telegram with the headline,
``Lockheed Wins the J.S.F. Contract.''
