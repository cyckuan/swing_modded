<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Visits Auto Tech PSE '96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China should enhance its own
automobile development capability by promoting international
cooperation, making best use of advanced manufacturing technology
from around the world, Premier Li Peng said today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Auto Tech PSE '96, an international automobile
presentation, symposium and exhibition (PSE) in Beijing today, Li
cited the automobile industry as one of the country's backbone
industries with wide prospects.
</P>
<P>
But its developments should be adapted to China's own
conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Jiang Chunyun, a vice-premier, and Luo Gan, a
state councillor, concurrently secretary general of the State
Council, Li visited exhibits from China and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In introducing and applying new technology, he said, China
should pay special attention to cutting down fuel consumption and
pollution. The prices for the auto products should also be
affordable for ordinary consumers.
</P>
<P>
To do this, he said, China have to work hard to cut down the
cost of auto production.
</P>
<P>
At the sponsorship of the Ministry of Machine-building
Industry, Auto Tech PSE '96 has drawn world famous auto makers,
computer companies and designing firms from such countries as the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the Republic of
Korea, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Suspends Work in Burundi After Staff Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) announced Wednesday the suspension of all its
humanitarian activities in Burundi in response to the killing of
three delegates there Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three ICRC Swiss workers, all in their thirties, were
killed when their vehicles came under fire Tuesday afternoon near
the village of Mugina in Burundi's northern province of
Cibitoke. They were returning to the capital Bujumbura from a
mission to investigate drinking water shortages in Cibitoke.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said it was extremely shocked by the tragedy and
strongly condemned the attack, with its flagrant failure to
respect the Red Cross emblem.
</P>
<P>
Separately, a UN press release quoted UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali as saying he was "shocked to learn of the
killing of ICRC workers in Burundi" and condemned this wanton act
of violence "in the strongest terms."
</P>
<P>
He called on the parties to refrain from further acts of
violence and to allow the humanitarian agencies to carry out their
work for Burundi unhindered.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the international community to support
efforts towards attaining peace and reconciliation in Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Accused of Disputing Greek Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece today continued to accuse its
neighboring Turkey of disputing its sovereignty over the islands
in the Aegean, including the island of Gavdos off southern Crete.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said that NATO and
European Union officials were stunned on learning that Turkey had
described the area south of Crete, and in particular the island of
Gavdos, as a "disputed area."
</P>
<P>
A Turkish naval officer requested Monday that Gavdos be
excluded from the planning of a NATO exercise scheduled for
September, claiming that it constituted a "disputed area."
</P>
<P>
Pangalos was speaking to reporters after talks with his
visiting Cyprus counterpart, Alekos Michalilides.
</P>
<P>
Turkey should realize "at what level of seriousness its views
are," Pangalos said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's Defense Minister Gerassimos Arsenis
described Turkey's stance on the Gavdos issue as "ludicrous" and
said NATO officials now understood that Ankara's behavior was "not
only targeted against Greece but was also creating problems for
the operation of the alliance itself."
</P>
<P>
"With its behavior, Turkey is trying to create a general
climate of questioning the status quo in the greater area of the
Aegean. Greece is ready to confront the challenge," Arsenis said.
</P>
<P>
Gavdos' community leader Theofilos Tsirintakis declared at a
press conference in Crete today that the island "is an integral
part of Greek territory and this has not been disputed by anyone
ever."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Gavdos would lodge strong protests with all
relevant international organizations while he himself would visit
EU countries and the United Nations to raise the issue of
"Turkish provocations."

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Study on Health Effects of Electric-Magnetic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
announced Wednesday that it has launched an international project
to assess health and environmental effects of exposure to electric
and magnetic fields (EMF).
</P>
<P>
The new project has been initiated by the WHO in response to
growing concerns in many countries over possible health effects
from exposure to an ever-increasing number and diversity of EMF
sources.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said the conflict between such concerns and
technological progress has been hindering development in this area
and led to considerable economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Electrical utilities in many countries have had to divert
around populated areas and construction of high voltage
transmission lines has even been halted. The installation of base
stations for mobile telephones is also being obstructed, the WHO
said.
</P>
<P>
Measures to keep electric and magnetic fields to a minimum are
costly, while research into the biological effects of exposure to
EMF is often duplicated and unfocused, the UN health agency said.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that concerns about EMF and health are
costing the United States alone some one billion dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
"It has become increasingly evident that only an
internationally coordinated project can help resolve the
controversy over the issue," said Wilfried Kreisel, the WHO's
Executive Director responsible for environmental health programs.
</P>
<P>
The new project, tentatively scheduled to last five years, will
pool current knowledge and available resources of key
international and national agencies to arrive at independent
conclusions, the WHO said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sees Lower Inflation Rate in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's consumer price index
rose by 0.06 percent in May after an increase of 0.78 percent in
April, Information Minister Harmoko said here today.
</P>
<P>
The slight increase of inflation in May meant the year-on-year

9.99 percent in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
The country posted an inflation rate of 4.1 percent from
January to May, Harmoko said after a monthly cabinet meeting on

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan to Become Greener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has embarked on an
ambitious tree plantation campaign to make the country greener,
fresher and more environment-friendly.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, the government of Pakistan has
finalized a plan to invest about 21 billion rupees (600 million US
dollars) in environmental protection projects, an amount equals to
what the government spent in its budget for 1995-96 on law and
order, community services and social services.
</P>
<P>
The tree plantation campaign is aimed at 10 percent forest
coverage of the country's total landscape.
</P>
<P>
Under the massive afforestation project, as many as 546 million
saplings are to be planted in over 1.5 million acres of land.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, a country of 130 million people and a landmass of
88.2 million hectares, only 32 percent of the 68 million hectares
of land surveyed has been found cultivable. Forests cover an area
of a little over five percent against the world standards of 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
More alarming has been the fact that deforestation is carried
out at the rate of almost 8,000 to 9,000 hectares annually, which
represents a 0.2 percent decline in forests per annum.
</P>
<P>
A number of tree plantation programs have been kicked off under
the massive afforestation project to make the country greener and
fresher.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani army has been entrusted with the Rachna Doab
afforestation project, which envisages block plantation of over
25,000 acres. This would serve as a model tree plantation project
for the country.
</P>
<P>
The National Highway Authority (NHA) has chalked out a
comprehensive, systematic, long-term and self-sustaining plan for
tree plantation.
</P>
<P>
The project is contracted to various private companies which
are responsible for supporting and taking care of the plants for
five years after plantation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 million trees are being planted along the
national highways by the NHA in the year 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Environment Protection Council (PEPC) has asked
the government for zero duty on the import of wood, which will
discourage tree cutting and effectively hit the country's timber
mafia who are actively engaged in timber smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to check the menace of tree cutting
by introducing tough legislation, which may include the
confiscation of vehicles caught smuggling timber along with
imprisonment to the owners of the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Cabinet will soon discuss paper recycling in all
the public departments as well as in the private sector to save
trees.
</P>
<P>
However, more work needs to be done to tackle other forms of
pollution. It is hoped that more efforts will be mobilized and
more resources will be made available to turn Pakistan into a more
environment-friendly nation.

<HEADLINE> Global FDI Flows in 1995 Surge to All-Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide foreign direct investment
(FDI) flows surged to an all-time high in 1995, but the developing
South still received a much smaller share of the total FDI than
the developed North, latest U.N. data said.
</P>
<P>
The global FDI flows were estimated at 325 billion U.S. dollars
in 1995, a 46 percent rise over 1994, preliminary U.N. Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) data released Tuesday showed.
</P>
<P>
Following their emergence from a period of slow growth and
boosted by a new wave of mergers and acquisitions, FDI inflows to
the developed countries reached an estimated 216 billion dollars
in 1995. The United States led the way with record inflows of 75
billion and record outflows of 97 billion.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries registered an estimated 97 billion in FDI
inflows, a record high. And the transitional economies of Central
and Eastern Europe received twice as much FDI in 1995 as in 1994,
an estimated 12 billion, also the highest figure on record.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD pointed out that both in developing countries and
Central and Eastern Europe, a small number of countries accounted
for a large part of the increases in FDI inflows: China,
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand in the former group and the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Russia in the latter group.
</P>
<P>
According to UNCTAD analysis, the unprecedented level of global
FDI flows in 1995 suggests that the speed of globalization of
production by trans-national corporations may be accelerating.
</P>
<P>
Extensive data and analysis of the 1995 global FDI flows will
be provided by the UNCTAD in its annual World Investment Report to
be published at the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> US Company to Invest 33 Million Pounds in Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland has secured its
first big foreign investment since the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
broke its cease-fire in February.
</P>
<P>
The news came with the announcement Tuesday of a 33 million
pound (50 million U.S. dollar) project by Copeland, a U.S.
electrical company.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reported today that Copeland, the world's
biggest manufacturer of compressors for the air conditioning and
refrigeration markets, is to set up a factory in Cookstown, County
Tyrone of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
It expects to start construction in August with production
starting early next year, employing an initial workforce of 300.
</P>
<P>
This is Cookstown's first foreign investment and a boost for
this remote part of Northern Ireland and one of its unemployment
black spots.
</P>
<P>
John Mcguckian, chairman of the Northern Ireland Industrial
Development Board, said the investment by Copeland was "a very
substantial endorsement of Northern Ireland."
</P>
<P>
The investment in Northern Ireland would allow Copeland to meet
the growing demand of its European customers, said Robert Novello,
chairman of Copeland.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Navy Ships Pay Goodwill Visit to Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Two Iranian navy ships arrived at
the port of Doha in Qatar on the opposite rim of the Gulf for a
friendly visit, an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA said that it is the first time
in the past 17 years for the Iranian navy ships to make such
goodwill visit.
</P>
<P>
The ships crew were welcomed at the port by Qatar navy
officials, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day visit of the ships is aimed at strengthening
fraternal ties between the two countries. Talks between the
high-ranking Qatar and Iranian navy officers are also scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Iranian warships launched such
visit in a bid to develop relations with neighboring countries,
including Qatar, against the influence by the United States and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iran attacked the United States for stepping up its war games
in the Gulf by moving an armored brigade into Qatar for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
The first elements of around 101 M1a2 Abram Tanks and Bradley
armored fighting vehicles were reported to have been delivered to
two facilities in Doha in early January.
</P>
<P>
Iran also lashed out at recent Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres' visit to Qatar and Oman, saying that the visits were not in
the interests of the regional governments and nations.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Formally Declared Election Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Central Election
Committee (CEC) today has officially declared Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu the winner of the May 29 elections for prime
minister, formalizing the announcement made by the committee last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The official final results of the elections were issued late
this afternoon by the CEC following a meeting of the committee
held in Jerusalem to sum up its works.
</P>
<P>
According to the results, Netanyahu had received 50.49 percent
of the total votes, and Labor Party's candidate Shimon Peres,
current prime minister, received 49.51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had won 29,457 votes more than his opponent, in a
narrow lead under 1 percent, in the first ever held direct
election for prime minister in the history of Israel.
</P>
<P>
As for the numbers of seats for the parties which have entered
the 120-member Knesset (parliament), there were no changes from
the results announced last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The final results indicated that the Labor Party will have 34
seats in the new Knesset, while Likud 32, the religious parties
23, Meretz 9, Yisrael Ba'aliya 7, Hadash 5, Third Way 4, United
Arab List 4, and Moledet 2.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israeli Basic Law, Prime Minister-elect
Netanyahu will form a new government within 45 days after the
official publication of the election results.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was reportedly trying to form his new cabinet
in 10 days, has already ordered Likud Director-General Avigdor
Lieberman to conduct the first round of coalition negotiations in
the last two days
</P>
<P>
Reports said he would have no trouble in forming a coalition
with the religious bloc, Yisrael Ba'aliya, the new immigrant
party, and the Third Way, a new group initiated by hawkish
Laborites.
</P>
<P>
However, with portfolio allocation in the offing, tension in
all potential coalition partners is rising, especially within the
Likud where no one has a clue about Netanyahu's intentions.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expects Action from Ghali-Denktash Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government would like
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to tell Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash that there must be action, and not
words, in solving the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
This position was stated today by Cyprus Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides just one day before a meeting between
Boutros-Ghali and Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The minister said "we have to enter a process to find common
ground on the fundamental issues of the Cyprus question, because
22 years is too long a time. It is high time the problem was
settled."
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali and Denktash were scheduled to meet today in
Istanbul, Turkey, on the sidelines of the U.N. Second Conference
on Human Settlements (Habitat II).
</P>
<P>
The meeting was postponed for Thursday morning because
Boutros-Ghali was taken ill with food poisoning, according to the
Turkish press.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot press reported today that Denktash intends
to submit his positions on a Cyprus settlement to the
U.N. Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief will have a similar meeting with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides on June 11 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
In New York, U.N. Secretary-General's spokesperson Sylvana Foa
said the newly-appointed special representative for Cyprus, Han
Sung-Joo, will attend the Geneva meeting.
</P>
<P>
Foa said the U.N. chief would not be presenting any new ideas
to Clerides and Denktash but would be listening to the two sides,
"trying to find a common denominator from which to start a new
phase of negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of 37 percent of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
This month will witness an active diplomacy on the Cyprus
problem, with a visit to the U.S. by Cyprus President Clerides for
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton and a later
meeting with British Prime Minister John Major.

<HEADLINE> No Agreement on Agenda in Chechnya Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian officials and Chechen rebels
failed to agree on the agenda of peace talks as negotiations
entered the second day.
</P>
<P>
The Russians want the talks to focus on military issues but the
rebels insist that political issues should also be on the agenda
of the talks being held in Nazran, capital of Ingushetia
neighboring the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the talks is to implement the ceasefire
agreement reached between Russian president Boris Yeltsin and
separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev at their May 27 meeting in
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss the release of prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation is headed by Nationalities Minister
Vyacheslav Mikhailov and includes parliamentarian Vladimir Zorin
and Sergei Slipchenko, spokesman for Russia's state commission on
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen delegation is headed by Said-Hassan Abumuslimov,
the separatists' new vice president. Rebel information chief
Movladi Udugov and field commander Aslan Maskhadov are also
attending the talks.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, the rebels demanded that Russian troops
pull out of Chechnya immediately, saying only a troop withdrawal
could assure the implementation of the May 27 truce agreement.
</P>
<P>
The rebels also demanded the cancellation of parliamentary
elections in Chechnya scheduled for June 16 which will coincide
with the presidential election in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Fighting continued in Chechnya after the truce became effective
midnight Friday and each side has accused the other of breaking
the ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Supply Financial Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan will channel financial aid to
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) through the
United Nations in response to an expected appeal to help the
country overcome food shortages, Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The assistance will be provided through the U.N. as
humanitarian aid and will be handled separately from the bilateral
rice aid issue, Kyodo said, quoting government sources.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money to be granted will be determined in
consultation with South Korea, it said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Young Sam has asked Tokyo to discuss
the issue with Seoul before deciding on any aid to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the DPRK have no diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Japan provided 500,000 U.S. dollars to Pyongyang last year in
response to a U.N. call for such aid.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters earlier today
that his government should extend some assistance to the DPRK from
a humanitarian point of view.
</P>
<P>
Japan agreed last year to supply 500,000 tons of rice to the
country, including 150,000 tons free of charge, on condition that
it was for civilian use only.

<HEADLINE> EU to Ease Ban on Exports of British Beef By-Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission agreed in
principle today to partially lift the ban on exports of British
beef by-products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it urged Britain to abandon its policy of
obstructing the European Union (EU) business.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the farm ministers of the 15 EU
countries failed to come to a decision on easing the ban on
gelatine, tallow and bull semen at a meeting in Luxembourg Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
Under EU rules, the issue will automatically go to the EU
Commission.
</P>
<P>
"The commission has assumed its responsibility in partially
lifting the embargo. It now expects the UK to immediately
de-escalate from its position," Commission President Jacques
Santer said.
</P>
<P>
The exemption of gelatine, tallow and bull semen from the
worldwide ban on British beef, ordered by the EU Commission on
March 27 for fears over Mad Cow Disease, will become formal on
June 10.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urged to Boost Trade With Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain should build up its trading
links with developing countries such as India and China rather
than pooling more resources with Europe, according to a British
Treasury strategy document.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today said the internal Treasury paper
suggested that if present growth rates continue, by 2015 India,
Brazil, Indonesia and Thailand will have overtaken Britain in the
league table of world economies.
</P>
<P>
The paper did not question Britain's continued membership of
the European Union (EU). However, it looked at whether Britain
should continue to develop its trade policy through the EU and
other international institutions such as the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
It asked, "Whether our interest is best served in the longer run
by hitching our wagon to the EU and international finance
institutions or by going it alone?"
</P>
<P>
When Britain gives aid to developing countries, it should do it
under its own initiative, rather than through institutions such as
the EU, the paper suggested. There is a better chance of a
flow-back from such aid if it is given under the "British"
label, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that a Treasury posting to Delhi should be restored and
staff should be sent to other key embassies such as Peking, Tokyo
and Moscow to boost British business links there.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury denied that it suggested Britain would be better
off outside the EU. However, it emphasized that Britain must look
towards the growing economies in Asia, South America and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
A government source said, "We need to realize they will be
serious players in the world economy in the next century."

KUALA LUMPUR, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia on Tuesday expressed
its ambition to conquer Mount Qomolangma, the highest peak in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday night
launched a national project aiming at making Malaysia the first
Southeast Asian country to conquer Qomolangma.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, 20 Malaysian mountaineerers will try to
plant the Malaysian flag at the 8,848-meter-high summit in May

</P>
<P>
It was reported that the project is a brainchild of Mahathir,
who once said: "We must have confidence to achieve all of our
dreams. This includes climbing Mountain Qomolangma, sailing across
the Pacific."
</P>
<P>
The project, jointly organized by the Youth and Sports
Ministry, Malaysian Climbing Association and Sport and Culture
Foundation of Malaysia, will cost 4.5 million Malaysian Ringgit
(about 1.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that of the 20 climbers selected for the
expedition, only 12 will trek to the top part of the mountain.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The top Chinese official in charge of
Hong Kong and Macao affairs today briefed Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto on China's Hong Kong policy based on the "one
country, two systems" concept.
</P>
<P>
China will not make any major changes in Hong Kong after 1997
apart from taking over control of diplomatic relations and
defense, said Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of China's State Council.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's local administration and the lifestyle of its
citizens will stay the same after it returns to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997, Lu was quoted as saying by a Chinese official
who briefed reporters on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The official said that during their 30-minute meeting, Lu told
Hashimoto that under the "one country, two systems" concept, a
market economy will continue to prevail in Hong Kong after British
colonial rule ends in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he hoped Hong Kong will play a role as China's
window on the world after it reverts to Chinese rule next year,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who is on a seven-day visit to Japan through Saturday at
the invitation of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, met Foreign
Minister Yukihiko Ikeda on Monday.

TOKYO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Ministry of

<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat today called on British businessmen to make
much-needed investments to the impoverished West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with British business leaders here this
morning, President Arafat said that since the infrastructure
facilities of the Palestine territory have been utterly destroyed,
"we are staring from below zero."
</P>
<P>
"Our own business people have already started a program of
investment in Palestine. We would like to see you make contact
with them," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here on Monday for a two-day visit to
Britain, that "we need your help and support in all fields, we
need to build the whole infrastructure -- roads, schools,
hospitals, telecommunications and sewage and power plants."
</P>
<P>
The West Bank and Gaza strip might need to build as many as
470,000 new homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in a free market economy, not controlled and
regulated by the state and I am dreaming of a Middle East
Singapore in Palestine," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit, President held separate talks with
British Prime Minister John Major and Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine, and exchanged views on bilateral relations and
the Middle East peace Process.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Nuke Weapons Moved to Russia for Destruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 5 (Xinhua) -- All nuclear weapons in Ukraine have
been transported to Russia before June for destruction, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
A statement signed by Ukraine's President Leonid Danilovich
Kuchma said the destruction will be carried out in Russia under
the supervision of Ukrainian officials.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine passed a resolution in July 1991
which declared that the country would stick to the three
principles concerning nuclear weapons -- non-acceptance,
non-production and non-possession.
</P>
<P>
The transport has clearly showed Ukraine's sincerity in the
implementation of the three principles, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming destruction of all nuclear weapons from Ukraine
will pave a way for establishing a non-nuclear zone from the Black
Sea to the Baltic Sea and will also promote mutual trust among
those countries in the zone, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It could help avoid fresh divisions in Europe due to the issue
of nuclear arms, the Ukraine's president said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The president said Ukraine volunteered to abandon the status of
a nuclear state because of its suffering from the Chernobyl
nuclear accident in 1986, in which 4,300 people died as a direct
result of the accident and many of its 350,000 clean-up workers
are now ill. Millions were affected, mostly in Ukraine, Russia and
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The Ukraine's leader also appealed to all other nuclear
countries in the world to destroy their nuclear arms.

SEOUL, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The opening session of South Korea's
new parliament broke up in acrimony today after members failed to
elect a speaker and two deputy speakers due to differences between
the ruling and opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
The ruling New Korea Party (NKP) led by President Kim Young-sam
had pushed for the election of Kim Soo-han as speaker and Oh
Se-eung as deputy speaker. They were nominated Tuesday by
President Kim.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition boycotted the voting, insisting that a
dispute over the ruling party's majority must be resolved first.
</P>
<P>
The NKP won 139 seats in the 299-seat National Assembly in
April elections, but regained a simple majority with 151 seats by
luring into its fold 12 lawmakers, mostly independents.
</P>
<P>
Acting speaker Kim Ho-nam of the conservative United Liberal
Democrats (ULD) introduced a motion for the election of speaker
and deputy speakers but refused to go ahead with the vote,
declaring parliament adjourned until next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 76, was elected acting speaker under parliament law, which
stipulates that the oldest member of a new National Assembly shall
act as chairman of its first plenary session.
</P>
<P>
He warned that there would be a physical clash between the two
camps if the voting were pushed ahead.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition National Congress for New Politics, headed
by Kim Dae-jung, joined the ULD led by Kim Jong-pil in frustrating
the ruling party's plan to form the new parliament with the
election of a speaker and deputy speakers.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the NKP first apologize to the people for
recruiting independent and opposition members to secure an overall
parliamentary majority.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Victory over UN Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of General Mohamed
Farah Aidid today celebrated the third anniversary of what they
called their victory over the U.S. led multinational forces in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The jubilant supporters marched onto the streets of south
Mogadishu today commemorating the killings of 24 Pakistani
peacekeepers and woundings of 56 others on June 5, 1993.
</P>
<P>
A group of singers entertained a large gathering held at the
radio station of General Aidid where the conflict sparked off
between combined U.S. and Pakistani forces on the one hand, and
armed militiamen supporting the general on the other.
</P>
<P>
General Aidid accused the U.N. forces of trying to silence
and seize his radio, while the UN forces claimed to have been
checking for a possible ammunition cache for the general in the
radio compound.
</P>
<P>
The radio was then neutralized by AC-130 gunships a week after
the incident on June 12.
</P>
<P>
Speaking through his radio on the occasion today, General
Aidid congratulated his supporters on defending their dignity
against what he called "foreign aggressors".
</P>
<P>
"Those who proved their bravery then should lie on their backs
as foreign intervention has come to a standstill," said General
Aidid.
</P>
<P>
According to the general, 75 civilians were killed and more
than 200 injured on the first day of the armed confrontation with
the UN forces on June 5.
</P>
<P>
"the massacre of our people had continued until the number of
death on Somali civilians reached more than 13,000 with 45,000
wounded," said the general who insists that the United Nations
should compensate for the losses.
</P>
<P>
He held the United States responsible for what had happened,
saying, "the forces from different nations operating in Somalia
were just kites being used by the Americans to carry out their
oppression in Somalia."
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between General Aidid and UN forces began on
June 5, 1993 and lasted until October 3, 1993 when 18 American
rangers were killed in a street battle in the heart of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The Americans failed to arrest the general, but succeeded in
detaining many of his close aids including his current arch
rival, Osman Hassan Ali Atto who was released on January 5, 1994.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
has decided to fully support Cape Town's bid for the 2004 Olympic
Games, Sports and Recreation Minister Steve Tshwete announced
today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Cape Town, Tshwete said the cabinet
meeting on Wednesday made the decision after a careful
consideration of the financcial implications of staging the
games, which was estimated to cost more than 7.5 billion Rand
(about 1.7 billion US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
It had studied submission from the bid company, the Department
of Finance, and the Development Bank of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet had also decided to establish the
management and co-ordination structures necessary in national
government to ensure the success of the bid.
</P>
<P>
Tshwete said holding the Olympics would contribute to overall
growth and development in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
''The cabinet's decision marks a proud moment for our country,
enabling us to contribute to the development of the Olympic
ideals,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
At the same conference, Cape Town 2004 Olympic Bid Company
Chief Executive Officer Chris Ball said he was delighted by the
cabinet's decision, saying all South Africans should now commit
themselves to making the bid a success.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus also gave assurance that
new taxes would not be levied to finance the games, although the
government was looking at other special initiatives such as
Olympic bonds.
</P>
<P>
Marcus said the key to the success of the bid was the private
sector involvement.
</P>
<P>
''This is South Africa's bid,'' added Marcus. enditem

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Receives Letter From Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
received here today a letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton
which dealt with the developments in the region following the
Israeli elections, according to U.S. ambassador to Lebanon Richard
Jones.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with the Lebanese president, Richard
Jones announced that he conveyed to Hrawi Clinton's letter "about
the developments in the region."
</P>
<P>
The "basical subject" in the letter was the results of the
Israeli elections, and the imagination on the next phase of the
peace process in the Middle East, he said.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the rightwing Likud Party,
defeated the incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres in the recent
Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Jones underlined a need to wait for some time before the
Israeli premier-elect forms his now government, but he vowed that
the American administration would continue its efforts to advance
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a stage where the Israelis are forming their
government," the U.S. diplomat said, "there are many
possibilities before Natanyahu, as a prime minister, to set up
coalitions, and there are a lot of people he should have dialogue
with them."
</P>
<P>
After the meeting in the Beirut Presidential Palace, Jones
also held a meeting with Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri in the
latter's office.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, he told reporters and he
delivered to the prime minister a copy of the letter which
he had conveyed to the president.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his optimism on the peace process, the U.S. envoy
said, "I think Netanyahu has expressed his seriousness in this
regard, but he needs some time to form his government."
</P>
<P>
When Netanyahu finished this work, "I don't see
obstacles for a continuity of the peace process," he said.

<HEADLINE> More Zambian Land Turns into Desert: Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Unless something is done quickly
most of Zambia's land will turn into desert in less than 20
years because of the rapid deforestation, studies published in
today's "Zambia Daily Mail" warned.
</P>
<P>
A radius of 30 kilometers around Lusaka is becoming barren and
deforested as a result of population growth and unsuitable
agricultural practices, said the studies.
</P>
<P>
In Western and Southern provinces, the deforestation is
threatening the existence of human beings and wildlife in the
areas, the studies said.
</P>
<P>
In some parts of the areas deforestation is causing so much
soil erosion and making land unsuitable for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Along the railway from Monze in the south to Ndola in the
north, people is destroying forests as growing poverty has
compelled the unemployed to turn to trees as sources of income,
said the studies.
</P>
<P>
The studies said that Zambia's "green gold" is rapidly being
depleted as trees are felled for wood and firewood.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Minster of Environment and Natural Resources William
Harrington was quoted as saying that any meaningful efforts to
save forest plantations and other forests from further
destruction in the country should start with poverty reduction.

<HEADLINE> Arab-China Chamber of Commerce Calls for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Arab-China Chamber of Commerce
(ACCC) called for a further development of economic and trade
relations between China and Arab countries in a final report
issued at the end its second meeting of the board of directors in
Beirut today.
</P>
<P>
A 17-member Chinese business delegation led by Xu Dayou, vice
chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International
Trade, attended the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the meeting included delegates from Lebanon,
Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Oman and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, members of the Chinese and Arab
delegations were received by Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's three top leaders "expressed their deep appreciation
for the joint efforts to promote the trade relations between
Lebanon and the Arab countries on the one hand, and China on the
other," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources close to the Chinese delegation disclosed
that the Lebanese leaders thanked China for its persistent
support for Lebanon on the world stage, and spoked highly of the
achievements China has made in various fields in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who is scheduled to pay an official visit to China next
week, expressed the hope that the visit would "contribute in
advancing the bilateral relations" between Lebanon and China.
</P>
<P>
He announced that he would hold a series of meetings with the
Chinese leaders, and sign several agreements of economic
cooperations.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is a small country," he said, "but its economic
potential is not so small."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he is making diplomatic efforts to attract
more international supports and financial assistance for
Lebanon's ambitious reconstruction projects, which was
masterminded by the billionaire prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Hariri called for a Chinese participation in more Lebanese
development projects, suggesting that Chinese enterprises invest
in Lebanon's planned free zone and take part in trade and
business exhibitions and fairs regularly held in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The ACCC said in the report that "There is a growing interest
in the Arab and Chinese sides to promote economic and trade
relations particularly with a view to enhancing economic
development and strengthening the role of China and the Arab
region in the world economy."
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to encourage Arab exports to China, and at the
same time, to benefit from the technological advancement made in
China in the economic development process in Arab countries," the
report added.
</P>
<P>
It put forward some suggestions for cooperation in several
aspects, including the need to promote financial cooperation, to
exchange investments, to increase the mutual visits of trade and
business delegations, to strengthen the exchange of information,
to promote the registration of trade marks, and to organize
shipping lines between China and the Arab Countries.
</P>
<P>
It also raised some concrete plans for strengthening the
ACCC's role in promoting the cooperations.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab side expressed its appreciation for the measures
taken by China to accelerate the pace of economic development in
the middle and western parts of China," the report added.
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and the Arab region can be traced back to a
time when the old silk road linked eastern and western Asia more
than 1,000 years ago, and the Arab region has been one of the most
important trade partners of China since then.
</P>
<P>
A rapid progress of trade between China and Arab countries has
been witnessed since China started its economic reform some 17
years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of the Chinese customs, trade volume
between China and Arab countries increased by 65.45 percent to
1,997 million U.S. dollars in the ten years from 1979 to 1989, and
amounted to 5,150 million dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> War Crimes Tribunal President: Only Individuals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- President of the Hague-based
International Criminal Tribunal Antonio Cassese said today it was
only individuals who had committed crimes in the Bosnia war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Belgrade after talks with Speaker of
the Yugoslav parliament's lower house Radoman Bozovic, Cassese
said they had fully agreed that there could be no collective, but
only personal and individual responsibility for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
"In the four-year civil war in Bosnia, atrocities were
committed by individuals, not by groups or states," said Cassese,
who arrived in Belgrade for a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
would only charge individuals, regardless of their nationality,
and would not accuse the entire people, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Hague-based Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was
set up under a U.N. Security Council resolution in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to official information released by the tribunal in
May 1996, the tribunal has indicted 57 war criminal suspects in
the former Yugoslavia -- of whom 46 are Serbs, including Bosnian
Serb President Radovan Karadzic and Serb Army chief Ratko Mladic,
eight are Croats and three are Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Tension Eases in Kakuma Refugee Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Situation returned to normal at a
refugee camp in northwest Kenya today after two days of fighting
between two Sudanese tribes at it that left six refugees killed
and 136 wounded.
</P>
<P>
A scuffle broke out between the Dinka and Nuer refugees at mid

refugees bearing spears and clubs began to roam the Kakuma
refugee camp in groups of 20 to 30 men attacking refugees of the
opposing tribe.
</P>
<P>
Kakuma is located in northwestern Kenya's Rift Valley
Province, about 100 kms from the Sudanese border.

Kenyan police responded immediately, working to separate the
two tribes and protect the other nationalities in the camp from
the fighting, a press release of the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR) said here today.
</P>

Kakuma.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of any refugees other than the Sudanese
Nuers and Dinkas being involved in the conflict. Kakuma shelters
some 48,000 refugees from 11 different countries.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

Currently, Russia imports tea, coffee, sisal and others from
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Ambassador hailed the tempo of Kenya's economic
development and good infrastructure and an industrial area that
is ideal for industrial development through joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Russia gives Kenya 20 students scholarship every year and is
exploring possibilities of sending in doctors to ease local
shortages and starting a joint pharmaceutical plant in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UK Refuses to Drop Non-Cooperation Policy With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government will not drop
its non-cooperation policy with the European Union (EU) despite
the EU decision to partially lift the ban on some British beef
by-products, according to Downing Street sources.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission agreed earlier today in Brussels to lift the
ban on exports of three British beef by-products -- gelatine,
tallow and bull semen.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest EU decision, Brian Mawhinney, a senior
British government minister, said today that Britain would stick
to its policy of non-cooperation, despite great pressure from EU
Commission President Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
Santer reportedly said in Brussels today, "The Commission has
assumed its responsibility in partially lifting the embargo. It
now expects the UK to immediately de-escalate from its position."
</P>
<P>
Santer described Britain's confrontation policy with the EU as
"against both the letter and spirit of the EU treaty" and he also
urged British Prime Minister John Major to make positive response
"in order that we may get on with the process of lifting the ban."
</P>
<P>
Mawhinney, also chairman of the ruling Conservative Party,
noted, "The policy has been made clear by the prime minister and
the policy remains in place until the circumstances which relate
to it and which he (Major) set out so clearly in the House of
Commons have been addressed."
</P>
<P>
British government officials reportedly indicated that they
regretted the need for maintaining the non-cooperation policy, but
they were necessary to concentrate the minds of Britain's EU
partners.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be where we are, but we have to focus minds
and proceed in this particular way," one of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the worldwide ban on British beef product
exports on March 27 when the British government announced that
there were possible links between BSE or mad cow disease and its
human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease.

<P>
NICOSIA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General's resident
representative to Cyprus, Gustave Feissel, has expressed the hope
that the situation will move forward on the Cyprus issue during
Boutros Boutros-Ghali's scheduled meetings with the leaders of
the two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Tuesday at Larnaca Airport before his departure for
Istabul, Turkey, where the U.N. chief is scheduled to meet today
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, Feissel said "we just have
to persevere, and keep pushing, hopefully all concerned will
realize that a solution is in their own interests and therefore it
is very important for the benefit of each community and others
that finally we move forward and make progress on this situation
here."
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali will also have a meeting with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides on June 11 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Boutros-Ghali's meeting with Denktash, Feissel
said that this is the first meeting that Denktash and the
Secretary-General have had for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is obviously concerned by the lack of
progress during these many months and years and this will give
him the opportunity to discuss the matter first hand with
Mr. Denktash," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All these will be helpful to the Secretary-General in
getting a first hand up to date impression of the situation and
which no doubt will help him consider how the U.N. can best
proceed in order to make progress," Feissel said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. diplomat reiterated that the objective of the U.N. is
to bring the two leaders together in direct talks with a view to
dealing with all the issues in a comprehensive manner and to
reach an overall settlement.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that before doing so, "we want to be
confident that such a meeting will be productive, so we have to
have some clear indications from both sides that they are ready
and determined to move forward."
</P>
<P>
Feissel said that Boutros-Ghali will have to submit to the
Security Council by the end of June, a special report on Cyprus
on his mission of good office. This report will take into account
his meetings in both Istanbul and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite all U.N. and
international peace efforts for the past 22 years.

<HEADLINE> 60 Percent of Zimbabwe's Households Being Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Over 60 percent of Zimbabwe's
households cannot provide for their basic needs, said a
preliminary report on a poverty assessment study.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was discussed at a one-day workshop here
Wednesday, said 46 percent of the households are living below the
family poverty datum line.
</P>
<P>
''Poverty is more prevalent in the rural areas with 72 percent
compared to urban areas with 46 percent of the households being
poor,'' said the report, prepared by the poverty assessment team
comprising officials from various government departments.
</P>
<P>
Manicaland was the poorest province with 75 percent of the
households being unable to provide basic needs, while Harare and
Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, were almost the same
at 55 and 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
''Nationally, the problem of unemployment and retrenchment is
given as the main cause of poverty, followed closely by problems
of drought,'' said the report.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment and retrenchment are the main reasons for poverty
in urban areas while drought has been the major reason in rural
areas, the report said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Monthly Vehicle Sales Hit Highest in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's new vehicle
sales in May increased by 19 percent to their highest level in 12
years, said figures released here today by the National
Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA).
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that new car sales jumped to 24,595 units
last month, 19.1 percent higher than the 20,649 cars sold in the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Last month's sales, the highest monthly sales since mid-1984,
were 28.4 percent higher than the sales recorded in April this
year.
</P>
<P>
The sales of light commercial vehicles, bakkies and minibuses
rose by 5.8 percent, or 644 units, to 11,798 compared to last
year's 11,154 units.
</P>
<P>
Heavy truck sales increased by a massive 29.3 percent from 615
units to 795, while medium commercial vehicle sales were 11.2
percent up at 447 units.
</P>
<P>
Industry sales rose by an impressive 14.7 percent to 37,635
compared to 32,820 unit in May last year, and by 23.7 percent
over sales in April of 30,415 units.
</P>
<P>
NAAMSA said the recorded high sales last month could be
attributed to strong preemptive buying ahead of vehicle price
increases of between 3 to 3.5 percent announced by most
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
However, NAAMSA said the price increases did not fully reflect
the cost rising effects of the Rand's recent sharp depreciation,
adding the industry could expect further preemptive buying this
month in anticipation of further price hikes.

<HEADLINE> Britain Supports Zimbabwe's Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain today pledged its continued
support for Zimbabwe's efforts to reform the economy and acquire
mainly white-owned commercial farms to resettle thousands of
landless peasants.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was given by visiting British Overseas
Development Minister Baroness Lynda Chalker after her talks with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in Harare today.
</P>
<P>
She did not, however, say how much Londond was prepared to
provide for the reforms or the land acquisition program.
</P>
<P>
Chalker, who is also Minister of Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs, told journalists after a 90-minute meeting with Mugabe
that she was confident Zimbabwe could achieve real economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
She said the British government would continue to discuss with
Zimbabwe the controversial land issue in the country with a view
to seeing how it could assist in redressing the land imbalances.
</P>
<P>
The Land Acquisition Act, enacted in 1992, provides for the
designation and compulsory acquisition of agricultural land for
resettlement of thousands of landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
On South Africa's relations with its neighbors, Chalker said:
"South Africa needs to work with its neighbors, otherwise
there will be no economic success. My government will do its best
to bring South Africa and Zimbabwe together," she said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Reiterates Readiness to Cooperate With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Yugoslav
parliament's lower house Radoman Bozovic reassured today that
Yugoslavia was ready to cooperate with the Hague-based
International War Crimes Tribunal on the basis of national and
international legal norms.
</P>
<P>
During talks with visiting President of the tribunal Antonio
Cassese in Belgrade, Bozovic said the tribunal's independent role,
dissociation from politics, and work based on respect for facts
and individual responsibility were prerequisites for the
implementation of the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Bozovic told Cassese that proceedings for the legal regulation
of cooperation with the Hague tribunal had not been instituted in
the Yugoslav parliament but the cooperation no doubt had the
support of legislators, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic held
separate talks with Cassese today over cooperation between the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The two sides noted the fact that Yugoslav government officials
and the U.N. tribunal had discussed an agreement on opening the
court's liaison bureau in Belgrade, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was expected to be concluded formally in the near
future, enabling the tribunal to collect information and evidence
on crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Hague-based Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was
set up under a U.N. Security Council resolution in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to official information released by the tribunal in
May 1996, the tribunal has indicted 57 war criminal suspects in
the former Yugoslavia -- of whom 46 are Serbs, including Bosnian
Serb President Radovan Karadzic and Serb Army chief Ratko Mladic,
eight are Croats and three are Muslims.

<HEADLINE> McDonnell Douglas Machinists Go On Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 6,700 McDonnell Douglas
machinists went on strike today, protesting the aerospace
company's growing use of nonunion workers.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the McDonnell Douglas-based St.
Louis, the strike was kicked off soon after the union leaders
failed to settle the disputes with the company. No new talks were
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Workers at the company's St. Louis headquarters, the only plant
affected by the strike, produce F-15 and FA-18 fighters and the
Navy's T-45 training jet. They also build part of the Air Force's
C-17 cargo plane and are upgrading the Harrier strike aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The union machinists overwhelmingly rejected the company's
latest contract proposal Sunday. Federal mediators worked all day
Tuesday in a bid to seek a deal to avoid the strike.
</P>
<P>
The key issue is outsourcing, the company's use of
subcontractors and nonunion McDonnell Douglas plants for work once
performed by union machinists.
</P>
<P>
While the company asserts outsourcing makes the company more
competitive, machinists see outsourcing as a threat to their jobs
and point out 1,500 layoffs at the plant in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Outsourcing was the key issue triggering off two other major
strikes in recent months. Later last December, machinists at the
Boeing walked out for 69 days. The strike delayed delivery of
nearly three dozen commercial jets. In March, General Motors
workers in Dayton, Ohio, staged a similar 18-day strike over
outsourcing. It was the longest strike against GM in 26 years, and
paralyzed 27 of GM's all 29 assemble plants in North America.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today delivered a message on the occasion of
World Environment Day, calling for the world's conscience and
action on "our fragile environment."
</P>
<P>
"World Environment Day is an occasion to reflect on the state
of our fragile environment," he said. "It is an observance that
draws attention to some of the ominous ways in which humanity is
imperiling its own habitation."
</P>
<P>
"It emphasizes the urgency of changing our attitude and
behavior, through responsible practices and actions," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Boutros-Ghali emphasized the importance of
meeting challenges of growing cities because the theme of this
year's World Environment Day is "Our Earth, Our Habitat, Our
Home."
</P>
<P>
"The future of our cities will determine more and more not only
the future of nations but also of the planet in its entirety," he
said. "We ignore the issue of sustainable management of cities at
our own peril."
</P>
<P>
"If cities are to continue to be the engines for economic
growth as they have been throughout human history, their future
development has to be based on considerations that are
environmentally sustainable," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM: Arab Summits Express Worry over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said here today that a series of summits which are
currently being held by Arab leaders "express worry" over the
rightwing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu's victory in the Israeli
elections last month.
</P>
<P>
These summits "express worry in the Middle East over the
arrival of a man setting out from negative starting points of
refusal, wondering what these starting points could lead to," the
foreign minister said in an interview with a local prominent
journalist.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held a meeting in Aqaba, Jordan,
today, which followed a meeting between Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad and Lebanese President Elias Hrawi last weekend and
another meeting between al-Assad and Mubarak on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After their talks in Riyadh, the foreign ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Syria and Egypt agreed that their heads of state will meet
in the Saudi capital on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli policy is to be forged in the next two months,
and the Arab leaders should take this new situation into
consideration, to determine their positions to face the event,"
Boueiz told Melham Karam, president of the Lebanese Journalists
Association.
</P>
<P>
"It is natural for the Arab countries to hold consultations in
this stage with a purpose to reach a common view and joint steps on
the regional level," the Lebanese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The (1990-1991) Gulf War consequently divided the Arab rank,
and we should wipe off this division and sit in a table to work
out a united Arab strategy in order to face the coming stage."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that an expected visit to Washington by Netanyahu
would be crucial for defining the Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States finds out that he does not want peace
and come up with impossible conditions, I don't think that
Washington will continue its absolute support for Israel," he
said.

WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has

<P>
ANKARA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish parliament today passed a
motion which calls for a parliamentary inquiry against the True
Path Party (DYP) Chairperson and former Premier Tansu Ciller for
the third time.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the DYP, all the parliamentary parties
backed the motion presented by the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP),
calling for a probe into Ciller's assets.
</P>
<P>
However, the parliament rejected a similar motion submitted by
the DYP calling for an inquiry into RP Chairman Necmettin
Erbakan's wealth.
</P>
<P>
Ciller is alleged to have acquired her wealth by misusing her
office during the term she served as minister and prime minister
as of 1991.
</P>
<P>
By not attending the plenary session, Ciller did not use her
right to defend herself in the face of the charges made against
her.
</P>
<P>
In line with the RP's earlier two motions, the parliament
agreed to open inquiries against Ciller in regard to the
alleged irregularities at the electricity distributing company TEDAS
and automobile concern TOFAS.

<HEADLINE> Britain Reiterates Its Position on Beef War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain is going to stay in the
European Union (EU), however it will not ignore the opportunities
in the wider world economy, as half of Britain's trade is
conducted with countries outside the EU, Michael Heseltine,
British Deputy Prime Minister, claimed here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a major conference at the start of the CBI's (the
Confederation of British Industry) "Business in Europe" campaign
week, Heseltine said: "Britain's leading role in building and
completing the single market -- the EU's greatest concrete
achievement to date -- puts us at the forefront of Europe." "It
gives Britain industry access to a home market of 370 million
people, creates a strong, cohesive of free-trading bloc from which
to compete in the global market-place."
</P>
<P>
However,the deputy prime minister said: "We can only create and
protect opportunities for British business by being at the center
of Europe - a Europe of nation states. We will not ignore the
opportunities in the wider world economy. Half of Britain's trade
is conducted with countries outside the EU, in booming new
markets.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities are immense. We must seize them. I saw that
for myself again two weeks ago, when I led our largest-ever
delegation of businessmen to China."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the "Business in Europe" campaign week, Heseltine
said, it comes at an important juncture in the development of the
European Union. Such developments present challenges and
opportunities for British business and government alike. Business
needs to understand these issues, and how to respond to them.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine warned: "It would be disingenuous to leave aside
current difficulties.... to read the newspapers one might imagine
we had been plunged back more than half a century. That British
troops were back in the trenches, and spitfires dogfighting in the
skies over Europe. One might be forgiven for thinking the
conference rooms of Brussels had been transformed into the
battlefields of Flanders, and pinstripe suits exchanged for battle
fatigues."
</P>
<P>
He said: "We are facing tough challenges. We have to take tough
decision -- however unjustifiable-- to ban our beef. Important
matters of national interest are involved. We cannot - and will
not -let them be brushed aside.
</P>
<P>
"Britain will not be governed by a separate code of conduct to
other Europeans. Europe is not federal state, but a group of
nation states. We have the same right to protect our interests as
any nation state," the deputy prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine reiterated Britain's position, saying that "We cannot
be expected to cooperate normally on other community business,
until all the necessary steps have been taken to lift the ban on
the export of beef derivatives, and an agreed framework is in
place which will lead to the lifting of the export ban as a
whole".
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said that "We hope this will not take
long."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Develops Debt Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is striving to develop
a world-class debt market to sharpen its edge as a regional
financial hub well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an annual dinner of Financial Executives Institute
(HK) Ltd. today, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said that
despite a short history of seven years, Hong Kong's debt market is
 a rising star of the Asia-Pacific capital markets.
</P>
<P>
The present size of the debt market is still small compared
with other financial sectors -- equity market and bank loans,
which have been the main sources of business funding in Hong Kong,
 said the official.
</P>
<P>
But the debt market has seen rapid growth from a very low base
of 27 billion HK dollars (3.5 billion US dollars) in 1989 to 214
billion HK dollars (27.4 billion US dollars) at the end of the
first quarter of 1996. Debt issued by private sectors accounted
for 70 percent of the total by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
"The expansion has been phenomenal," said the financial
secretary, who stressed that the market has thrived largely on
private sector initiatives, though the government did take an
active role in facilitating the development.
</P>
<P>
Two government initiatives -- the Mandatory Provident Fund
(MPF) and the proposed Mortgage Corporation -- would gear up Hong
Kong's debt market to further expansion in the coming years,
according to Tsang.
</P>
<P>
The MPF system would cover more than two million people in the
work force, and the large pool of retirement reserves would fuel
the demand for debt and other financial instruments. Tsang
estimated that the annual contributions under the system would
amount to 30 to 40 billion HK dollars (3.8 to 5.1 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Mortgage Corporation, when established, would provide high
quality debt paper such as mortgage-backed securities for
investors, so as to widen the range of financial products being
offered and boost the development of Hong Kong's secondary
mortgage market.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that Hong Kong is also the center providing debt
financing services for the huge infrastructure work programs in
the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The region's infrastructure investment is estimated to be
around 1.5 to 2.5 trillion US dollars in the years up to 2000,
according to the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. China
alone will account for one third of the total amount.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will play an important role in arranging such huge
debt issues, especially for China, said the official.

SHANGHAI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China's largest municipality
recently introduced a watchdog to keep fakes away from its

<HEADLINE> Chaos Theory a Winner: Euro Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- British scientists say chaos theory
could help teams by laying bare the patterns of play adopted by
opponents, according to a report.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the University of Wales Institute in Cardiff
have analysed matches using "notational analysis", transferring
information from videos of games onto computer-generated grids.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an article in New Scientist magazine on
Thursday as saying that the institute's Keith Lyons claims this
revealed the highly structured nature of games, highlighting
moments of "chaos".
</P>
<P>
"When you can see the orderliness behind football and winning,
it is easier to identify the ripples of player-induced chaos that
upset these patterns," he said.
</P>
<P>
He gives the example of the Real Zaragoza midfield player
spotting the Arsenal goalkeeper out of position in last year's
European Cup Winners' Cup final, and lofting a shot over the
English keeper's head from the half-way line to win the cup.
</P>
<P>
The scientists also use chaos theory to explain developments
over a season or even longer, helping identify when teams reach
"stability" and perhaps need a shock in order to progress.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the "perturbation" is premature, introduced before a
team has reached its optimum, settled state, and a seemingly minor
change can have huge, unpredictable results.

<HEADLINE> China's Progressive Three-Golden Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China is exerting great efforts
into constructing its information infrastructure, especially the
golden bridge, golden card and golden customs projects.
</P>
<P>
Detailed development plans of the three-golden projects were
given by Wu Jiapei, deputy-director of China Information
Association at an international symposium on advanced information
technology for government and public management held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1993, the three-golden projects will help improve
the country's information industry, and improve the sector's
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
The golden bridge project is expected to set up a national
public economic information network, consisting of a satellite and
optic-fibre cable network to transmit data, voice and digital
information, during its first three to five years of construction.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the bridge project will help China build an
information superhighway by improving the first phase of its
construction.
</P>
<P>
The golden card project, a credit card program to build an
electronic currency system, has launched test operations in 12
major cities, issuing nearly 30 million cards.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 the card project is expected to issue 60
million cards, and as many as 200 million by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The golden customs project aims to build up a network linking
all foreign trade departments and firms in the near future and
realize electronic data exchanges and paperless trading in the
long term.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Calls for Greater Effort for Agriculture (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China must also push ahead with two fundamental shifts in
economic structure, from the traditional planned economy to market
economy, and in economic growth mode from being extensive to
intensive in agriculture, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China's economic reforms were initiated in its rural
areas. Though the country has scored world acknowledged
achievements in rural reforms, "we can never say that we have
accomplished everything," he said, adding that China needs further
reforms in agricultural administration structures, rural market
systems, and support and protection by the state government for
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
After emphasizing the current policy of contract responsibility
systems with remuneration linked to output, Jiang also stressed
the importance of further reforming the circulation structures of
farm produce and production materials for agriculture use.
</P>
<P>
He also called for greater efforts to develop a socialized
service system in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China is relatively scarce in natural agricultural resources
and its demand for farm products is increasing along with the
growth of population, he said. "It is unrealistic to increase new
resources, especially input to natural resources on a large
scale," he said.
</P>
<P>
The only way out is to optimize the use of current resources,
increase the content of science and technology in agriculture and
improve the quality of farmers.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection tour, Jiang also urged local officials to
protect arable land and water resources. He addressed the topics
of the progress of ideology and culture, establishment of a
democratic legal system and grassroots organizations in rural
areas, as well as the crackdown on crimes which has been beefed up
on a nationwide scale since the beginning of last month.

ISTANBUL, June 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 heads of States or
Governments will come to Istanbul to attend the high-level
segment of the Second United Nations Conference on Human
Settlements (HABITAT II) between 12-14 June.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel today told a
press conference here that the leaders would gather for the last
three days of the two-week conference to adopt final documents on
improving human settlements prepared by two of its committees.
</P>
<P>
The documents include an "Istanbul Declaration," which will
contain the message of the conference and the political will of
the participating states for "sustainable human settlements in a
rapidly urbanizing world and adequate shelter for all."
</P>
<P>
Nine countries, including Poland, Israel, Romania, Bulgaria,
Kenya, Azerbaijan, Zaire, Uganda and the Palestinians, will be
represented by heads of state and Sudan, Ethiopia, Peru by their
vice-presidents.
</P>
<P>
The states that will be represented at the prime minister level
are Pakistan, Burundi, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Croatia, Djibouti and
Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
China and other 10 countries will send their vice-premiers to
the conference, dubbed as "City Summit."
</P>
<P>
However, no high-level officials other than ministers from the
United States, France, Germany, and other leading Western
countries will be present at the summit.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Akbel also gave a brief outline of
the past three days of the conference.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 80 speakers have taken the floor and
expressed the views of their government on human settlements as
well as implementation.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 people, including 2,600 official delegates, have
come to Istanbul for the conference, in contrast with previous
expectation of some 20,000.
</P>
<P>
However, Akbel said that the number cannot demonstrate the
degree of success of the so-called last large-scale U.N.
conference of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman maintained that the outcome and the
implementation of its documents are more important.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Motorola Inc., the US industrial
giant, today celebrated the opening of Shanghai Motorola
Automotive and Industrial Electronics Company in Shanghai's Pudong
Area. It comes just weeks after the company established a radio
pager factory in the same area.
</P>
<P>
Since then the US electronics company has built six
solely-funded enterprises or joint ventures in Tianjin, Nanjing,
Hangzhou, Leshan and Shanghai, with its production ranging from
cellular phones, semiconductors and electronics telecommunications
products.
</P>
<P>
David P. Melka, Senior, Vice President and General Manager of
Automotive and Industrial Electronics Group, Motorola, who was in
Shanghai for the opening ceremony, said that the company has
already invested one billion US dollars in China and will push its
total China investment to 1.2 billion US dollars by the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Melka said Motorola plans to enhance its presence in China
by localizing most of the senior executives and technology leaders
within five years, increasing localization rates for Motorola
products in China, helping China with its electronics industry and
establishing more joint ventures on the basis of solely-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Since Motorola established its first factory in Tianjin in
1992, it has become one of the largest multinationals with the
most investment in China. In 1994, the company was named one of
the ten largest foreign-funded enterprises in China in terms of
export and sales volumes.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Village Show Window of Folk Customs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Jinzhu - the name means Golden
Bamboo - an ethnic Zhuang village, is attracting travelers from
across the world with its unique folk customs of one of the chief
ethnic minorities in south China.
</P>
<P>
The village with 80 families and more than 350 people is
located in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
It has been recognized as a representative of the northern
Zhuang people by the State Nationalities Commission and UNESCO
because the villagers totally retain their own costume, language
and life style.
</P>
<P>
Jinzhu people have altered their traditional farming life since
August of 1993, when the village became a tourist attraction for
overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
Each morning villagers work for a few hours in the fields
before they go to meet travelers at the entrance to village.
</P>
<P>
On arriving visitors are led to a singing and dancing ground at
the center of the village, where they enjoy all kinds of ethic
songs and dances, such as the local Sigong dance to pray for a
bumper harvest, the Zhubang dance depicting hunting, and the
Embroidered Ball dance, the lovers' dance.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 travelers visit the village annually, over
half of them from over 10 countries such as the United States,
Japan, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
With tourism booming, souvenirs have become a major source of
income for Jinzhu people. Local handicrafts such as embroidered
balls, sachets, bamboo and wood carvings, are all popular with
tourists.
</P>
<P>
Embroidered balls, which are gifts between lovers, earn the
biggest amounts of money for Jinzhu villagers. With almost everyone
able to embroider, villagers sold nearly 30,000 embroidered balls
last year and earned about 20,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, per-capita income for Jinzhu village reached 2,000
yuan, triple that before 1993.

an integral part of China and vowed it would not allow any support

"In the German government's view, Tibet is an integral part of

<HEADLINE> Experts Show Cautious Optisism on China's Grain Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural experts have expressed
cautious optimism on China's grain production capacity in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed that China can be basically self-sufficient in
grain supplies, and will import only to make up varieties and crop
failures.
</P>
<P>
"China can feed itself, but it must do hard work," experts
attending the Beijing conference at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering noted.
</P>
<P>
Lu Liangshu, Vice-President of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, said that China's grain production faces three
problems: the ever increasing population, the decreasing area of
arable land, and the rising level of consumption.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that while stablizing grain production, the
country should pay more attention to the production of non-staple
foods, such as meat, eggs, milk, fruit and vegetables, thus easing
the direct consumption of grain.
</P>
<P>
According to his analysis the per capita consumption of grain
will drop to 213 kilograms by the year 2000, 40 kilograms lower
than in 1986.
</P>
<P>
By then China's total consumption of grain will be at the same
level of the year 1993.
</P>
<P>
Academician Li Zhensheng said that China's agricultural
production still has great potential. But he admitted that the
potential will become a reality only under good policies,
sufficient financial and technological inputs.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the comprehensive development of agriculture
should receive more attention, noting that in the past ten years,
grain output increased by not more than one tenth, while the
output of chemical fertilizers doubled in the country.
</P>
<P>
Academician Shi Yuanchun, from the China Agriculture
University, said advanced technologies are the key to grain
production in the coming few years, especially under the
circumstance of limited land and water resources.
</P>
<P>
China now has arable land of 96 million hectares and 6.6
million hectares cultivatable in near future, that means, the per
capita occupation of arable land in the country is no more than
0.1 hectare.

<P>
CAIRO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Yemen signed eight
cooperation agreements during a three-day session of the
Egyptian-Yemeni Joint Higher Committee, which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
The agreements cover bilateral cooperation in such fields as
investment, trade, tourism, culture, fishing, technology and
sports.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, who co-chaired the
session with his Yemeni counterpart Abdul Aziz Abdul-Ghani, said
following the session today that inter-Arab trade and economic
ties should be promoted.
</P>
<P>
The volume of inter-Arab trade dose not exceed 8 percent of
that of Arab trade with non-Arab countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri added that inter-Arab investments are estimated at
only about 15 percent of Arab joint investments with non-Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that economic relations between Egypt and Yemen
could be promoted by encouraging businessmen of the two countries
to set up joint projects.

LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- French striker Eric Cantona would
not be leaving the English club following a row over the misuse of
his name on commerical products, said Manchester United manager
Alex Ferguson Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, Cantona had threatened to quit soccer if
English companies did not stop using his name for selling their
products.
</P>
<P>
But Ferguson was quoted as saying: "It is not on the agenda for
Eric to leave Manchester United and we are doing our best, with
our legal advisers, to resolve this matter to Eric's satisfaction."
</P>
<P>
United announced it would be taking legal advice on whether to
take action against companies advertising goods which Cantona or
the club have not endorsed, it said.
</P>
<P>
Cantona threatened to quit England last August when the
Football Association announced an inquiry into his appearance in a
training match while he was serving his lengthy suspension.
</P>
<P>
On that occasion, the intervention of United manager Alex
Ferguson persuaded him to change his mind. But Cantona was left
out of the French Euro 96 squad.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Calls for Greater Effort for Agriculture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The issue of feeding China's
1.2 billion population must rely on the country itself and this
issue can be resolved self-reliantly, President Jiang Zemin said
during his recent inspection tour to Central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, said efforts for agriculture, particularly grain
production, cannot be slackened but be grasped in the whole
process of modernization and any period of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by senior central government and provincial
officials from Henan, Jiang toured the northern Henan from the
June 1-5 as China's major bread basket awaits a good harvest of
summer crops.
</P>
<P>
He trekked villages, farmers' homes, collective-run and township
enterprises, and listened to opinions from rural officials, party
members and model workers.
</P>
<P>
During his Henan tour, the president reiterated the importance
of agriculture in the entire economic work to help maintain the
country's prosperity and sustainable social development.
</P>
<P>
"It also concerns the strategic issue as to whether China can
maintain and strengthen its independence in international
competition," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is in the process of rapid industrialization and during a
period of transformation in economic structure. Jiang noted that
it is easy for agriculture to be put in an unfavorable position in
a market competition, if the country fails to attach importance
to, or ensure agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged major agriculture provinces, like Henan, to
integrate farm production with processing, transportation,
marketing and comprehensive utilization of farm produce in a bid
to boost the comprehensive economic returns of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"With the development of agriculture industrialization, farmers
can increase their income levels, there will be also a larger
rural market, offering vast room for the development of other
related sectors," he said.

<HEADLINE> Post-election Israel Still Attractive to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS),
a leading world bank, expects post-election Israel to remain an
investment attraction despite of a short period of uncertainty,
the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a move to calm foreign investors concerned with Israel's
economic prospects after the victory of right wing Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu in last week's elections, UBS, one of the
world's most prominent banks and Switzerland's largest, published
Wednesday an optimistic update on the Israel's post-election
market status.
</P>
<P>
A change of pace and emphasis is expected in the ongoing
Israeli-Arab peace process under the new Likud-led government,
but the direction would remain more or less the same, UBS market
analysts said in the report.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, concessions will be given on all sides, and in
this regard, the influence of the United States will be pivotal,"
they said, adding that Prime Minister-elect Netanyahu would act
accordingly in view of the fact that a majority of Israeli people
support peace.
</P>
<P>
The report forecasts the business world will exercise caution
while evaluating policies of the new government in the initial
period, but the economy's robust performance is expected to
continue.
</P>
<P>
A sustainable long-term economic growth rate of 5 percent is
achievable under the new government, whose policies will focus on
curtailing inflation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The analysts also expect the new government to accelerate the
privatization process, continue investment in infrastructure and
carry on structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
Investment growth may be negatively affected by uncertainty in
the short term, while buoyed overall consumption levels will
increase in 1996, before moderating in 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As for trade, the UBS analysts do not see any politically
driven shift in recent patterns of rapid diversification, adding
Israel should continue to be a magnet for foreign investors as
long as its economic policy "remains broadly unchanged and
pragmatism rules foreign relations."

the devolution process.
</P>
<P>
With the Jaffna peninsula now under the aegis of the
lawfully-elected government, there was an increased capability to
involve the people in the north in the devolution process, for
which a select committee of parliament is currently sitting, said
Peris.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there were fears among both the Tamil people and
the country's majority Sinhalese community that the proposed
devolution package in Jaffna might not be implemented
susccessfully.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized that the government's military success
of retaking Jaffna peninsula strengthened the government's will to
go ahead with the devolution process.

<HEADLINE> Iran Summons Ambassador from Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran today summoned its ambassador
from Bahrain in protest against Manama's accusation of Iran's
involvement in a plot to overthrow the Manama government, degrading
the Tehran-Manama diplomatic relations from ambassadorial level to
charge d'affaires level.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain Monday announced the discovery of a conspiracy by a
pro-Iranian terrorist organization to topple the current government.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran regards
Manama's move which has resulted in the lowering of diplomatic
relations between the two countries as "miscalculated and hasty."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman maintained that such moves would only serve the
interests of the aliens in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said such unfounded allegations would prepare the ground
for enemies to take hostile measures against all regional
countries.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts noted that the incident would seriously
affected Iran's image in the Persian Gulf region since it is
trying to join in the confidence-building program with Arab
countries in a bid to thwart international isolation by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources told Xinhua that the Bahraini ambassador
to Tehran had actually bid farewell to his friends and colleagues
in the diplomatic community late last week.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Warned to Aware of Depression Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China's largest city, Shanghai,
has 750,000 people suffering from depression and mental illness,
health officials have revealed.
</P>
<P>
 Chinese people have been warned to become more aware of
depression, with a message that the illness can be recognized and
treatable.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 11.3 percent of adults in the world suffer
from depressive disorders annually.
</P>
<P>
Owing to high-level jobs and fierce competitions, depression
poses a growing problem in China as its pace of life speeds up.
Yet it is often misdiagnosed, said Dr. Gu Niufan, director of the
Shanghai Mental Health Center.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of depression include chronic headaches, lack of vigor
and interest in life, insomnia or oversleeping, stomach aches,
constipation, irritation, and an inability to work efficiently,
said Gu Niufan.
</P>
<P>
In order to help Chinese doctors, patients and ordinary
residents recognize depression and its treatment, US
pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, will join two World Health
Organization mental health centers in China, to launch a
depression awareness campaign.
</P>
<P>
The two centers are the Beijing Mental Health Institute of
Beijing Medical University and the Shanghai Mental Health Center,
</P>
<P>
The campaign will focus on education about depressive diseases
for general physicians in Shanghai and Beijing. It will train some
2,000 doctors, who can help up to one million suffers of mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
The WHO has expressed full support for the campaign in China.
</P>
<P>
With headquarters in Shanghai, Lilly China, the China branch of
Eli Lilly, has set up seven offices in the country.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Housing Prices Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia's housing prices
continued to fall in the first quarter of this year despite a
stronger economic growth in the three months, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said in a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the ABS index of established house prices fell
by 0.2 percent in the three months to March after a similar fall
in the December quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The index fell by 0.9 percent in the 12 months to March.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, although the country's economy grew
by 4.8 percent in the March quarter, the housing sector was still
chilled by the relatively high interest rates. The official
interest rates have remained at 7.50 percent since late 1994.
</P>
<P>
Among other signs of weakness of the economy, retail trade fell
0.5 percent seasonally adjusted in April to 10.149 billion
Australian dollars (8.018 billion US dollars) and the unemployment
rate rose to 8.6 percent in trend terms in May.
</P>
<P>
Housing approvals remained flat in April, rising merely 0.1
percent to 10,432 units seasonally adjusted from 10,424 in March.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said they expected a weaker economy in the
June quarter and a moderate recovery in the following quarter.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Reasons for Turkish PM's Resignation (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The resignation of Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz has shocked the political arena in Turkey,
and brought the political situation of the country more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz resigned here today as the Turkish Constitutional Court
has announced that the vote of confidence for the center-right
coalition government between the Motherland Party (ANAP) and the
True Path Party (DYP) was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
On May 14, the court upheld an appeal by the pro-Islamic
Welfare Party (RP) which argued that the vote of confidence in
March for the ANAP-DYP coalition government was against the the
procedure code of the parliament which requires an absolute
majority of those who attended the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The three-month-long coalition government failed to gain an
absolute majority by only winning 257-207 votes with 80
abstention.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ANAP parliamentary group this morning, Yilmaz
said that as the Court's cancellation of the vote of the
confidence, it is hard for the coalition government to gain 276
votes in the 550-seat parliament to win the vote of confidence,
and the only thing for him to do is to submit his resignation to
President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The RP appeared at the top of last December's general
elections but failed to find a coalition partner after all the
left-or right-wing political parties boycotted the pro-Islamic
party.
</P>
<P>
The situation forced ANAP and DYP, two rival parties, to come
together and formed a two-party minority coalition government in
March with the Democratic Left Party (DSP)'s support from outside
the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the main reason for Yilmaz' resignation is that the
struggle between Yilmaz and DYP leader and former Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller remains more serious. Since the coalition government
was set up in March, Yilmaz and Ciller have not been in good
cooperation, but have been fighting against each other.
</P>
<P>
On April 24, the Turkish parliament passed a first motion to
investigate Ciller over alleged irregularities at the Electricity
Distributing Company (TEDAS).
</P>
<P>
The motion presented by the RP was passed by 232 votes to 179
in the assembly in a secret vote. Seventy-six ANAP deputies
apparently voted for the investigation.

<HEADLINE> 79 Killed, 77 Injured in Southwest China Landslides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the Chinese
landslide disaster was put at 79 today, with 77 more injured.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy occurred in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Today 14 more victims were found today, some alive and some
dead, and the number of those still missing was reduced to
148. The two landslides occured on May 31 and June 3 in Laojinshan
Mountain, site of the Daping Gold Mine in Yuanyang County
following non-stop torrential rain.
</P>
<P>
The 77 wounded have been hospitalized for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The landslides buried 23 gold pits, 13 of which have been dug
out by rescue teams, saving 30 miners.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,600 gold miners who suspended mining operations
because of the disaster have received emergency relief from
government.
</P>
<P>
Rescue work to search for more survivors is continuing.
</P>
<P>
China's State Council has dispatched a work team to the
province to help organize and direct the relief operation.

<P>
After the vote, Ciller accused Yilmaz of not preventing his
deputies from voting in favor of the RP motion. She said there
was "strong reaction from her party colleagues" over the "yes"
votes by the ANAP deputies.
</P>
<P>
On May 9 and June 5, the parliament also passed the
RP-presented second and third motions for an investigation against
Ciller concerning corruption allegations during the sale of
state-owned shares of Turkey's leading automobile plant TOFAS and
for an inquiry into Ciller's assets with a strong support of DYP's
coalition partner ANAP.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz also accused Ciller of having misappropriated a prime
ministry's fund of 500 billion Turkish liras (about 7.8 million
U.S. dollars). Thus, Ciller's reputation has rapidly descended in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for Yilmaz' act, Ciller decided on May 25 to
withdraw her party from the coalition government with the ANAP and
asked Yilmaz to render his resignation to the Turkish president.
</P>
<P>
On June 3, the Turkish parliament voted overwhelmingly to open
a debate on a RP-submitted censure motion against the government
led by Prime Minister Yilmaz. Most of the DYP deputies joined
other parties and voted for the motion in a bid to oust the Yilmaz
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DYP parliamentary group unanimously decided
Wednesday to vote in favor of the censure motion against Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the DYP parliamentary group, Ciller said, "In
coming days we will have to take a number of critical steps. But
one point which is very clear so far is that the current
government does not carry on."
</P>
<P>
In face of this serious situation, Yilmaz held an emergency
meeting of the ANAP parliamentary group Wednesday night soon after
his returning from a tour to Belgium and decided to resign.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, Demirel will meet with RP Chairman
Necmettin Erbakan and other four party leaders to discuss the
government issue Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
As to the political situation in Turkey, Demirel once said,
"Politics is that yesterday is yesterday and today is today."
</P>
<P>
As a whole, the struggle among the political parties in the
country will become more strong and complicated.

</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China and the Philippines are neighbors with a
bilateral friendship dating back over 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries set up diplomatic ties 21 years ago,
friendship and cooperation have developed fairly well, continued

</P>
<P>
As to the problems existing in bilateral relations, he noted,
so long as the two sides take into consideration the general
situation of bilateral ties, they can be solved gradually through
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are some leading businessmen included in
Siazon's entourage, Jiang said he is convinced that this visit is
to further promote bilateral cooperation in economy, trade,
science and technology.
</P>

secretary, which enables him to view China's great economic
changes.
</P>
<P>

relations, adding that the Philippine side wishes to strengthen
and expand its cooperation with China in various fields.
</P>
<P>
On China-ASEAN relations, Jiang said that China attaches
importance to its friendly relations with the ASEAN countries
including the Philippines. He stressed that such relations should
be viewed not only from the current angle, more emphasis should be
put on the future.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China will exert long-term efforts for its
economic development, which needs a long and stable international
environment of peace, especially a peaceful neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The development of China's economy will bring about a positive
impact on peace and development in Asia and in the world at large,
added Jiang.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Siazon conveyed an invitation from
Philippine President Fidel Ramos for Jiang to visit the
Philippines after attending the APEC's informal leadership meeting

<HEADLINE> Fujian Bans Illegal Sex Identification of Unborn Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Fujian Provincial People's
Congress has adopted a new law which bans the identifying of the
sex of unborn babies in the province.
</P>
<P>
The law, the first local regulation of its kind in China, is
aimed at keeping the balance in population structure, and
maintaining a stable society.
</P>
<P>
The regulations forbid the use of ultrasonic testing,
chromosome detection and other medical means to illegally identify
the sex of fetuses.
</P>
<P>
Sex identification can only be conducted with the approval of
medical and public health institutions above city-level for
examining hereditary diseases, according to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that the status or licenses of doctors who
conduct illegal sex identification more than twice will be
cancelled.
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women who illegally abort a fetus after going through
sex identification tests, will not be allowed to give birth to
their first baby for five years, and they will not to be permitted
to have another child, the law says.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the sex ratio of the newly-born
population in Fujian Province has become imbalanced since
1980s. The normal sex ratio of baby girls and baby boys should be
100:103 (to 107).
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the fourth nationwide census in 1990 indicated
that the ratio of baby girls and baby boys in Fujian Province was
100:118.7.
</P>
<P>
And statistics produced by the Fujian Provincial Family
Planning Committee in 1995 showed that the ratio of baby girls and
baby boys was 100: 115.4.
</P>
<P>
The two numbers are apparently higher than normal levels, with
analysts attributing the reason to the failure of reporting baby
girls during the national census, and illegal abortions after
identification of gender.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The completion of key projects in
energy, transport, telecommunications and agriculture has helped
speed up economic growth in the Tibet Autonomous Region,
according to the regional government.
</P>
<P>
An official of the autonomous regional government said that
since 1991 Tibet's gross domestic product -- the value of goods
and services produced -- has grown at an annual rate of 8.3
percent, six percentage points higher than during the 1986-1990
period.
</P>
<P>
The official said that over the past five years the government
has spent ten billion yuan in fixed assets in such basic sectors
as energy, transport, telecommunications, farming and livestock
breeding.
</P>
<P>
A number of power stations fueled by hydropower, terrestrial
heat and solar energy were built across Tibet, known as the "roof
of the world."
</P>
<P>
As a result, Tibet's electricity production jumped to 520 million
kilowatt-hours in 1995 from 210 million kwh in 1986, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Spurred by the power industry, the autonomous region's
manufacturing industry has scored an annual rise of 10.3 percent

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian, Syrian and Saudi Arabian
leaders will hold a three-way summit in Damascus, Syria Friday to
discuss the latest developments in the Middle East and the future
of regional peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and Saudi King Fahd will mainly deal with
efforts to close Arab ranks and push forward the peace process
based on the principle of land-for-peace, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa was quoted by the Middle East News Agency
(MENA) as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports had said that the three leaders would meet
Friday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia today denied the
reports.
</P>
<P>
MENA also said today in a dispatch datelined Damascus that the
three leaders would discuss recommendations and proposals
submitted to them by the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Syria
and Egypt after their meeting in Riyadh Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposals and recommendations deal with the Arab situation
and the future of the peace process in the light of new
developments in the region, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders have strengthened their consultations after
right-wing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu was elected prime
minister in last week's Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mubarak, Jordan's King Hussein and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat met in the Jordanian Red Sea port city of
Aqaba to discuss the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite summit came after a meeting between al-Assad and
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi in Syria Sunday and another one
between Mubarak and al-Assad in Cairo Monday.
</P>
<P>
The flurry of Arab summits is aimed at coordinating Arab
stances to save the peace process as Netanyahu has promised to
take a tougher stance than that of his predecessor Shimon Peres on
peace negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors,
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Gap between China's Regional Economic Growth Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth rates in most
China's areas this year has witnessed a drop, narrowing regional
economic growth gaps, according to the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The state's tight money policy to control inflation has caused
a continuous decline of growth speed of gross domestic product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, the country generated
more than 1,315.57 billion yuan of GDP, with its growth rate over
the same period of last year dropping one percentage point
compared with that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Among them, agricultural's GDP maintained its former growth
speed, that of industry fell by two percentage points, and the
service trade growth was slightly up.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts view that China will keep a higher economic
growth rate of 10.2 per cent.
</P>
<P>
During the first three months of this year east China's Fujian
Province led the country with a 15.6 percent economic growth
speed, followed by Tianjin Municipality and eastern Anhui
Province, both with growth rates reaching 14.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
East China's Jiangsu Province headed the country during the
period, increasing its GDP value by 120.99 billion yuan, while
Shandong and Guangdong Provinces were among those who saw their
GDP values increase by more than 100 billion yuan over the three
month period.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman Condemns Japanese Diet Members' Denial of Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Shen Guofang expressed strong indignation here today at the way a
number of Japanese Diet Members' have denied both Japan's
aggression and the forceful recruitment of "comfort women" by the
Japanese army of aggression during the World War Two.
</P>
<P>
When asked at a routine news conference to comment on a report
that Seisuke Okuno, a Japanese Diet member and one of his
colleagues, denied Japan's history of aggression and Japanese
aggressor troops' forceful recruitment of women in China and other
Asian countries to serve as "comfort women", Shen voiced strong
indignation over a few Japanese Diet members' adherence to the
erroneous conception of history, openly distorting history and
embellishing aggression.
</P>
<P>
The war of aggression launched by the Japanese militarists
brought untold suffering to the Chinese people, Shen noted, adding
that it was a universally-recognized historic fact that forcing
women of China and other Asian countries to serve as "comfort
women" was one of the ferocious crimes committed by the Japanese
aggression army.
</P>
<P>
Having a correct understanding of, and properly dealing with
that period of history, is the important political basis for the
development of Sino-Japanese friendly and cooperative ties, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the Japanese side, taking the approach of
responsibility towards history, no longer does any thing that will
hurt the feelings of people in China and other Asian victimized
countries who have suffered from the aggression," the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> China To Approve Temporary Nuclear Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to approve a
temporary ban on peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs) to contribute
toward the conclusion of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty
(CTBT) by the end of June, said Chinese Disarmament Ambassador Sha
Zukang Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As "a major move by the Chinese Government for the sake of an early
treaty,...the Chinese delegation is now ready to go along with a
temporary ban on PNEs," Sha told a CTBT session here Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
China agrees to leave the issue to the future review conference of
the treaty, he said.
</P>
<P>
If PNEs are to be allowed by a consensus, early arrangements
for possible PNEs should be made, precluding any military benefits
and consistent with the obligations of States under other
international agreements, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has always viewed PNEs as technology helpful to economic
development, and particularly applicable to China, a populous
country with a large territory but relatively scarce natural
resources, Sha noted.
</P>
<P>
Sha also stressed, "It is essential to condition the entry into
force of the treaty on the joining by all those states that are
technically capable of conducting nuclear explosions."
</P>
<P>
As the CTBT should be a concrete step towards the early
elimination of all nuclear weapons, China supports the position of
the Group of 21 non-aligned countries that words on nuclear
disarmament should be included in the relevant part of the treaty,
Sha said.
</P>
<P>
On verification of the treaty, Sha said the most important
issue is the trigger mechanism for on-site inspections (OSI),
which "touches upon the security interests of all states parties
and exemplifies the principle of equality and justice of the
treaty."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that data obtained by the international
monitoring system (IMS) set up under the treaty should serve as
the primary basis for requesting an OSI.
</P>
<P>
He said that although national technical means (NTMs) may have
a supplementary role to play in obtaining data, their use should
be restricted.
</P>
<P>
It is a fact that only a small number of developed countries
possess NTMs suitable for the treaty, and abuses may lead to
discrimination against developing countries, said the Chinese
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The data used to trigger on-site inspection "must be technical,
reliable, verifiable, and obtained in consistence with universally
accepted principles of international law. Such data should also go
through a process of technical and political examination."
</P>
<P>
Sha said that China is categorically against triggering OSI
with so-called "human intelligence" such as espionage information.
</P>
<P>
China firmly believes that in order to ensure the OSI is
applied justly, a request for an OSI must be approved by a
two-thirds majority of the treaty organization's Executive
Council, he added.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Sha stressed that the OSI, being politically
sensitive, can only be the last resort of the verification system
to be used under extreme circumstances. It can only be "a rare
rather than routine event," he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Population Boosted by Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia's population last year
saw the largest increase in five years because of a near double of
immigrant numbers to the country, according to a report released
today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
</P>
<P>
The country's population grew to 18,173,600 by the end of 1995,
up 1.3 percent from the previous year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
This was the largest increase of population since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Overseas migrants moving into Australia contributed to the
major part of the population growth. ABS figures showed that
110,900 new settlers came to the country in 1995, an increase of
97 percent over the 56,200 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals exceeded departures where permanent and long-term
residents were concerned, while many short-term visitors changed
their mind and stayed permanently, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government is considering making new comers wait
longer, namely two years instead of six months, to become eligible
to enjoy social welfare as provided for permanent residents. It is
also planning to impose stricter conditions on entrance of
migrants as refugees.

spell, scored 18 off the bench for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Shawn Kemp led the Sonics with 32 points. He fouled out after
throwing rainbow-haired Dennis Rodman, who had a game-high 13
rebounds, to the floor with 1:43 left in the game.

<P>
The Sonics never got closer than seven points after that, and
the Bulls' 14-4 closing run saw six points from Jordan and single
baskets from Harper, Rodman, Kukoc and Australian centre Luc
Longley for Chicago.

<HEADLINE> China Raises More Silversides in Reservoirs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Reservoirs in central China are
swimming with success after a campaign to introduce millions of
fish proved a big success.
</P>
<P>
About 150 million inseminated silversides eggs were put into
50 reservoirs in Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the country's efforts to raise more silversides
in reservoirs in a bid to make people living around the lakes more
affluent. There used to be only one reservoir with such fish in
Hubei.
</P>
<P>
The nutritious and highly fertile fish used to flock only in a
few lakes in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, according to
experts at the Institute of Reservoir Fishery under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences. The raising of silversides in reservoirs can
give high economic returns.
</P>
<P>
There are now 85,000 reservoirs in China.
</P>
<P>
Last March, the ministries of water conservancy and agriculture
jointly issued a circular calling for accelerating the spread of
techniques on raising of silversides, and a national coordination
group was set up.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 inseminated eggs of silversides were put into
reservoirs across the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year four reservoirs in Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong
and Inner Mongolia gathered more than 300 million silversides
eggs, accounting for half the national total.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the Ministry of Agriculture has listed
silversides production in the "Harvest Plan" for the country's
fishing industry, and the State Science and Technology Commission
has decided to give priority to promotion of relevant techniques.

The Dalian Engineering University in Dalian, a port city in

Most of today's college students were born in the 1970s, and
they seldom have a chance to watch old films on TV in the

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Private Entrepreneurs Encouraged to Compete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong's Governor Lu Ruihua
has encouraged private entrepreneurs to become more actively
engaged in international competition by adopting the system of
modern enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium held here, the governor said that
private enterprises can join forces on a voluntary basis and form
large corporations and conglomerates to sharpen their competitive
edges.
</P>
<P>
As one of the affluent regions in China, Guangdong now boasts
over 1.3 million individually-owned industrial and commercial
enterprises -- those employing less than eight workers each
according to Chinese regulations -- employing a total of 2.5
million workers. They have a combined registered capital of over
16.3 billion yuan (1.963 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
There are 89,000 private enterprises employing 1.17 million
people and showing a combined registered capital of over 57.2
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
At present, the private sector in Guangdong accounts for 10.9
percent of the province's total payroll and 23.6 percent of the
total retail sales.
</P>
<P>
The governor told those attending the symposium that the
private sector has helped increase job opportunities and revenue,
promote commodity distribution, and proved to be a necessary and
beneficial addition to the socialist economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the private sector in Guangdong is still
constantly developing financially, technically and in terms of the
quality of personnel. The government will continue to give support
to the sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that the private sector will take a step forward by
making greater efforts to improve technology and management.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the sector will become more conscious of
laws that affect it, since the market economy is an economy of
law.

<HEADLINE> Three International Conventions to Remain Applicable in Macao after 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) said here today that
three international conventions will remain applicable in Macao
after 1999.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xi'an, representative of the Chinese team of the
Sino-Portuguese JLG, told reporters after a close-door meeting
with the representative of the Portuguese team that certain
progress has been made in Macao's entry into world bodies and the
extension of some international conventions in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The three conventions to be extended after 1999 include the
Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of
Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, a convention on environmental
protection and a convention on the protection of natural species.
</P>
<P>
"We have exchanged views on a wide-range of issues including
the application of international conventions in Macao," Wang said.
"That will help quicken the working pace in solving transitional
affairs in Macao."
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the Chinese side hopes the Portuguese side
would offer a detailed list explaining the international
conventions the Portuguese side wants to extend to Macao before
1999 and the international bodies Macao intends to join in before
1999.
</P>
<P>
"The list will help us to make an overall plan to solve
different problems," Wang said. "I believe that making such a list
will not cause much trouble to the Portuguese side."
</P>
<P>
Jorge Mendes, representative of the Portuguese team, told
reporters that the two sides have discussed at least 27
international conventions, and the current meeting is a
preparatory one for the coming session of the JLG at the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting on Wednesday, the two sides discussed the
three leading issues of the transitional period in Macao -- the
localization of civil servants and law, and the use of Chinese as
an official language.
</P>
<P>
Wang said after the meeting that the localization of civil
servants should be quickened as three-fourths of the transitional
period has past and the remaining time is very limited.
</P>
<P>
He said that both sides agree that the quickening of the
localization process is in the interests of both sides, and the
localization of middle and senior rank civil servants should be
put on top agenda now.

<HEADLINE> Paintings of Qing Dynasty Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Color paintings with the
characteristics of the Imperial family during the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911) have been found in the Songzhu Temple in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
While renovating the temple, construction workers found that
pillars and beams are covered with color paintings. Wang Zhongjie,
an expert of the Palace Museum, verified the paintings were drawn
during the middle years of the Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The temple was built by Emperor Yongzheng in 1733, for a living
buddha from Mongolia to use as his religious site in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the paintings are still bright despite 260
years of weathering.
</P>
<P>
"Dragon and phoenix patterns, which only the imperial family
could use, appear in some paintings," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The paintings feature drawings of imperial courts, parks,
gardens, temples and residences.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his colleagues agreed that the discovery of the
paintings will facilitate the study of production and decoration
of the middle years of the Qing Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Cares for Farmers' Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- It is hoped that the 70 million
rural residents of east China's Zhejiang Province will be provided
with health care by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Current achievements in the province's rural healthcare plan
inspire optimism for this goal, which is part of the plan of the
Chinese government for its rural population of 900 million.
</P>
<P>
Areas that measure the development of healthcare work include
incidence of infectious diseases, and death rates of infants and
women in labor. The province's statistics in these areas have met
or almost reached the national standards for the
end-of-the-century target.
</P>
<P>
Major endemic diseases, such as iodine deficiency and snail
fever, and infectious diseases, including measles and polio, have
been effectively controlled.
</P>
<P>
About half the counties in Zhejiang have passed an examination
for rural healthcare work, conducted early this year by the
Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth of the local economy has led to a prosperous life
for many Zhejiang farmers in recent years, but healthcare
conditions in several areas still need improvement.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, several physicians have been sent to towns and
villages to educate rural residents about health care.
</P>
<P>
The doctors also urged locals to improve toilet facilities and
sanitary conditions in order to reduce environmental
pollution. Many rural households have used flush toilets at home.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 70 percent of farmers have used clean
tap water, the highest rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
A rural medical care network has been established throughout
the province, providing a convenient service for locals in need of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 county-level hospitals and other kinds of
healthcare centers have been formed, as well as 3,000 township
hospitals and 22,300 village clinics, which employ 73,000 medical
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang also has established a cooperative medical care
system, which was jointly funded by government allocations and
individual investment.
</P>
<P>
So far, 6.8 million rural residents involved in this system are
receiving better medical care.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang to Become Power Base on Yangtze River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province aims
to become an electrical power base on the Yangtze River Delta by
the beginning of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the provincial electrical power bureau revealed
their plans during the opening ceremony for the Jiaxing Power
Plant held in Jiaxing city in the province.
</P>
<P>
To achieve their goal, the province plans to put large- and
medium-sized units with a total of 7.96 million kw of installed
capacity into operation during the 1996-2000 period, and to extend
950 km of 500 kv of transmission lines and 2,850 km of 220 kv
lines.
</P>
<P>
Giving priority to fossil-fueled power stations, the province
also will put more effort into building hydraulic and nuclear
power plants during the coming years.
</P>
<P>
It plans to build large coastal fossil-fueled power stations,
develop conventional hydraulic power stations, act quickly to
build a group of gas and steam combined-cycle power plants, and
properly develop pumping storage power plants.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that two 330,000 kw units in Taizhou Power Plant
will become operational, one in this year and one in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Three 600,000 kw units in Beilun Power Plant, which started the
second phase of its expansion in 1995, also are expected to be
built during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Four 600,000 kw units in Jiaxing Power Plant, two 300,000 kw
units in Wenzhou Power Plant, and two 300,000 kw units in
Changxing Power Plant should be completed by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the province had a total of more than 10
million kw of installed capacity, generating 40.7 billion kwh of
electricity annually.
</P>
<P>
The province is expected to have a modern grid system by the
turn of the century, that mainly will be equipped with 500 kv of
transmission lines and 300,000-plus kw units.
</P>
<P>
During recent years, the province has cooperated with dozens of
countries and regions, including the United States, Britain,
Japan, France, Canada, Singapore and the Republic of Kazakhstan,
in the fields of technology, trade and personnel training in the
power industry.
</P>
<P>
The period between 1991-1995 saw the province use more than 400
million US dollars for developing the local power industry.
</P>
<P>
The Beilun, Zhenhai, Taizhou, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Changxing and
other fossil-fueled power plants are mainly located in the
province's eastern coastal area, while the Xin'anjiang,
Fuchunjiang, Wuxijiang and Jinshuitan hydraulic power plants are
situated in the western and southern parts of the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian labor market
remained stagnant as official figures released today showed that
the unemployment rate is still in the upward trend.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today that
total employment rose by 34,000 to 8.325 million in May on a
seasonally adjusted basis.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent in May on a
seasonally adjusted basis from 8.9 percent in April, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
However, in trend terms, the unemployment rate was still on the
rise, moving up to 8.6 percent in May from 8.4 percent in the
previous nine months.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Employment, Education, Training at Youth Affairs
Amanda Vanstone said after the release of the figures that the
Australian labor market was still stagnant.
</P>
<P>
Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot said more than
four-and-half years of economic growth had failed to bring the
unemployment rate below 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
She warned that the coalition government's move to cut eight
billion Australian dollars (6.3 billion US dollars) from the
budget over the next two years would worsen the jobless figure.
</P>
<P>
A hiring intention survey by the Drake International found that
total number of the employed would fall by 0.9 percent in the next
three months, largely due to the federal government's staff cuts.
</P>
<P>
Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry pointed out that it
was imperative to push forward the reform of the labor market in
order to achieve long-term benefits for employment.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government proposed to amend the Industrial
Relations Act and liberalize the labor market. But the bill it
put through to the Parliament has been set aside by the Senate
until August.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Prime Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
resigned here today after only three months in government as the
Constitutional Court announced that the vote of confidence for the
coalition government formed between the Motherland Party (ANAP)
and True Path Party (DYP) was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel approved Yilmaz's
resignation presented this afternoon and asked him to continue
his cabinet until a new government is formed.
</P>
<P>
On May 14, the court upheld an appeal by the pro-Islamic
Welfare Party (RP) which argued that the March 12 confidence vote
for the center-right coalition government was against the
procedure code of the parliament which requires an absolute
majority of those who attended the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The ANAP-DYP government won by 257-207 votes with 80
abstention, thus failed to gain an absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
On June 3, Turkey's parliament voted overwhelmingly to open a
debate on a censure motion submitted by the RP against the
government led by Yilmaz. The voting results of 316 to 122
suggested that the parliament would oust the government on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the DYP deputies joined the deputies from the RP,
the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Grand Unity Party
(BBP) in voting for opening the debate against the government.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary group of the DYP unanimously decided
Wednesday to vote for the motion against Yilmaz's government.
</P>
<P>
DYP Chairwoman and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said at
her group meeting: "in coming days we will have to take a number
of critical steps. But one point which is very clear so far is
that the current government does not carry on."
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said to his parliamentary group this morning that it is
hard for the government to gain 276 votes in the 550-seat
assembly for the vote of confidence and so, the only thing
remains for him is to submit his resignation to President
Suleyman Demirel.

Guided by the philosophy that "He who develops, benefits,"
individual farm households have volunteered to take part in soil
improvement projects.
</P>
<P>
The move also has attracted dozens of overseas corporations,
that have pooled 20 million US dollars for land improvement.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have produced high-yielding fields by building
reservoirs and digging canal networks in their land. Others have
adopted various methods such as digging deep furrows in the soil,
diverting water from the Yellow River and building terraced
fields, under which fish and lotus roots can be raised while crops
are growing above.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive soil treatment efforts brought an additional
170,000 tons of grain and 20,000 tons of cotton to Binzhou
Prefecture last year. And the per capita net income of farmers at
Dongying Prefecture increased by 1,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> China to Approve Temporary Ban on Peaceful Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to approve a
temporary ban on peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs) in efforts
toward the conclusion of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
by the end of June, Chinese Disarmament Ambassador Sha Zukang said
today.
</P>
<P>
Showing necessary flexibility to facilitate the conclusion of
the treaty within the time-frame as planned, "the Chinese
delegation is now ready to go along with a temporary ban on PNEs,"
Sha told a CTBT session this morning.
</P>
<P>
China agrees to leave the issue to the review of a future
conference of States Parties, he said, adding that if peaceful
explosions would be allowed by a consensus, early arrangements for
possible explosions should be made, precluding any military
benefits and being consistent with the obligations of States under
other international agreements.
</P>
<P>
China has always viewed peaceful nuclear explosions as
technology helpful to economic development, particularly of
China, a populous country with a large territory but relatively
scarce natural resources, Sha noted.

to Malaysia per month.
</P>
<P>
"We were told by the delegation that China produces two types
of flour, the 505 plain flour and 502 refined plain flour," Tan
told the press.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the flour is between 82 sen (about 0.33 US dollars)
and 89 sen (about 0.36 dollars) per kg excluding freight charges,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Launches Suzhou River Purification Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial city
has begun a comprehensive project to purify the Suzhou River that
runs through Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai municipal government convened a large gathering
Wednesday to announce the formal launching of the project.
</P>
<P>
To prevent pollution in the river, the municipal government
will forbid shipping and the use of wharves and illegal buildings
along the lower part of the Suzhou River.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more trees will be planted along the banks of the
river in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou River is 125 kilometers long and its lower part, 22
kilometers, crosses Shanghai. Many factories, wharves and
residential buildings stand along the two banks of the Suzhou
River.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1970s, the river water turned black and produced a
foul odor, owing to dumping of industrial and domestic waste
water, both directly and indirectly into the river.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the city government began to make efforts to
clean up the river. It collected 1.6 billion yuan (about 200
million U.S. dollars) to build a 40-kilometer-long wastewater
pipeline, which is used to collect industrial and domestic
wastewater along the river, and also a water disposal project,
which is able to treat 1.17 million tons of waste water daily.
</P>
<P>
To completely eliminate the pollutant materials from the water,
the municipal government launched the project for the full-scale
purification of Suzhou River.
</P>
<P>
An administrative group headed by the city mayor will lead the
work efforts.
</P>
<P>
The city's target for the year of 2000 is to keep the water
free from floating waste and foul smell. The goal for 2010 is to
create conditions favorable for the return of fish and shrimp to
the river.

COLOMBO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Sri Lanka's northern
Jaffna peninsula will shortly receive the fertilizer they need to
cultivate the land there, according to official sources here
today.

Company will dispatch fertilizer to Jaffna peninsula by ship which
began its journey to the North Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sri Lanka heavily depended on Jaffna Peninsula Farmers
for chilies, onions and other similar food crops. The worsening
of the conflict in the 1980's saw production of these items in the
North collapse and these items had to be imported in order to meet
the market demand.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that government is hopeful that the revival

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here today that the United States
should not tell countries in Southeast Asia how to manage the
region.
</P>
<P>
Opening the three-day 10th Asia-Pacific Roundtable meeting
here, Abdullah said that whatever role the US wants to play in
Southeast Asia should complement the efforts by the ASEAN as the
regional grouping knows best how to keep the area stable.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"The US has been playing a role in this region and we are aware
that it wants to continue to be engaged in the area but it should
try to understand the efforts by the ASEAN to ensure continued
peace and stability in the region," the Malaysian minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is good to have friends living far away like the US
who have a keen interest in the region's security and stability,
but it is wrong for them to tell countries in the region how to
manage the area, adding the ASEAN countries will oppose any
military adventurism in the region which could threaten its
security and hamper economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The 10th Asia-Pacific Roundtable meeting was attended by some
240 policy makers, academicians, scholars, journalists, NGO

Israeli police today.
</P>
<P>
JMCC, based in East Jerusalem, said Dawoud Ya'coub Shwaiki, 28,

house in Ras Al-Amoud, Jerusalem, this morning,.
</P>
<P>
Dawoud's father, Ya'coub, said that a van stopped in front of
the house next to Dawoud's car. Dawoud, accompanied by his two
brothers and Ya'coub, went out to find what this van wanted, when
a civilian clothed group went out of the van and shot at him
leading to an immediate death. One of Dawoud's brothers,
Muhammad, was also injured and is now in Hadassa Hospital. The
special unit also arrested Dawoud's younger brother, Whbe, but
released him at a later time.
</P>
<P>
The father added that there was another Israeli border guards
patrol in the area, who prevented the neighbors and others in the
area from getting closer to the scene of the shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
Ya'coub denied the Israeli military story that there were
three armed men, including his son, which led the special unit to
shoot. He affirmed that his son was killed in cold blood. Ya'coub
added that Dawoud did not have a "security" history with the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
As for the body, it is currently at Abu Kabir Autopsy Center,
and the Israeli authorities has so far refused to hand over
Dawoud's body to his family.

while the youngest is one and half years old.

<HEADLINE> Iran Accuses Iraq of Holding 700 Iranian POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran today accused Iraq of
detaining 700 Iranian prisoners of war and demanded their early
return to the country.
</P>
<P>
Ali Akbar Abutorabi, representative of Iran's Supreme Leader
Ali Khamenei for the ex-POWS' affairs, said they "are still being
held in captivity in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraqi government should acknowledge the
detention of Iranian POWS in Iraq and clarify their condition.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that this is the smallest number of
Iranian POWS the Iranian authorities have ever put forward in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of POWS is one of the problems that blocks the
improvement of relations between Iran and Iraq. The two neighbors
fought an eight-years war from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed earlier that Iraq still holds more than 15,000
Iranian POWS according the documents it has, while Iraq said
that there are some 5,000 Iraqi POWS still kept in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran repeatedly attacked Iraq for its reluctance to cooperate
with Iran in the issue although it has unilaterally released
thousands of Iraqi POWS during the past years.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what Iran announced, the Iraqi side has said that
Iraq holds only 64 Iranian prisoners, most of them were captured
in southern Iraq in 1990 and two of them were Iranian air force
officers captured in May 1993 when their aircraft were shut down
during their attack on the bases of Iranian outlawed Mujahideen
Khalq Organization (MKO) in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran did not reveal how many Iraqi POWS are still kept in Iran,
but it released 100 Iraqi POWS in August of 1995 as a signal to
Iraq for rapprochement between the two neighbors.

<HEADLINE> 800 Houses Burnt Down in Malindi, Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A firestorm has razed down over
800 houses, leaving over 10,000 people homeless, one baby dead
and four people missing in Kenya's coastal town of Malindi, the
"Kenya Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The fire raged for over five hours as people ran
helter-skelter to safety and looters took advantage of deserted
homes," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The disaster spread fast due to the strong sea winds and lack
of adequate fire fighting machines and personnel in town.
</P>
<P>
The fire left a trail of destroyed shops, workshops, cafes,
medical clinics, where residents cried openly and uncontrollably
as they were watching their earthly possessions, especially
clothing go up in smoke, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest and most devastating fire in the coastal town was
caused by two people fighting over food using fire-wood and live
embers.
</P>
<P>
Kilifi Kilifi District Commissioner Lucas Kosilbet drove to
the scene with a battalion of police officers and fire-fighters
upon the report of fire, which has been brought under control.

<HEADLINE> Shenyang Starts Construction of Toxic Waste Disposal Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Shenyang Toxic
Industrial Waste Disposal and Burying Plant, the first of its kind
in China, started Tuesday in suburbs of Shenyang, a large
industrial city in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Funded by a World Bank loan of seven million U.S. dollars, the
project will absorb a total investment of 120 million yuan (14.8
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The toxic waste disposal plant will be in the Xinchengzi
District of Shenyang City, and cover about nine hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The project includes construction of a toxic waste transport
system, a safety burying pit which can contain 240,000 tons of
waste, a dialysis system with an annual processing capacity of
1,350 tons, and a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang and its surrounding cities are China's most heavily
polluted areas, which has prompted local authorities to develop
systems for environmental protection, pollution control, and the
comprehensive utilization of national resources into the city's
long-term economic and social development plan.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Shenyang invested 850 million yuan (10
million U.S. dollars) in environmental protection projects.
</P>
<P>
Though the city's gross national product has been growing
rapidly, it kept its environmental protection index at the same
level recorded in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
After the operation of the toxic waste disposal plant, the
pollution of toxic waste in Shenyang and neighboring cities is
expected to be greatly reduced. The project will be used as a
model for similar projects in other Chinese cities.

<HEADLINE> Britain Offers to Help With Zimbabwe's Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Wednesday said it would
give Zimbabwe over 14 million U.S. Dollars to support economic
reforms provided the southern African country reached agreement
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
British Minister of Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Lynda
Chalker demanded Zimbabwe reduce the budget deficit to manageable
levels.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's budget deficit currently stands at 4.274 billion
Zimbabwe Dollars (427 million U.S. Dollars), representing 6.7
percent of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Britain cancelled the disbursement of 10 million U.S. Dollars in
balance of payments support for the economic reform programme during
the 1995/96 financial year because Zimbabwe did not meet IMF spending
targets.
</P>
<P>
"I held discussion with Zimbabwe Finance Minister Herbert
Murerwa and he assured me of Zimbabwe's continued efforts to
reduce the budget deficit," the British minister said.

<HEADLINE> Automated Teller Machine System Soon in GCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 6 (Xinhua) -- An automatic cash-withdrawing
machine system will soon come into service in the six Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) nations, according to official sources
here today.
</P>
<P>
The system is aimed at providing convenience to the citizens
traveling among the GCC countries by withdrawing money with a
card in each other's country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local newspaper Arab Times Wednesday,
Mohammed Marafi, chairman of Kuwait Net (KNET), a network on which
Kuwaitis could draw cash anywhere within the country limits from
automated teller machines, said that an integrated system among
GCC countries will be fully operational next year.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are going through a series of tests at the moment,
sharing cash withdrawals from Automated Teller Machines
(ATM). First with the Saudi Payment Network (SPN) and with other
GCC switches later."
</P>
<P>
The proposed GCC-wide regional sharing arrangement allows each
national switch to connect with other national switches, he said,
adding that the building of an automatic cash-drawing network in
the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain are presently
at different stages and all are expected to be completed before
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
"The system we have created (in Kuwait) has been shared with
all GCC countries, making it very easy to inter-connect," Marafi
said.
</P>
<P>
The KNET system currently links all banks in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that KNET card holders traveling to all
other GCC countries will be able to utilize the service of cash
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Devised as a "convenience for travelers," once the GCC link is
fully operational, card holders are guaranteed 100 percent
security, Marafi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also insisted that the same high level of
standards of KNET will be incorporated into the GCC system as
well.

HARARE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's largest bank on

</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, said on Wednesday the rate of inflation

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Philippine Foreign Ministers Confer in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen and Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs
Domingo Siazon held talks here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry sources said that the two foreign
ministers exchanged views covering a wide range of issues
involving Sino-Philippine relations, China-ASEAN relations and
other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Qian said Sino-Philippine relations have been progressing
steadily since the two countries established diplomatic ties 21
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two governments want to maintain Sino-Philippine friendly
relations and regional stability, Qian said, so that they can
properly resolve problems in bilateral relations in the spirit of
seeking common ground, while still reserving differences,
respecting and trusting each other, and consulting with each other
in a friendly manner.
</P>
<P>
"China highly values the traditional friendship between the
Chinese and Philippine peoples and attaches importance to the
further development of all-round friendly relations and
cooperation with the Philippines," Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, who arrived here Wednesday on an official visit, said
"important progress" has been made in Philippine-Chinese relations
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is ready to expand its cooperation with China
in various sectors, particularly in economy, trade, science and
technology, Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Philippines wants to maintain discussions and
cooperation with China in both regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government will continue to stick to the "one
China" policy, the foreign secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers agreed that the two countries should
properly settle the existing disputes on the Nansha islands in the
South China Sea through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Qian and Siazon expressed satisfaction over
the "all-round development" of the China-ASEAN relations in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the relations between China and ASEAN, as well
as its member countries, are growing "steadily and in an all-round
way."
</P>
<P>
The common interests between China and ASEAN greatly outweigh
their differences, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides need a favorable and stable neighboring environment,
which is the most fundamental common ground between China and all
southeast Asian nations, Qian explained.
</P>
<P>
Siazon told Qian that his country, which is now making
preparations for this year's APEC forum and its informal
leadership meeting to be held in the Philippines, hopes to obtain
close cooperation and support from China.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Taiwan's participation, he said the Philippine
government will strictly follow the rules designated at the
previous APEC forums and informal leadership meetings.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his appreciation for the Philippine position and
said China is willing to maintain close discussions and work
together with the Philippines to ensure positive results at the
meetings.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Strengthens Land Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- By cracking over 6,000 cases a year,
a provincial land administration in China has saved more than
2,000 hectares of farmland from rampant occupation over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
Between 1986 and 1995 land occupied by construction totalled
96,300 hectares, 40,000 hectares less than the previous decade,
said Wang Jian, an official with the land administration in
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
With the setting up of an administrative system for the
examination and approval of land rights, the province's space of
land used for construction has decreased, despite the growth of
economic development, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In Jingzhou Prefecture 80 percent of farmland has been put
under priority protection. Administrators of land in the province
have become more competent in their work. At present 25 percent of
land management officials have received college education.
</P>
<P>
Wang went on to say that the provincial administration has
effectively adjusted the structure of land use.
</P>
<P>
Even when less land is used for construction, the building of a
number of energy, transportation and industrial projects, such as
a section of the Beijing-Kowloon railway, Hanchuan Power Plant,
has been completed successfully.
</P>
<P>
As a major agricultural province, Hubei faces acute shortage of
land, with each person having 0.05 hectares at present.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee an annual increase of 500 million kg in
grain output during the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000),
the land administration will strengthen law enforcement, reform
land use systems to ensure the area of farmland stands above
3.3 million hectares, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The administration plans to reclaim more waste land, waste
mountains and slopes, so that 33,000 hectares of land can be
developed, he said.

<HEADLINE> Trade Minister Starts Trip to Seven Latin American Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu
Yi, heading a Chinese government economic and trade delegation,
left here today for a month-long visit to Cuba, Mexico and other
five Latin American nations to explore new ways for furthering its
trade and economic ties with those countries.
</P>
<P>
This will be the largest team ever led by a Chinese foreign
trade minister to the region, an official with the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec) said.
</P>
<P>
The other five countries the delegation will visit are Brazil,
which is China's biggest trade partner in the region, Peru, Chile,
Argentina, and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The move is just part of China's effort in implementing its
policy of market diversification for its foreign trade, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhiquan, director of the Moftec's American and Oceania
Affairs Department, said that China attaches great importance to
developing its mutually-beneficial trade and economic cooperation
with Latin American countries, which have been advancing at a
quick pace since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese customs, trade volume between China
and the region last year rose by 30 percent to 6.11 billion US
dollars, making up 2.1 percent and 1.3 percent of their total
foreign trade volume respectively.
</P>
<P>
Great potentials are yet to be tapped for further developing
trade and economic cooperation between China and Latin American
countries as their economies are strongly complementary to each
other, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Wu's visit will serve to promote
mutual investment between China and the region while enhancing
bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, Chinese enterprises have launched 160 solely
invested business or joint ventures in 24 countries and areas in
the region, with an actual investment of 300 million US dollars,
while businesses funded by Latin American countries in China have
numbered nearly 200, with an actual investment of 300 million US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Fight Bicycle Traffic Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- With pedal-power still dominating
Chinese streets, the country's capital has launched an extensive
campaign to tighten control over bicycles in an attempt to reduce
the increasing number of traffic jams and accidents.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, 4,800 traffic accidents have occurred in Beijing
due to bicycle riders' violations of regulations. More than 490
people here have been killed and 4,600 injured.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has urged the 6.5 million local
cyclists to better manage their bicycles and not violate traffic
regulations, according to the "Beijing Evening News."
</P>
<P>
Sources said that by the end of last April, the capital had
8.48 million bicycles, which led to increasing traffic jams and
violations.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities also are soliciting opinions and suggestions
for maintaining traffic order in the presence of a large number of
bicycles.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now has more than 10 bicycle
manufacturers, each with an annual output topping one million
bicycles.

<P>
HAIKOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A green "Great Wall" is being built
along the east coast of Hainan Province, an area often considered
a "typhoon corridor"in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1973, a typhoon hit this southernmost province, killing 720
people, injuring over 1,700 people and causing direct economic
losses valued at one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To prevent similar nightmares from occuring again, local
authorities started planting eucalyptus, Caribbean pine and other
trees along the coastal area. So far, a 1,463-km-long stretch of
forest has been built, forming a complete coastal forest belt
system.
</P>
<P>
With more and more people vigorously joining the project, the
local government has issued contracts to farmers agreeing to pay
them for their tree-planting efforts.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei province will
focus on the development of ecological agriculture to protect its
environment in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
One of the earliest provinces in the country to work toward
improving ecological conditions, Hubei has more than 100 counties
promoting the combination of economic, ecological and social
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
In addition to farming, they plant trees and grass, and raise
fish and livestock.
</P>
<P>
As a result, these counties have raised the forest coverage
rate from 26 percent to 35 percent, brought control to one third
of the soil-eroded areas, and increased high-yield farmland by
about 267,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
At present, Hubei has built 200,000-hectare production bases
for chemical-free tea, rice and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The ecological development has benefited farmers whose annual
income is more than 100 yuan per capita higher than the average
income of farmers in the province.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Youth Killed by Israeli Soldiers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- An 18-year Palestinian youth,
Hanna Abu Alona, was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers near
Khan Yunis, the Gaza Strip, Wednesday night amid tensions
mounting follow rightwing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu's
election of Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The youth ran toward Israeli soldiers at an outpost near the
refugee camp and failed to heed warnings to stop, reported Israel
Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the soldiers feared the young man was
wearing explosives and so they opened fire. They had first warned
him twice to stop and fired in the air.
</P>
<P>
The incident may further infuriate radical Palestinian Islamic
groups who described Netanyahu's victory in the elections as a
declaration of war against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, thousands of Jews gathered in the city center of
Hebron singing and dancing to celebrate Netanyahu's victory at
what was billed as a "thanksgiving rally for the saving of
Hebron."
</P>
<P>
A message from Netanyahu was read out at the rally. It
said: "Settlers of Hebron, city of our forefathers: I share in
your joy but unfortunately am unable to be with yoy." "I am full
of appreciation for your Zionist and pioneering work, which
continues the Jewish presence in the old Jewish city in the world
-- the older sister of Jerusalem. Be strong and brave."
</P>
<P>
This was interpreted by some settlement leaders as an
indication that Netanyahu does not intend to pull the army out of
Hebron, which the Labor-led government pledged to do in
accordance with Oslo 2 agreement.
</P>
<P>
Seeing Netanyahu's victory as a green light for speeding up
settlement activity in east Jerusalem, the Elad settlement group
has moved a Jewish family into a home in the City of David
section of Silwan.
</P>
<P>
This move is the first expansion of the original effort to
move Jewish families into the Arab village over four years ago,
during the final months of the last Likud government. Eleven
Jewish families moved in then, sparking international
criticism. the recent addition brings the total to 12.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two separate calls to annex settlements were heard,
one from Ma'aleh Adumim Mayor Benny Kashriel calling for the
extension of Israeli sovereignty over the "Greater Jerusalem
settlements," and the other from Jordan Valley settlement heads
calling for the annexation of their region.
</P>
<P>
Kashriel unveiled a plan at a Jerusalem press conference for a
greater Jerusalem supra-municipality that would incorporate
Jerusalem, Ma'aleh Adumim, Givat Ze'ev, Efrat, Betar, Har Adar,
and Mevasseret Yerushalayim.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be submitted to the new rightwing government
when it is formed likely on June 17.

<HEADLINE> IMF Criticizes Uganda for Increasing Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
yesterday criticized Uganda for its increased military
expenditure during the 1995/96 financial year, the local press
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
IMF representative in Uganda Ulrike Wilson was quoted by "The
New Vision" as saying that within the total expenditures in this
current fiscal year, substantial reallocations have been made to
the defence budget, a practice which threatens to undermine the
budget process and should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
The donor community has been concerned about increased
expenditure on defence and the re-admission into the army of some
men and officers retired from service, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
It is said that as a result of increased expenditure on
defence, expenditure on priority projects has dropped about 10
percent in Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Migrants' Children Get Way to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- School-age children of China's 80
million migrants may soon be going to school, in light of a recent
decision by the State Education Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
SEC sources said here today that most school-age children of
migrants can attend local schools as temporary students. Others
can take training courses for informal education.
</P>
<P>
Schools and administrators for the training courses may charge
migrant students an enrollment fee.
</P>
<P>
Selected by the SEC on a trial basis to launch the program are
Beijing and its neighbors, Tianjin municipality and Hubei
Province, as well as Shanghai, east China's Zhejiang Province, and
Shenzhen City in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The floating population throughout China totalled 80 million
last year. About two to three million of this group are school-age
children, who follow their parents as they travel the country in
search of jobs.
</P>
<P>
Most migrants congregate in big cities, open cities in coastal
areas, border towns involved in frontier trade and distributing
centers for small commodities.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of education for them is becoming acute," said an
SEC official who is in charge of basic education.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the problem must be addressed, as it clashes with
the Compulsory Education Law, equal rights to education among all
children of school age, and the overall improvement of people's
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, students from Beijing Normal University
voluntarily started a night school for migrant laborers.

<HEADLINE> Oroqen County in Inner Mongolia Enjoys Greater Autonomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Oroqen Autonomous Banner, a county
in Inner Mongolia which inhabits the smallest minority ethnic
group in China, is now implementing more flexible autonomous
policies.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, the Standing Committee of the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region adopted the Regulations on Autonomy in the
Oroqen Autonomous Banner.
</P>
<P>
Oroqen covers 60,000 square kilometers and had a population of
310,000 at the end of last year, including 2,130 Oroqen people.
</P>
<P>
The people there originated from the Heilongjiang River Valley
and still lived in primitive conditions before the founding of New
China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Formerly only hunters and fishermen, they now are also engaged
in farming and livestock breeding.
</P>
<P>
The Oroqen County government may formulate new policies and
take additional measures to train officials and technical
personnel of Oroqen and other minority ethnic groups, in
accordance with the Regulations on Autonomy in Oroqen Autonomous
Banner.
</P>
<P>
The County government can give priority to Oroqen people and
people of other minority ethnic groups in hiring civil
servants. It will also be responsible for developing local natural
resources and protecting historic sites and relics.
</P>
<P>
The Regulations also state that June 7 marks the establishment
of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, and that Oroqen's traditional
festival, a campfire, will be held June 18.

<HEADLINE> Computer Software Glitch Blamed for Ariane Launch Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A day after the explosion of the
first Ariane-5 rocket in its maiden flight, French officials today
blamed a computer software glitch for the failure.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Mugnier, launch operations director for the French
Space Agency (CNES), said that preliminary data indicated
computers had sent wrong information to the rocket.
</P>
<P>
The guidance system broke down 37 seconds after lift-off from
European Space Agency's (ESA) launch site in Kourou, French
Guiana. At 41 seconds, data transmission failed.
</P>
<P>
The problem caused the rocket to change direction and break
apart, prompting ground controllers to blow up the launch vehicle
one minute six seconds after the blast-off.
</P>
<P>
Also destroyed was an uninsured scientific satellite payload
worth 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a disaster, but rather an incident," Yves Le Gall,
head of strategy at the CNES, told a news conference in Kourou.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the failure would not be very high if the fault was
in the guidance system, rather than in the propulsion system, said
French Space Minister Francois Fillon.
</P>
<P>
The Ariane-5 project had so far cost some 40 billion francs (8
billion U.S. dollars) and was already 20 percent over budget, the
minister told Europe 1 radio.
</P>
<P>
The commission set up to investigate the accident will report
by mid-July, and the second Ariane-5 rocket's launch scheduled for
September will probably be delayed, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Gall assured reporters that the failure "will not
delay the second mission for a long time."

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Prime Minister-elect
Benjamin Netanyahu told Sultan Qaboos of Oman Wednesday night that
he and his government would continue with the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Omani News Agency (ONA), Natanyahu
telephoned Qaboos and Oman's Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah for making this commitment.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli Prime Minister asserted during his call to the
Sultan that he and his government will continue with the Middle
East peace process," ONA said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also "asserted his commitment to the Palestinian-
Israeli peace agreements as well as continuing the peace process
with the other Arab countries to achieve the desired peace," the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
ONA said Sultan Qaboos asked Netanyahu "to guarantee the
commitment of the new Israeli government to implement all
agreements that the former Israeli government signed with the
Arab sides and to double its efforts to resume negotiations on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks to reach a real, lasting and
comprehensive peace."
</P>
<P>
Oman belongs to the Gulf Cooperation Council(GCC) which also
groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Oman and Qatar are the only GCC countries to have agreed
exchanging trade missions with Israel. Qatar's Cabinet Wednesday
also urged Netanyahu to remain committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today from Doha quoted Qatari officials
as saying that Qatar would consider slowing down the pace of
normalizing ties with Israel following Netanyahu's election.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries are concerning that the right-wing government of
Israel might be less keen than former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
on achieving the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia are expected to hold talks
on Friday in the kingdom on the issue of the Middle East after
Israel's election.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Provide China With Clean Coal Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A consortium of Canadian companies
is to send state-of-the-art clean coal technology to China to help
solve the country's air pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
The technology, which can drastically reduce noxious emissions
such as sulphur dioxide from coal-fired power stations and allows
waste to be recycled into other raw materials, will be installed
this September at a plant in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The consortium, including Babcock &AMP; Wilcox, Canada-China Power
Inc. and Ontario Hydro International, has designed the Clean Coal
Technology Transfer Project.
</P>
<P>
The "circulating fluidized bed "technology, reduces over 90
percent of sulphur dioxide and 50 percent of nitrogen dioxide from
coal burning boilers. In addition, solid waste can be recycled as
raw material for local cement plants, Babcock &AMP; Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
The consortium will also provide technical assistance, training
and other services to Chinese power generation design institutes,
environmental protection agencies and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has agreed
to contribute 8.4 million U.S. dollars to the project, which will
be completed in three and a half years under an agreement signed
here today between CIDA and the consortium.

LISBON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Portugese Prime Minister Antonio

<P>
In another attempt to reduce environmental pollution, the
government has also adopted a regulation on the recycling of soft
drinks packings, which now account for one-third of the country's
total urban solid wastes.
</P>
<P>
"It (recycling of packings) is a key question that has a
bearing on the quality of our environment in the future," the
president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the government should preempt by enacting standards
governing future commercial production and civilian behavior, he
warned "the longer the issue drags on, the higher price we will
pay."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Medicare's Hospital Fund to be Insolvent Sooner Than </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A major hospital insurance fund
for the elderly run under the government's Medicare program will run
out of money in 2001, one year earlier than forecast, unless the
system is reformed, a report warned today.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin called on Republican leaders to
work with President Bill Clinton's administration to pass a budget
this year which would provide a short-term cure for Medicare's
solvency problems.
</P>
<P>
Rubin appeared with Health and Human Services Secretary Donn
Shalala and Labor Secretary Robert Reich to release the report
prepared by the trustees of Medicare, a federally funded health
insurance program for the elderly needy.
</P>
<P>
In last year's annual report, the trustees said Medicare
wouldn't be insolvent until after 2002.
</P>
<P>
The Medicare trustees urged the immediate enactment of
legislation to curb the growth in program costs and the setting up
of a national advisory group to draft long-term recommendations on
Medicare reform.
</P>
<P>
Medicare finances have worsened because of greater expenditures
for home health care, nursing facilities and hospice care, said
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. Hospitals
are also performing more expensive operations on the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said President Clinton is proposing 116 billion
U.S. dollars in Medicare savings as part of the plan to balance
the federal budget over seven years, while the Republicans' last
proposal was 168 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But within the 116 billion dollars, there is common ground, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton last year vetoed the balanced budget bill passed by the
Republicans, which would have saved about 226.7 billion dollars
from Medicare up to 2002.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Medicare is a national health program through which
certain medical and hospital expenses of the aged and the needy
are paid for from Federal funds.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Emission Test Campaign Launched in Kathmandu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Traffic authorities in this
capital city of Nepal Wednesday launched a new air pollution
control campaign by introducing a vehicle emission test on the
occasion of the World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle test campaign was initiated Wednesday by conducting
a pollution test on the car used by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba.
</P>
<P>
Under the new vehicle pollution test system, all the vehicles
in the Kathmandu area have to take tests on their pollution levels
compulsory within the next six months.
</P>
<P>
According to traffic officers, petrol-fueled vehicles only
emitting smoke with less than three percent carbon could pass the
pollution test.
</P>
<P>
A vehicle passing the test could receive a green sticker
provided by the traffic authorities but it could receive a yellow
one only if fails the test.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles receiving yellow warnings could take another test
within two month. If they fail again, they would be banned from
the roads in the Kathmandu area.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the prime minister's armored Mercedes failed its
inaugural test Wednesday as results showed 4.2 percent carbon
within its emission, more than one percent higher than the three
percent standard.
</P>
<P>
Officers said that nearly 90 percent of the vehicles having
undergone a similar pollution test two years ago in the area had
failed.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for such a high failure rate include entry of
second-hand vehicles into the country, lack of proper maintenance,
poor quality of fuel and dust in the air, they said.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that there are nearly 100,000 registered
vehicles in Kathmandu valley with only 340 kilometers of motorable
roads at present.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Latin American nations have
made much headway in the war against drug trafficking and
consumption in the first months of this year.
</P>
<P>
In Argentina, the National Gendarmery (police) said it has
confiscated a total of 416 kilograms of cocaine and 665 kilograms
of marijuana during the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 352 drug dealers were detained in 1,380 operations
carried out by the police, according to a bulletin released on
June 3 by the Gendarmery.
</P>
<P>
In Peru, the anti-drug authorities seized 411 kilograms of
cocaine-based paste last weekend in a passenger bus. The drugs
were in 18 small bags mixed with the bundles and parcels of the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle was travelling through the Urubamba Valley in the
central part of the country with a dozen passengers on when it was
stopped by a group of agents, a local newspaper said. The
passengers were now held by the agents to find out the owners of
the shipment.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, the Federal Judicial Police agents have confiscated
approximately eight tons of marijuana and detained six people
suspected of peddling drugs, two of them U.S. citizens in various
operations carried out recently in five states of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Attorney-General's Office said in a bulletin that
the biggest contraband: one ton and 24 kilograms of marijuana was
confiscated from a truck trailer at a highway checkpoint in San
Luis, Baja California.
</P>
<P>
In Colombia, the authorities detained 278 drug dealers, nine of
them foreigners, and confiscated 538 kilograms of cocaine, 339
kilograms of cocaine base, 17 tons of coca leaves and 22.4 tons of
pressed marijuana during the month of May, official sources said.
</P>
<P>

radios, 54 vehicles, seven boats and two airplanes last month and
destroyed 1,337 hectares of coca crops. 17 hectares of marijuana
and 947 hectares of poppies crops.
</P>
<P>
In Costa Rica, agents of the Judicial Investigation Body seized
95 kilograms of cocaine being transported in a freight truck with
a Guatemalan license plate, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle was detained Monday evening when it was entering
the city limits of Costa Rica capital San Jose. The driver and
his assistant were taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
The drug was wrapped in one-kilogram packages sealed with two
layers of plastic tape and its final destination was the United
States, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the U.S. Customs Services agents seized 458
kilograms of cocaine hidden in a freight truck from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The agents discovered the drugs when inspecting the
refrigerator unit filled with tomatos and other vegetables. The
cocaine shipment is said to be worth of 45 million U.S. dollars in
the drug market.

<HEADLINE> Samper's Defense Attorney Barred From Political Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper's defense attorney will be barred from
taking part in the president's political trial now underway in
the lower house of Congress, the Supreme Court ruled today.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers had previously decided to allow Samper's lawyer, Luis
Guillermo Nieto Roa, to take part in the debate in the house over
whether to pursue or drop criminal charges against Samper, who is
accused of illegally using drug money from the Cali Cartel to fund
his 1994 presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
But liberal Congresswoman Alegria Fonsecaf filed a petition
with the criminal court of the Supreme Court challenging the
decision, claiming it violated the procedure of the political
trial.
</P>
<P>
The Court ruled in her favor and has now barred Nieto Roa from
taking any further part in the debate, but did not say
specifically whether he may or may not attend as an observer.
</P>
<P>
President Ernesto Samper was charged in February with receiving
millions of U.S. dollars from the Cali drug cartel during the
presidential campaign in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A special congressional panel set up to investigate the charges, the
House Accusations Committee, recommended last week that criminal
charges against the president be dropped.
</P>
<P>
That recommendation is now being debated by the lower house of
Congress, which must approve or reject it.
</P>
<P>
If the house decides to pursue the criminal charges against
Samper, the Senate, or upper house, would conduct a political
trial. If found guilty, Samper would be immediately removed from
office and his case would pass to the Supreme Court for a criminal
trial.

<HEADLINE> China, US Sets up Over 100 Pairs of Sister-City Relationships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua)-- To date, 111 pairs of sister-city
relationships have been established between Chinese and
U.S. cities, Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Li, who also is president of the Chinese Association of
Mayors, plans to visit the United States tomorrow as head of a
Chinese delegation of governors and mayors.
</P>
<P>
Since diplomatic relations were first forged in 1979, exchanges
between China and the United States have been steadily improving,
and bilateral relations have undergone remarkable development on
the basis of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Twin-city relationships also have been on the rise between
Chinese cities and provinces and U.S. cities and states, which
suggests the shared desire of the people of the two countries to
have friendly exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Li said the sister cities in the two countries have explored
possibilities for sharing ideas and information about politics,
trade and economy, science and technology, education, culture and
sports.
</P>
<P>
For the past few years, Li continued, delegations from 640
Chinese cities visited the United States, and U.S. delegations
returned the visits, which promoted understanding and friendship
between the two peoples and enhanced their respective economic
constructions and social development.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of Chinese governors and mayors will leave here
tomorrow for a visit to the U.S. at the invitation of the
national committee of the US-China People's Friendship
Association, sources said.

BANGKOK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar authorities have accepted
Thailand's proposal to resume construction work on the
Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge and revive cross-border trade
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made at the 14th meeting of the local
Thai-Myanmar Border Committee at Mae Sot, northern Thailand,
Wednesday. The meeting was also the first since Yangon closed the
Mae Sot-Myawaddy border on March 4 last year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar had earlier accused Thailand of illegal encroachment
and demanded a halt to all construction work on the friendship
bridge.
</P>
<P>
At the Wednesday meeting, Thailand also called on Myanmar to
exercise greater control over ethnic groups which have reportedly
crossed the border to rob and kill Thai villagers.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar delegation asked Thailand to return three rifles
seized from its soldiers on March 12 during cross-border fighting

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Finance Ministry is
expected to allow imports of wine essence for local blending and
bottling to meet rising demand of wine consumption in the country.
</P>
<P>
Imports of wine essence would help reduce imports of expensive
wines and ease the country's current account deficit, said
Somjainuek Engtrakul, Director-General of the Excise Department of
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Somjainuek also said that his department is also seeking for a
ministerial permission to amend a regulation which only allows
vineyard owners to open wineries.
</P>
<P>
Imports of wine essence currently are prohibited in Thailand
unless local wineries have their own vineyards. Duty on wine
imports in the country currently stands at 45 percent and it would
be cut to 30 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Canberra To Strengthen Defense Links With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian is planning to give
"part-time" use of its military bases to US military and allow the
"pre-positioning" of US military hardware on Australian soil,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move to strengthen military ties with the US clearly means
that the new government aims not only at enhancing substantially
the overall relationship but also at upgrading the defense links
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review said that Australian Defense
Minister Ian McLachlan will discuss the plan for the US military
to use Australian bases on a part-time basis when he meets with US
Defense Secretary William Perry next month.
</P>
<P>
The US military is likely to be given access to Australian
bases for training purposes as well, and the use of firing ranges
is also being considered.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that McLachlan is also planning to propose to
the US that it should follow Australia's example and conduct joint
military exercises with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
But any move, it is believed, to encourage stronger defense
links between Washington and Jakarta could still run into problems
with the Congress, which often makes unwarranted charges about
Indonesia's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that McLachlan would discuss the issue with
Australia's neighbors of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations before a final commitment was given to Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China is to auction famous musical
works for the first time, the latest issue of "Musical Life" has
reported.
</P>
<P>
The copyrights of songs and lyrics written by Chinese composers
after 1949, when the People's Republic was founded, will be
auctioned in September in Xi'an, an ancient city in northwest
China.
</P>
<P>
"The move is to market the musical works and protect composers'
economic interests," said Zhao Ning, an organizer at the Xi'an
International Intellectual Property Rights Exchange Center.
</P>
<P>
Usually a singing star can make tens of thousands yuan for
performing a popular song, but a composer receives only a small
remuneration for writing the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
The organizer said he welcomes bidders from any country and any
region to take part in the event.
</P>
<P>
The money obtained at the auction will be given to the
composers and some will be donated to the preparatory China Music
Development Foundation, the paper said.

ROME, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A specialized United Nations agency
today issued a warning about environmental damages caused by huge
stockpiles of unused pesticides.
</P>
<P>
The stockpiles, of about 100,000 tons, are contaminating soil
and groundwater throughout Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe, the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.
</P>
<P>
Much of the pesticides, including DDT and HCH, or
hexachlorocyclohexane, came to the developing countries from
foreign donors, and most of them are out-dated.
</P>
<P>
The FAO, based in this Italian capital city, said the chemicals
are left to accumulate and pose environmental hazards because
proper disposal facilities are in short supply.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Asks OPEC for More Oil Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will ask OPEC to raise
its oil production quotas at the upcoming regular meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna,
officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
As an organization of oil exporting countries, OPEC should not
count "a country's internal oil consumption as part of its
exports," said Venezuelan Mining and Energy Minister Erwin Arrieta.
</P>
<P>
Arrieta complained that the current distribution of the
OPEC-set quotas was discriminatory and lacked equality.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela was given a quota of 2.359 million barrels per day
but its production potential will rise to 3.4 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
During the OPEC meeting, which was put off until Thursday,
Arrieta will raise the possibility of concluding trade agreements
among OPEC members, similar to the accord that Venezuela had
reached with the former Soviet Union to supply crude oil to Cuba
and Spain.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's top officials listened to Venezuela's suggestions about
the oil quotas early last month, and promised to set up a
committee that will give Venezuela their answers at the Vienna
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of Iraq's return to oil exports is exerting big
pressures on the oil market, which will further be affected by the
efforts of several OPEC members to demand bigger quotas.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of oil production quotas and sales ceilings
for OPEC member countries dated back to 1986 when world oil prices
dropped below 10 U.S. dollars per barrel.

SHIJIAZHUANG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China has required all towns
and villages along the national highways to post name signs within
the next three years.

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest Production Line of Solar water heaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The world's biggest production line
of solar vacuum tubes water heaters went into operation today at a
new manufacturing plant of Beijing Sunda Solar Energy Technology
Co., Ltd, in Sanhe City, Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhaoguang, vice-mayor of Beijing City; Indymion Wilkinson,
head of the European Union's European Commission; Myint Maung,
country director of the UNIDO's (the United Nations' Industrial
Development Organization) China office; and Heinzmann, member of
Daimler-Benz Aerospace Board of Directors; were present at the
production line's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Sunda company was established in 1995 as a joint venture of
Daimler-Benz Aerospace and Beijing Solar Energy Research
Institute(BSERI), which is engaged in development of solar
products. Its new production line has an annual capacity of
500,000 water heaters, most of which will be exported.
</P>
<P>
Myint Maung said that UNIDO had a long history of cooperation
with both BSERI and the German company, and has played a useful
role in the transfer and development of technology.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that China has a great market potential
for solar equipment, because more than two thirds of the country's
territory is rich with solar energy.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta to Provide AIDS Counseling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will set
up a special agency to provide counseling to people suffering from
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or those carrying the
human immuno virus (HIV), Antara news agency today quoted a senior
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Social Affairs Minister Inten Suweno said that it is badly
needed for establishing such an agency to prevent the spread of
AIDS and help people who had contracted the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
The ministry had launched information campaigns to
AIDS-high-risk people in some places, she told a workshop on the
evaluation of the national anti-AIDS campaign program.
</P>
<P>
"For the purpose, we have identified 393 locations and targeted
as many as 39,000 people," she said.
</P>
<P>
She singled out prostitutes, drug users, homosexuals and prison
inmates as those deserving the special attention of health
officials involved in the anti-AIDS campaigns.
</P>
<P>
According to the official data up to last March, there were 295
HIV and 95 full-blown AIDS cases in Indonesia. The actual numbers,
however, are believed to be far higher.
</P>
<P>
Suyono Yahya, one of the speakers at the forum, said that the
actual number of AIDS cases in the country may be between 40,000
and 50,000.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations Development Program (UNDP) report said
Indonesia might have to spend 16 billion US dollars on medical
treatment of AIDS sufferers if the disease could not be
effectively prevented from spreading.

<HEADLINE> Tamil People In Northern Sri Lanka Thank Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 6 (Xinhua)-- The people in the Jaffna Peninsula
at the northernmost extremity of Sri Lanka, who belong mostly to
the Tamil community, have organized a series of public meetings to
thank the government and its armed forces for having redeemed them
from the 10-year rule of the Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said that under the rule of the
Tamil rebels, the people had been denied their basic human rights
and freedom and the death penalty awaited anyone who defied or
criticized the rebels.
</P>
<P>
There was dire scarcity of food items and other essentials and
whatever was sent for the people by the government and
non-governmental organizations were grabbed by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, about 80 percent of the people
who were displaced from the peninsula had returned home to be
under government civil administration since the end of May.
</P>
<P>
They said that as many as 407,000 people had been re-settled
under the government's rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have
been waging a 13-year war for a separate state during which 50,000
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have staged three major offensives in the
Jaffna Peninsula since last October and brought it under
government control.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Partner Supports Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the National
Democratic Party (RPP), Nepal's second ruling partner in the
present three-party coalition, have said they would continue to
support the coalition government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the
Nepal Congress (NC) Party.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement made public Wednesday, the RPP central
leaders said that trying to topple the present government would
not be in favor of the national interest and the people.
</P>
<P>
There are speculations here these days that the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (UML) is to launch a challenge against
the government in the forthcoming parliament session by persuading
a faction of the RPP to withdraw from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
UML leaders recently have vowed that they would topple the
NC-led government at any cost during the parliament session to be
held within a month.
</P>
<P>
The statement of RPP leaders, signed by those mostly holding
cabinet seats in the present government, urged the opposition to
shun the "wrong attitude" that the government should be unseated
by whatever means possible.
</P>
<P>
The RPP leaders said it is "nothing more than an empty dream to
say that a stable government would be formed out of another
political equation if the present one is unseated."
</P>
<P>
All the coalition partners should keep this reality in mind,
they said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The present government in Nepal was formed last September by
NC, RPP and the Nepal Goodwill Party after they jointly overthrew
the minority UML government through a no-confidence vote in the
parliament.

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Take Full Place in NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
today that his country would be ready to take its full place in a
reformed North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly cabinet meeting, Chirac said that a recent
agreement on NATO's reform was "a major success for France, for
the Europeans and for the alliance as a whole."
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached Monday at NATO's two-day meeting in
Berlin, will allow the setting up of a European military component
under the control of the 10-member Western European Union (WEU).
</P>
<P>
The new structure will give more independence to Europe to deal
with regional crisis without involving U.S. ground forces, partly
by borrowing U.S. military hardware.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the Berlin agreement marked "a decisive stage on
the road of the new trans-Atlantic partnership."
</P>
<P>
It would enable "the Europeans to exercise their full
responsibilities in the framework of an Atlantic alliance that has
been renewed in depth," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The agreement should be carried out in months, Chirac said,
adding that France would then resume a full membership at the NATO
that once was dominated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
France has been bargaining its return to NATO's integrated
military command structure since it pulled out of the alliance in
1966 to keep France's defense independence.
</P>
<P>
The French government has long stood for NATO's reform toward a
more European military wing.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Exempts Luxury Tax on Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
announced y that it will grant tax exemptions on several types of
cars in order to boost the use of locally-made components.
</P>
<P>
Official sources today quoted Trade and Industry Minister Tunky
Ariwibowo as saying that the government will exempt the luxury tax
on 1,600cc and smaller cars and station wagons, as well as jeeps,
minibuses, vans and pick-up trucks produced in Indonesia, if more
than 60 percent of their components are locally made.
</P>
<P>
The luxury goods tax on other Indonesian-brand cars produced
with at least 20 percent of local components at the end of the
first year of production would also be exempted, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The exemption depends on a minimum local content of more than
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
In February, the government granted a three-year tax exemption
to the Indonesian Timor car on condition that its local components
total 20 percent by the end of the first year of production, 40
percent by the end of the second year and 60 percent by the end of
the third year.
</P>
<P>
Timor is produced by PT Timor Putra Nasional, owned by
President Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo Mandala.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the United States and the European Union had pointed out
that the measure ran counter to the principles of non-protection
Indonesia is obligated to uphold under the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Foreign manufacturers had also reacted angrily to the initial
plan, saying its support for a national champion was unfair and
would harm their effort to expand in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
But, Indonesia defended its car policy, saying there will be no
change in its position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ariwibowo said that the first batch of 45,000 Timors would be
manufactured and assembled in South Korea before the plant comes
on stream.
</P>
<P>
A "sufficient" number of Indonesian workers would be sent to
South Korea for an "adequate amount of time" to produce the car
and to "ensure an effective transfer of know-how," the minister
added.

<HEADLINE> EU Unveils Plan to Cut Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A wide-ranging plan to help put
the European Union's (EU) 18 million unemployed back to work was
launched today by the European Commission amid growing Europe-wide
concern over jobs.
</P>
<P>
Removing internal trade barriers, redesigning aid policies,
re-allocating EU funds to job-creating programs and replacing
"generous" welfare schemes with retraining programs were some of
the key parts of the long-awaited plan unveiled by European
Commission President Jacques Santer today to the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Eleven percent of the EU's 165 million strong workforce are now
unemployed, with 40 percent of the 18.3 million jobless workers
being long-term unemployed and 22 percent of Europeans under 25
unable to find a job.
</P>
<P>
Santer urged the 15 EU nations to redesign industrial and
regional aid policies to make them more oriented toward job
creation.
</P>
<P>
Santer also called on EU members to make efforts to remove
barriers to inter-European trade, which would enable small
businesses to thrive and create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The EU leader went on to urge a reallocation of 5.5 billion
European currency units (6.9 billion U.S. dollars) in surplus EU
funds to employment-generating projects over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Some three-quarters of 170 billion Ecus (212 billion dollars)
in funds earmarked for 1996-1999 will be committed to specific
projects and could be channeled into employment-intensive schemes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the unemployed to get back to work, Santer urged
governments to replace generous welfare schemes with retraining
programs and other more "active' methods.
</P>
<P>
He rejected charges that a sound jobs policy is incompatible
with the vigorous deficit-trimming policy EU governments must
carry out to qualify for the single European currency before it is
launched in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
A stronger currency will mean a stronger economy and more jobs,
Santer said.
</P>
<P>
"The single currency is the best friend of future generations",
he said, "We must stay on course."
</P>
<P>
The job-creating strategy, laid out at a time when consumers
and businesses are gloomy over employment prospects, will be
reviewed at the EU summit on June 21-21 in Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Overall economic confidence, hurt by worries over the jobs
situation and a slower production growth, slipped to 98.5 in May
from 98.8 in the previous month, the Commission's monthly
barometer said today.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Squabbles Over Iraqi Oil Sales, Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- OPEC oil ministers battled late
Wednesday over how to accommodate Iraq's return to the world oil
market and whether to realign its production quotas many viewed as
"obsolete."
</P>
<P>
Intensive ministerial consultations on a variety of proposals
have put off until Thursday the opening of the 100th session of
the 36-year-old Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), a half-yearly regular event.
</P>
<P>
The impact of Iraq's resumed oil export under a U.N. deal
ending its 1990 Gulf War embargo is sure to top its agenda.
</P>
<P>
Under the May 20 accord, Iraq will gain 2 billion U.S. dollars
by exporting an average of 0.7-0.8 million barrels a day (MBD) for
six months to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
This figure, coupled with the long-existing overproduction by
some OPEC members which have lifted their real output some 1.5 MBD
above the 24.52 MBD ceiling, is feared to deal a heavy blow to the
already vulnerable oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices dropped on Wednesday with London benchmark Brent
Blend crude futures ending down by 69 cents at 17.87 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
To cushion the revived Iraqi oil sales and meet actual market
demand, some delegates said OPEC, now pumping a total of 26 MBD,
should move up its somewhat obsolete three-year-old ceiling, to
about 25.5 MBD and reallocate quota distributions.
</P>
<P>
However, as the idea is opposed mainly on suggestions that a
upward-revised ceiling threatens to dampen the oil market, fierce
infightings seem unavoidable in the OPEC talks, which began in
Vienna on Wednesday and expected to continue well into Friday.

<P>
ROME, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Linford Christie of
Britain was beaten by American Dennis Mitchell in the men's 100
meters race here on Wednesday at the Golden Gala Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, Olympic third-placer, clocked 10.05 seconds against
Christie's 10.10 for the top honour.
</P>
<P>
Both runners failed to improve their personal best of the
season. Mitchell ran a wind-assisted 9.93 in Atlanta last month,
while Christie had his season's best of 10.04.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was Morocco's Salah Hissou who took the limelight by
pacing up the second fastest time in the history of the men's
5,000 meter race.
</P>
<P>
His winning time of 12 minutes 50.80 seconds was just next to
the record of 12:44.39 set by Ethiopia's Haile Gebresilasie.
</P>

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Devise Joint Defense Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany, both Europe's
powerhouses, today agreed to work out a joint strategic policy on
defense by this Autumn, in a bid to iron out their differences
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Helmut Kohl made the
decision at the 67th Franco-German summit held today in Dijon,
eastern France.
</P>
<P>
The joint framework for defense will set out their common
strategic interests as a basis for future cooperation, said a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Both Chirac and Kohl agreed that the two countries should
review their armament cooperation and military integration,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
They did not give details of the common strategic policy to
reporters. Kohl said that it needs "discussions."
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the two leaders will sign a final
document on military strategy, armed forces and armament policy at
their next summit scheduled in December.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told reporters that they had no "misunderstandings" that
were caused by the radical reforms on French defense policy he
declared in February, shifting to an all-professional army,
scrapping conscription and cutting the military budget.
</P>
<P>
France has announced it will give up developing a type of
military air-freighter worth 4.5 to 7 billion francs (about 0.9 to
1.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Germany, who had feared that Paris' defense reforms will do
harm to some jointly developed weapon systems, has agreed with
Chirac's move in the development of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, French Defense Minister Charles Millon and
his German counterpart Volker Ruehe signed an agreement,
instructing a Franco-German working group to examine the 27
existing joint armament programs.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has reiterated that Germany will press ahead with a
military intelligence satellite system to be jointly built with
France.
</P>
<P>
On the nuclear issue, Kohl said Germany has no intention to get
nuclear weapons through France.

WUHAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey among China's
university students shows that "The Selected Works of Deng
Xiaoping" is on their top-ten list of favorite books.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted jointly by the Hubei Provincial Higher
Learning Institutes Working Committee and the Hubei Provincial
College Students Work Society, questioned 1,000 students from nine
colleges and universities in Wuhan, the capital city of central
China's Hubei province.
</P>
<P>
Results show that "The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," which
is considered to be a theoretical summary of his experience in
leading China's reform and opening drive, was chosen as one of the
books that makes a strong impact on university students.
</P>
<P>
Literary works and biographies about proletarian
revolutionaries from previous generations are still popular on the
campuses, including a biography on Mao Zedong entitled "Red Crag,"
a Chinese novel dealing with the struggles of communist prisoners
in the concentration camps in the 1940s, and "How Steel Was
Tempered," a Russian novel by Nikolai Ostrovski.
</P>
<P>
One student from Wuhan University said: "It is hard to
understand China's current situation without studying the thoughts
of the great men in Chinese history, especially those during the
revolution period."
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that books on life, society and
psychology are preferred by more than 60 percent of the students
polled, and literary works have a large readership, topping 84.1
percent.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa, in his capacity as chairman of the Board of
Investment (BOI), Wednesday set up a committee aimed at promoting
Thai investment overseas.
</P>
<P>
The new committee will first promote Thailand's ability to
reach Indochina and Myanmar, and then turn to other ASEAN members,
China and South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ways to boost Thai investment abroad include tax measures,
market and investment information, and financial services, such as
soft loans and project guarantees.
</P>
<P>
The committee will establish project scales and categories
under which promotional privileges can be granted, and also act as
an intermediary with other state and private agencies.
</P>
<P>
BOI Secretary General Staporn Kavitanon was quoted today by
local newspaper Bangkok Post as saying that government support for
Thai investors looking overseas is necessary under increasing
global competition.
</P>
<P>
Over the past nine years, Thai investors have poured more than
19.068 billion baht (762 million US dollars) into projects in
eight neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the ASEAN headed the list worth 11.323 billion
baht (452 million US dollars), while investments in China were

Students surveyed gave priority to the works of some
world-famous literary giants, such as Lu Xun, an eminent Chinese
revolutionary writer whose essays and novels are collected in "The
Complete Works of Lu Xun."
</P>
<P>
Students also said they like contemporary authors who render a
realistic view of life in their novels. Among them is Lu Yao, an
outstanding writer who died in his 40s in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Reading is the number-one spare time activity listed by the
students, followed by sports and watching movies and TV programs.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that nearly 80 percent of students go to the
library at least once a week, and library books remain the main
reading source for students.
</P>
<P>
Renting books from nearby bookstores has become a new campus
trend, due to the shortage of new books and magazines in college
libraries.
</P>
<P>
Some educational workers pointed out that private bookstore
owners should be advised as to which books to buy for students to
read outside classes.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, today's college students universally
pay great attention to economic issues, especially the stock
market, and to information about employment opportunities. Experts
suggested that the college students also should study some
economic theory.
</P>
<P>
Education experts believe that college students should be given
more guidance in regard to their reading selections, while the
press and publishers should further the control of book markets
and provide more outstanding works for students in the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Denies Wider Baht Fluctuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Bangkok has denied that
it might expand the bandwidth of the baht fluctuation against the
US dollar by up to nine satang (0.36 cents) per day.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Deputy Governor Rerngchai Maraganond said Wednesday
that he had been misinterpreted by some newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai explained that he earlier only said that a wider baht
fluctuation band will "not affect the present nine-satang range
between the baht and dollar buying and selling rates among
commercial banks and their clients."
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Thai central bank's exchange equalization fund
fixes the baht on a daily basis by announcing a mid rate, allowing
currency trading between the fund and other banks to float against
the dollar within a range of plus or minus two satang (0.08
cents).
</P>
<P>
The value of the baht is pegged to the dollar around 80 percent
at present, with a narrow fluctuation band. Analysts say that this
would help avoid risks in the money market and support exports.

GUANGZHOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of southern
China's Guangdong province will take powerful measures to strictly
restrict the raising of pet dogs.
</P>
<P>
A new set of regulations, which go into effect September 1,
stipulate that dog breeders must pay more than 10,000 yuan for
each animal's registration, and they are asked to turn over 6,000
yuan annually for a medical examination fee.
</P>
<P>
Pet dogs will be restricted on all urban streets, in the city's
economic and technological development zones, bonded zones, scenic
spots and tourism resorts, according to the new regulations
approved by the Standing Committee of the Eighth Guangdong
Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Households in these areas will have to apply for licenses to
raise pet dogs, and each household is allowed only one pet dog
under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou city authorities said that stricter measures and
higher fees for raising pet dogs are aimed at reducing the number
of dogs, which in turn should help protect human health and safety.
</P>

ALMA ATA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Population experts in Kazakhstan
called on the government to work out policies to halt the decline
in the country's population caused by emigration, falling
birthrate and rising death rate.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending a meeting of a presidential committee on
family, women and population suggested hearings should be held
every year on the situation.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, Kazakhstan has seen a fall in its
birthrate and an increase in its death rate. In 1995, the
birthrate fell 0.17 percentage points to 16.6 in every thousand,
the lowest level for more than 10 years. The mortality rate rose
0.05 percentage points over 1994.
</P>
<P>
These two factors, together with a rise in the number of people
leaving the country, led to a fall in the population of 270,000

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official on MFN Trade Status of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking U.S. trade official
said here today that the renewal of the Most Favored Nation (MFN)
trade status is in the interest of both the United States and
China.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the Foreign Press Center in
New York, Stuart Eizenstat, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for
international trade, said that despite strong opposition in
Congress, "a renewal of China's MFN trade status is in the
interest of the United States and China. It is not a gift to
China."
</P>
<P>
He repeated Washington's position that the MFN status was
renewed to China just like being given to other countries.
</P>
<P>
It is a foundation of healthy economic relations between the
two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important not to see the dispute (between the U.S. and
China) as a trade war," he said, adding that "it is a significant
trade dispute."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he urged China to take action to comply with
the intellectual property agreement reached in early 1995 between
Beijing and Washington. Otherwise, he said, the United States
would not hesitate to take firm actions to protect its commercial
interests.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat, who heads the Commerce Department's International
Trade Administration, is in charge of promoting U.S. exports on
the world market.
</P>
<P>
The official also explained how his government would help small
and medium-sized businesses get a market niche in the keen
international competition by providing them with expertise and
export financing.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of the emerging markets in the
developing nations, in Asia and latin America in particular. By
the year 2000, he noted, the U.S. exports to these countries would
exceed its exports to Japan and Europe combined.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales in China Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Private cars have become a driving
force in China's automobile sales market that will see a seven
percent increase, to 1.6 billion this year, experts at the
country's Information Center forecast.
</P>
<P>
China's automobile sales have witnessed a slow growth rate over
the past few years. But sales have started to boom with more
Chinese people buying cars for private use.
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 cars will be sold to private owners this year,
which account for 40 percent of the total demand in China's
market. And those people will buy half of the 820,000 trucks to be
sold this year.
</P>
<P>
Passenger car sales will top 360,000 this year, with more sedan
cars sold.
</P>
<P>
Imports of sedan cars will surpass last year's number. However
the market share of imported sedan cars will continue declining to
less than 30 percent this year after home manufacturers of sedans
put more cars onto the market.

<HEADLINE> More Poles Expected to Live in Private Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 5 (Xinhua) -- More Poles are expected to live in
private houses as housing developers are increasing the
construction of spacious and quality houses to sell and let to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Construction of private houses has been on the rise thanks to
the fact that housing loans have been tipped toward developers of
private houses, according to the Polish State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the bureau said that more new houses have been
sold to private owners, which increased the nationwide proportion
of private houses from 36.6 percent in 1989 to 51 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
Private houses are also becoming more spacious, up from an
average 77 square meters for each household in 1989 to last year's
average of 91.8 square meters.
</P>
<P>
But the State Statistics Bureau warned that Polish people may
have to wait a little longer to get their own houses that the
construction of private houses takes longer time to complete. The
reason for the prolongation was not explained.

<HEADLINE> Government Chooses Site for Third Paris Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paris, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The French government announced today
that Paris' third airport will be built at a site about 80
kilometers southwest of this capital.
</P>
<P>
The planned new airport, at Beauvilliers near the city of
Chartres, will supplement the existing facilities of
Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Orly.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Transport Minister Bernard Pons,
construction of the new facility is not expected to be completed
until the year 2015 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Among other candidates, the chosen site would presumably cause
the least environmental and other problems.
</P>
<P>
About 50 million air passengers currently use the existing two
airports annually, making Paris the second largest hub in Europe
and the seventh in the world.
</P>
<P>
A Transport Ministry report issued in July said that the demand
would be between 76 and 96 million passengers by the year 2015,
and 90 to 124 million by 2030.
</P>
<P>
It warned that if without a new airport, Paris could lose the
additional passengers to other cities in Western Europe.

Zhengzhou, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Ruins of a military project built
during the Song Dynasty (960-1279) have been discovered in
Dengzhou city in central China's Henan province.
</P>
<P>
Located in the mountainous area of Xingshan, the site consists

walls wind up and down along the Funiushan Mountain chain for more
than 30 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The circumference of the largest village is more than 5,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
Inside these mountain villages are stone rooms where warriors
once lived, water storage wells, and martial arts training rooms.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
donated six helicopters to Colombia to enhance the latter's
anti-drug operations across the country.
</P>
<P>
Handing over the aircraft, which cost a total of 4.4 million
U.S. dollars, Myles Frechette, the U.S. ambassador to Colombia,
said that this donation is one more proof that the cooperation
between the United States and Colombia in the war against drugs is
still in force.
</P>
<P>
On the decision of the Organization of American States (OAS) to
reject the Helms-Burton Act, Frechette said that the policy of
Bill Clinton's government is to do its utmost to transform the OAS
which will reflect the aspirations and the needs of the nations in
the region.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 23 OAS members voted in Panama to adopt a
resolution asking the Inter-American legal committee to rule
whether the Helms-Burton Act violates the international law.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China's largest and most modern
hydropower dam is nearing 120 meters, three quarters of its
designed height.
</P>
<P>
The dam, part of the Lijiaxia Power Station, should be
completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The power station, with an installed capacity of two million
kilowatt, is located in Qinghai at the upper reaches of the Yellow
River, China's second longest waterway.
</P>
<P>
Invested jointly by the central government and four provinces
of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai, the dam is designed to
stand 165 meters high, China's third hyperbolic arch dam.
</P>
<P>
As advanced construction methods have been employed in the
construction of the dam, a number of major projects such as flood
diversion culverts and cofferdams have been successively completed
and the first power generating unit has been installed since the
construction started in 1987.
</P>
<P>
To retain water in November and generate electricity at the end
of this year, China decided to spend two billion yuan in 1996 for
the construction of the hydropower project. Resettlement of local
residents is being implemented and is expected to be completed
later this month.

<HEADLINE> Research on "Black Mound" on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Makes Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Research into the causes and
prevention of "black mound" on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which
formed as a result of the depletion of vegetation coverage, has
made marked progress, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The plateau, one of China's five major herding areas, accounts
for 37 percent of the country's grassland. The degradation of
grassland has caused rapid spread of naked black mounds, posing a
severe threat to local economic development and the ecological
balance.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than seven million ha of "black mounds" on
the plateau.
</P>
<P>
A research team consisting of scientists from the Qinghai
Provincial Science and Technology Commission, the Qinghai Academy
of Animal Husbandry and the Chinese Academy of Sciences presented
a clear picture of the situation of "black mounds" after a field
investigation in 36 counties went into operation last June.
</P>
<P>
The scientists attributed excessive grazing and hungry rodents
to be the main causes of black mounds, and have created a program
for the treatment of the degradation of the grassland.
</P>
<P>
It is the first large-scale investigation and research done in
the field in China, and scientists have asked for a closer watch
on the problem.

<HEADLINE> Hostile Attitude To EU is Damaging UK Business - CBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 5 (Xinhua) - The hostile attitude to UK membership
of the European Union displayed by many politicians and
commentators is deeply damaging to UK business and economic
interests, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) claimed
today.
</P>
<P>
Niall Fitzgerald, Chairman of the CBI' Europe Committee,
said:"The ongoing debate on the UK's role in Europe has become
obscured in a fog of rhetoric that threatens to obscure our view
of Europe. This risks further reducing the UK's credibility as a
negotiating partner in the EU and its ability to shape the future
of Europe."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference here of the CBI's "Business in Europe"
campaign week, Fitzgerald ridiculed claims that Britain would be
better off outside the EU.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not kid ourselves. Careless talk of Britain leaving the
EU will cost jobs. The reason why Britain has been such a magnet
for inward investment is not simply because of language and
improved labour relations, but because it is a competitive entry
point for the European Single Market."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Britain's role in the EU, Fitzgerald said: "For
British business, that would be the worst of all possible worlds -
a case of regulation without representation. Loose and ill-defined
talk of british interests conveniently ignores the fact that our
interests are best served by ensuring of Europe and how it works."
</P>
<P>
the chairman said, "I am not saying the EU is perfect. Far from
it. We would like to see its markets opened up further, tougher
action on state aids, the transport, energy and telecommunication
markets liberalized.
</P>
<P>
"But is Britain more likely to achieve these goals by arguing
from a position of trust at the heart of Europe or by carping from
the sidelines?"
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said the aims of the CBI's campaign were to put
business priorities firmly at the top of the European agenda and
to ensure that the Europe debate in the UK and the rest of the
Union is based on an objective understanding of economic
realities.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the restoration of Europe's competitiveness as
the overriding priority, and stressed that the successful
completion of the Single Market was the best way to achieve that
aim.
