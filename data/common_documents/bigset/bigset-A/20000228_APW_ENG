Ex FBI Head Questioned Waco Tactics
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- A former top FBI official wrote in March 1993 that he was
concerned with the tactics used during the Branch Davidian siege by the FBI's
hostage rescue team commander, who also had a key role in the deadly 1992
standoff at Ruby Ridge, Idaho. The Dallas Morning News obtained documents that
show senior FBI officials at first were very skeptical of their on-scene
commander's insistence that tear gas was the only safe way to end the Waco
standoff. The memo, from the bureau's most experienced tactical expert, said
hostage rescue team commander Richard Rogers had prompted similar concerns in
Ruby Ridge standoff.

McCain To Miss This Week's Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican John McCain won't take part in this week's GOP
presidential campaign debate, and aides say they pulled out because rival George
W. Bush was slow to agree to the California event and that sparked scheduling
conflicts. McCain's aides denied the move represented a shift in strategy and
resources away from California toward other important states that vote on March
7, like New York. A senior McCain aide who spoke on condition of anonymity
dismissed suggestions that the Arizona senator was focusing on states other than
California.

Tijuana Police Chief Killed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Assailants shot and killed Tijuana's police chief
today, pumping more than 100 shots into his car as he drove along a busy
highway. Alfredo de la Torre, in charge of the police force in this violent
border town since 1998, was pronounced dead at the scene, said Enrique
Tellaeche, a spokesman for the Baja California state attorney general's office
in Tijuana. Dozens of investigators combed the city and interviewed witnesses,
but no one had been arrested. The city, home to the busiest border crossing on
Earth, is one of the main ports of entry for drugs heading into the United
States.

U.S. Issues Alert About Warfare Suits
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has alerted U.S. facilities around the world
that hundreds of thousands of protective suits meant to shield GIs from gas and
germ attack may have holes and other critical defects, according to military
officials and documents. The Pentagon learned about the flaws five years ago but
did not consider the problems crucial and needed the gear for U.S. peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia, criminal investigators say. On Feb. 9, the Pentagon cautioned
commanders not to use any of the 778,000 suits except in training.

Albright Eyed As Czech President
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Madeleine Albright, America's Czech-born secretary of
state, returns next week to her homeland, where there is talk she might seek the
presidency of the East European nation after her tour in Washington ends. Some
Czechs are speaking of her as a possible successor to President Vaclav Havel,
who must retire in 2002. Havel, a playwright-turned-politician helped lead the
"Velvet Revolution" that in 1989 persuaded communist rulers to resign. He has
openly talked about the possibility of Albright succeeding him.

Contentious Elections Test Senegal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Senegalese voters on Sunday cast ballots in a
presidential election as rebel attacks and political unrest threatened one of
Africa's few enduring democracies. The contest pitting President Abdou Diouf
against seven challengers is the country's most contentious in decades after 40
years of rule by the Socialist Party. Initially results weren't expected until
at least Tuesday. But electoral officials said late Sunday night that a
provisional count could be released Monday.

Juror: Diallo Verdict Was Clear

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A member of the jury that acquitted four white police
officers in the killing of Amadou Diallo said Sunday that the outcome was "not
happy, but clear." Speaking publicly for the first time since Friday's verdict
in the racially charged case, juror Helen Harder said the jury deliberated
without discord before agreeing the law was on the side of the officers.
Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy were
cleared of second-degree murder and other charges in the slaying of Diallo, a
West African immigrant.

Pistons Beat Bulls 93-90

	   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Jerry Stackhouse scored 27 points in the Detroit
Pistons' 93-90 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Sunday night. Christian
Laettner added 17 and Grant Hill 14 as Detroit won for the third time in four
games. Elton Brand had 28 points and 12 rebounds in Chicago's fourth straight
loss. With the Pistons leading 92-89, Lindsey Hunter missed a driving layup and
Randy Brown grabbed the rebound to give Chicago a chance to tie with 14.4
seconds to go. Brand missed a shot, but grabbed his own rebound and was fouled
with five seconds left. He missed the first and made the second instead of
intentionally missing, making it 92-90.

<HEADLINE> Curfews Said To Help Deter Crime  </HEADLINE>
   By RON POWERS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rising number of American cities are imposing curfews
to deter youth violence, crime and gang activity, according to a report that
says 110 cities have established them in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, released Monday by the National League of Cities, said that
compares with 122 curfews set up across the nation during a 15-year period
between 1980 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Nighttime youth curfews were reported by a total of 337 of some 490 cities
the league surveyed; 68 had daytime curfews, the report said. Officials in
another 35 cities said they're considering implementing a curfew.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Knight, president of the league and mayor of Wichita, Kan., said curfews
``continue to be a growing trend in the United States as city officials look for
answers to ensure the safety of youth in their communities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in nearly three of four cities surveyed by the league said they
believe a curfew can help curb gang activity, but it does little to influence
the behavior of hard-core gang members. The most positive effects were found in
reducing assaults, burglaries and graffiti.
</P>
<P>
	   The league said that in most U.S. cities, children under 18 are expected to
be off the streets by 11 p.m. during the week and by midnight on weekends.
</P>
<P>
	   In cities with daytime curfews, young people are expected to stay off the
streets during school hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Some teens and their parents have challenged the constitutionality of
curfews, but many cities avoid having their curfews struck down by modeling
their laws after curfew statutes from other cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to a Charlottesville, Va.,
curfew, which is similar to those adopted by many U.S. cities. While the
justices did not issue a decision, they let stand a lower court ruling that said
the city's curfew is a valid means of ``reducing juvenile violence and crime.''

<HEADLINE> Demand for Workers Should Stay High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly one-third of American companies expect to hire more
workers this spring, the strongest demand in more than two decades, according to
a survey being released Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey of second-quarter hiring plans, conducted by the temporary
staffing agency Manpower Inc., indicated especially strong demand for workers in
financial services and in manufacturing durable goods.
</P>
<P>
	   "The personnel shortage continues to plague companies in all industries and
geographic regions," said Jeffrey Joerres, president and chief executive of
Milwaukee-based Manpower. This, he said, presents "opportunities to many more
workers."
</P>
<P>
	   The report, based on a survey of 16,000 businesses nationwide, showed that
32 percent will need additional staff in the second quarter, while 6 percent
plan cutbacks. Some 58 percent expected their work forces to be unchanged, and 4
percent were uncertain.
</P>
<P>
	   Those were the strongest figures since the third quarter of 1978, Manpower
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, 29 percent said they would hire staff, while 6 percent predicted
cuts, 61 percent expected no change and 4 percent were uncertain.
</P>
<P>
	   Expected hiring in durable goods industries, which produce cars, appliances
and other long-lasting products, totaled 38 percent of those surveyed, matching
the previous record achieved in the second quarter of 1998, Manpower said. It
said that 28 percent of finance, insurance and real estate businesses said they
expected to hire more workers in the April-June period.
</P>
<P>
	   Regionally, the strongest demand for workers was in the West, where 35
percent of companies surveyed said they expected to be hiring in the second
quarter, while 6 percent said they would reduce employment. Fifty-four percent
said they expected no change, and 5 percent were uncertain.
</P>
<P>
	   Manpower has conducted quarterly employment surveys for 24 years. The margin
of error in the telephone survey, which includes companies in 485 cities, is
plus or minus 2 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> No. 6 Ohio St. 64, Illinois 51  </HEADLINE>
    By RUSTY MILLER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Twenty minutes of hard work made the final seven days
of the regular season that much more meaningful for No. 6 Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebounding from a nondescript first half, the Buckeyes used a stifling
defense, Michael Redd's 21 points and a 20-3 second-half surge to get by
Illinois 64-51 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   With two games remaining in the regular season, the Buckeyes (20-5, 11-3)
are tied for second in the Big Ten with Michigan State, a half-game behind
Purdue.
</P>
<P>
	   "The thing I like is that it's in our hands now," Ohio State coach Jim
O'Brien said. "If we're good enough to do it on the road, we deserve it. And if
we don't, we have nobody to blame but ourselves. We've just got to win two more
games."
</P>
<P>
	   The Buckeyes play at Penn State on Wednesday and at Minnesota on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our destiny is in our own hands now," said point guard Scoonie Penn, who
scored 14 points.
</P>
<P>
	   A capacity crowd of 19,100 said goodbye to three senior starters -- Penn,
George Reese and Ken Johnson -- who played their final game at Value City Arena.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Redd's father this week said that his son might forego his
final year of eligibility to make himself eligible for the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
	   The fans chanted, "One more year!" as Redd shot free throws in the final
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   If it was Redd's final home game, he made the most of it. He also had 12
rebounds as the Buckeyes dominated the boards in the second half. He also moved
into fifth place -- passing Jimmy Jackson -- on Ohio State's career scoring list
with 1,787 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Brown had 12 points and Reese finished with 11. Johnson blocked six
shots and had six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our defense is very good right now," said Brown, who put the clamps on
Illinois standout Cory Bradford, holding him to 14 points on 5-of-15 shooting
from the field. "If our offense can play well, we're tough to beat. The second
half we played so good on defense."
</P>
<P>
	   Illinois (18-8, 10-5) had won seven in a row and nine of its last 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Cook led the Illini with 17 points. Frank Williams, who beat the
Buckeyes on a 3-pointer at the buzzer in the Big Ten opener, mustered 11 points
on 3-of-15 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Illini, shooting 44 percent for the season, hit just 18-of-59 shots from
the field for 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "They played a great defensive game and they attacked us offensively and
were much more aggressive in the second half," Illinois coach Lon Kruger said.
"Ohio State's defense was outstanding and they got all the loose balls with
their hustle."
</P>
<P>
	   The Buckeyes won the rebounding battle 40-30, outrebounding the Illini 15-4
during their second-half spurt.
</P>
<P>
	   A Cook basket staked Illinois, which had led by as many as eight points in
the first half, to a 38-34 lead with 16:20 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Illini would miss 19 of their final 23 shots from the field and
would score only three points and hit one field goal over the next nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our guys deserve credit for how they guarded a very good team," O'Brien
said. "I think the second half was our best effort this season -- to keep
Illinois to 21 points and 24 percent shooting in the second half is great."
</P>
<P>
	   Rebound follows by Reese and Brown pulled the Buckeyes even before Penn gave
them the lead for good on two foul shots with 13:11 left. Penn later stole the
ball and hit the perimeter jumper at the other end to cap a 12-0 run for a 46-38
lead at the 10:18 mark.
</P>
<P>
	   After Lucas Johnson hit a 3-pointer to break the Illini's six-minute scoring
drought, the Buckeyes ran off the next eight points to build the lead to 54-41
with 7:18 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The lead never dropped below 11 points again.
</P>
<P>
	   "This keeps us in the hunt in the Big Ten," Johnson said. "The race for No.
1 is very close. Now we have to win our games down the stretch to stay in it."

<HEADLINE> Porter Sent Home, Misses Fla. Game  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Auburn officials sent leading scorer Chris Porter
back to campus before Sunday's game against Florida after learning of possible
contact between the player and an agent.
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn coach Cliff Ellis got word of the investigation late Saturday and
sent Porter home. He did not play in No. 11 Auburn's 88-59 loss to No. 9
Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   "My hope is that he'll state whatever the circumstances are, be forthright
and honest about it," Ellis said. "Then, if there's a mistake being made,
hopefully, he'll admit it. He's certainly been good for the college game. I hope
they'll allow him to come back and continue to contribute to a game he made a
choice to come back to."
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn athletic director David Housel said the school learned that Porter
possibly had contact with an agent or an agent's representative.
</P>
<P>
	   "Until the issue is resolved, we will withhold Chris from competition,"
Housel said. "We will resolve this matter as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
	   From the looks of Sunday's game, the Tigers need Porter back.
</P>
<P>
	   Without Porter, and with injuries that hampered the effectiveness of Mamadou
N'diaye and Daymeon Fishback, Auburn matched its worst loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Porter came out of junior college last year and sparked a turnaround at
Auburn, averaging 16 points and eight rebounds a game to lift the Tigers to
their first NCAA tournament in 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   He was considered a possible first-round pick after last season, but a loss
in the round of 16 of the tournament compelled him to stay for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
	   That, more than anything, is what confuses Ellis as he contemplates trying
to make a tournament run without the preseason All-America.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a young man who turned away the NBA last year and a young man who has
worked so hard and is on target to get his degree this summer," Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
	   The coach awoke the players early Sunday morning to inform them that their
teammate wouldn't be with them.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we can do is pray his situation will get worked out and he'll come
back," guard Doc Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Porter's alleged problem is nothing new to college basketball. Recently,
players at UCLA, St. John's and Cincinnati and Michigan have been investigated
for possible improper dealings with agents or other sources.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a new situation in this sport," Ellis said. "A lot of it has to
do with kids coming out of high school, coming out of college early. You just
have to hope they don't have a weak moment. There are leeches out there and you
can't let them come out there and suck on you."
</P>
<P>
	   Porter is averaging 14.6 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. He has played
well lately, averaging 16 points and seven rebounds since Southeastern
Conference play began.
</P>
<P>
	   His loss will be felt on the court. It also served a warning off of it.
</P>
<P>
	   "The thing I learned is that you have to make sure you associate with the
right people," Robinson said. "If you do that, you'll be all right."

    TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Monday morning, pushed
down by slumping U.S. stock prices. Tokyo shares moved slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. dollar bought 109.68 yen in late morning, down 1.16 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 110.47 yen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which was down some 45 points
early in the session, gained 38.54 points, or 0.19 percent, to 19,856.42 at the
end of the morning session. On Friday, the average closed up 246.44 points, or
1.26 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar came under selling pressure after the Dow
Jones industrial average fell 230.51 points, or 2.3 percent, to 9,862.12 at
Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first close below 10,000 since April 6, 1999, and the lowest
close since April 1, 1999, when it finished at 9,832.51.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.14 yen, down from 109.51 yen
late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started lower Monday following sharp falls in
U.S. blue-chip stocks Friday, but later moved into positive territory led by a
rise in Japanese blue chip issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co., said Japanese
investors have already factored U.S. worries about rising interest rates into
stock prices, and said the Tokyo market would not necessarily continue to move
in tandem with New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong demand would continue to support share prices in Tokyo, Hatae said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors would not buy shares in Arabian Oil, whose stock price stood at
750 yen (dlrs 6.88) at late morning, compared to 850 yen (dlrs 7.80) at Friday's
close.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its drilling rights with Saudi Arabia expired early Monday
after renewal negotiations broke down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's trade minister Takashi Fukaya said in a news conference Monday
morning that oil supplies to Japan from Saudi Arabia will continue unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first

<HEADLINE> Canucks 2, Coyotes 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Todd Bertuzzi scored for the third time
in three games and Felix Potvin stopped 27 shots as the Vancouver Canucks beat
Phoenix 2-1 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bertuzzi opened the scoring with a beautiful solo effort just 1:36 into the
second period. Bertuzzi cut hard around Coyotes defenseman Jyrki Lumme on the
right side, then moved quickly back into the middle and through the crease
before tucking the puck behind goaltender Sean Burke.
</P>
<P>
	   Darby Hendrickson made it 2-0 on a wraparound with 53 seconds left in the
period. Hendrickson also assisted on Bertuzzi's goal and now has three goals and
three assists in his last five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Potvin was two minutes away from his second shutout of the year and first
with Vancouver before Deron Quint scored into a wide-open net on a rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix finished a four-game, all-Canadian road trip 0-3-1 and dropped to
32-23-7-1 overall. The Coyotes are now just 1-12-3 this year when Jeremy Roenick
fails to record a point. Phoenix is 28-8-3 when Roenick gets on the scoresheet.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canucks improved to 6-3-1 since the All-Star break. They are eight
points behind Colorado and San Jose for the final Western Conference playoff
spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Potvin wasn't tested often in the first period, but faced 11 shots in the
second and made several big saves in the third. He made his best save of the
night less than one minute into the third period when he stopped 20-goal scorer
Shane Doan on a partial breakaway.
</P>
<P>
	   Potvin also got a little help from the goal post when Louie DeBrusk got a
wrist shot behind him with 5:27 left. He has posted a 4-2-1 record since
returning from a knee injury after the All-Star break.

McCain To Miss This Week's Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican John McCain won't take part in this week's GOP
presidential campaign debate, and aides say they pulled out because rival George
W. Bush was slow to agree to the California event and that sparked scheduling
conflicts. McCain's aides denied the move represented a shift in strategy and
resources away from California toward other important states that vote on March
7, like New York. A senior McCain aide who spoke on condition of anonymity
dismissed suggestions that the Arizona senator was focusing on states other than
California.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has alerted U.S. facilities around the world
that hundreds of thousands of protective suits meant to shield GIs from gas and
germ attack may have holes and other critical defects, according to military
officials and documents. The Pentagon learned about the flaws five years ago but
did not consider the problems crucial and needed the gear for U.S. peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia, criminal investigators say. On Feb. 9, the Pentagon cautioned
commanders not to use any of the 778,000 suits except in training.

<HEADLINE> Hunt leads cops from South Bronx to South America to success  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The chase went on and on, always moving south.
<P>
	   It began on a stretch of 149th Street in the South Bronx, shifted down the
coast to south Florida, proceeded across the Caribbean into South America.
</P>
<P>
	   The pursuers came from the Bronx Homicide Task Force, veteran police
investigators headquartered off a dingy highway. The prey was Los Colombianos, a
reputedly murderous gang from Bogota by way of sunny Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   In the high-profile home of the Latin Kings and the Gambino family, Los
Colombianos attracted little New York media attention. But authorities knew them
as a sophisticated, cold-blooded gang with an amazing attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
	   They operated with impudence for four years, pulling dozens of robberies
with lightning precision in a half-dozen states, authorities said. The nine
gun-toting South American nationals hit lucrative targets: banks, jewelers,
couriers.
</P>
<P>
	   They had come to the United States from Colombia and Ecuador, but were now
based in Miami. The gang's reputed leader was 25-year-old Alex Restrepo; at his
side were his sisters, Paola and Mabel. Its youngest member was just 17.
</P>
<P>
	   They allegedly robbed a New Jersey jeweler of $500,000 in diamonds. A brazen
midtown Manhattan heist netted $1.2 million in jewelry and left a Hong Kong man
with a bullet in his chest, police said. An investigator trying to arrest one
member in Queens wound up ducking gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   The gang seemed bulletproof, untouchable - until last August, when they
targeted a South Bronx business. One of its employees was a balding, slightly
pudgy ex-cop: retired detective Donald Pagani Sr., who spent 25 years with the
New York Police Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Pagani now worked two days a week at his cousin's meat distribution
business, his way of keeping busy in retirement. He was well-liked by fellow
workers, quick to grab a check at the local coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
	   The 69-year-old grandfather was off to deposit $52,000 in a nearby bank when
he was gunned down in front of a horrified co-worker on East 149th Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The murder case went from there to the homicide cops on the Cross-Bronx
Expressway.
</P>
<P>
	   It was their job to catch killers, but this case was personal: Pagani was
very much one of theirs. The detective had followed his father, Louis, into the
department; Pagani's son, Donald Jr., had followed him.
</P>
<P>
	   Other agencies joined the case, but the Bronx detectives remained
territorial, even when the chase led into strange territory: through a
hurricane, around an erupting volcano, across Florida, Texas, Mexico, South
America.
</P>
<P>
	   "They promised us," recalled Pagani's cousin, Michael DiPasquale, "that they
would get these guys."
</P>
<P>
	   The cat-and-mouse chase pitting the relentless cops and the Colombians went
on for months. The suspects were literally running for their lives; they faced a
possible death penalty if arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   The detectives, far from New York's familiar city streets, were trying to
keep their promise to Donald Pagani's family.
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   It was Feb. 1, 1996 - a New York winter evening, shortly after 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Lap Koon Chow, a Hong Kong salesman attending a Manhattan jewelry show, was
walking outside the New York Hilton with a friend. They had just exited a car;
each carried a bag filled with jewels.
</P>
<P>
	   It was then, according to a federal indictment, that they met Los
Colombianos.
</P>
<P>
	   Four men with knit masks pulled over their faces appeared from the darkness,
snatching the jewels. When the 36-year-old Chow resisted, one of the men simply
shot and wounded him.
</P>
<P>
	   The criminals escaped in a waiting car, firing gunshots into the air like
Dodge City cowboys. It was typical of the gang's style: fast, violent,
successful. The haul was $1.2 million in diamonds.
</P>
<P>
	   The gang, authorities said, netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in
jewelry and cash in 50 robberies between 1996-1999. They carried handguns and
walkie-talkies, wore bulletproof vests. They used various aliases and assorted
fake passports; some reportedly had plastic surgery to alter their looks and
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
	   They were based in Miami, but police said their crimes were often committed
outside Florida - targets were hit in California, Georgia, Massachusetts, Ohio.
By jumping between states and jurisdictions, they managed to avoid authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   "They knew what they were doing," said police Lt. Al Katcher of Union, N.J.,
where the gang pulled off a $500,000 jewelry heist in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Katcher, the gang surprised two men at precisely 4:57 p.m. -
the time the pair typically walked through their business' parking lot with
jewelry-laden briefcases.
</P>
<P>
	   The bandits stuffed guns in the men's faces, escaping in a matter of
minutes. While fleeing, they twice changed cars to avoid detection. Police
recovered the abandoned cars, but not the jewelry.
</P>
<P>
	   Only several weeks later was a link was made between the Union heist and the
other robberies, Katcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities provided few details on most of those heists, including an
Atlanta holdup and a theft of cash and checks at a Queens supermarket. But
investigators were open about the gang's brutal efficiency, their knowledge of
their victims.
</P>
<P>
	   "They do basic investigative work on you," New York Detective Benny Tirado
observed. "They know where you work and who your kids are."
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Pagani's kid, Donald Jr., became a police lieutenant in the Sixth
Precinct. Los Colombianos didn't know that on Aug. 27, 1999, when the
high-rolling gang hit the South Bronx on a Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The elder Pagani was 69; the detective had retired from the NYPD in 1983
after a quarter-century on the job, including a stint as one of the department's
first Internal Affairs officers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1990s, he began working part-time at his cousin's South Bronx
business - something to keep him busy between his annual September hunting trips
with his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Pagani, who also had a daughter, became a father figure of sorts to many of
his younger co-workers at the American Sirloin Meat Co. "He was more like family
than a friend," remembered Abdul Tawab, an Afghani immigrant who became a Pagani
favorite.
</P>
<P>
	   At 11 a.m. that summer morning, with the weekend just hours away, Pagani
volunteered to join another employee headed to make a bank deposit of $52,000 in
cash and checks.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair made plans to grab lunch on the way back.
</P>
<P>
	   Five minutes later, Pagani was dead. A federal indictment described the
scene this way:
</P>
<P>
	   The two men climbed into a car outside the company's East 149th Street
office. A truck was double-parked alongside. They were suddenly under siege by
Restrepo and two gun-toting sidekicks.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Colombianos grabbed the money pouch. Pagani pulled his .32 caliber
handgun and swapped bullets with the assailants, a cacophony of pop-pop-pops
that lasted less than 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Gangster Fernando "Fercho" Colorado was fatally wounded. Restrepo and fellow
Colombian Nelson Baez blasted at Pagani, then opened fire on bystanders in an
effort to kill any potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   When the shooting stopped, the case belonged to the Bronx Homicide Task
Force.
</P>
<P>
	   There were two immediate leads: Colorado's address book with the names of
five co-conspirators, and a license plate number, provided by an eyewitness,
from the getaway van.
</P>
<P>
	   The murder of an ex-cop finally put Los Colombianos in the newspaper. Within
days, the gang members bolted New York. That meant nothing to their new
pursuers, who were determined to close this case.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were very daring," said one of the Bronx investigators. "If we didn't
track them down, it was obvious this wouldn't be their last murder or last job.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was obvious someone else would get hurt."
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   Los Colombianos returned to Florida. "Something bad happened," a police
informant later quoted gang member Pepe Mirand as saying before their abrupt
departure. Mabel Restrepo, 23, wasn't as quick as her siblings, and was arrested
on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bronx detectives, with agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration,
headed south. Within 10 days of the Pagani slaying, they were on the trail in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   As they followed leads, they encountered a dilemma unseen in the typical
Bronx homicide probe: a hurricane. The investigation was stalled as Hurricane
Floyd blew through Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   The fleeing gang split up, kept on the move. Three suspects were headed for
their homeland, Ecuador. The other five were likely headed to their native
Colombia, authorities believed.
</P>
<P>
	   The fugitive suspects zipped across the southern United States to Texas,
then down into Mexico. At one point, a Coast Guard cutter was called in to chase
a ship wrongly believed to hold some of the fugitives.
</P>
<P>
	   In Ecuador, there was another unfamiliar problem: a volcanic eruption that
stranded some detectives.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities were by now using wiretaps and leaks from informants to track
the suspects through South America. Days became weeks became September, October,
November. The weather in the Bronx grew cold, but the trail of the fugitives
heated up.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspects were ultimately tracked to a home in Bogota, Colombia. The
NYPD, confident it had the suspects, reached out for help.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 1, 1999, acting on a request from the Bronx cops, Colombian
officials and the DEA made their move. They arrested Restrepo and his sister,
Paola, along with Mirand and two other suspects. Their hideout held a stash of
gold chains, rings and bracelets, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   During Christmas week, officials at the U.S. Department of Justice in
Washington drafted extradition papers for the five suspects, who were indicted
for racketeering, armed robbery, attempted murder and the slaying of Donald
Pagani Sr.
</P>
<P>
	   Three other suspects remain at large, said Justice Department spokesman John
Russell.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear how long extradition will take. But when the suspects finally
head north again, four of them face the death penalty for Pagani's murder. The
other option: life without parole.
</P>
<P>
	   Pagani's family remains shaken by the slaying; his son went hunting without
his father last September, and Pagani's six grandchildren are still upset that
he no longer visits their Sunday basketball games. For the Bronx detectives,
closing the case was the best they could do for the Pagani family - and the
family appreciates it.
</P>
<P>
	   "They did a tremendous job," said his cousin, DiPasquale. "They got them."

<HEADLINE> Diallo juror describes 'unhappy' decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Clearing four white police officers of murder in the
slaying of an unarmed black man wasn't easy, according to some jurors.
<P>
	   But the law made the jury's decision "very clear - not happy, but clear,"
juror Helen Harder said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking publicly for the first time since Friday's verdict in the racially
charged case, Harder said that the jury deliberated without discord before
announcing its dramatic decision.
</P>
<P>
	   "It turned out the only way it could turn out," Harder, 71, told The
Associated Press in a brief interview in the kitchen of her Albany County home.
</P>
<P>
	   Added Harder: "I'm not saying it's a happy verdict. I know the cops are
happy. None of (the jurors) are very happy. But that's the way it worked out."
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview on Sunday with NBC, juror Tim DeTraglia agreed with Harder's
assessment, even saying "tears were shed" during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy were
cleared of murder and other charges in the slaying of Diallo, a West African
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   The plainclothes officers claimed they fired 41 bullets at the victim on
Feb. 4, 1999, after he refused orders to halt for questioning and pulled out a
black object they thought was a small handgun. Diallo was hit 19 times in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment before the defendants realized the object was a
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Apparently, the officers' testimony was a crucial point for the jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   "He looked at the police officers, they identified themselves, and as they
moved toward him, he turned and backed away," juror Tom Knowles said to NBC.
"Why? Why? We won't know those answers."
</P>
<P>
	   Juror Ed Powell also told NBC the jury believed that the officers thought
that their lives were in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I were to pull something out of my pocket, you couldn't identify that
quickly whether it was a gun or a wallet," Powell said, adding that the officers
had a legal right to defend themselves if they thought Diallo was attacking
them.
</P>
<P>
	   The death of Diallo - and now the not-guilty verdict - has flamed tensions
between police and minorities and touched off protests around New York City.
Because of pre-trial publicity, an appeals court moved the murder case from the
Bronx to Albany, where Harder, who is white, served on a jury that also had four
black women and seven white men.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors have remained mostly silent since the verdict, despite constant
hounding by network television, New York City newspapers and major news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury's black forewoman, who once lived in the Bronx, told the New York
Post that the three-day deliberation had "nothing to do with race." She declined
further comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Harder, who has nine children and 17 grandchildren, described the heartbreak
of seeing Diallo's parents sitting in the front row each day of the month-long
trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The juror didn't mention race. But her husband, attorney George Harder, said
his wife told him that it was not an issue in the jury's deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense case hinged on the emotional testimony of the officers. All
claimed they were convinced that they had to shoot Diallo in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge instructed jurors several times that by law if they concluded that
the officers "reasonably believed" Diallo was armed and dangerous, they must
acquit.
</P>
<P>
	   About the officers, Harder said, "I thought they were quite believable."
</P>
<P>
	   The juror also said she was relieved that the trial is over.

<HEADLINE> In pulpits and streets, appeals for justice and change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Demonstrators marched down Broadway chanting "it's a
wallet not a gun" on the second day of protests over the acquittal of four
police officers in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo.
<P>
	   The reference was to the wallet the officers said they mistook for a gun. In
what was billed as a day of prayer Sunday, political leaders and activists
criticized the not-guilty verdict as inappropriate for a case in which police
fired 41 bullets and hit the African immigrant 19 times, only to learn that he
was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,000 people joined a vigil outside the United Nations, where
civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton said he hoped to bring the Diallo
case to international attention. Afterward, about 450 people - accompanied by a
phalanx of police - marched to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope to express our feelings - I must see justice done," said marcher
Omar Jalloh.
</P>
<P>
	   The march was similar to Saturday's protest, although it was smaller and not
as tense. Police said there was one arrest for disorderly conduct and one
summons issued for using a megaphone without a permit.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said he was "calling for another jury to hear evidence" on the
policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "Come November, the jury is going to render its decision," he said,
referring to Giuliani's probable run for the U.S. Senate. "We're going to
boycott in this city. We are afraid to spend money with certain people because
we are considered suspects. Let's hold our wallets, let's hold our wallets."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Sharpton's spokeswoman, Rachel Noerdlinger, said Sharpton and his
National Action Network are investigating which companies contribute to the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. The PBA helped finance the defense for the
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, Sharpton will release the names of the companies and ask
citizens to boycott them, his spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, acquitted of second-degree murder and lesser charges by a
jury in Albany on Friday, still face a departmental inquiry and possibly federal
charges if Attorney General Janet Reno finds evidence that Diallo's civil rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, filling in for
an ailing Cardinal John O'Connor, told parishioners Diallo's death should cause
people to "re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear and
perhaps toward prejudice - racial prejudice at that."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged
his followers to vote against Giuliani, saying the mayor had failed to thank him
for urging calm in the wake of the Diallo shooting a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a climate
that's divisive," Butts said in a telephone interview. "And I'm not calling for
calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be active."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Teitelbaum, a spokesman for Giuliani's Senate campaign, questioned
Butts' motives, saying he had "hugged Mayor Giuliani" at an interfaith service
at St. Patrick's soon after the shooting and "now he is exploiting Amadou
Diallo's death for partisan political reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue making "fundamental, meaningful change, so that people aren't
afraid that the police are going to shoot them."
</P>
<P>
	   Vallone, a Democrat, said the city council had budgeted funds for that
purpose and "even the mayor is recognizing that changes have to be made."
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Key provisions of the plan would make federal and state funding for local
police contingent on the police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and create a permanent special prosecutor to handle police
brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, he said the NYCLU intends to sue the city
on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking the Democratic
nomination for U.S. Senate, urged New Yorkers not to let the verdict divide
them.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, "we must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter," she told several hundred
people at a national Dominican-American conference at City College.

<HEADLINE> German Christian Democrats Lose Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL GEITNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Voters chastised Germany's Christian Democrats in the first
electoral test since a slush fund scandal exploded around former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and his party.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the losses were not as bad as the battered conservatives feared.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls from late last year -- before the scandal -- showed the Christian
Democrats would easily oust the center-left coalition in the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein, continuing a string of statehouse victories at the expense
of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, support for the Christian Democrats fell in Sunday's voting for the
state legislature to 35 percent, from 37 percent in the last election four years
ago, according to projections. Because the legislators elect the governor, the
results mean Social Democratic Gov. Heide Simonis will hold onto her job for a
third term.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, challenger Volker Ruehe's showing was enough to keep alive his
behind-the-scenes campaign to take over the national party at a convention in
April.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We lost because of this scandal,'' he told German television. ``But I'm
proud that we've been able to ... connect with our voters and avoid a
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Starting now I'm a federal politician again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Current party chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble, who faced an internal rebellion
over his handling of the scandal, announced Feb. 16 he would not seek
re-election in order to allow his party a ``new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
	   Angela Merkel, the party's general secretary, is considered the
front-runner, but is opposed by right-wingers because of her more progressive
stance on social issues and roots in former communist East Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Party leaders are scheduled to vote for a new chairman March 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl has admitted hiding millions in undeclared, and therefore illegal,
campaign contributions and refuses to name the sources, leading to speculation
about possible influence peddling. Parliament and prosecutors have targeted Kohl
for investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian Democrats are ``out of the bottom of the valley,'' Merkel told
a news conference in Berlin, noting that the results were less punishing than
had been predicted. ``It's back in step and will naturally continue to fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Early results showed the Social Democrats garnering 43 percent, up from 40
percent in 1996, while their coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens,
dropped to 6 percent from 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Social Democratic party secretary Franz Muenterfering hailed the showing as
a vote of renewed confidence in Schroeder's government as well. A series of
local defeats last year cost Schroeder control of the upper house of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Refugees Heading Back Home  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TURBO, Colombia (AP) -- It's been three years since 4,200 villagers from
hamlets along the Cacarica River near Colombia's border with Panama became
frightened exiles in their own land.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleeing threats from right-wing paramilitary gunmen, the villagers picked up
quickly -- leaving food on the stove and abandoning livestock and fields of
yams, yuca and plantains.
</P>
<P>
	   They crammed into a convoy of wooden boats and crossed the choppy Gulf of
Uraba, arriving in this grimy port, where they remain today -- holed up in
shelters and an abandoned basketball arena, living symbols of one of the globe's
silent crises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been here for three years now, and the people are bored. The
children are getting sick,'' said Eugenio Denis, 36, a jobless, thin father of
six.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed up with their situation and tired of waiting on slow-moving peace talks,
many have decided to go back home even though rebels and paramilitary groups are
still battling over the region -- a major corridor for arms and drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
	   The first group is heading back today, the third anniversary of the day they
were forced to leave Cacarica.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 2 million Colombians have fled their homes at one time or another
over the past 15 years to avoid escalating guerrilla violence and
``scorched-earth'' paramilitary campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, 288,000 people became refugees, a private monitoring group, the
Consultancy for Human Rights and Displacement, reported last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet despite a forced uprooting larger than the refugee exodus from Kosovo,
government officials, activists and U.N. refugee experts say the world has
largely ignored Colombia's humanitarian emergency. The World Food Program
recently said its appeal last year for $9 million to aid displaced Colombians
yielded not a penny from international donors.
</P>
<P>
	   The refugee problem could be worsened by a $1.6 billion aid package the U.S.
Congress is considering to finance an intensified anti-drug campaign in
Colombia. U.S. and Colombian officials are making plans to aid 10,000 peasants
who probably would be uprooted by a military drive into southern regions that
grow coca, the source of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bogota, some displaced people have made desperate publicity-seeking
measures, including the boisterous takeover Tuesday of the government's refugee
agency and a 2-month-old sit-in at the International Red Cross's offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, the assistant U.N. high commissioner for refugees, Soren
Jessen-Peterson of Denmark, visited refugees in Turbo and nearby Rio Sucio and
urged them to be patient.
</P>
<P>
	   He said their neglect was symptomatic of a global failure to respond when
people flee within their own countries instead of crossing borders. Such people
are known bureaucratically as ``internally displaced people'' -- not refugees --
and mostly must depend on their own governments for help.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The causes are the same; the results are the same; and the solutions are
the same. But there's no international structure to deal with them,'' Peterson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia's aid chief, Fernando Medellin, says he has only $15 million for a
problem that will require $360 million during the next three years. And that's
only to deal with the 400,000 people the government says need help now.
</P>
<P>
	   Refugee experts say the scant attention paid to Colombia is due partly to a
unique pattern of violence and flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighty percent of Colombia's war displaced flee in small family units, not
the mass movements that make international news. Many move in with friends or
relatives in cities and eventually find work. Most are expelled not by the
military, but by guerrillas or paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's such a complex situation. You can't paint it easily,'' said Hiram
Ruiz of the U.S. Committee for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruiz's organization and groups including Catholic Relief Services are urging
U.S. lawmakers to include at least $50 million for the displaced in any new aid
package for Colombia. U.S. officials say the plan will include some money for
refugee assistance organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   As long as the violence continues, even increased aid may not do much.
Refugee advocates estimate an additional 250,000 people could flee this year,
and peace talks currently under way with rebels could take years to conclude.
</P>
<P>
	   The refugees in Turbo have had enough and plan to return to their fertile
lands this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We lived well there, deliciously,'' said Consolacion Palmeque, a jovial
mother of two stirring coffee over a sweet-smelling wood fire. ``Every fifteen
days there was a dance. We lived without fear.''
</P>
<P>
	   They concede they aren't returning to good times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know the war isn't going to end, because it's just beginning,'' said
refugee leader Pascual Avila.

<HEADLINE> Group Helps Farmers Find Companions  </HEADLINE>
    By MARGERY BECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- As if a faltering farm economy weren't enough of a
burden to bear, many in agriculture face another problem -- loneliness.
</P>
<P>
	   Single farmers and ranchers have a tough time meeting other people with
similar interests, say those who would know best.
</P>
<P>
	   "The thing about agriculture, it's usually in an area where you don't have
many neighbors," said Kay Remus, 63, who lived on a ranch outside North Platte
until her husband retired. He died shortly afterward in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Widowed and alone with her children grown up and leading their own lives,
Remus became more isolated in the three years following her husband's death.
Then she spotted a newspaper ad for a gathering of people like herself.
</P>
<P>
	   Six years later, Remus chaired the 14th annual national convention of
Singles in Agriculture, held in Lincoln over the weekend. The itinerary was
packed with social events including dances, group meals and tours of local
sites, the Quilt Research Institute and the nation's only tractor-testing
laboratory among them.
</P>
<P>
	   Singles in Agriculture got its start in 1984, after one farmer complained in
a letter to Farm Journal that it was hard for him to meet women interested in
rural life.
</P>
<P>
	   That year, the trade magazine offered to accept names, addresses and short
biographies from single people in the farm industry and put them in touch with
each other.
</P>
<P>
	   It received 2,700 responses, more than the journal could handle.
</P>
<P>
	   In June 1986, 23 people gathered in Peoria, Ill., for Singles in
Agriculture's first meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The group now has a dozen state and regional chapters with about 1,150
members nationwide, including 55 in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have people from their mid-20s on up," Remus said. "And they come from
all over the country -- even in places where there isn't a chapter."
</P>
<P>
	   The group's national chairman, Morris Bilskie of Chicago, spent much of his
life working for ConAgra, which transferred him around the country 11 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The mobile lifestyle left him little time to date, much less marry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I met and dated some great gals along the way, but ultimately we ended up
going our own ways," Bilskie said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although about 50 of the group's members have met and married each other,
the organization is not a dating service, members insist. Rather, it's a support
group that gives isolated members events to attend year-round and
"long-distance" neighbors they can depend on.
</P>
<P>
	   "Members can really count on each other in good times and in bad --
especially in times of tragedy," Bilskie said. "It's like a chain reaction. The
information gets out pretty quick."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the oldest members at 74, Mary Ellen Maschmeier of Turpin, Okla., has
taken a lead in the organization, serving twice as the Oklahoma chapter
president in her seven years as a member. She serves on the group's national
board.
</P>
<P>
	   "You'll will notice if you look around that everybody is so happy to see
each other," she said, sweeping the Lincoln hotel lobby with an outstretched
arm.
</P>
<P>
	   "Farm life is a lonely life if you don't have people you can count on."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jazz singer struggles, keeps her dream alive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A low hum resonates from the capacity crowd at the
Village Vanguard. Snippets of conversation mix with murmured drink orders in the
triangle-shaped basement room that was home to the likes of Charlie "Bird"
Parker and Miles Davis.
<P>
	   With its pictures of John Coltrane and Roland Kirk on the walls, this is the
place where jazz performers dream of taking the stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Teri Thornton is one of those dreamers, has been since she decided as a
little girl in Detroit that jazz would be the soundtrack of her life. Her dream
took her to critical acclaim as a singer 40 years ago; then through three failed
marriages, near-oblivion as a performer and bouts with alcoholism, depression
and cancer; and finally back into the spotlight as winner of one of jazz's most
prestigious awards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just know that there's nothing else for me to do," said Thornton. "God
gave me this talent and I knew he meant for me to do something with it and I
just couldn't give up."
</P>
<P>
	   And she hasn't. After years of taking whatever small singing jobs she could
get - and even a stint as a taxi driver - Thornton released "I'll Be Easy to
Find" on Verve Records last year, her first release since the early '60s.
</P>
<P>
	   On a recent night, after the band members have done their solos, the
saxophonist reaches for the microphone.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ladies and Gentleman - Teri Thornton."
</P>
<P>
	   The black sequins on her beret catch some light and sparkle as Thornton
slowly makes her way onstage, flanked by a man who holds her arm in support. She
sinks onto her chair, a long, dark, animal-print shirt hanging off her gaunt
frame.
</P>
<P>
	   This is night three of a six-night gig at the Vanguard, with Thornton doing
two sets a night. The mother of three and grandmother looks frail.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1997. Her treatment -
chemotherapy, radiation, and finally surgery - has been exhausting. Now she has
painful blood clots in her legs that make walking difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   But there's no sign of illness in her voice when she starts singing. The
low-pitched sound is true as Thornton doles out bits of wisdom to an
appreciative audience.
</P>
<P>
	   "He who is wise never tries to revise what is past and gone," she sings in
"Devil May Care."
</P>
<P>
	   It was never supposed to be this difficult to get a big break for Thornton,
now a gracious, elegant woman of 65 with a wide smile and smoky voice.
</P>
<P>
	   An only child, she grew up in a house filled with music. Her grandmother
sang in church, and her mother had a radio show. Her mother wanted Thornton to
become a classical pianist but supported her decision to sing jazz, even making
sure Thornton saw all the big-name musicians who passed through town.
</P>
<P>
	   "My mother would think it was so important for me to see them, she'd kind of
snatch me off the schoolgrounds" to go watch the greats of the day, the singer
recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   She started performing in the 1950s and made her way to Chicago. The Windy
City was good to her, with plenty of work and plenty of friends in the jazz
scene. She worked in Canada, too, then went east to New York in 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Big Apple it was instant luck, Thornton said. The day of her arrival,
she went to look for a friend at a jazz club and ended up taking the stage for a
song.
</P>
<P>
	   Her performance impressed a woman in the audience who helped get her a job
singing on national television. TV led to club dates, and an introduction by
some jazz friends to a record company led to a contract.
</P>
<P>
	   "Devil May Care" was released in 1961 on Riverside Records, followed by
"Somewhere in the Night," the theme for the television show "Naked City," in
1962 on Dauntless, and "Open Highway" on Columbia in 1963.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite critical acclaim, Thornton's career never came up to speed. Soon
even the club dates began drying up.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the kind of thing where you're too little to be big and too big to
be little," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Plus, like the song says, the times they were a-changing. The '60s were the
age of rock 'n' roll, and Thornton was a jazz singer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really didn't fit in," she said, recalling that even when she tried to
take to the new music, she was ignored by producers at Columbia Records.
</P>
<P>
	   "They had decided what kind of material I should do and they ... wouldn't
let me go over the line," Thornton said. "I always liked rock 'n' roll ... and I
could have performed it, but they refused to let me do that. So I wound up off
the label."
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton stayed in New York until 1975, singing the occasional gig,
sometimes living off the kindness of friends. She moved to Los Angeles to be
near her son after her ex-husband would not let the boy return from a visit.
</P>
<P>
	   It was in LA she was reduced to driving a cab. "Unfortunately there wasn't
very much work out there for me," she recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   She got some singing jobs, she said, but "it was just kind of from one job
to the next and one paycheck to the next."
</P>
<P>
	   Her return to New York with her son in 1983 didn't make things any better.
Her old jazz friends had drifted away or didn't want to see her. "I didn't know
how I was going to make it here. I wasn't about to drive a cab in this town,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Living in an apartment above a bar, she began drowning her troubles in
alcohol. She remembers waking up in the morning facing "my own alcoholic
breath." She thought of suicide but decided that she couldn't leave her son,
then 14.
</P>
<P>
	   And once she decided she was going to live, she said, life started looking
up. She stopped drinking and sang with small jazz bands, work that was steady if
not spectacular.
</P>
<P>
	   "There would be lean times, but I could always maintain," she said. "I could
never feel like I had a whole lot of bad luck because there were so many things
that were good in the realm of that bad luck."
</P>
<P>
	   But the good was hard to find in the summer of 1998. Thornton was recovering
from surgery after having been diagnosed with cancer the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   When her manager Suizi Reynolds called and asked her if she wanted to enter
a singing competition, it seemed like a joke. Especially when Thornton found out
it wasn't just any contest but the Thelonius Monk International Jazz
Competition.
</P>
<P>
	   An age limit that would have made Thornton ineligible had been dropped, and
it would be the perfect showcase for her. Thornton agreed even though she wasn't
sure she was well enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Her manager sent in a CD of Thornton's songs, and she was chosen as one of
the five finalists to perform live in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton spent the week before the contest lying down to conserve energy. It
paid off. According to published accounts, she tore the house down with her
rendition of "I'll Be Easy to Find."
</P>
<P>
	   Recalling her reaction when she was announced as winner, Thornton said, "I
was weak in the knees. ... It was just so heady. I still experience it over and
over again."
</P>
<P>
	   Does she wonder about the life she might have had if stardom had come during
her first go-round? A little, but Thornton is philosophical.
</P>
<P>
	   "It didn't happen then. The life that I had, as bad as may it seem to
somebody else, it's still good," she said. "There's a lot of growing in the
process and I think that you're not ready until you're ready."

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton urges reconciliation between cops and citizens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton urged New Yorkers to reach across
the "trust divide" in the wake of the Diallo verdict but offered no opinion on
whether the case warrants a federal investigation.
<P>
	   "There are still too many people in this city who believe they are
considered guilty just because of the color of their skin, and there are also
too many police officers who believe they are mistrusted because of the color of
their uniforms," Clinton told several hundred people Sunday at a City College
conference on the political concerns of Dominican-Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   She added: "The police must strive for a better understanding of the
communities they serve, and the communities must strive for a better
understanding of the risks that the police face in their service on behalf of us
every day."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton noted that the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into whether
federal civil rights charges should be brought against the four white officers
who were acquitted of wrongdoing in the shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
black African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not offer an opinion on whether she thought a federal case was
merited, saying: "No matter the outcome of that investigation, there is more for
all of us to do to respond to this tragedy. We must not allow the verdict to
divide New Yorkers. We must reach across those lines of mistrust and division
and join to ensure that no tragedy like this ever happens again."
</P>
<P>
	   She also called for an effort "to recruit and train a police force that
truly reflects the racial and ethnic diversity of this great city. We must
support efforts to expand community policing so that more police officers can
walk the beat and really know people they serve."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is running for U.S. Senate against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
Giuliani's spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum, bristled at the notion that the police
force needs reforming.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mrs. Clinton is obviously unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department," he said. "As a result of the plan, the new police class will be the
most diverse ever and will better reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of our
city."
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum did not have the breakdown for the academy's latest class, and
the police department could not immediately provide it. But overall, the force
is about two-thirds white, while the city's population is less than half white.

<HEADLINE> Huddled masses? Not on the new Lower East Side  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Lower East Side of Manhattan is famous for its
tenements, its pastrami sandwiches and its proud history as the first American
home to millions of immigrants.
<P>
	   Until recently, trendy nightclubs, posh art galleries and $3,000-a-month
studio apartments were definitely NOT part of the picture.
</P>
<P>
	   But with a little help from New York's through-the-roof real estate market,
the old Lower East Side has become something its former residents would never
have recognized - a hip downtown hotspot.
</P>
<P>
	   The narrow streets where vendors once pushed carts piled high with clothing,
vegetables, household goods and even eyeglasses are now home to scores of bars,
cafes and glitzy shops that might look more at home in upscale SoHo or artsy
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now it's pretty much a well-known fact that if you want to move to a really
cool, hip neighborhood, you're going to move down here," said artist Peter
Marco, who sells brightly colored Keith Haring-esque T-shirts and paintings from
a shop on Orchard Street. "If you come down here on a weekend, there's no better
place to party. The streets are just mobbed with 20-somethings having the time
of their life."
</P>
<P>
	   A century ago, the Lower East Side's crowded tenements and filthy living
conditions inspired muckraking journalist Jacob Riis' expose "How the Other Half
Lives."
</P>
<P>
	   Waves of immigrants passed through the area, fresh from Ellis Island - first
Irish, then Italians, eastern European Jews, Russians, Poles and Greeks, later
Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   Immigration still shapes the neighborhood. Today it's not clear where
Chinatown begins and the old Lower East Side ends. Hispanic families have a
significant presence, and many recent arrivals hail from Bangladesh and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   But scattered among the Asian fishmongers and elderly Jewish men selling
socks, underwear and discount clothing is a new kind of migrant - young
professionals drawn to the area by low rents and a vibrant arts and
entertainment scene.
</P>
<P>
	   "The grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the immigrants who first moved
to this neighborhood and worked all their lives to get out ... are back in the
neighborhood," laughed Fred Austin, owner of the venerable Katz's Delicatessen,
which now stays open till 3 a.m. on weekend nights to accommodate hungry young
club-goers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a host of new shops, new clubs, even theaters, bars, design houses
- a lot of young people, fresh blood, giving the neighborhood a shot in the arm,
a revitalization that we haven't seen for many, many years."
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't always that way.
</P>
<P>
	   Popular for years as a bargain shopping district, the Lower East Side fell
on hard times during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s. By the time recession hit
in the early '90s, it was known more for its problems with crime and drugs than
its history. Hundreds of old apartment buildings sat vacant, sealed by landlords
who couldn't be bothered to spend money fixing them up.
</P>
<P>
	   Salvation came in the form of New York's late 1990s real estate boom.
</P>
<P>
	   With Wall Street's bull market driving commercial and residential rents to
eye-popping levels in more established Manhattan neighborhoods, young New
Yorkers started noticing the Lower East Side's cheap housing and great location.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now that SoHo has really gentrified into something that the average person
can't afford, I think a lot of people are looking for that SoHo kind of flavor
at a reasonable price," said Bob Levy, the owner of Harris Levy Inc., a family
linen store whose discounted sheets and bedding have been a fixture on Grand
Street since 1894.
</P>
<P>
	   Artists and writers moved in - along with bars, restaurants and boutiques -
and upscale young professionals soon followed.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I moved down here, the broker had 35 keys and he was like, 'Pick a
store,"' recalled Marco, whose art shop is now an overwhelming avalanche of
color. "It was a block full of empties."
</P>
<P>
	   Some longtime residents were suspicious.
</P>
<P>
	   "They used to say, 'Oh, you're not going to make a dollar, what are you
doing opening an art gallery on Orchard Street?"' Marco said. "'This is where
you sell underwear and socks."'
</P>
<P>
	   That's just what's on display next door at J. Hauptman Haberdashery, along
with men's suits and sportswear. Jack Hauptman, whose parents started the store
40 years ago, worries he won't make it on the new Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
	   Hauptman says the busy bar and club scene is driving away his longtime
customers. Young people "come here to drink," he said. "It's upsetting because
it's taking away my livelihood."
</P>
<P>
	   Some worry gentrification is beginning to drive out the immigrants and other
poor and working class residents who have long been part of the Lower East Side.
Late-night carousing at the area's dozens of bars and clubs has also raised
concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   "People who are low income feel that eventually they will be priced out of
the neighborhood," said Marcia Lemmon, who heads the Ludlow Block Association.
"And when you have a lot of noise, street traffic, that's not conducive to
raising a family."
</P>
<P>
	   The low rents that first drew young people to the neighborhood are already
vanishing. In the Beckenstein Fabrics building on Orchard Street - still
surrounded by storefronts displaying girdles, handbags and discount hosiery -
newly renovated one-bedroom apartments rent for $5,000 a month, and studios top
out at $3,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Who's paying those prices?
</P>
<P>
	   "Wall Street guys," said Faith Hope Consolo, an executive at the real estate
firm handling rentals in the Beckenstein building. "Even lawyers and
accountants, if you can believe it. ... It's amazing. We just don't have enough
space for everybody."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, some old-time Lower East Siders couldn't be happier. Levy said a park
near his linen store was once a hangout for drug dealers and is now clean and
safe.
</P>
<P>
	   "I remember years ago that if I had to stay in the store late, ... at 10
o'clock at night, I'd start thinking, 'I'd better get going,"' he said. "Now I
can stay till 12 o'clock and I don't think twice about it."
</P>
<P>
	   What does the future hold for the ever-evolving Lower East Side?
</P>
<P>
	   More change, predicts artist Marco.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the only thing you can count on," he said. "Eventually somebody's
going to come down here and change us again."

</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking straight up from the Capitol Rotunda's stone
floor, the circular white-plastic shape resembles a giant powdered doughnut, its
hole framing a painting of George Washington serenely presiding over the
heavens.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a surreal vision, almost as if Christo, the Bulgarian-born artist who
wraps famous structures like the Reichstag in Berlin, had left his mark on the
preeminent symbol of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   But there has been no art attack on Capitol Hill. ``This is serious business
for us,'' says James Ellison, an assistant to the Architect of the Capitol, even
as he concedes that the rotunda now looks ``like Christo had struck.''
</P>
<P>
	   The architect's office is engaged in the first phase of an ambitious $44
million rehabilitation project to reverse the effects of decades of seeping
water, rust and layer upon layer of paint that has accumulated since the Capitol
dome was completed just after the Civil War,
</P>
<P>
	   That means identifying and documenting hundreds of cracks and breaks in the
dome's cast iron plates and scraping away toxic lead-based paint.
</P>
<P>
	   The plastic doughnut is the visible layer of a four-layer custom-designed
safety netting deployed, just below the Washington painting in the eye of the
dome, to keep debris from falling on the heads of people below. That allows the
rotunda to remain open for tourists and congressional ceremonies while work goes
on above.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the outer plastic, Ellison explains, is a 3 1/2-inch diamond netting
able to withstand a 500-pound impact. Behind that is a finer  3/4-inch webbing.
And behind that is plastic sheeting to contain the dust.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially assembled on the rotunda floor, it took three weeks to hoist in
place. ``It's there simply in the event a piece of iron should fall, Ellison
said, adding that the only feasible alternative was to build a scaffold from the
floor up.
</P>
<P>
	   Weighing nearly 9 million pounds, the Capitol dome rises 287 feet from
ground level to the feathered head of the Statue of Freedom, which has crowned
it since 1863. The dome, which replaced an earlier structure, was the finishing
touch of an extension in the mid-19th century that added new House and Senate
wings to the original building.
</P>
<P>
	   The office of the Architect of the Capitol says it's probably ``the most
famous manmade landmark in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although painted to resemble the white marble of the new wings, the dome is
actually cast iron, a material chosen for its relatively light weight, low cost
and ease of fabrication. The dome was designed, as were the new wings, by Thomas
U. Walter. Army Capt. Montgomery Meigs of the Corps of Engineers ran the
building project even as he feuded with Walter for control.
</P>
<P>
	   The current crop of engineers and architects has no fault to find with their
work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those guys 140 years ago did a superb job of designing and building it --
and it has stood the test of time,'' Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cracks and breaks are essentially surface abrasions. ``We're not talking
about structural problems,'' Ellison said. ``The dome is perfectly safe.''
</P>
<P>
	   Work on the second phase of the project could begin in October 2001 if
Congress provides the required $37 million, the largest part of the overall $44
million cost.
</P>
<P>
	   That will require a far more elaborate support structure inside the rotunda,
built out from the main stone base of the dome to support scaffolding. The
rotunda will be closed for three months while it is installed.
</P>
<P>
	   When in place it will be used as a base to repair the cracks and breaks in
the iron; ease paint removal and recoating with a modern, non-toxic paint; and
install an array of mechanical improvements, including a new ventilation system
to prevent condensation and make the dome's interior a drip-free zone.
</P>
<P>
	   All of this must be done while carefully protecting the canopy 180 feet
above the rotunda floor that supports the eye-of-the-dome painting that the
nation's founder raised to glory.

<HEADLINE> More Consumers Prefer Cell Phones  </HEADLINE>
    By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- John Dunn, who spends much time on the road and has
loved ones scattered throughout the country, decided last year the time had come
to cut the cord.
</P>
<P>
	   On his telephone, that is.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of the growing acceptance of wireless technology, thousands of
consumers have made their mobile phone their primary phone. Wireless companies
gathered here this week for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association
say they increasingly are seeing consumers reach for a cell phone -- rather than
a traditional wireline receiver -- to make a call.
</P>
<P>
	   In Dunn's case, he figured he could save money by purchasing a wireless plan
with a set number of long-distance minutes that he can use at home or while
traveling.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've got the same phone number in my pocket day in and day out," said Dunn,
of Clarksville, Tenn. "It makes it very convenient."
</P>
<P>
	   About 2 percent of 86 million wireless subscribers use their mobiles as
their only phone, according to the Yankee Group research firm. Some users say
they end up saving money by purchasing hundreds of minutes for one flat rate
compared with their monthly local and long-distance bills combined.
</P>
<P>
	   More commonly, consumers are using their cell phone to make calls when they
could have opted for a wired phone instead, said Ed Reynolds, president of
BellSouth Mobility Inc. Rather than paying 35 cents for a pay phone call or
waiting for someone else in the house to get off the line, people are dialing on
their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're seeing a very significant amount of that," Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
	   In parts of the country that have limited landline service because of their
remote location or sparse population, wireless also can offer a way to
"leapfrog" old technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Wheeler, president of the cellular association, said American companies
are just beginning to wake up to what developing countries have long known:
"Wireless is the most cost-efficient and quickest way to get 21st century
service to remote areas."
</P>
<P>
	   Federal regulators, for example, are looking at ways to entice wireless
carriers to expand their services to underserved areas, particularly American
Indian reservations, that may not have regular phone service.
</P>
<P>
	   Wireless companies are even putting pressure on traditional phone companies
in some places to lower their prices. In Regent, N.D., a wireless company has
become a formidable challenger to the local carrier.
</P>
<P>
	   "Customers like that they're not locked into one choice," said Dave
Friedman, vice president of marketing for U.S. Cellular Corp. His company has
had success in offering residential cellular service to some New England
customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Leap Wireless International, a California-based company, offers a service in
markets such as Chattanooga, Tenn., called "Cricket." That plan costs callers a
flat rate of $29.95 for all local calls and incoming calls from anywhere in the
world. The company says it is capturing an underserved market through this
product. Consumers who use it have an average income 50 percent less than
traditional wireless users.
</P>
<P>
	   There are practical limits to the number of consumers who can go the
cell-phone-only route. Some wireless carriers are facing serious strains to
their network capacity, particularly in dense urban areas.
</P>
<P>
	   For that reason and others, some analysts say they see wireless not so much
as a replacement for regular phones as an added option for consumers seeking to
expand on their telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't look at wireless as better than wireline," said Darryl Sterling,
senior analyst at the Boston-based Yankee Group. Instead, he said he looks at
mobile phones more as a complement to traditional phones.
</P>
<P>
	   Companies say that in many markets, people are interested in wireless
services for their second line, since they may want one landline to hook up
their fax or Internet access.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the cellular association, 43 percent of all wireless
subscribers have more than one regular phone line at home and 44 percent of
those people said they would like to be able to convert that line to wireless.
</P>
<P>
	   Young professionals, who may be moving into a new place and haven't already
paid for their wireline connection, are among those most likely to take the
cellular-only route in the future, Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you have family and friends spread out over a wide area, and you travel,
it makes the most sense," Dunn said.

<HEADLINE> 100 Best Adventures in America  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the folks who brought you the world's top treks, now
comes the 100 best adventures in America -- from rafting the Grand Canyon to
canoeing the Niobara River in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   National Geographic Adventure magazine had a panel of editors and outdoor
writers study the most exciting things to do in this country and presents the
best in its March-April issue.
</P>
<P>
	   No. 1? Rafting the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are other whitewater trips with this much adrenaline,'' the magazine
admits. ``But nothing can compare to rafting the Colorado through the Grand
Canyon ... it is the shear power of the water -- massive waves, boat-soaking
holes, furious rapids -- that defines the Colorado experience.''
</P>
<P>
	   How about No. 100?
</P>
<P>
	   Canoeing the Niobara. ``A Cornhusker secret revealed, the Niobara is a
superb prairie paddle,'' National Geographic Adventure reports.
</P>
<P>
	   In between are a manic miscellany of adventures including delivering the
mail by plane to isolated ranches in Idaho, swimming with manatees in Florida's
Crystal River and digging for dinosaurs in Montana. The magazine will be on
newsstands March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Rounding out the top 10 overall are:
</P>
<P>
	   2: Sea kayaking the Na Pali Coast, Kauai, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
	   3: Dog-sledding in the Brooks Range, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   4: Mountain biking Kokopelli's Trail in Colorado and Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   5: Hiking the Narrows, Zion National Park, Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   6: Skiing Corbet's Couloir, Jackson Hole, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
	   7: Climbing El Capitan, Yosemite National Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   8: Hiking the Presidential Range traverse, New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   9: Competing in the ``Beast 2000'' adventure race, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   10: Diving in Bonne Terre Mine, Bonne Terre, Mo.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak To Expand Into Delivery  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak, charting a course of expansion rather than cuts,
aims to become financial viable by serving new passenger markets and filling a
niche in the time-sensitive delivery business.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroad's new ``network growth strategy'' will be unveiled officially
Tuesday, although portions were disclosed in recent days.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would expand or improve service in 21 states, add 11 route segments
and increase train frequency on three routes. It also would boost by 10 percent
the number of station-to-station links and bring trains to the areas of 4
million potential new passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very different approach to the business, a growth-oriented
approach as opposed to a nickel-and-dime-yourself-to-death approach,'' said
Amtrak President George Warrington.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, chairwoman of a Senate subcommittee
overseeing Amtrak, praised the corporation's new strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very creative and innovative,'' she said. ``I can't say enough about
the new leadership at Amtrak. They're thinking outside the box, and that is what
Amtrak needed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak projects that the changes, when fully implemented, will generate $229
million in new annual revenue and cause a net gain of $65 million in 2003. The
timing is crucial for Amtrak. Under legislation passed in 1997, it has until the
end of fiscal year 2002 to wean itself from federal operating subsidies or face
possible liquidation.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroad now operates a 22,000-mile system that serves more than 500
communities in 45 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes do not require approval by Congress. But in order to implement
them, Amtrak will have to strike deals with various freight railroads whose
tracks is uses.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, Amtrak trains will begin stopping in Des Moines and Iowa
City, Iowa; Rockford, Ill.; Vicksburg, Miss.; Monroe and Shreveport, La.; Lake
Geneva and Janesville, Wis.; and destinations on the Atlantic Coast of Florida
including Daytona Beach, Cape Canaveral and Fort Pierce.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, people as far north as Boston will be able to board a train and travel
to Florida without having to transfer in New York. Gamblers will find more
trains to take them to Shreveport's casinos. Riders can board in Michigan, sleep
as their train dashes through Canada and wake up in upstate New York, on the way
to New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   There are losers as well.
</P>
<P>
	   By taking a northern route through more heavily populated cities in Texas,
the Sunset Limited train will no longer stop in Del Rio, Alpine and Sanderson.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, the International will stop in Ann Arbor and Dearborn, Mich., but
no longer serve five other Michigan cities -- East Lansing, Durand, Flint,
Lapeer and Port Huron.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrington said the plan reflects a hard lesson Amtrak learned in the
mid-1990s: Cuts in service bring numerous complaints and fewer financial savings
than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've tried in the past to shrink, and all we've done is irritate people,
reduce service and profits and ridership. And that's no way to run a railroad,''
said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of Amtrak's governing board. ``The
board is committed to building a national railroad system, and this is a giant
step forward to doing it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Illustrative of Amtrak's new philosophy is its treatment of the Sunset
Limited, a money-loser that threads its way along the southern United States
from Jacksonville, Fla., to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The growth strategy says that eliminating the Sunset Limited would save $8
million in costs but deprive Amtrak of $9.5 million in fares from passengers and
fees from deliveries that rely on that line to connect to other routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrington said the report indicates that adjustments, not wholesale
changes, are needed to strengthen Amtrak, which was created in 1971 following
the demise of passenger service by major railroads.
</P>
<P>
	   With the exception of a luxury transcontinental route designed to link New
York and Los Angeles in 60 hours, Amtrak is proposing no new long-distance
routes. Rather, the plan calls for strategic extensions, shifting equipment
around and paying greater attention to mail and express business.
</P>
<P>
	   A case in point is the Crescent, which travels between New York and New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   Plans call for the train to separate in Meridian, Miss., with one segment
heading west to Fort Worth, while the other continues south to New Orleans. This
would allow Amtrak to add service to Vicksburg, Miss., and to Monroe and
Shreveport, La., while building opportunities for mail and express deliveries
between Dallas-Fort Worth and the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The expected payoff is an additional $7.7 million a year as of 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   The mail and express business is key to Amtrak's recipe for financial
recovery, as is a plan to begin hauling meat, poultry, fruit and vegetables in
refrigerated cars attached to intercity trains.
</P>
<P>
	   Sensitive to the concerns of freight railroads, Warrington stressed that he
is looking to complement what they do, not to compete, and to enter into
partnerships to make the best use of the tracks they and Amtrak share.

<HEADLINE> Albright Eyed As Czech President  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. MANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is ``certainly
flattered'' by suggestions she seek the presidency of her native Czech Republic,
but she has dismissed it without serious consideration, her spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Czechs are speaking of her as a possible successor to President Vaclav
Havel, who must retire in 2002. Havel, a playwright-turned-politician, helped
lead the ``Velvet Revolution'' that in 1989 persuaded communist rulers to
resign, and he also has raised Albright's name.
</P>
<P>
	   But State Department spokesman James P. Rubin sought to dampen the
speculation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From time to time, senior Czech officials have approached the secretary
about this possibility,'' he said. ``She has dismissed it, although she is
certainly flattered that Czechs would consider her for the post of president of
her native land. She has never given this any serious consideration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, 62, plans to be in the Czech Republic on March 5-8. The visit
coincides with the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of
national hero Tomas Masaryk, who served as the first president of the
Czechoslovak Republic after the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918.
</P>
<P>
	   Havel's chief policy adviser, Pavel Fischer, told Time magazine ``it is not
impossible'' that Havel and Albright will discuss the presidency during the
visit. The secretary, a former professor, has not publicly discussed her plans
after the Clinton administration ends next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's visit will have some trappings of a political barnstorming tour.
She will receive a gold medal from Masaryk University in Brno and will go to
Masaryk's birthplace at Hodonin. She will lay a wreath at his tomb in Lany, west
of Prague, and go to the capital to unveil a Masaryk statue.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright was born Marie Korbelova in Prague in 1937. Her father was a Czech
diplomat who took his family to London as Germany took over their homeland at
the start of World War II. The family then moved to Denver in 1948 rather than
serve under a communist Czechoslovak government.
</P>
<P>
	   Havel first brought up the presidency idea in 1998. After returning to
Prague from an official visit to the United States, he expressed regret that he
hadn't asked whether she would be available to succeed him. ``It occurred to me
on the plane on my way back home,'' Havel said, ``so I did not have the chance
to ask her.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Constitution bars Albright or any other foreign-born citizen from
the American presidency, but there appears to be no legal bar to keep an
American citizen from assuming the presidency of another country.
</P>
<P>
	   Other naturalized citizens have served in foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
	   Lithuania's current president, Valdas Adamkus, is a former U.S. government
bureaucrat. Yugoslavia's former prime minister, American Milan Panic, was a
California millionaire before returning to his homeland and was barred by a
technicality from running against the President Slobodan Milosevic in 1992.
Golda Meir moved from a Milwaukee classroom to become the prime minister who led
Israel to victory in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Havel's wife, Charlotte Garrigue, is an American.

<HEADLINE> Report: Youth Imprisonment Doubles  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As states moved steadily to prosecute more young people
as adults, the number of prison inmates under 18 more than doubled between 1985
and 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, 3,400 youths 17 or younger were committed to adult prisons on
conviction in either juvenile or adult courts. By 1997, the number of such
youths had more than doubled to 7,400, the Justice Department reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Young inmates by no means are overrunning the prisons' adult population of 2
million, and just 5 percent of all young offenders serve sentences in adult
facilities, researchers said. But data suggest that today's violent young
offenders are more likely to do prison time than in years past.
</P>
<P>
	   That's partly because of an increasing number of state laws that take away
their legal status as minors and make them more accountable, researchers say.
The crackdown, fueled in part by high-profile school violence, has placed
children as young as 11 on trial in criminal courts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many states have increased the number of provisions that allow juveniles
to be handled in the adult system,'' said report author Kevin J. Strom, a
researcher with the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, based on state prison records reported annually to the Justice
Department, noted that while 37 states and the District of Columbia consider
18-year-olds adults for criminal purposes, most also allow ``certain categories
of offenders under 18 to be incarcerated in adult prisons and housed with older
inmates.''
</P>
<P>
	   Debate continues to rage over the merits of handing out adult punishments
for legally classified youth who commit crimes. Californians will vote March 7
on a ballot proposal that would make it easier to charge juveniles as young as
14 as adults for serious crimes and impose life sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's some justification for public frustration with the juvenile
system,'' said Vincent Schiraldi, director of the Justice Policy Institute, a
think tank opposed to mandatory sentencing. ``But sending them to the adult
system en masse is no solution. It's hardly a resounding success for the people
it's got.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yearly youth commitments to prison climbed steadily between 1986 and 1995,
then leveled off, the report said. Over the years, more youths were imprisoned
relative to the number arrested. In 1997, 33 youths were sent to prison for
every 1,000 arrests for violent crimes, up from the 18 per 1,000 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven in 10 young offenders who received adult punishment in 1997, the
latest year state prison records were available, were convicted of violent
crimes. Of that total, 37 percent were jailed for robbery, 13 percent for murder
and 13 percent for aggravated assault, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The inmate data do not specify whether young offenders are convicted in
juvenile or adult courts, but Strom said it is known that a small percentage go
from the juvenile courts to adult incarceration.
</P>
<P>
	   Historically, young offenders' fates were mostly decided by juvenile court
judges. But after a spate of drug-gang violence and school shootings in the last
decade, state lawmakers decided adult prisons could more effectively deal with
violent or chronic youth offenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1992, 30 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that in
certain instances send kids directly to criminal court. Through 1998, despite a
50 percent drop in the juvenile murder arrest rate, many states also gave
criminal prosecutors increased power to bypass the century-old juvenile system
or chipped away at options juvenile judges had for keeping youth cases in their
courts.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rising number of American cities are imposing curfews
to deter youth violence, crime and gang activity, according to a report that
says 110 cities have established them in the past five years. The report,
released Monday by the National League of Cities, said that compares with 122
curfews set up across the nation during a 15-year period between 1980 and 1995.
Nighttime youth curfews were reported by a total of 337 of some 490 cities the

strong demand for workers in financial services and in manufacturing durable

conflicts. McCain's aides denied the move represented a shift in strategy and

<HEADLINE> Alleged Prison Camp Heads on Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The discovery of battered and emaciated
Bosnian inmates at Omarska prison camp in 1992 marked a turning point in
international willingness to intervene in the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the Bosnian Serbs who allegedly ran the detention camp were scheduled
to go on trial. Prosecutors say hundreds of prisoners were murdered, raped and
tortured at the camp in northern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
	   Miroslav Kvocka, Milojica Kos and Mlado Radic are charged with war crimes
and crimes against humanity for presiding over the atrocities at Omarska. A
fourth defendant, Zoran Zigic, is accused of torturing and murdering prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   A conviction on any count at the tribunal carries a maximum life sentence,
although 40 years is the stiffest sentence imposed so far. All four defendants
have pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was established in 1993 amid the global
outcry following the discovery of the camps.
</P>
<P>
	   The Omarska case is the first dealing directly with what prosecutors
characterize as ``a system of concentration camps'' as a deliberate strategy to
drive out Muslims and Croats from the area in order to create an ethnically pure
Serb state.
</P>
<P>
	   Serb forces swept through the Prijedor region of northern Bosnia at the
outset of the 1992-95 war and herded more than 6,000 non-Serbs into Omarska and
the nearby Keraterm and Trnopolje camps.
</P>
<P>
	   In a pretrial brief, prosecutors Grant Niemann, a former Australian war
crimes investigator, and Brenda Hollis, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel,
painted a horrifying picture of the camps.
</P>
<P>
	   New arrivals were beaten with batons and rifle butts and jammed into
stiflingly hot rooms with no beds and meager sanitary facilities, prosecutors
say. Hundreds allegedly died as a result of the treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   At Omarska, a converted iron ore mine, the dead bodies piled up on a daily
basis, the prosecutors wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Battered corpses were visible virtually every morning before they were
loaded onto trucks and removed from the camp,'' the brief says.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors hold Kvocka responsible for much of what happened at Omarska,
describing him as commander through June 1992 and later deputy commander. Kos
and Radic, alleged shift commanders, ordered guards to beat prisoners and
sometimes participated themselves, prosecutors maintain.
</P>
<P>
	   The three men, the brief says, ``exercised the power of life and death over
the detainees.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors also maintain the commanders bear responsibility for atrocities
at the two satellite camps because they ``actively participated in a common,
widespread and repressive system designed for the persecution of non-Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. tribunal has convicted 13 Serbs, Croats and Muslims of war crimes
and crimes against humanity. Dozens of suspects are in custody at its seaside
detention center, while key figures still at large include Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military
chief Ratko Mladic.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hosts Governors Minus Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton reflected on his waning days in office
and asked politicians who will serve after him not to waste a rare moment of
national economic prosperity and promise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 11 months I will be a private citizen,'' Clinton said as he toasted
most of the nation's governors at the White House. ``Most of you will still be
serving. Think of that,'' and use the opportunity wisely.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who claims much of the credit for the economic boom that coincided
with his elevation from Arkansas governor to president, meets with the state
leaders three times this week, including a discussion session scheduled today at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was likely to focus on the successful economy in his annual
address to the National Governors' Association, but would also touch on the
problem of rising oil prices, White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also planned to address Democratic governors separately tonight.
</P>
<P>
	   He will hear ideas about how to keep the good times going, but he will
likely hear a few complaints, too. Many of the 50 governors worry that the
federal government will stymie states' individual innovations in a variety of
areas, including health care and taxation.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, a Republican and chairman of the bipartisan
governors' association, said the group wants Clinton to hear its debate over
governors' roles in keeping state economies prosperous.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Much of that will reflect our desire that the federal government not
attempt to pre-empt our activities in that regard,'' Leavitt said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The governors' four-day meeting is centered on the findings in a new
economic report prepared for the group. The report, a copy of which was sent to
the White House weeks ago, concluded that states must aggressively refashion
their governments if they want to continue to compete.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who rose to national prominence as governor of Arkansas in the
1980s, toasted a smaller-than-expected group of 34 governors Sunday night and
noted that this is the 200th anniversary of the presidential election of another
former governor, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Jefferson embraced flexibility in governance, and Clinton urged governors to
do the same as they contend with the challenges of unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who wants to follow Jefferson and Clinton into
the White House, was one of those who missed the menu of grilled Arctic char and
rock shrimp served on the Reagan china. Bush was campaigning for president in
Seattle. His brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, was in Washington for the
governors' conference but skipped the White House dinner.

<HEADLINE> Teen Drama Group Teaches Abstinence  </HEADLINE>
    By LOUINN LOTA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A scene from "No Way to Treat a Lady" opens with Marie,
a pregnant girl, speaking of love and loss.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was older, and he was so good-looking," Marie explains to the audience.
"He told me that if two people really love each other, they shouldn't be afraid
to show it to each other."
</P>
<P>
	   A voice answers her sternly.
</P>
<P>
	   "They can show it to each other," it says. "Too bad some girls like you,
Marie, are ignorant enough to think that the only way a guy thinks you can show
him love is through sex."
</P>
<P>
	   The dialogue is spoken as part of the performance of a Southern California
troupe of teen-agers who teach sexual abstinence, resistance to peer pressure
and cultural tolerance to thousands of urban students through
true-life-situation theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Every actor in the Phantom Projects troupe has faced the pressures or
situations they portray on stage. After each play, the sixth- to eighth-grade
audience members can speak candidly about their own problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "The center of all of our shows is that everything comes down to
self-control," said Steve Cisneros, the group's producer-director. "It's natural
to have feelings of wanting to have sex. It's natural to be intolerant to what
others are and do. The actors are going through these same peer pressures
themselves at their schools."
</P>
<P>
	   The plays have been so effective that schools from New York to Arizona have
asked for the troupe.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, about 75 schools in Los Angeles, Orange and Santa Barbara
counties have booked the shows over four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Another 15 schools, most of them Christian parochial, have asked for the
sexual abstinence play, "No Way to Treat a Lady."
</P>
<P>
	   The actors, who are from half a dozen schools, have a 3.7 grade point
average, rehearse on weekends and receive permission to miss class on
performance days. Some schools give them credit for their work.
</P>
<P>
	   While the actors are unpaid, Cisneros, 21, remains thousands of dollars in
credit-card debt from staging the productions. The troupe charges up to $550 for
three performances at a location, but that doesn't meet expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Phantom Projects began when Cisneros was age 17 and a student of Bruce
Gevirtzman, an English teacher at La Mirada High School, about 20 miles from Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Gevirtzman, a playwright since 1976, wrote "No Way To Treat a Lady" and
other works now performed by the group.
</P>
<P>
	   Teens "should be able to depend on family, to always know that they are
loved," Gevirtzman said. "But that's not the case anymore. There are a lot of
substitutes for the love they're not getting: violence, sex, drugs."
</P>
<P>
	   Tired of seeing many such misguided teens at his school, Cisneros believed
he and his peers could reach out to urban middle-schoolers and teach them
survival tools for their turbulent years.
</P>
<P>
	   At a recent performance of "No Way to Treat a Lady," students raved about
the life lessons it offered. They asked that their last names not be used,
worried that their use might link them with problems addressed in the play.
</P>
<P>
	   "I learned some interesting and important facts about sex and the effects it
could have on my life that I didn't know," said Jason, 14. "I've been pressured
to have sex with someone more times than I can remember. Sometimes it's so hard
to resist."
</P>
<P>
	   Veronica, another middle-schooler, said the show "almost made me, cry just
because it's such a scary world -- STDs, AIDS, pregnancy."
</P>
<P>
	   "My mind was set to not have sex until I'm married," she said, "but now it's
written in stone."
</P>
<P>
	   Some parents have been unhappy with the frankness of the troupe's plays.
One, who identified himself as a former actor in a Christian drama company,
praised the cast in a comment sheet but also said "they are not qualified to
field students' questions on this sensitive subject."
</P>
<P>
	   But Cisneros defended the effort.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted to combine my passions for theater and the power to teach," he
said. "This is the way I could do it."

<HEADLINE> Maple Sugar Season Officially Opens  </HEADLINE>
   By TRUDY TYNAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORTH BROOKFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Never mind the lingering snow banks. Forget
the freezing rain.
</P>
<P>
	   The sure sign of spring in New England is the sweet smell of maple sap being
boiled into syrup.
</P>
<P>
	   And so state Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Healy, armed with a
gubernatorial proclamation, marched out in the slush Friday to kick off a
month-long promotion of Massachusetts' sugar houses with a ceremonial tree
tapping at the Warren Farm &AMP; Sugarhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   The tapping with Healy manning the drill, state Sen. Stephen Brewer,
D-Barre, pounding in the tap and state Rep. David Tuttle, R-Barre, hanging the
bucket, marked the first time the state has officially kicked off the season.
</P>
<P>
	   And it gave Massachusetts maple sugarers a political jump on Vermont, the
nation's sugaring and syrup-promoting king.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vermont, where spring comes later, Gov. Howard Dean isn't scheduled to
ceremonially tap a tree until March 13. Vermont produces about a third of the
nation's syrup and its sugarers boiled up 370,000 gallons of the sweet stuff
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Massachusetts' more than 200 sugarers produced about 44,000 gallons of syrup
last year, ninth in the nation. But nearly two-thirds of their syrup is sold
retail directly on the farm and syrup-related tourism has grown into a $16
million to $19 million business, Healy said.
</P>
<P>
	   In hopes of attracting more city folks this spring, country inns and
restaurants are teaming up with sugar houses in a first-time promotion featuring
fancy cooking with Massachusetts maple syrup.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to take maple syrup beyond breakfast,'' said Janice Wentworth, who
runs the Warren Farm with her husband, Dale. ``It's a great natural flavoring
and the chefs have really gotten excited. They've come up with all sorts of new
and old ways to use it in traditional and nouvelle cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
	   That includes maple duck tacos and maple fettuccini, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``March is usually a slow time and this really can bring out people,'' said
Heather Salem, of the Salem Cross Inn in West Brookfield, which has come up with
a maple pumpkin cheesecake with pecan sauce.
</P>
<P>
	   While some sugarers on valley farms are already boiling, most on mountain
farms are still tapping, said J.P. Welch of Worthington, president of the
Massachusetts Maple Sugar Producers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're poised,'' said Russ Davenport of Shelburne, whose trees are still
buried deep in snow. ``All we need is another string of warm, dry days with some
nice afternoon sun and 5-mile-an-hour breeze from the west.''
</P>
<P>
	   For starters. Once it warms up enough to start the sap flowing, sugarers
need a chancy mix of warm days in the 40s and nights with below-freezing
temperatures to keep the trees from budding and prolong the syrup season that,
at most, lasts a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, production was down across most of New England, except for Maine,
as temperatures zipped from too warm in February to too cold in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's too hard to predict,'' said Arthur Berndt, president of Maverick
Sugarbush in Sharon, Vt., the state's largest. ``We don't know what kind of
weather is coming along. The ground is frozen pretty hard, so it might take a
while to get going here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Hank Peterson, secretary of the New Hampshire Maple Producers
Association, was optimistic about this year's run because of last fall's
hurricane-borne heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the old Yankee sayings is: `If the trees go to bed in the fall with
wet feet, we'll have a good year,''' he said.

<HEADLINE> Are GOP Candidates Whistling Dixie?  </HEADLINE>
   By ALLEN G. BREED Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush helped raise funds for a
ball where couples dressed in Civil War garb and danced where slaves once
toiled. Sen. John McCain hired a campaign manager who edits a magazine seen by
critics as a home for racist views.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Republican presidential contenders have come under fire for their ties
to people in what has been called the neo-Confederate movement. Both have sought
to distance themselves from the controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   But the issue is still simmering as they approach Tuesday's primary in
Virginia, home of the Civil War rebel capital and of Appomattox Courthouse, site
of the South's surrender.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A president must be president to all the people,'' Ralph Neas, head of
People for the American Way, wrote to McCain last week in demanding he fire
South Carolina campaign aide Richard Quinn. Quinn is editor-in-chief of Southern
Partisan magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   Neas' liberal advocacy group cited commentaries by Quinn, including one in
1983 in which he wrote that ex-slaves who stayed South near their former masters
``found for themselves a life altogether more satisfying than their cousins who
ended up sleeping with rats in Harlem. ...''
</P>
<P>
	   In another column, published in 1993, Quinn argued against a Martin Luther
King Jr. holiday, saying his ``role in history was to lead his people into a
perpetual dependence on the welfare state, a terrible bondage of body and
soul.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``To tie your campaign for the highest office in the land to such views
would give them a legitimacy that is very troubling,'' Neas wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Southern Exposure, the journal of the Institute for Southern
Studies, a civil rights think tank in Durham, N.C., criticized Bush for writing
letters in 1996 on behalf of Richmond's Museum of the Confederacy, the Sons of
Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
	   The journal questioned Bush's fund-raising effort on behalf of the museum's
annual ball, which is held in a flag-festooned foundry building where slaves
produced armaments for the Southern army.
</P>
<P>
	   John Shelton Reed, a sociologist at the Center for the Study of the American
South at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, suggested both
candidates -- and the organizations in question -- were being tarred with too
broad a brush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You could say if this were being done to associations on the left, it
would be called McCarthyism,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
	   On another, more prominent issue, both Bush and McCain said it was up to
South Carolina residents to decide whether the Confederate flag should keep
flying above their Statehouse -- a position some critics have interpreted as
evidence of neo-Confederate sympathies.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said this month he was surprised to be shown documents indicating his
ancestors owned slaves on their plantation in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain defended Quinn, though he said he was unfamiliar with Southern
Partisan magazine. The Bush campaign jumped on the situation, calling Quinn's
writings offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush's people defended his letters on behalf of Confederate-related
groups as standard practice for governors nationwide. They said he also has
written letters for dozens of black organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Noted Civil War historian James McPherson said Bush should not be ashamed to
have supported the Museum of the Confederacy, whose home is the so-called
``White House of the Confederacy.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Museum of the Confederacy is a highly professional and valuable museum
and research institution,'' said McPherson, who teaches at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Robin Reed, the museum's executive director, has come to
expect this sort of controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``History's being used as a battering ram for political debate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But McPherson thinks people are right to consider a candidate's stance on
the Confederate flag and related issues as relevant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One's stance on the flag, I think, does reflect some degree of commitment
for civil rights -- or lack of commitment,'' he said. ``It's come to mean
that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Governmental Studies at the
University of Virginia, said the neo-Confederate issue might prompt blacks to
turn out in slightly higher numbers Tuesday. But he also said black
participation in the Virginia's GOP primaries is historically very small.
</P>
<P>
	   Let people have the information, he said. ``It's hardly a mortal sin; barely
a venial one.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Reed agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed, who has contributed articles to Southern Partisan, thinks McCain
should have cut Quinn loose. And although he doesn't accept that recognizing
these Confederate groups is a bad thing, he acknowledges that Bush might have
been better served if his aides had told him to put up his pen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he's happy being governor of Texas it's probably OK -- politically
speaking,'' Reed said. ``Now morally, it comes down to a judgment call. ... I
don't have a problem with this. Other people plainly do.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Takes Delegates From Islands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush swept presidential contests in four
U.S. territories over the weekend, walking away with more than two dozen
Republican delegates to the national convention.
</P>
<P>
	   The victories increased the delegate total for Bush to 93 and narrowed the
gap between him and John McCain, who has 96. A candidate needs 1,034 delegates
to win the Republican nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush easily defeated McCain during Sunday's primary in Puerto Rico to win
all 14 delegates from the island. He also swept caucuses held a day earlier in
Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands, each of which had four delegates at
stake.
</P>
<P>
	   In Puerto Rico, with 99 percent of the polling stations reporting, Bush
received 89,448 votes, or 93 percent, and McCain had 5,647 votes, or about 6
percent. Former ambassador Alan Keyes and publisher Steve Forbes, who dropped
out of the GOP race earlier this month, each received less than 1 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush picked up additional delegates, he cannot count on getting their
votes in November if he wins the nomination. That's because residents of U.S.
territories cannot vote in the general election, even though they may
participate in presidential primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Bush supporters called the victories significant, particularly after
a pair of losses in primaries held in Arizona and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a tremendous triumph not only for Puerto Rico, but on the national
level because it is the first group of Hispanic voters that has voted solidly
with Governor Bush,'' said Jose Fuentes Agostini, the island's former Attorney
General and co-chair of Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   During Saturday's contests, there was a motion to split Guam's four
delegates between Bush and McCain, but a binding motion to support only Bush
prevailed, said Fred Castro, the national committeeman-elect.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Virgin Islands, Republicans met on the Caribbean islands of St.
Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, said the territory's GOP committeeman, Holland
Redfield II. He refused to give a breakdown of how participants voted during the
closed assemblies.

<HEADLINE> Candidates on Medical Accounts  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press picks an issue and asks the
presidential candidates a question about it. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Medical Savings Accounts
</P>
<P>
	   Should the government let anyone set aside money in a tax-free medical
savings account to help pay for their health care?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``I have made quality, affordable, accessible health insurance
for all Americans a top priority in my campaign for president. Medical savings
accounts fragment the risk pool and are the exact opposite of the purpose of
insurance -- that is, to spread the risk as broadly as possible. Health care is
a shared responsibility, which in part means that we all pay in for the day when
we have to draw upon our insurance. Medical savings accounts mean wealthier
people can opt out of the risk pool, leaving a smaller pool of poorer people who
would face higher premiums. That is inconsistent with my plans for health
care.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``I am opposed to Republican proposals to broaden medical savings
accounts. These proposals have the potential to segment healthy populations from
the sick in the insurance market and therefore leave sicker populations with
higher health care costs. We already have some demonstrations on MSAs today and
should wait and see what kind of impact they have on the insurance market
forward considering a full blown proposal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``I want a health care system that is patient-driven, not
government-run, that leaves medical decisions in the hands of physicians instead
of insurance companies, that encourages research and innovation, and that offers
more and better choices to consumers. I believe every American should have
access to quality, affordable health care by giving consumers better information
about health care plans, providing more choices such as medical savings accounts
and changing tax laws to help more people, such as the uninsured and the
self-employed, afford health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``My tax plan immediately expands and strengthens MSAs. The
plan expands eligibility for MSAs to all Americans who have a high-deductible
health insurance plan. It eliminates the requirement that insurance coverage be
paid for by the employer. In addition, the plan lowers the minimum deductible in
the required insurance plan to $1,000 for singles and $2,000 for families and it
allows taxpayers an MSA tax deduction before taking standard or itemized
deductions. The proposal eliminates the cap on the number of MSAs permitted by
law and makes them permanent. It helps the millions of American families who do
not have long-term care insurance and are particularly vulnerable to the
enormous expenses of long-term health care.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Plans Assault on Robertson  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the Republican presidential campaign headed to a
crucial sprint, John McCain plans to sharpen his assault on religious
conservatives linked to rival George W. Bush, suggesting they are no better than
``union bosses'' seeking to perpetuate their power.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was headed to Virginia Beach, Va., home of televangelist Pat
Robertson, where aides said he planned a stinging critique of Robertson and his
ties to the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said the Arizona senator would make the case that, in defending Bush
and attacking McCain, Robertson was putting personal political ambition ahead of
conservative causes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The union bosses who have subordinated the interests of working families
to their own ambitions -- to their desire to preserve their own political power
at all costs -- are mirror images of Pat Robertson,'' said an early draft of
McCain's remarks, provided to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech, McCain offers GOP leaders a blunt choice, declaring: ``I
don't believe it's logical to suggest the Republican establishment is more
important than to save the Republican majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides compared the attack to a 1992 move by President Clinton
criticizing rap singer Sister Solja, a move where Clinton cast himself as a
moderate.
</P>
<P>
	   Word of the speech came as McCain and Bush squabbled over campaign debates,
while Bush was on the defensive about his relations with Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
	   A high-profile showdown in California seemed threatened when McCain said he
wouldn't appear at Thursday's scheduled debate in Los Angeles. His aides said
Bush dallied in committing to the event, which caused scheduling problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush hotly denied that, and McCain might lose a big platform he needs in a
state crucial to his hopes.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate, sponsored by CNN and the Los Angeles Times, comes just days
before that giant state's primary March 7. Bush demanded an explanation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's going to have to explain why he's not going to this debate,'' said
Bush, who blamed McCain for pulling out of the debate. ``I was led to believe
earlier this week that everybody had accepted.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to let George Bush dictate our schedule,'' countered
McCain spokesman Todd Harris.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior McCain aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, dismissed any
suggestions that the senator was easing his commitment to California.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has scheduled six campaign days in the state before the primary, and
is running $3 million in television commercials in the state, the aides said.
Officials are considering adding another day to that effort.
</P>
<P>
	   The California situation is the opposite from earlier in the campaign, when
McCain repeatedly attacked Bush for ducking debates.
</P>
<P>
	   Some aides warned that McCain's upcoming trip to California, which ends
hours before the debate, will be dominated by questions about skipping the
event, and that it would give Bush an excuse to duck future face-offs.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's aides said Bush had initially turned down the California debate,
then changed his mind only after McCain had assembled an intense campaign
schedule in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was having none of McCain's explanation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very important primary state and a state that's going to have a
lot to say about who the next president is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain did not address the issue in public appearances Sunday, but Harris
dismissed Bush's sudden focus on campaign debates. ``They lose a couple of
primaries and all of a sudden they're born-again debaters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Sunday, Bush was on the defensive about a visit he paid to Bob Jones
University in South Carolina before that state's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor, leader of New York's 2.4 million
Catholics, Bush said he should have been ``more clear'' in his speech ``in
disassociating myself from anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice. It was
a missed opportunity, causing needless offense, which I deeply regret.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics have argued that the school takes harshly anti-Catholic views, and
bans interracial dating, and they have attacked Bush for not speaking out
against those practices during his appearance at the school.
</P>
<P>
	   In his letter, which his campaign released, Bush stated his ``profound
respect'' for the Roman Catholic Church and said the criticism of him is unfair
and unfounded.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Boxing Officials Like Chances  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.-
AP Boxing Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) -- With a team of 12 boxers who have international
tournament experience and were toughened in the Olympic trials and box-offs,
officials and coaches are feeling good about them qualifying for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
	`Twelve guys are going to Sydney, I believe that,'' head coach Tom Mustin said
after the U.S. Olympic team was determined in the box-offs Thursday through
Saturday at Foxwoods Casino.
</P>
<P>
	Those 12 boxers now must compete with boxers from North, South and Central
America and the Caribbean for 54 spots in the Olympic tournament at Sydney in
September.
</P>
<P>
	Many of the box-offs between Olympic trials champions and winners of the
losers' bracket in that double-elimination tournament were hotly contested.
</P>
<P>
	``In three days, you got to see the best boxers in the United States and I
believe some of the best boxers in the world,'' said Gary Toney, president of
USA Boxing.
</P>
<P>
	There are four world champions on the team -- Brian Viloria of Waipahu, Hawaii,
106 pounds; Ricardo Juarez of Houston, 125; Michael Simms Jr. of Sacramento,
Calif., 178; and Michael Bennett of Chicago, 201.
</P>
<P>
	Mustin noted that since the 1996 Olympics, which U.S. boxers won one gold and
five bronze medals, ``we've sent boxers to more tournaments. It gives them the
feel of having to win more than once and how to box against different styles.''
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. goal now is to qualify all the boxers in the first of three Americas
qualifying tournaments at Tampa, Fla., March 27-April 1. There, the 20 boxers to
reach the finals in 10 weight classes from 106 to 178 and the winners of the
heavyweight and super heavyweight classes will go to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	Those who don't qualify in Tampa will get another chance April 27-22 at Mexico
City, where 22 more boxers will earn trips to Sydney. The final 10 Olympians
from the Americas will be the 10 winners of the weight classes from 106 through
178 in competition May 23-28 at Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
	As the world's No. 1 team, Cuba is exempt from qualifying.
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. team members are Jose Navarro of Los Angeles, 112; Clarence
Vinson of Washington, D.C., 119; Marshall Martinez of Vista, Calif., 132;
Ricardo Williams Jr. of Cincinnati, 139; Dante Craig of Cincinnati, 147; Jermain
Taylor of Little Rock, Ark., 156; Jeff Lacy of St. Petersburg, Fla., 165; and
Calvin Brock of Charlotte, N.C., super heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have three weeks of training camp getting ready for the Americas,''
Mustin said. ``We have a lot of work to do, working on keeping hands up, staying
of the corner, staying off the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
	Mustin also said there would computer scoring of sparring sessions so that the
boxers would be able to see what blows count and to work at getting credit for
punches.
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympics are the big one,'' said Mustin, who turned 54 on Sunday. He was
head coach for the 1993 and 1999 world championship teams and the 1991 and 1995
Pan American Games squads. He is an assistant manager of packaging for the
Tacoma News Tribune.
</P>
<P>
	Assisting Mustin will be 46-year-old Israel Acosta of Milwaukee and 45-
year-old Candelario Lopez of San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	Israel Acosta, who works for the Housing Authority for the City of Milwaukee
was an assistant coach for 1999 world championships team. He was an elite
amateur boxers for 12 years and U.S. champion in 1977. His record was 340-16.
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, a police sergeant, was an assistant coach for the 1999 Pan Am Games
team.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Dreams Born, Die in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Anne Marie Lauck saw an Olympic dream born as her own
was dying.
</P>
<P>
	Leading Saturday's marathon trials for nearly 17 miles, Lauck was starting to
think she might hang on for her second straight Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
	But just past the 20-mile mark, little-known Christine Clark pulled alongside,
looking fresher and stronger down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	``She took off and I said, `There's goes our team,''' Lauck said.
</P>
<P>
	Clark's surprising 2-hour, 33-minute, 31-second trip -- the Anchorage
pathologist had never run faster than 2:40 before -- made her America's lone
marathon representative for the Sydney Games in September.
</P>
<P>
	She could not better the Olympic standard of 2:33. Because of USA Track and
Field rules, America will send a one-woman team for the first time in five
Olympiads.
</P>
<P>
	``When you're growing up, you always dream about a moment like this,'' Clark
said. ``But to actually accomplish it, that's so unfathomable to me.''
</P>
<P>
	Only Libbie Hickman and Kristy Johnston reached the Games ``A'' standard before
the trials. But Hickman finished 6 minutes behind in eighth on a humid Southern
day where temperatures on the street hit 80 degrees. Johnston was runner-up,
almost 2 minutes in back.
</P>
<P>
	Had Clark broken 2:33 and no else dipped under that time, then Johnston and
Hickman also would have gotten tickets to Sydney. Had the top three finishers
gone faster than 2:33, all would have gone.
</P>
<P>
	The weather was the determining factor. The sweltering conditions slowed the
170-woman field -- 141 finished -- and very few ran personal bests.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed about not making the team,'' Johnston, the fifth-place
finisher in 1996, said after running 2:35:36. ``It's very hard. I will try and
fight some of the rules, but do it in a positive way so I don't take anything
away from the first-place finisher. I don't know if that means going to the IAAF
...''
</P>
<P>
	Lauck held on for third, collapsing as she crossed the finish line from the
brutal pace she set for nearly two-thirds of the race. She was given fluids and
appeared chipper and smiling at a postrace awards ceremony a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
	Walter Hickman, Libbie's husband, spoke for his disappointed wife, who ran
2:39:57.
</P>
<P>
	``The last six miles were like a death march for her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Craig Mossback, executive director of USATF, defended the choice of Columbia as
the site, saying that in February the city's weather usually approximates the
conditions the marathoners would be expected to face at Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
	``Eighty-six degrees turned out to be about 25 degrees warmer than you'll
probably get in Sydney,'' Mossback said..
</P>
<P>
	``The story of the race is that a woman ran 7 minutes faster than her personal
best. Today, it was extremely fair and it was extremely unfair.''
</P>
<P>
	Clark came into the race the 22nd-fastest qualifier and let Lauck, 10th-place
finisher at the 1996 Olympics, set the pace through the first 20 miles. Once in
the lead, like unknown winner Jenny Spangler four years ago, Clark pushed to the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
	Joan Benoit Samuelson, 42, the American record-holder at 2:21:21 and 1984
Olympic gold medalist, placed ninth at 2:39:59, her best finish in six years.
</P>
<P>
	Many runners wore red, white and blue ribbons on their race singlets in protest
of the Confederate flag atop the Statehouse, but no problems relating to that
situation were reported.

<HEADLINE> Wind Not at the America's Cup  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Everyone's talking about the weather at the
America's Cup. As usual, there's nothing anyone can do about it.
</P>
<P>
	Sailing's biggest extravaganza has lost its steam. Not on the waterfront, where
tens of thousands of fans turn out to send off the racing yachts in the morning
and the bars remain packed long into the night.
</P>
<P>
	Out on the water, it's another story. In the last 10 days, three races have
been postponed because the wind hasn't blown with enough gusto to push the
75-foot sailboats around the course on the fluky, flaky Hauraki Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	That, coupled with four lay days built into the schedule dictated by TV rights
holders, and the momentum seem shot. Team New Zealand's speedy Black Magic has
routed Italy's Luna Rossa in the three races that have gone off, and a 5-0 sweep
seems imminent -- whenever they can squeeze in the next two races needed to keep
the America's Cup in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
	Race 4 in the best-of-9 series had to be abandoned Sunday, and the forecast for
Tuesday doesn't look good.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to Fiji for five days and I'll be back for Race 4 on Sunday,''
joked eliminated American skipper Paul Cayard.
</P>
<P>
	He might not be far off the mark.
</P>
<P>
	Because of a high pressure system that's parked itself over Auckland, this may
be the America's Cup that never ends.
</P>
<P>
	``The centers are close to us so we have breeze to the north and the south, and
not much here,'' said Bob Rice, the New Englander who works as chief
meteorologist for Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
	Even without the high pressure, the wind in Auckland, the self-described ``City
of Sails,'' is an interesting phenomenon. In what's called the ``Battle of the
Breezes,'' the southwesterlies coming off the Tasman Sea and the northeasterlies
off the Pacific try to dominate each other over the Hauraki Gulf. If they cancel
each other out, they also kill the racing.
</P>
<P>
	``It's entirely logical,'' Rice said Monday. ``The idea of some sort of evil
spirit living on the Hauraki Gulf ... it's just weather doing weather things.
When you have all this water and land terrain and so forth, you have things like
this going on. It's perfectly natural.
</P>
<P>
	``It's like if you put Los Angeles 10 miles over from New York. Both of them
have their own regime.''
</P>
<P>
	The tame winds have even whipped up controversy. Race committee chairman Harold
Bennett was accused of favoring the Kiwis when he abandoned Race 3 on Thursday,
saying the light wind was too shifty toward the top of the course. The Italians,
whose boat is believed to be strong in light air, wanted to race so badly that
they cruised up and down in the starting area with sails hoisted.
</P>
<P>
	Bennett dismissed the suggestions that his decisions to abandon races have been
influenced by Team New Zealand, calling them ``slurs on my integrity.''
</P>
<P>
	Bennett did admit that he'll probably have more gray hairs by the time this
thing finally ends.
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, it's pretty unsettling for everyone involved, not just the crews, but
us,'' he said. ``It's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
	Even Black Magic tactician Brad Butterworth agreed with one of the criticisms
of sailing.
</P>
<P>
	``Light days are pretty much like you see it on TV -- it's like watching the
grass grow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Said Kiwi grinder Craig Monk: ``The final 60 minutes before a race can be
called off is the worst. That hour always feels like six hours.''
</P>
<P>
	Event organizer Tony Thomas said the finals couldn't have started much earlier
because they were preceded by the four-month challenger elimination series,
capped with Luna Rossa's dramatic win over AmericaOne.
</P>
<P>
	What's been griping to some is that there has been plenty of wind on some lay
days, the days off built into the schedule.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clarke Beats Tiger at Match Play  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM DAHLBERG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Darren Clarke hardly seemed the type to be at La
Costa playing Tiger Woods for $1 million. Overweight and underhyped, smoking a
cigar between shots, he looked more like he belonged on a stool in the
neighborhood pub.
</P>
<P>
	   Only the night before, he had to be told his Match Play Championship final
against Woods was 36 holes, not 18 as he had thought.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet there he was on Sunday, chugging down the fairway after another
perfectly placed tee shot. There he was, keeping the pressure on Woods with iron
shots snuggled close to the pins.
</P>
<P>
	   And there he was, accepting a handshake from Woods on the 33rd hole of the
day after doing what everyone else failed to do all week -- beat the world's
best player in the format he plays best.
</P>
<P>
	   "He did to Tiger Woods what Tiger Woods does to everybody else," swing guru
Butch Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The most unlikely looking challenger to Woods might have been the one least
intimidated by the best golfer in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Clarke keeping the pressure on Woods, who could do little as Clarke
made four birdies in five holes during the front nine of the afternoon round to
turn an even match into a rout.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, Woods sputtered when he tried to mount one of his famous
comebacks, and Clarke became the first full-time European Tour player to win on
U.S. soil since Lee Westwood won in New Orleans in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Darren just flat outplayed me," Woods said. "He played beautifully."
</P>
<P>
	   The fans who turned out for what they thought would be another Woods'
coronation at La Costa found that out early.
</P>
<P>
	   Even when Woods nearly aced the par-3 third hole to go up quickly, Clarke
never seemed intimidated. He came out with five front-nine birdies to start the
morning match and missed only one fairway all day.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, meanwhile, was making mistakes he didn't make all week. Staying even
after the first 18, he played only 1-under the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   "To play as well as that under the circumstances today, against the best
player in the world, is certainly very gratifying," Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke came into the tournament ranked 19th in the world, and he spent much
of the winter working hard on his game under the tutelage of Harmon, who has
coached Woods since he was 16.
</P>
<P>
	   The week before, both players worked with Harmon in Las Vegas. Before
Sunday's final, Harmon was on the practice range working on Woods' swing when
Clarke yelled over to him.
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't bother coming over here, I'm hitting it perfect," he told Harmon.
</P>
<P>
	   The remark was half in jest, but Clarke had it right. He drilled his drives
down the middle of the fairway and put his irons close. When he needed to make
big putts, he drained them.
</P>
<P>
	   He was playing so well, he skipped the driving range, where Woods spent the
45 minutes between rounds. He went up to the clubhouse instead and had a nice
lunch.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was too tired," Harmon said. "He didn't want to go to the range because
he would have had to walk back up that hill again."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, meanwhile, couldn't find the swing he wanted. He misfired while
trying to get back in the match, leaving a sand shot in the bunker on No. 12,
and Clarke finally closed him out with a two-putt par on the 15th hole.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just trying to find my golf swing," Woods said. "I did a lot of it
with smoke and mirrors today, with a lot of my hands and timing it well, and
made a lot of putts in the morning just to keep myself in the ballgame."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the two were even until Clarke rolled in a birdie putt on No. 4 in
the afternoon round, the beginning of a Tiger-like run of four birdies in five
holes that put him 4-up as he walked off the eighth green.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke, though, figured Woods had one more run left in him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was expecting Tiger to do a couple of special things and have a go at
me," he said. "I wasn't relaxing any."
</P>
<P>
	   He won't be doing much relaxing in the near future, either. Clarke was
headed to play in the Dubai Desert Classic, and promised Harmon that he would
also dust off the gym equipment in his garage to take off some pounds added over
the winter.
</P>
<P>
	   The added pounds don't come close to the added confidence of beating the top
64 players in the world after a nine-year career that included only five
European tour wins.
</P>
<P>
	   "Confidence-wise, this will be the greatest thing that ever happened to
him," Harmon said. "I saw a Darren Clarke I've never seen before. I knew he was
capable of it. I just never saw him put it together."
</P>
<P>
	   The tournament was sponsored by Andersen Consulting.

<HEADLINE> Jim Carter Wins Tucson Open  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The biggest obstacle Jim Carter had to clear was self
doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, who made his debut on the PGA Tour in 1987 and then went 291
tournaments without a victory, ended the string Sunday when he won the Tucson
Open by making up four shots on third-round leader Tom Scherrer.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, his face streaked with tears, he talked about life as a non-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   "All the players are a great support for each other, but they are kind of
out there beating your brains out. There's no guarantee that you ever get to sit
up here and take home some hardware, so there's tons of doubt," Carter said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he hit a low point a week ago when he played well, but still missed
the cut in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was like, 'Geez, I don't know if I can do it -- maybe it's not supposed
to be for me,"' said Carter, who closed with a 6-under-par 66 that left him two
shots ahead of Scherrer, Chris DiMarco and Jean Van de Velde.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of quitting, he gave himself a pep talk on the way to Tucson
National, where the former Arizona State golfer won a college tournament in
1984. The previous year, he was the NCAA medalist.
</P>
<P>
	   It was his best result as a pro -- the $540,000 winner's share is about
$80,000 more than Carter earned last year, his best season, and shot him to
sixth on the money list with $580,763.
</P>
<P>
	   His best finish until this event was third four times -- in 1989, 1995, 1996
and 1998 -- and he hadn't had a top 10 finish since last June.
</P>
<P>
	   The field was diluted by the absence of the top stars who played in the
Match Play Championship, but Carter didn't back in. His 19-under 269 matched
David Duval's winning score of two years ago -- the lowest in four years since
the tournament abandoned a two-course format and settled on Tucson National.
</P>
<P>
	   He also beat players of the caliber of Van de Velde, last year's runner-up
at the British Open, and 1996 U.S. Open winner Steve Jones, who bogeyed the last
hole and wound up tied with Rick Fehr for fifth at 272.
</P>
<P>
	   First-round leader Steve Lowery, Woody Austin, Steve Flesch and Kirk
Triplett, who won his first title last week in Los Angeles, were grouped at 273,
with Kevin Sutherland and Ted Purdy at 274.
</P>
<P>
	   Rookie Casey Martin, who has a circulatory disease in his right leg and is,
by court, order, allowed to ride a cart on tour, had his best performance in
five starts. Martin finished with a 71 for a 276 total, and tied seven other
players for 17th.
</P>
<P>
	   Scherrer bogeyed two of the first four holes, but made his second birdie of
the round on the ninth hole and reached 18-under with another birdie on No. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   That was as far as his clubs would take him, and all it did was get him
within one stroke of Carter, who opened a 2-shot lead when he rolled in a 3-foot
birdie putt on the 11th hole.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone was going to make a run," said Scherrer, who finished with a 72
after three bogeys. He had one in the first three rounds. "I didn't know who it
would be, and it turned out to be Jim. That was a great round of golf he had
today. I knew someone would do it, and I just didn't quite keep pace."
</P>
<P>
	   Carter birdied the first three holes, starting with a 45-foot putt from the
fringe on No. 1, and got to 17-under on the eighth hole with another difficult
birdie -- a chip from 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right away, those thoughts jump in your head," he said. "And then you have
to slap yourself around because you can't think like that. I've done that before
-- get all excited -- and it just turns into a mess, so I did a very good job of
keeping my mind empty."

<HEADLINE> Here's Sammy: Sosa Late But in Camp  </HEADLINE>
    By RICK GANO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Late-arriving star player and strong-willed, no-nonsense
manager met for the first time this spring. Hugged, in fact. Even posed for a
picture.
</P>
<P>
	   Sammy Sosa and Don Baylor were lobbing compliments at each other like
batting practice fastballs Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sosa, with 129 homers over the last two seasons, will gladly steal more
bases if that's what Baylor wants and the Chicago Cubs need.
</P>
<P>
	   Baylor's initial response to Sosa's being more than a week behind the rest
of the position players was: ``It's a big deal.'' But he softened that stance
Sunday, saying he wasn't upset and that he gave Sosa permission to report two
days after the Feb. 25 deadline because of the flu.
</P>
<P>
	   They both predicted they will get along just fine. Of course, it's still
February.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You hit 66 homers and I don't think you will have any problems with the
guy,'' Baylor said. ``I think we are both after the same thing. That's why I
feel there will not be a problem with a guy who plays every day. And the
magnitude of Sammy Sosa, I'm not getting in the way of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   And Sosa said he would not have any problems with Baylor, whom he called a
``tough guy.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993 and 1995, a slimmer Sammy was a 30-steal, 30-homer man with the
Cubs. But then he weighed 198. Now he's up to 230.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Remember, I'm a slugger,'' Sosa said, predicting he can still steal 30
bases, despite the bulk added for power.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever Baylor asks, Sosa said he will try to provide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a guy who knows how to deal with superstars and I'm willing to come
here and do everything he wants me to do,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm an employee like everybody else and I'm willing to sacrifice myself to
go out there and win the game.''
</P>
<P>
	   Baylor said he and Sosa exchanged pleasantries throughout the day and would
sit down later and talk. He's said since taking the job he wants Sosa to be a
more all-around player.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll have our conversation about what I expect. I think he understands
after all the running we are doing. I want him to hit third in our lineup, be
very productive and take a few more chances,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are going to be a lot of guys given the green light to steal a bag
and he will be one of those guys. I'm not stupid either in making him do some
things he's not comfortable in doing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Through the course of the season, I believe he will be a little more
comfortable with what we are trying to accomplish -- take the extra base, move
runners up. He's a smart player.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sosa took part in just about everything his first day. He hit against real
pitchers Matt Karchner and Rodney Myers and broke three bats. In another session
of batting practice against pitching coordinator Lester Strode, he hit 13 homers
in 31 swings.
</P>
<P>
	   But when it came to doing 10 wind sprints at the end, Sosa had to beg off on
one in the middle to catch his breath. He's in pretty good shape, he said, but
not that good.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was a little tired on the first day. I'm not going to lie to you,'' Sosa
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sosa pronounced himself healthy and offered assurances he's ``still hungry''
after two straight years of 60-plus homers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a new millennium and a new year and I can't sit down and relax
because I had two great years,'' Sosa said,
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel like a rookie. I'm never satisfied and I always want to go to the
next level. This is the year I have to go out and put everything together. We
have new coaches, new faces and a new manager.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sosa also said he is not worried about a new contract after his current
four-year, $42.5 million deal expires in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied a report that he might seek $160 million in a new deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I play great, I'll never have a problem going out there and getting a
good contract,'' Sosa said. ``I need to take care of business first and then the
money will be there.'' Notes: 3B Willie Greene became ill during Sunday's
conditioning exercises, was carted off the field and taken to a hospital because
of dehydration. Greene missed the first week of spring training because of
illness in his family.

<HEADLINE> Indians Finley Ready For October  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM WITHERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- Chuck Finley has never had a better chance to win
a World Series ring. And now that they've got Finley, neither have the Cleveland
Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   Not long ago, Finley was in awe of the Indians. Hated playing them.
</P>
<P>
	   From Anaheim's dugout, he'd look across and wonder how Cleveland ever lost.
All-Stars up and down the bench, and always a .300 hitter at the plate, at least
that's how it seemed to Finley.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Finley, couldn't understand why the Indians couldn't win another
Series title.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You'd look at them,'' Finley said. ``And go, `Dang, the defense is great.
The pitching is strong. The hitting is obviously there. But you talk to guys
here and they say, `We don't pitch so well sometimes and we kick it (the ball)
around a little bit.' And I'd say, 'What?' Whenever we play you guys it's
7-2.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Now that he's with the Indians, Finley will be on the winning end of those
7-2 games. And now, for the first time in 14 frustrating years, he's with a
legitimate championship contender.
</P>
<P>
	   Of all the reasons the Indians coveted Finley -- he's left-handed, pitches
200-plus innings a year and owns the New York Yankees -- one is paramount.
</P>
<P>
	   They want to win a World Series. Now.
</P>
<P>
	   And so does Finley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very important to me,'' he said. ``I imagine it's frustrating to
them, too. They've been knocking on the door. It's kind of a similar situation.
Their frustration is parallel to mine.''
</P>
<P>
	   After nearly trading for Finley last July, Cleveland signed him to a
three-year, $27 million contract in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians couldn't wait any longer to get a frontline starter. Winning
five straight AL Central titles and two AL pennants since 1995 doesn't cut it in
Cleveland anymore. A first Series title since 1948 is the only thing left.
</P>
<P>
	   And Finley could be the missing piece.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know about the puzzle, but he fits,'' Indians manager Charlie
Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 37-year-old Finley is Cleveland's first regular left-handed starter
since Greg Swindell in 1991. He'll be slotted as the No. 2 starter behind
Bartolo Colon and ahead of Charles Nagy, Dave Burba and Jaret Wright -- all
righties.
</P>
<P>
	   Finely knows the pressure is on. But if handling a little heat is all he has
to do to win a World Series ring, well, then bring it on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know they went out and said, 'Hey, we want you here.' So I know there
are certain responsibilities with the commitment, and I don't want to say
pressure, but obligation,'' he said. ``I'm ready for it. I've been waiting for
this chance my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Distracted by trade rumors, Finley went 12-11 with a 4.43 ERA last year, but
only after going 7-1 in the final two months, including 4-0 in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Finley was in the final year of his contract with the Angels, with whom he
began his career in 1986 and for whom he won 165 games pitching for some bad
teams. He wanted to stay with the club and decided to represent himself while
trying to negotiate a deal to finish his playing days in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the dealings off the field hurt him on the mound.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had a stretch of five starts there where I probably would have been
released from A-ball,'' he said. ``I was getting hammered. I had the trade thing
going on.''
</P>
<P>
	   But once the deadline passed, Finley was his old self. He said the decision
to leave Anaheim was difficult, but one he had to make if he wanted a shot at
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was time for me to move on,'' he said. ``I didn't have five more years
to wait around for it to come around.''
</P>
<P>
	   Now he feels like a rookie again. Finley looks around the Indians' clubhouse
and smiles knowing he won't have to face Manny Ramirez and Jim Thome. He'll
never have to worry about Kenny Lofton leading too far off first. And every time
he pitches, he'll have Roberto Alomar and Omar Vizquel behind him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're two vacuum cleaners out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Then there's the Yankees. They have won the World Series three of the last
four years. Finley's career record against them is 16-9.
</P>
<P>
	   But it hasn't come easily. When facing the Yankees, he describes his state
of mind this way: ``scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
	   With the Indians, that all changes. Finley doesn't have to be afraid
anymore.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Dreams Born, Die in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Anne Marie Lauck saw an Olympic dream born as her own
was dying.
</P>
<P>
	Leading Saturday's marathon trials for nearly 17 miles, Lauck was starting to
think she might hang on for her second straight Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
	But just past the 20-mile mark, little-known Christine Clark pulled alongside,
looking fresher and stronger down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	``She took off and I said, `There's goes our team,''' Lauck said.
</P>
<P>
	Clark's surprising 2-hour, 33-minute, 31-second trip -- the Anchorage
pathologist had never run faster than 2:40 before -- made her America's lone
marathon representative for the Sydney Games in September.
</P>
<P>
	She could not better the Olympic standard of 2:33. Because of USA Track and
Field rules, America will send a one-woman team for the first time in five
Olympiads.
</P>
<P>
	``When you're growing up, you always dream about a moment like this,'' Clark
said. ``But to actually accomplish it, that's so unfathomable to me.''
</P>
<P>
	Only Libbie Hickman and Kristy Johnston reached the Games ``A'' standard before
the trials. But Hickman finished 6 minutes behind in eighth on a humid Southern
day where temperatures on the street hit 80 degrees. Johnston was runner-up,
almost 2 minutes in back.
</P>
<P>
	Had Clark broken 2:33 and no else dipped under that time, then Johnston and
Hickman also would have gotten tickets to Sydney. Had the top three finishers
gone faster than 2:33, all would have gone.
</P>
<P>
	The weather was the determining factor. The sweltering conditions slowed the
170-woman field -- 141 finished -- and very few ran personal bests.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed about not making the team,'' Johnston, the fifth-place
finisher in 1996, said after running 2:35:36. ``It's very hard. I will try and
fight some of the rules, but do it in a positive way so I don't take anything
away from the first-place finisher. I don't know if that means going to the IAAF
...''
</P>
<P>
	Lauck held on for third, collapsing as she crossed the finish line from the
brutal pace she set for nearly two-thirds of the race. She was given fluids and
appeared chipper and smiling at a postrace awards ceremony a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
	Walter Hickman, Libbie's husband, spoke for his disappointed wife, who ran
2:39:57.
</P>
<P>
	``The last six miles were like a death march for her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Craig Masback, chief executive officer of USATF, defended the choice of
Columbia as the site, saying that in February the city's weather usually
approximates the conditions the marathoners would be expected to face at Sydney
in September.
</P>
<P>
	``Eighty-six degrees turned out to be about 25 degrees warmer than you'll
probably get in Sydney,'' Masback said..
</P>
<P>
	``The story of the race is that a woman ran 7 minutes faster than her personal
best. Today, it was extremely fair and it was extremely unfair.''
</P>
<P>
	Clark came into the race the 22nd-fastest qualifier and let Lauck, 10th-place
finisher at the 1996 Olympics, set the pace through the first 20 miles. Once in
the lead, like unknown winner Jenny Spangler four years ago, Clark pushed to the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
	Joan Benoit Samuelson, 42, the American record-holder at 2:21:21 and 1984
Olympic gold medalist, placed ninth at 2:39:59, her best finish in six years.
</P>
<P>
	Many runners wore red, white and blue ribbons on their race singlets in protest
of the Confederate flag atop the Statehouse, but no problems relating to that
situation were reported.

Northwest voters can send a message across the nation during Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>

	   ``This is the first step of the Washington two-step. If we do well on
Tuesday, then we do well in the caucuses,'' Bradley told more than 300
supporters crammed into a middle-school auditorium in Vancouver, located across
the Columbia River from Portland, Ore. ``Then we beat the establishment
powers!''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has been campaigning in Washington state since last Wednesday in
hopes of winning the state's ``beauty contest'' presidential primary on Tuesday.
But no delegates will be awarded Tuesday; they will be apportioned based on
party caucuses one week later.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley planned two last events in Seattle today -- greeting ferry commuters
and attending a rally at the University of Washington -- before heading off to
California, which is the big prize in next week's ``Super Tuesday'' battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, meanwhile, campaigned Sunday at Seattle's Franklin High School and
later talked to local families in Redmond, Wash., on the issue of pipeline
safety -- something Bradley addressed in two bills in the Senate and campaigned
on here last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people were killed last June when a pipeline leak turned into a
massive fireball in Bellingham, Wash. The same pipeline runs through Redmond.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as he stepped off Air Force Two in Denver late Sunday night, Gore hit
all the local 10 o'clock TV news broadcasts with a round robin of live
interviews from the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know why the other candidates have been ignoring Colorado,'' which
has 51 Democratic delegates up for grabs in its March 10 primary, Gore told
KMGH-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   But even as Gore campaigned in Colorado, he was keeping an eye over his
shoulder at Washington state. He was phoning in drive-time interviews to five
Seattle radio stations this morning before heading out to rallies in Denver and
Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley picked up newspaper endorsements Sunday from The Hartford Courant
and The Maine Sunday Telegram. Gore, who was heading to Denver, was endorsed by
The Sun of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's one cutting swipe Sunday at Bradley followed a more elaborate assault
late Saturday before loyalists at a state Democratic Party chili fest. There,
Gore said he wanted a ``clear and decisive'' verdict from Tuesday's nonbinding
primary, and he accused Bradley of trying to sink the Democratic Party in ``a
cauldron of wedge issues and phony labels.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his stump speeches and advertising, Bradley has been scrutinizing Gore's
past record against abortion rights and gun control.

<HEADLINE> Polaris Retracing Alaskan Trek  </HEADLINE>
   By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Forty years ago, Edgar Hetteen set out with three
companions on a 1,200-mile trek across the Alaskan wilderness in a last-ditch
effort to save the motorized sled he felt was the key to his company's future.
</P>
<P>
	   If Hetteen could only get the word out, he believed the Sno-Traveler -- the
first modern-day snowmobile -- would transform winter travel in harsh northern
climates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We needed to draw adventurers,'' Hetteen said. ``We needed to prove our
snow machines worked.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 21-day trip over the rocks, sand, ice and snow of Alaska, riding through
blizzards, torrential winds and sand storms, did just that.
</P>
<P>
	   Today snowmobiling is a $10 billion industry. There are more than 4 million
snowmobilers around the world and 130,121 miles of groomed snowmobile trails in
the United States, nearly four times the miles of interstate highway.
</P>
<P>
	   Polaris Industries Inc., the company Hetteen started, had sales of $1.3
billion last year. It's the world's largest manufacturer of snowmobiles, a
strong second in all-terrain vehicles, a top maker of personal watercraft and a
growing presence in motorcycle manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
	   The grand adventure that showed the snowmobile was more than a goofy machine
has never been far from Hetteen's mind. Last year he approached his old company
-- he had jumped to rival Arctic Cat in 1961 -- about retracing the 1960 Alaskan
trek from Bethel, on the Bering Sea coast, to Fairbanks. Polaris agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Hetteen, 79, and nine others plan to leave March 15 on the anniversary
journey, which is also intended to raise money for medical research. The group
will include David Johnson, 77, Hetteen's brother-in-law who invented that early
snowmobile, and Tom Tiller, 38, who took over as Polaris chief executive last
May.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the larger team, there will be other differences.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Forty years ago, the only thing that ever used that area was dog teams. We
were the first mechanical surface transportation to ever cross anywhere in the
state of Alaska,'' Hetteen said. ``I would expect we will see a lot more
snowmobile trails now than dog trails.''
</P>
<P>
	   Snowmobile technology also has come a long way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are many years of innovation in these new machines,'' Hetteen said.
``We were extremely lucky on that first trip. We had some problems but it could
have been more severe.''
</P>
<P>
	   Just 10 days into the 1960 trip and less than halfway to Fairbanks, the
group was traveling on the frozen Yukon River miles from the nearest village
when Hetteen's machine gave a choking pop and died.
</P>
<P>
	   He took the machine apart in the driving wind and bitter cold, replacing the
coil that introduces electricity to the engine. As Hetteen cranked up the
machine for a test, he dropped his hammer into the spinning fins of the
flywheel, stripping out all of the cooling fins. For the rest of the distance,
he traveled on hope that the machine wouldn't overheat and die. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no advance publicity about the early trip because Hetteen and his
friends weren't sure it would be successful. Thus, they became a mystery as they
stopped in remote villages where such machines had never been seen before.
</P>
<P>
	   For this trip, team members will have satellite phones and a global
positioning system that will feed their exact location back to computers in
Minneapolis. The adventurers will participate in live Internet events on the
company's Web site, www.polarisindustries.com.
</P>
<P>
	   If the weather cooperates and the snowmobilers are not forced to make
detours faced during the 1960 trip, the new trip will be 900 miles over eight
days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're all a little crazy,'' Tiller said, when asked why he wanted to
retrace a trip that was done in desperation to save a company that is now
successful, with net income up 8 percent in 1999 and sales up 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Polaris also hopes the trip will raise $100,000 for research to combat ALS,
the progressive neurodegenerative disease commonly known as Lou Gehrig's
disease, Tiller said. The company is matching contributions by its employees to
the National ALS Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian City Sweeps Its Rubble  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KADUNA, Nigeria (AP) -- The wreckage of violence is being slowly swept from
the streets of this northern Nigerian city. The smells -- the burned buildings,
the bonfires, the corpses left outside to rot for days -- are fading.
</P>
<P>
	   But the hatred remains.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am one of the soldiers,'' said Xavier Thompson, sitting on a metal bench
outside St. Joseph's Cathedral, where the perimeter wall is blackened and
cracked by fire. ``The soldiers of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
	   Days after horrific violence raged through this city, ignited by a proposal
to bring Islamic law to Kaduna state and quelled only after a massive military
deployment, few people believe they have seen the last of the fighting -- here
or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   In a nation of 120 million sharply divided by religion, ethnicity and
geography, the fury over Islamic law, or sharia, could prove to be one of the
biggest challenges facing Nigeria's nascent democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, sharia officially went into effect in neighboring Zamfara state,
which is overwhelmingly Muslim. Two other states in Nigeria's largely Muslim
north passed sharia bills last week. Other states, including Kaduna, which is 40
percent Christian, are considering following suit.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting in Kaduna has been the only major violence so far connected
with Sharia, ignited here perhaps because Christians make up a significant part
of the state's population, and so are less willing to accept Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence unleashed illustrates the fury that simmers in Nigeria, a
nation cobbled together by British colonialists with little thought to existing
ethnic or geographic boundaries. At least 300 people -- and many times that, by
some accounts -- died in the fighting, which erupted Feb. 21 and wasn't
completely quieted until two days later.
</P>
<P>
	   Each side blames the other for the clashes started when 5,000 Christians
marched to protest the sharia proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   People were attacked with machetes, burned alive, shot and stoned to death.
Entire blocks of buildings were burned out, and whole neighborhoods abandoned.
Dozens of burned cars and trucks littered the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people fled the city, or to the safety of military camps. It
was days before the refugees began to trickle home.
</P>
<P>
	   Horrific tales came from both sides: children hacked with machetes, women
burned beyond recognition, groups of men force-marched from their neighborhoods,
never to be seen again.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a week after the fighting began, more than three dozen bodies still
littered the neighborhood of Rigasa Village, where pigs fed on the blackened
corpses of Christians whose Muslim neighbors turned against them.
</P>
<P>
	   But sharia is far from simply a religious dispute. It is tangled up with
distrust between northerners, who are mostly Muslim Hausas, and southerners, who
are mostly Christian Yorubas or Ibos, and with widespread bitterness over
Nigeria's endless economic ills.
</P>
<P>
	   It comes as northerners, whose domination of the military gave them immense
power during 15 years of army rule, are losing much of their influence after
last year's democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Political circles swirl with rumors that the calls for sharia are actually a
plot to stir up violence in Nigeria -- and give the military an excuse to seize
power again.
</P>
<P>
	   The government of President Olusegun Obasanjo rejects such allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not scared by some of the reports suggesting there is a grand
design'' to destabilize the country, said Jerry Gana, minister for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   Obasanjo has chosen to largely steer clear of the issue, afraid of inflaming
the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The sharia thing, as far as I'm concerned, will blow over,'' said Gana.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Christian nor Muslim leaders agree.
</P>
<P>
	   To its supporters, sharia is a path to honesty and peace, a set of laws that
urges Muslim piety while allowing Christians to practice their religion as they
wish. They note that only Muslims would be tried in Islamic courts, while
Christians would continue to answer to secular law.
</P>
<P>
	   To its opponents, though, it is a barbaric mingling of church and state, a
fanatic's government that will hand down punishments from lashings to cutting
off hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Some also see far greater problems looming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given the very weak nature of the state as it's presently constituted, the
fact that the whole process of democracy is just getting off the ground ... this
is the most significant threat to the corporate existence of Nigeria,'' said the
Rev. Matthew Kukah, secretary general of the Catholic Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
	   Muslim leaders scoff at such talk. They insist they are simply trying to
practice their religion, and have no interest in encouraging political unrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Many observers see Nigeria's rampant poverty as a major underlying factor in
the violence, as angry, unemployed young people take advantage of unrest to rob
and loot.
</P>
<P>
	   But explanations mean little to the thousands who suffered through the
fighting in Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is terrible,'' Yusuf Harman said as he stared at the ruins of a
street market, littered with piles of blackened fruit, broken sewing machines
and seared bags of rice.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why it happened, he shook his head in confusion: ``It's just a
religion matter. I don't understand.''

Curfews Said To Help Deter Crime

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rising number of American cities are imposing curfews
to deter youth violence, crime and gang activity, according to a report that
says 110 cities have established them in the past five years. The report,
released Monday by the National League of Cities, said that compares with 122
curfews set up across the nation during a 15-year period between 1980 and 1995.
Nighttime youth curfews were reported by a total of 337 of some 490 cities the

35 cities said they're considering implementing a curfew.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton urges reconciliation between cops and citizens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton urged New Yorkers to reach across
the "trust divide" in the wake of the Diallo verdict but offered no opinion on
whether the case warrants a federal investigation.
<P>
	   "There are still too many people in this city who believe they are
considered guilty just because of the color of their skin, and there are also
too many police officers who believe they are mistrusted because of the color of
their uniforms," Clinton told several hundred people Sunday at a City College
conference on the political concerns of Dominican-Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   She added: "The police must strive for a better understanding of the
communities they serve, and the communities must strive for a better
understanding of the risks that the police face in their service on behalf of us
every day."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton noted that the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into whether
federal civil rights charges should be brought against the four white officers
who were acquitted of wrongdoing in the shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
black African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not offer an opinion on whether she thought a federal case was
merited, saying: "No matter the outcome of that investigation, there is more for
all of us to do to respond to this tragedy. We must not allow the verdict to
divide New Yorkers. We must reach across those lines of mistrust and division
and join to ensure that no tragedy like this ever happens again."
</P>
<P>
	   She also called for an effort "to recruit and train a police force that
truly reflects the racial and ethnic diversity of this great city. We must
support efforts to expand community policing so that more police officers can
walk the beat and really know people they serve."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is running for U.S. Senate against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
Giuliani's spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum, bristled at the notion that the police
force needs reforming.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mrs. Clinton is obviously unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department," he said. "As a result of the plan, the new police class will be the
most diverse ever and will better reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of our
city."
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum did not have the breakdown for the academy's latest class, and
the police department could not immediately provide it. But overall, the force
is about two-thirds white, while the city's population is less than half white.

<HEADLINE> Huddled masses? Not on the new Lower East Side  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Lower East Side of Manhattan is famous for its
tenements, its pastrami sandwiches and its proud history as the first American
home to millions of immigrants.
<P>
	   Until recently, trendy nightclubs, posh art galleries and $3,000-a-month
studio apartments were definitely NOT part of the picture.
</P>
<P>
	   But with a little help from New York's through-the-roof real estate market,
the old Lower East Side has become something its former residents would never
have recognized - a hip downtown hotspot.
</P>
<P>
	   The narrow streets where vendors once pushed carts piled high with clothing,
vegetables, household goods and even eyeglasses are now home to scores of bars,
cafes and glitzy shops that might look more at home in upscale SoHo or artsy
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now it's pretty much a well-known fact that if you want to move to a really
cool, hip neighborhood, you're going to move down here," said artist Peter
Marco, who sells brightly colored Keith Haring-esque T-shirts and paintings from
a shop on Orchard Street. "If you come down here on a weekend, there's no better
place to party. The streets are just mobbed with 20-somethings having the time
of their life."
</P>
<P>
	   A century ago, the Lower East Side's crowded tenements and filthy living
conditions inspired muckraking journalist Jacob Riis' expose "How the Other Half
Lives."
</P>
<P>
	   Waves of immigrants passed through the area, fresh from Ellis Island - first
Irish, then Italians, eastern European Jews, Russians, Poles and Greeks, later
Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   Immigration still shapes the neighborhood. Today it's not clear where
Chinatown begins and the old Lower East Side ends. Hispanic families have a
significant presence, and many recent arrivals hail from Bangladesh and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   But scattered among the Asian fishmongers and elderly Jewish men selling
socks, underwear and discount clothing is a new kind of migrant - young
professionals drawn to the area by low rents and a vibrant arts and
entertainment scene.
</P>
<P>
	   "The grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the immigrants who first moved
to this neighborhood and worked all their lives to get out ... are back in the
neighborhood," laughed Fred Austin, owner of the venerable Katz's Delicatessen,
which now stays open till 3 a.m. on weekend nights to accommodate hungry young
club-goers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a host of new shops, new clubs, even theaters, bars, design houses
- a lot of young people, fresh blood, giving the neighborhood a shot in the arm,
a revitalization that we haven't seen for many, many years."
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't always that way.
</P>
<P>
	   Popular for years as a bargain shopping district, the Lower East Side fell
on hard times during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s. By the time recession hit
in the early '90s, it was known more for its problems with crime and drugs than
its history. Hundreds of old apartment buildings sat vacant, sealed by landlords
who couldn't be bothered to spend money fixing them up.
</P>
<P>
	   Salvation came in the form of New York's late 1990s real estate boom.
</P>
<P>
	   With Wall Street's bull market driving commercial and residential rents to
eye-popping levels in more established Manhattan neighborhoods, young New
Yorkers started noticing the Lower East Side's cheap housing and great location.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now that SoHo has really gentrified into something that the average person
can't afford, I think a lot of people are looking for that SoHo kind of flavor
at a reasonable price," said Bob Levy, the owner of Harris Levy Inc., a family
linen store whose discounted sheets and bedding have been a fixture on Grand
Street since 1894.
</P>
<P>
	   Artists and writers moved in - along with bars, restaurants and boutiques -
and upscale young professionals soon followed.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I moved down here, the broker had 35 keys and he was like, 'Pick a
store,"' recalled Marco, whose art shop is now an overwhelming avalanche of
color. "It was a block full of empties."
</P>
<P>
	   Some longtime residents were suspicious.
</P>
<P>
	   "They used to say, 'Oh, you're not going to make a dollar, what are you
doing opening an art gallery on Orchard Street?"' Marco said. "'This is where
you sell underwear and socks."'
</P>
<P>
	   That's just what's on display next door at J. Hauptman Haberdashery, along
with men's suits and sportswear. Jack Hauptman, whose parents started the store
40 years ago, worries he won't make it on the new Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
	   Hauptman says the busy bar and club scene is driving away his longtime
customers. Young people "come here to drink," he said. "It's upsetting because
it's taking away my livelihood."
</P>
<P>
	   Some worry gentrification is beginning to drive out the immigrants and other
poor and working class residents who have long been part of the Lower East Side.
Late-night carousing at the area's dozens of bars and clubs has also raised
concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   "People who are low income feel that eventually they will be priced out of
the neighborhood," said Marcia Lemmon, who heads the Ludlow Block Association.
"And when you have a lot of noise, street traffic, that's not conducive to
raising a family."
</P>
<P>
	   The low rents that first drew young people to the neighborhood are already
vanishing. In the Beckenstein Fabrics building on Orchard Street - still
surrounded by storefronts displaying girdles, handbags and discount hosiery -
newly renovated one-bedroom apartments rent for $5,000 a month, and studios top
out at $3,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Who's paying those prices?
</P>
<P>
	   "Wall Street guys," said Faith Hope Consolo, an executive at the real estate
firm handling rentals in the Beckenstein building. "Even lawyers and
accountants, if you can believe it. ... It's amazing. We just don't have enough
space for everybody."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, some old-time Lower East Siders couldn't be happier. Levy said a park
near his linen store was once a hangout for drug dealers and is now clean and
safe.
</P>
<P>
	   "I remember years ago that if I had to stay in the store late, ... at 10
o'clock at night, I'd start thinking, 'I'd better get going,"' he said. "Now I
can stay till 12 o'clock and I don't think twice about it."
</P>
<P>
	   What does the future hold for the ever-evolving Lower East Side?
</P>
<P>
	   More change, predicts artist Marco.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the only thing you can count on," he said. "Eventually somebody's
going to come down here and change us again."

<HEADLINE> In pulpits and streets, appeals for justice and change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Demonstrators marched down Broadway chanting "it's a
wallet not a gun" on the second day of protests over the acquittal of four
police officers in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo.
<P>
	   The reference was to the wallet the officers said they mistook for a gun. In
what was billed as a day of prayer Sunday, political leaders and activists
criticized the not-guilty verdict as inappropriate for a case in which police
fired 41 bullets and hit the African immigrant 19 times, only to learn that he
was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,000 people joined a vigil outside the United Nations, where
civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton said he hoped to bring the Diallo
case to international attention. Afterward, about 450 people - accompanied by a
phalanx of police - marched to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope to express our feelings - I must see justice done," said marcher
Omar Jalloh.
</P>
<P>
	   The march was similar to Saturday's protest, although it was smaller and not
as tense. Police said there was one arrest for disorderly conduct and one
summons issued for using a megaphone without a permit.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said he was "calling for another jury to hear evidence" on the
policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "Come November, the jury is going to render its decision," he said,
referring to Giuliani's probable run for the U.S. Senate. "We're going to
boycott in this city. We are afraid to spend money with certain people because
we are considered suspects. Let's hold our wallets, let's hold our wallets."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Sharpton's spokeswoman, Rachel Noerdlinger, said Sharpton and his
National Action Network are investigating which companies contribute to the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. The PBA helped finance the defense for the
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, Sharpton will release the names of the companies and ask
citizens to boycott them, his spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, acquitted of second-degree murder and lesser charges by a
jury in Albany on Friday, still face a departmental inquiry and possibly federal
charges if Attorney General Janet Reno finds evidence that Diallo's civil rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, filling in for
an ailing Cardinal John O'Connor, told parishioners Diallo's death should cause
people to "re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear and
perhaps toward prejudice - racial prejudice at that."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged
his followers to vote against Giuliani, saying the mayor had failed to thank him
for urging calm in the wake of the Diallo shooting a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a climate
that's divisive," Butts said in a telephone interview. "And I'm not calling for
calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be active."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Teitelbaum, a spokesman for Giuliani's Senate campaign, questioned
Butts' motives, saying he had "hugged Mayor Giuliani" at an interfaith service
at St. Patrick's soon after the shooting and "now he is exploiting Amadou
Diallo's death for partisan political reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue making "fundamental, meaningful change, so that people aren't
afraid that the police are going to shoot them."
</P>
<P>
	   Vallone, a Democrat, said the city council had budgeted funds for that
purpose and "even the mayor is recognizing that changes have to be made."
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Key provisions of the plan would make federal and state funding for local
police contingent on the police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and create a permanent special prosecutor to handle police
brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, he said the NYCLU intends to sue the city
on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking the Democratic
nomination for U.S. Senate, urged New Yorkers not to let the verdict divide
them.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, "we must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter," she told several hundred
people at a national Dominican-American conference at City College.

<HEADLINE> Jazz singer struggles, keeps her dream alive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A low hum resonates from the capacity crowd at the
Village Vanguard. Snippets of conversation mix with murmured drink orders in the
triangle-shaped basement room that was home to the likes of Charlie "Bird"
Parker and Miles Davis.
<P>
	   With its pictures of John Coltrane and Roland Kirk on the walls, this is the
place where jazz performers dream of taking the stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Teri Thornton is one of those dreamers, has been since she decided as a
little girl in Detroit that jazz would be the soundtrack of her life. Her dream
took her to critical acclaim as a singer 40 years ago; then through three failed
marriages, near-oblivion as a performer and bouts with alcoholism, depression
and cancer; and finally back into the spotlight as winner of one of jazz's most
prestigious awards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just know that there's nothing else for me to do," said Thornton. "God
gave me this talent and I knew he meant for me to do something with it and I
just couldn't give up."
</P>
<P>
	   And she hasn't. After years of taking whatever small singing jobs she could
get - and even a stint as a taxi driver - Thornton released "I'll Be Easy to
Find" on Verve Records last year, her first release since the early '60s.
</P>
<P>
	   On a recent night, after the band members have done their solos, the
saxophonist reaches for the microphone.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ladies and Gentleman - Teri Thornton."
</P>
<P>
	   The black sequins on her beret catch some light and sparkle as Thornton
slowly makes her way onstage, flanked by a man who holds her arm in support. She
sinks onto her chair, a long, dark, animal-print shirt hanging off her gaunt
frame.
</P>
<P>
	   This is night three of a six-night gig at the Vanguard, with Thornton doing
two sets a night. The mother of three and grandmother looks frail.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1997. Her treatment -
chemotherapy, radiation, and finally surgery - has been exhausting. Now she has
painful blood clots in her legs that make walking difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   But there's no sign of illness in her voice when she starts singing. The
low-pitched sound is true as Thornton doles out bits of wisdom to an
appreciative audience.
</P>
<P>
	   "He who is wise never tries to revise what is past and gone," she sings in
"Devil May Care."
</P>
<P>
	   It was never supposed to be this difficult to get a big break for Thornton,
now a gracious, elegant woman of 65 with a wide smile and smoky voice.
</P>
<P>
	   An only child, she grew up in a house filled with music. Her grandmother
sang in church, and her mother had a radio show. Her mother wanted Thornton to
become a classical pianist but supported her decision to sing jazz, even making
sure Thornton saw all the big-name musicians who passed through town.
</P>
<P>
	   "My mother would think it was so important for me to see them, she'd kind of
snatch me off the schoolgrounds" to go watch the greats of the day, the singer
recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   She started performing in the 1950s and made her way to Chicago. The Windy
City was good to her, with plenty of work and plenty of friends in the jazz
scene. She worked in Canada, too, then went east to New York in 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Big Apple it was instant luck, Thornton said. The day of her arrival,
she went to look for a friend at a jazz club and ended up taking the stage for a
song.
</P>
<P>
	   Her performance impressed a woman in the audience who helped get her a job
singing on national television. TV led to club dates, and an introduction by
some jazz friends to a record company led to a contract.
</P>
<P>
	   "Devil May Care" was released in 1961 on Riverside Records, followed by
"Somewhere in the Night," the theme for the television show "Naked City," in
1962 on Dauntless, and "Open Highway" on Columbia in 1963.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite critical acclaim, Thornton's career never came up to speed. Soon
even the club dates began drying up.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the kind of thing where you're too little to be big and too big to
be little," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Plus, like the song says, the times they were a-changing. The '60s were the
age of rock 'n' roll, and Thornton was a jazz singer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really didn't fit in," she said, recalling that even when she tried to
take to the new music, she was ignored by producers at Columbia Records.
</P>
<P>
	   "They had decided what kind of material I should do and they ... wouldn't
let me go over the line," Thornton said. "I always liked rock 'n' roll ... and I
could have performed it, but they refused to let me do that. So I wound up off
the label."
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton stayed in New York until 1975, singing the occasional gig,
sometimes living off the kindness of friends. She moved to Los Angeles to be
near her son after her ex-husband would not let the boy return from a visit.
</P>
<P>
	   It was in LA she was reduced to driving a cab. "Unfortunately there wasn't
very much work out there for me," she recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   She got some singing jobs, she said, but "it was just kind of from one job
to the next and one paycheck to the next."
</P>
<P>
	   Her return to New York with her son in 1983 didn't make things any better.
Her old jazz friends had drifted away or didn't want to see her. "I didn't know
how I was going to make it here. I wasn't about to drive a cab in this town,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Living in an apartment above a bar, she began drowning her troubles in
alcohol. She remembers waking up in the morning facing "my own alcoholic
breath." She thought of suicide but decided that she couldn't leave her son,
then 14.
</P>
<P>
	   And once she decided she was going to live, she said, life started looking
up. She stopped drinking and sang with small jazz bands, work that was steady if
not spectacular.
</P>
<P>
	   "There would be lean times, but I could always maintain," she said. "I could
never feel like I had a whole lot of bad luck because there were so many things
that were good in the realm of that bad luck."
</P>
<P>
	   But the good was hard to find in the summer of 1998. Thornton was recovering
from surgery after having been diagnosed with cancer the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   When her manager Suizi Reynolds called and asked her if she wanted to enter
a singing competition, it seemed like a joke. Especially when Thornton found out
it wasn't just any contest but the Thelonius Monk International Jazz
Competition.
</P>
<P>
	   An age limit that would have made Thornton ineligible had been dropped, and
it would be the perfect showcase for her. Thornton agreed even though she wasn't
sure she was well enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Her manager sent in a CD of Thornton's songs, and she was chosen as one of
the five finalists to perform live in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton spent the week before the contest lying down to conserve energy. It
paid off. According to published accounts, she tore the house down with her
rendition of "I'll Be Easy to Find."
</P>
<P>
	   Recalling her reaction when she was announced as winner, Thornton said, "I
was weak in the knees. ... It was just so heady. I still experience it over and
over again."
</P>
<P>
	   Does she wonder about the life she might have had if stardom had come during
her first go-round? A little, but Thornton is philosophical.
</P>
<P>
	   "It didn't happen then. The life that I had, as bad as may it seem to
somebody else, it's still good," she said. "There's a lot of growing in the
process and I think that you're not ready until you're ready."

<HEADLINE> 'Whole Nine Yards' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The hit men remain on target.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Whole Nine Yards," a comedy about hired killers, held onto first place
at the box office for the second straight weekend, taking in $9.6 million,
according to industry estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The teen comedy "Snow Day" also held strong at No. 2 with $8.5 million in
its third weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "Reindeer Games," a casino-heist caper starring Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise and
Charlize Theron, was the only new movie to debut in the top five. Directed by
John Frankenheimer, it overcame generally poor reviews to open in third place
with $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The comic drama "Hanging Up," which ran a close second to "The Whole Nine
Yards" last weekend, fell to No. 4 with $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The sci-fi thriller "Pitch Black" rounded out the top five with $7.1 million
in its second weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The top movies were bunched tightly, unlike a few weeks ago when the horror
hit "Scream 3" debuted and far outpaced the competition.
</P>
<P>
	   "Light, escapist fare rules the day right now," said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie attendance.
</P>
<P>
	   "But the top five's got a real mix of genres. The industry's putting enough
different films into the marketplace that each one is picking up its own
audience segment," Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another new movie, "Wonder Boys," debuted in seventh place with $5.9
million. Starring Michael Douglas as a novelist and professor whose life is in
shambles, "Wonder Boys" played in narrower release than the other top films and
scored the best per-theater average.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing in 1,253 cinemas, "Wonder Boys" averaged $4,669 per theater,
compared to an average of $3,299 in 2,910 theaters for "The Whole Nine Yards"
and $3,630 in 2,204 theaters for "Reindeer Games."
</P>
<P>
	   Paramount plans to expand "Wonder Boys" next weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty" and "The Cider House Rules" continued to trade on their
top status among Oscar nominees. Re-released last week, "American Beauty" was in
ninth place with $4.7 million, pushing its total gross to $87.7 million. The
movie has added about $13 million to its take since Oscar nominations were
announced last week.
</P>
<P>
	   At 1,346 theaters, "The Cider House Rules" went into its widest release yet
and had $4.1 million in ticket sales to rank No. 10. The film has grossed $32
million, up about $9 million since the nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Beach," the new movie from teen heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio, dropped
out of the top 10 after just three weekends. It was No. 11 with $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures were to be released
today.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "The Whole Nine Yards," $9.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Diallo juror describes 'unhappy' decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Clearing four white police officers of murder in the
slaying of an unarmed black man wasn't easy, according to some jurors.
<P>
	   But the law made the jury's decision "very clear - not happy, but clear,"
juror Helen Harder said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking publicly for the first time since Friday's verdict in the racially
charged case, Harder said that the jury deliberated without discord before
announcing its dramatic decision.
</P>
<P>
	   "It turned out the only way it could turn out," Harder, 71, told The
Associated Press in a brief interview in the kitchen of her Albany County home.
</P>
<P>
	   Added Harder: "I'm not saying it's a happy verdict. I know the cops are
happy. None of (the jurors) are very happy. But that's the way it worked out."
</P>
<P>
	   Amadou Diallo's mother, Kadiatou Diallo, who cried as the jury announced the
not-guilty verdict 24 times, said today her son was forgotten at the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "The judge said to the jury they should put themselves in the shoes of the
police officers, but Amadou did not come alive during the trial," she said in an
interview on NBC's "Today" show. "No one talked about him really."
</P>
<P>
	   She was disappointed in the jury's decision but said she still has faith in
the American justice system. "Something tells me to keep on having faith because
right now we are calling for a federal investigation to see what can be done
about it," she said. The family also plans to file a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview on Sunday with NBC, juror Tim DeTraglia agreed with Harder's
assessment, even saying "tears were shed" during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy were
cleared of murder and other charges in the slaying of Diallo, a West African
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   The plainclothes officers claimed they fired 41 bullets at the victim on
Feb. 4, 1999, after he refused orders to halt for questioning and pulled out a
black object they thought was a small handgun. Diallo was hit 19 times in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment before the defendants realized the object was a
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Apparently, the officers' testimony was a crucial point for the jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   "He looked at the police officers, they identified themselves, and as they
moved toward him, he turned and backed away," juror Tom Knowles said to NBC.
"Why? Why? We won't know those answers."
</P>
<P>
	   Juror Ed Powell also told NBC the jury believed that the officers thought
that their lives were in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I were to pull something out of my pocket, you couldn't identify that
quickly whether it was a gun or a wallet," Powell said, adding that the officers
had a legal right to defend themselves if they thought Diallo was attacking
them.
</P>
<P>
	   The death of Diallo - and now the not-guilty verdict - has flamed tensions
between police and minorities and touched off protests around New York City.
Because of pre-trial publicity, an appeals court moved the murder case from the
Bronx to Albany, where Harder, who is white, served on a jury that also had four
black women and seven white men.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors have remained mostly silent since the verdict, despite constant
hounding by network television, New York City newspapers and major news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury's black forewoman, Arlene Taylor, who once lived in the Bronx, told
the New York Post that the three-day deliberation had "nothing to do with race."
</P>
<P>
	   She told the Daily News that the public outrage over the jury's decision was
"like getting a kick in the teeth."
</P>
<P>
	   Harder, who has nine children and 17 grandchildren, described the heartbreak
of seeing Diallo's parents sitting in the front row each day of the month-long
trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The juror didn't mention race. But her husband, attorney George Harder, said
his wife told him that it was not an issue in the jury's deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense case hinged on the emotional testimony of the officers. All
claimed they were convinced that they had to shoot Diallo in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge instructed jurors several times that by law if they concluded that
the officers "reasonably believed" Diallo was armed and dangerous, they must
acquit.
</P>
<P>
	   About the officers, Harder said, "I thought they were quite believable."
</P>
<P>
	   The juror also said she was relieved that the trial is over.

<HEADLINE> Dissent Reported in FBI Waco Siege  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- A memo written during the weeks-long standoff by the Branch
Davidian cult in 1993 details dissent within the FBI over whether to use tear
gas to end the ordeal, The Dallas Morning News reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   The standoff near Waco ended April 19, 1993, in the fiery deaths of more
than 80 cult members after agents launched a tear gas attack. The standoff had
begun Feb. 28, more than seven weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   A memo dated March 23, 1993, was obtained by the newspaper. Danny O.
Coulson, then deputy assistant FBI director, wrote that he feared bureau
officials in Waco were lobbying to use tear gas against the Davidians because
they were frustrated, tired and under pressure from the agency's hostage rescue
team commander, Richard Rogers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bottom line, I suggest that it is not time to ask the AG (attorney
general) or the president for permission to assault the compound with gas,'' he
wrote. ``Progress is still being made.''
</P>
<P>
	   Coulson wrote that negotiations were being hurt by an inconsistent tactical
strategy, including repeated punishment of sect members just when they appeared
to be cooperating.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has maintained that the Davidians were responsible for their
own deaths. But several of the sect's survivors and relatives have filed a
wrongful death lawsuit against the government.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is set for May 14 in Waco federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers was the agency's on-scene commander in Waco and also had a key role
in the deadly 1992 standoff at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
	   In Ruby Ridge, an FBI sniper under Rogers' command killed the wife of white
supremacist Randy Weaver after Rogers relaxed bureau rules of engagement and
pushed for an all-out tank and tear-gas assault on the Weavers' cabin.
</P>
<P>
	   In Waco, Coulson wrote, ``a lot of pressure (to use tear gas) is coming from
Rogers.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had similar problems in Idaho with him and he argued and convinced the
SACs (local FBI special agents in charge) that Weaver would not come out. That
proved to be wrong. I believe he is a significant part of the problem here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers has declined interview requests.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno approved a plan to gas the compound on April 19,
1993. It began with a gradual tear-gas insertion but escalated to an all-out
tear gas assault after the sect began shooting at FBI tanks.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, agents increased pressure by sending tanks deep into the building.
Six hours after the gas assault began, the compound burned with sect leader
David Koresh and more than 80 followers inside. Some died from fire, others from
gunshots.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 81 points in today's
early going. Advancing and declining issues are evenly split on the New York
Stock Exchange.

<P>
	   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off 15 points and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500

<HEADLINE> Drug Tests on Pregnant Women Studied  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide whether public
hospitals can test pregnant patients for drug use and tell police who tested
positive.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices said they will review a challenge to a South Carolina
hospital's policy aimed at detecting pregnant women who use crack cocaine. The
policy's opponents say it violates women's Fourth Amendment protections against
unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital discontinued its policy after a 1993 lawsuit was filed, but the
court's decision, expected sometime in 2001, could determine whether it ever
gets reinstated and whether other hospitals consider adopting similar policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute stems from South Carolina's efforts to prosecute women who use
crack cocaine while pregnant under the state's child-endangerment law.
</P>
<P>
	   The state law makes it a crime to ``refuse or neglect to provide the proper
care and attention'' so that a child ``is endangered or is likely to be
endangered.'' The state's Supreme Court has ruled that a viable fetus -- one
able to live outside the uterus -- is a child under the law and has upheld its
use against pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina prosecutors have done so dozens of times since 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's highest court refused in 1998 to review such prosecutions. But
no other state's top court has allowed them. The highest courts in Florida,
Kentucky, Nevada and Ohio explicitly have disallowed them.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Medical University of South Carolina, a public hospital in
Charleston, officials decided in 1989 to help such prosecutions. If a woman's
urine test indicated cocaine use, she was arrested for distributing the drug to
a minor.
</P>
<P>
	   In early 1990, the policy was changed to give drug-using patients a choice
between being arrested and enrolling for treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten women sued the hospital and others in 1993, contending among other
things that the urine testing, performed without court warrants, amounted to
unreasonable searches that violated their privacy.
</P>
<P>
	   After a six-week trial, a federal jury ruled against the women. The 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that verdict last July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In light of the documented health hazards of maternal cocaine use and the
resulting drain on public resources, (hospital) officials unquestionably
possessed a substantial interest in taking steps to reduce cocaine use by
pregnant women,'' the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   It also said the policy effectively advanced that interest and that the
urine tests ``were minimally intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
	   For those reasons, the appeals court concluded that the searches were
reasonable under a ``special needs'' exception to the Fourth Amendment's general
requirement that a search be authorized by court warrant or be based on
``probable cause'' to suspect a crime.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the 10 women called the appeals
court ruling a ``radical extension of the special needs doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court ruling, they said, ``would permit law enforcement and
other governmental officers to engage in searches as a means of gaining evidence
for arrests and prosecutions without a warrant or individualized suspicion, so
long as the government can present a health or safety reason for its actions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Ferguson vs. City of Charleston, 99-936.

<HEADLINE> U S West Loses Long-Distance Battle  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U S West, one of the major regional phone companies,
today failed to win the Supreme Court's permission to sell another firm's
long-distance service to its local customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, turned away U S West's argument that the
arrangement is authorized by a 1996 federal law intended to open local phone
markets to full competition.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T's long-standing monopoly over phone service was broken up by a 1982
agreement that created competition in long-distance service while setting up
regional phone companies to provide local service on a monopoly basis.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1996 Telecommunications Act overhauled that system and sought to open
local phone service to competition for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other things, the law let local phone companies provide long-distance
service if they opened their local markets to competition. Last December, Bell
Atlantic got Federal Communications Commission permission under that provision
to offer long-distance service to its New York customers.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, U S West and Ameritech companies negotiated agreements to sell the
long-distance service of Qwest Communications Corp. to their local customers.
Qwest paid U S West and Ameritech a fee for each local phone client who chose
Qwest's long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC blocked the partnerships, saying they violated the 1996 law because
U S West and Ameritech did not open their local markets to competition in
exchange for the right to provide long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia agreed last
June. Ameritech did not appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   U S West's appeal to the Supreme Court said it was not ``providing'' phone
service but was merely selling another company's service. The 1996 law was
clear, and therefore the appeals court should not have deferred to the FCC's
interpretation, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department lawyers said the 1996 law created an incentive for local
phone companies to open their markets to competition, and that U S West's
arrangement would circumvent that goal. Government lawyers also noted that U S
West and Qwest have announced plans to merge.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is U S West Communications vs. FCC, 99-869.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Block Deporting of Nazi  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to halt the deportation
of a 78-year-old retired foundry supervisor found to have served as a guard at
two Nazi concentration camps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which Ferdinand Hammer
argued that immigration officials should have to show he actively participated
in persecution of the camps' prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammer, of Sterling Heights, Mich., admits he was a member of the German
army's Waffen-SS during the war but has denied being part of a battalion that
served at concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
	   He came to the United States in 1955 and became a naturalized citizen in
1963. Hammer was stripped of his citizenship by a federal judge in 1996 for
lying about his past.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge found Hammer had served as a guard at the Auschwitz death camp in
Nazi-occupied Poland and the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammer did not appeal his loss of citizenship, and later that year the
government began deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   An immigration judge ordered him deported in 1997 after finding that Hammer
had assisted in Nazi-sponsored acts of persecution.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals upheld that order, as did the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals last November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over 1 million people were murdered based solely on their religion or
ethnicity at the concentration camps where Hammer stood guard,'' the appeals
court said, adding that the government need not present evidence that Hammer
personally was involved in specific acts.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, Hammer's lawyer said immigration officials in
his deportation case improperly relied on findings made during the citizenship
case that he was a guard at the death camps.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyer also said the government should have to prove ``personal active
assistance'' by Hammer in acts of persecution.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Hammer vs. INS, 99-1310.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Return Award Against ABC  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a $10
million libel award a bank executive and his company won, and then lost, against
ABC over a ''20/20'' news story he says made him look like a crook.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by Alan Levan, chairman
and chief executive of BFC Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Levan's appeal urged the court to limit how far appeals courts can go in
second-guessing juries' findings in libel cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Levan and BFC, then known as BankAtlantic Financial Corp., sued ABC and
''20/20'' producer William Willson over a 1991 broadcast that portrayed them as
unfairly taking advantage of investors in complex financial deals.
</P>
<P>
	   The report focused on investors who had joined limited real estate
partnerships to buy commercial properties and saw their interests plummet during
a nationwide decline in real estate values. Some said Levan had bilked them in
deals known as ``roll-ups,'' in which their interests in real estate were
swapped for bonds issued by Levan's struggling savings and loan, BankAtlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   After a seven-week trial in 1996, a federal jury in Miami awarded Levan
$8.75 million and BFC $1.25 million in compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
	   But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last September that ABC did
not have to pay a cent. Lawyers for Levan and BFC had failed to prove that ABC
aired the story with ``actual malice'' -- either with knowledge or reckless
disregard of its falsity.
</P>
<P>
	   Public figures who sue for libel must prove falsity and actual malice, but
private citizens need only prove that the statement was false and made
negligently.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Levan and ABC disagreed over the gist of the ABC report. Levan's
lawyers said it was that he knowingly misled limited-partner investors, but
ABC's lawyers said the gist was merely that the roll-ups were unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We conclude that the answer is somewhere in between: ABC clearly implied
that the limited partners got a raw deal, one so bad that a viewer would believe
Levan must have known that the deal was unfair ... particularly in light of his
financial expertise,'' the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, Levan's lawyers said the appeals court wrongly
supplanted its own view for the jury's ``regarding a broadcast's gist and its
falsity.''
</P>
<P>
	   They said appeals courts ``have no license to supplant the jury so
thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Levan's limited partners eventually collected on an $8 million settlement in
class-action lawsuits over the roll-ups, but congressional and regulatory
investigations yielded no criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Levan vs. Capital Cities/ABC Inc., 99-1085.

    VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Shoppers trying to win a free wardrobe stripped and
streaked through dozens of clothing stores across Austria on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Huddling in the buff, in temperatures slightly above freezing, dozens of men
and women waited for the doors of the 40 Kleider-Bauer shops across the country
to be unlocked at 9 a.m. before racing through the premises.

	   The first five streakers at each location to reach the cash register
received a coupon for $357 in new clothes, along with a navy blue bath towel to
cover up.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today, with blue-chip

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges To Work With Govs  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, who takes considerable credit for the
nation's current economic prosperity, pledged cooperation today with governors
trying to make the most of the boom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We begin the new century on a high note,'' Clinton said as he welcomed a
bipartisan group from the National Governors' Association to the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton noted that February marks the nation's longest month-by-month
economic expansion ever, with few signs of a slowdown. ``In the last three
months of 1999, economic growth was 6.9 percent, the fastest in more than a
decade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton meets with the state leaders three times this week, including the
discussion session today.
</P>
<P>
	   He will hear ideas about how to keep the good times going, but he will
likely hear a few complaints, too. Many of the 50 governors worry that the
federal government will stymie states' individual innovations in a variety of
areas, including health care and taxation.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, a Republican and chairman of the bipartisan
governors' association, said the group wants Clinton to hear its debate over
governors' roles in keeping state economies prosperous.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Much of that will reflect our desire that the federal government not
attempt to pre-empt our activities in that regard,'' Leavitt said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also planned to address Democratic governors separately tonight.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday night, Clinton reflected on his waning days in office and asked
politicians who will serve after him not to waste a rare moment of national
economic prosperity and promise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 11 months I will be a private citizen,'' Clinton said as he toasted
most of the nation's governors at the White House. ``Most of you will still be
serving. Remember that. We have the opportunity of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
	   The governors' four-day meeting is centered on the findings in a new
economic report prepared for the group. The report, a copy of which was sent to
the White House weeks ago, concluded that states must aggressively refashion
their governments if they want to continue to compete.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who rose to national prominence as governor of Arkansas in the
1980s, toasted a smaller-than-expected group of 34 governors Sunday night and
noted that this is the 200th anniversary of the presidential election of another
former governor, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Jefferson embraced flexibility in governance, and Clinton urged governors to
do the same as they contend with the challenges of unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who wants to follow Jefferson and Clinton into
the White House, was one of those who missed the menu of grilled Arctic char and
rock shrimp served on the Reagan china. Bush was campaigning for president in
Seattle. His brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, was in Washington for the
governors' conference but skipped the White House dinner.

<HEADLINE> Mad Cow Disease Detected in Denmark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- A case of mad cow disease has been reported in
northern Denmark, the government said today. The 4-year-old cow was immediately
slaughtered while the rest of the 70-head milk herd was put under observation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's totally incomprehensible. In Denmark, we have done all that is
possible to avoid this," Lennart Korsgaard Nielsen, chairman of the Danish
Livestock and Meat Board, said in an interview with public radio.
</P>
<P>
	   The animal, which was born and bred in Denmark, was slaughtered in late
January because it suffered from spasms -- symptoms of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, said Flemming Thune-Stephensen, a
veterinarian with the meat industry's livestock agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The cow's head was sent to laboratories in Denmark and Britain, which
confirmed it had the disease. The result of the test arrived Sunday in Denmark
and the case was made public today, Thune-Stephensen said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, this is our first real case of mad cow on a Danish-born
animal," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   An infected animal was found in 1992 in Denmark, but it was imported from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Government officials were not available for comment before an afternoon news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was detected in a herd in the northern part of the Jutland
peninsula, which has the largest cattle population in Denmark with 364,500 heads
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Panic swept Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s after British-raised
cattle contracted bovine spongiform encephalopathy and it was linked to a
brain-wasting disease in humans. The European Union ruled in August that British
beef was again safe for import, although France has maintained its ban.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in France said today they have detected their eighth case of mad
cow disease this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The milk cow and its herd of 100 were slaughtered as a precautionary
measure, the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement. The affected animal was
found in the Cotes d'Armor region of Brittany.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, authorities discovered 31 cases of mad cow disease in France.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Ministry has said new cases of mad cow disease will break
out in France until 2001, five years after stringent prevention measures were
taken against the disease, which has an average incubation period of five years.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution sums up: Cops "concocted" story to protect Schwarz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal prosecutor charged today that ex-cop Charles
Schwarz and two other officers "concocted a story" to conceal Schwarz's role in
the stationhouse sodomy attack on Abner Louima.
<P>
	   "It has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that that is exactly what
these officers did," Assistant U.S. Attorney Lauren Resnick told jurors in her
summation of the government's case.
</P>
<P>
	   She said that as a representative of the public trust, the officer had the
obligation to tell the truth but failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, she said, "They told one story ... then another and yet another
story here at the trial. They concocted a story to protect one of their own."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege Schwarz 34, held Louima down while Officer Justin Volpe
sodomized him with a broken broomstick in a Brooklyn precinct house lavatory,
then connived with fellow Officers Thomas Wiese, 34, and Thomas Bruder, 37, to
cover up Schwarz's role.
</P>
<P>
	   Resnick's summation was expected to continue until midday; lawyers for the
three officers were then to present their final arguments to the Brooklyn
federal jury. The trial is entering its fourth week.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe is serving 30 years after pleading guilty in May to violating Louima's
civil rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, Schwarz was convicted of assault and civil rights violations and
faces a possible life sentence; he was acquitted, along with Wiese and Bruder,
of beating Louima in a patrol car on the way to the stationhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   At this trial, Schwarz, Bruder and Wiese could get up to five years if
convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
	   The obstruction of justice case is being tried separately because it deals
with statements made by the three officers which were ruled inadmissible at the
first trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first case, the officers were initially charged in state court, but
federal prosecutors took it over in short order.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, a former Marine, denies that he was even in the 70th Precinct
bathroom when Volpe attacked the Haitian immigrant with the broomstick on Aug.
9, 1997, inflicting severe injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, Wiese and Bruder, also say that a flurry of phone calls among them
in the weeks following the incident were not part of any effort to invent an
alibi for Schwarz as the government claims.

<HEADLINE> Altar Egos: Darva &AMP; Rick  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Who wants to pretend this fiasco never happened? Two weeks
after "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?," there's plenty of chagrin for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   To start with, Fox, the unembarrassable network that for once was ruffled
when its arranged marriage between Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger went wildly
asunder.
</P>
<P>
	   Early last week, the network announced there would be no marry-a-millionaire
sequels, in response to a report that a former fiancee of Rockwell once accused
him of hitting and threatening to kill her.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Fox network boss Sandy Grushow pronounced the end (though not for the
first time) of all such "exploitative reality specials," in his words. "They're
gone; they're over," he told The New York Times just hours after Fox aired
"Robbie Knievel's Head-on Train Jump Live!"
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the new "Multimillionaire" missus, an emergency room nurse, was
nursing her own wounds on the TV-interview circuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never wanted the publicity," Conger insisted on NBC's "Today" show as she
caught the next wave of publicity.
</P>
<P>
	   Conger portrayed herself as a "regular, everyday, next-door-neighbor" type
and a devout Christian, to boot. Having been chosen by Rockwell from 50 bridal
contenders, she complained that his glad-to-meet-ya kiss -- a protracted lip
lock -- "was a huge mark of disrespect."
</P>
<P>
	   On ABC's "Good Morning America," Conger explained that "never in a million
years did I ever think that I was going to be selected," but that if she got the
nod, her groom would surely see their matrimony "in the same way that I do: It's
a TV show."
</P>
<P>
	   In other words: Change the channel, hon, I'm driving my new Isuzu Trooper
home to Mom.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm hurting today," the jilted Rockwell confided on "Good Morning America"
(separate interviews, of course, befitting newlyweds who spent their honeymoon
cruise in separate cabins). "I'd hate to have even my worst enemy feel as
hammered as I do right now."
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, Rockwell looked ahead bravely: "I'm hoping we'll all be able to
look back at this and say how much we learned, and laugh."
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell knows laughter. Laughter was his business. In 1990, The Pittsburgh
Press wrote about his standup act at a comedy club called The Funny Bone. "Those
are great earrings," Rockwell reportedly wisecracked to a woman in his audience.
"What are they? Fishing lures?"
</P>
<P>
	   Then, in an interview, he mentioned filming a BVD underwear commercial and
spoke hopefully of his upcoming role in "The Killer Tomatoes Strike Back."
"After 10 years of trying to be in the right place at the right time, it finally
happened," said Rockwell, who, a decade later, was in real estate.
</P>
<P>
	   So where does that leave us, the jilted viewers? Will we be deprived of
"Darva &AMP; Rick" follow-up shows? How about "The Darva &AMP; Rick Christmas Special,"
"Darva &AMP; Rick &AMP; the Blessed Event" and, this being Fox, "Cheaters! World's Most
Embarrassing Video of Darva &AMP; Rick!"
</P>
<P>
	   The names and faces will be different. But don't bet against seeing such
fare, whether on Fox or another network, in an age of voyeur-vision that boasts
upcoming CBS series "Survivor" (which will strand contestants on an island to
compete for $1 million) and "Big Brother" (which will install volunteers in a
home equipped with microphones and cameras).
</P>
<P>
	   Paradoxically, "reality" programming, which networks value for its audience
appeal, depends on the network relinquishing the thing it values most: control.
Ordinarily, a network pays top dollar for actors and micromanages every script
to maximize its hold over what goes on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   But no matter how much Fox may have wanted to control "Multimillionaire,"
how could anyone have scripted its participants' pasts or dictate their behavior
beyond the show's fadeout?
</P>
<P>
	   That's the problem with reality shows. No matter how hard the networks try
to keep the unforeseen in check -- though for "Multimillionaire," it seems, Fox
didn't try very hard -- there's always the chance that circumstances overtake
the merely spontaneous. Careening toward a place beyond amusement. To a place
that no longer serves the network's best interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Nor ours, as we share memories of Rick &AMP; Darva. Oh, great! They are wed to
us!

<HEADLINE> High court rejects bid for new trial in gas station killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Massachusetts man who raped and murdered a
Windsor Locks gas station attendant but was spared the death penalty on Monday
lost his state Supreme Court appeal seeking a new trial.
<P>
	   Christopher Hafford, 35, was convicted in June 1996 of murdering Theresa
Rafferty by stabbing her with an ice pick and clubbing her with a shovel.
Rafferty had 61 wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-judge panel convicted Hafford of capital felony, felony murder,
murder, robbery, burglary and first-degree sexual assault. That same panel
conducted a penalty hearing to determine whether Hafford should be executed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Superior Court panel found that the murder was committed in a cruel and
heinous manner. But the judges spared Hafford's life because they found there
were mitigating factors: his mental impairment and willingness to cooperate with
authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Hafford was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole
and was given an additional 20 years each for burglary and robbery. The
additional terms are to be served consecutively, for an effective prison
sentence of life plus 40 years.
</P>
<P>
	   In his appeal, Hafford had argued, among other things, that the trial court
improperly refused to suppress his confession and that he was denied his right
to a trial by jury.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Supreme Court's 7-0 decision Monday, Chief Justice Francis J.
McDonald wrote that Hafford was well aware of his rights concerning confessions
and was advised of his right to remain silent eight times.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from his confession, the high court concludes there was "overwhelming
evidence of the defendant's guilt independent of his confession."
</P>
<P>
	   Among other things, the court said that Hafford said, "I did it" when
approached by police; his blood was found at the crime scene; and the victim's
blood was discovered on his clothes and on the knife found in his car.
</P>
<P>
	   As to the claim that his right to a jury trial was denied, the justices said
the transcript clearly shows Hafford waiving that right after discussion of the
issue with the judge.
</P>
<P>
	   During his trial, defense attorneys said Hafford was a sexual sadist who was
in the throes of a mindless rage when he killed Rafferty, who was working alone
in her father's service station when the attack occurred in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   The evidence showed she fought back and was conscious through at least part
of the attack.

<HEADLINE> Drug Tests on Pregnant Women Studied  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, tackling a dispute over women's
privacy, said Monday it will decide whether public hospitals can test pregnant
patients for drug use and tell police who tested positive.
</P>
<P>
	   The court must determine whether a South Carolina hospital's policy aimed at
detecting pregnant women who use crack cocaine violates the Constitution's
protections against unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On one level, the question before the court is whether pregnant women have
lesser constitutional rights than other Americans,'' said Simon Heller of the
Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, one of the lawyers representing 10 women
who tested positive.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the women were arrested ``right out their hospital beds, still
bleeding from having given birth,'' he said, as the state used its
child-endangerment law to prosecute women who use illegal drugs while pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Paltrow of the Women's Law Center, another of their lawyers, called the
policy ``bad medicine'' because it deters women from seeking prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the hospital's lawyers nor South Carolina officials had an immediate
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital discontinued its policy after a 1993 lawsuit was filed, but
police already had arrested 30 maternity patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices' decision, expected sometime in 2001, could determine whether
the policy ever gets reinstated and whether other hospitals consider adopting
similar tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina law makes it a crime to ``refuse or neglect to provide
the proper care and attention'' so that a child ``is endangered or is likely to
be endangered.'' The state's Supreme Court has ruled that a viable fetus -- one
able to live outside the uterus -- is a child under the law and has upheld the
law's use against pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina prosecutors have brought such cases dozens of times since
1989, and the nation's highest court refused two years ago to review such
prosecutions. The highest courts in Florida, Kentucky, Nevada and Ohio have
disallowed them, however.
</P>
<P>
	   The law was enacted during the crack cocaine epidemic, but pregnant women
found to have used other drugs have also been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Medical University of South Carolina, a public hospital in
Charleston, officials decided in 1989 to help prosecutors. If a woman's urine
test indicated cocaine use, she was arrested for distributing the drug to a
minor.
</P>
<P>
	   In early 1990, the policy was changed to give drug-using patients a choice
between being arrested and enrolling for treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten women sued the hospital and others in 1993, contending among other
things that the urine testing, performed without court warrants, amounted to
unreasonable searches that violated the Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital treats indigent patients, many of them black. Of the 30 women
arrested, 27 were black. The lawsuit alleged that the hospital policy was
racially discriminatory, but that argument was not raised in the Supreme Court
appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   After a six-week trial, a federal jury ruled against the women. The 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that verdict last July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In light of the documented health hazards of maternal cocaine use and the
resulting drain on public resources, (hospital) officials unquestionably
possessed a substantial interest in taking steps to reduce cocaine use by
pregnant women,'' the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   The policy effectively advanced that interest, it said, adding that the
urine tests ``were minimally intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
	   For those reasons, the appeals court concluded the searches were reasonable
under a ``special needs'' exception to the Fourth Amendment's general
requirement that a search be authorized by court warrant or be based on
``probable cause'' to suspect a crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal called the July ruling a ``radical extension of the special needs
doctrine'' that would let police search without a warrant or individualized
suspicion any time ``the government can present a health or safety reason.''

<HEADLINE> Polls: Bush-McCain tight; Gore big margin in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Two statewide polls out Monday show Texas Gov.
George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain running neck-and-neck among New York's
Republican voters with Al Gore having wide leads over Bill Bradley among
Democrats.
<P>
	   New York's presidential primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   A tracking poll conducted by Zogby International for the New York Post had
McCain favored by 43 percent of likely Republican voters with Bush favored by 42
percent, a statistical tie. Alan Keyes trailed at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, the vice president led former New York Knicks star
Bradley, 53 percent to 32 percent, in the Zogby poll.
</P>
<P>
	   A second poll, conducted by the Siena College Research Institute had Bush
supported by 43 percent of Republicans to 40 percent for McCain, also a
statistical tie. Other candidates - both Keyes and Steve Forbes also have their
names on the New York ballot - gained 4 percent of the support.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Gore led Bradley, 52 percent to 27 percent, in the
Siena poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Zogby's telephone poll, conducted Saturday and Sunday, sampled 450 likely
Republican primary voters and 455 likely Democratic primary voters. The margin
of error for each was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Siena College's telephone poll, conducted Feb. 23-26, had a margin of error
of plus or minus 7 percentage points for the sample of 189 registered Democrats
considered likely to vote in the November election and 8 percentage points for
the 152 Republican voters sampled.

	   "One Endless Night" (Windcharger/Rounder) -- Jimmie Dale Gilmore
</P>
<P>
	   Jimmie Dale Gilmore's new album doesn't set out to reinvent the wheel, and
that's just fine. After a spell with a major label that included the bold and
strikingly original "Braver Newer World," Gilmore returns with this CD to rootsy
twang, as well as the world of indie labels.
</P>
<P>
	   Opening with the title cut, "One Endless Night" is instantly comfortable and
familiar. The shimmering guitars, Zen-cowboy odes and rollicking honky-tonkers
are nothing new for Gilmore, but they make "One Endless Night" a familiar
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
	   Twangy, quavering and utterly unique, Gilmore's voice makes every song he
sings his own. On this album, that includes work by some of the best songwriters
roots music has produced: John Hiatt, Townes Van Zandt and Butch Hancock, among
others.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilmore ventures away from Americana once, with impressive results -- his
edgy version of "Mack the Knife" is a revelation. And while "One Endless Night"
as a whole is not revelatory, it is excellent. Sometimes you just want a cold
Shiner Bock instead of a chimay ale.

	   "Fire &AMP; Skill: The Songs of The Jam" (Epic/Ignition) -- Various Artists
</P>
<P>
	   Darting through traffic like it was on a Vespa scooter with a dozen sideview
mirrors, The Jam distinguished itself from London's late 1970s punk-rock
explosion with a more traditional, but no less engaging, look and sound.
Fashionwise, The Jam favored Mohair suits and Rickenbacker guitars. Their
musical influences were the first wave of '60s British Mod bands (The Who, The
Creation, Small Faces, The Kinks) as well as American rhythm and soul bands. The
Jam's sound went from tight power-pop to rhythm and blues, a style that front
man Paul Weller's later band Style Council would explore further.
</P>
<P>
	   This Jam tribute album, "Fire &AMP; Skill," begins and ends with contributions
by Oasis' Gallagher brothers. Liam Gallagher and Ocean Colour Scene's Steve
Craddock kick things off with a pining "Carnation," while big brother Noel does
an appropriate acoustic take on "To Be Someone."
</P>
<P>
	   Coolest is the Beastie Boys' understated organ-powered R&AMP;B version of
"Start!" with chorus sung by Cibo Mato's Miho Hatori. More soul numbers include
Heavy Stereo's rhythmic rave-up of "The Gift," and "A Town Called Malice" by the
group Gene.
</P>
<P>
	   Everything But the Girl's light turn of the acoustic ballad "English Rose"
is splendid for Tracy Thorn's touching voice and a string section. Easing the
tempo of "Going Underground," Buffalo Tom alters the original to hair-raising
effect. Garbage build up the bitterness of "The Butterfly Collector" and creep
it out with electro dirge beats, dramatic strings and Shirley Manson's
vindictive vocals.
</P>
<P>
	   A slightly more aggressive "That's Entertainment" by Reef; Silversun's
cheery vocals on "Art School"; and Ben Harper's heartfelt but mismatched take on
"The Modern World" represent the collection's more rote renditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Given The Jam's deep discography, "Fire &AMP; Soul" could have used a couple
more songs in this set. But fans should get a kick out of the varied covers
compilation, and also seek out the original recordings.

	   "Copland" (Angel) -- Copland
</P>
<P>
	   Whether or not you are into classical music, you have been listening to
Aaron Copland all your life.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the first distinctly American composers, Copland wrote energetic
music that has been a staple of movies, especially Westerns, and snippets of his
work have become some of the most recognizable music in TV commercials. Copland,
who died 10 years ago, was one of the first classical composers writing for
audiences raised on radio and movie music.
</P>
<P>
	   The new two-CD set by EMI Classics is an opportunity to hear almost three
hours of Copland's music, performed by the St. Louis Symphony, the Dallas
Symphony Orchestra and the Philharmonic Orchestra of the City of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   The set showcases Copland ballets "Billy the Kid," "Rodeo" and "Appalachian
Spring." And, of course, there is the "Fanfare for the Common Man," some of the
most stirring 3 minutes and 39 seconds in music, written to inspire the soldiers
of World War II.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 211.50; Nasdaq Down 50.92  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials soared more than 200 points today as
bargain hunters grabbed shares at reduced prices following last week's big
selloff. Technology issues slumped on a bout of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
211.50 at 10,073.71, topping the 10,000-mark that it fell below Friday for the
first time in more than 10 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was down 50.92 at 4,539.58 as investors cashed in
on the technology sector's recent record-setting gains. Yahoo! was down 9 3/16
at 156 and Intel was off 2 1/16 at 111 3/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 11.83 at 1,345.19.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the stock market has been plagued in recent weeks by fears that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to reduce inflationary pressures in
the robust U.S. economy. Adding to these concerns today was a Commerce
Department report that Americans' personal income rose sharply in January to its
strongest pace in three months.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors worry that as people make more money, they will be inclined to
spend more. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Dow soared today, analysts say the index will likely resume its
volatile pattern in coming weeks as investors continue to shift money into
companies with the best chance for rapid earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
	   That should bode well for the Nasdaq, which analysts said was under pressure
today primarily because investors were just taking profits from the dramatic
gains in the index in recent weeks. The Nasdaq hit new closing highs on
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are asking 'Where can I find earnings growth?" said Alan
Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. "They know that
they can find such growth in technology, Internet and telecom stocks. Those are
outperforming the old economy stocks."
</P>
<P>
	   Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in
Kansas City, Mo., added that "the momentum of this market still rests on the
shoulders of the Nasdaq. This is just a one-day flip from Nasdaq into Dow."
</P>
<P>
	   The volatility in the U.S. stock market prompted selling on financial
markets overseas today. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.49 percent,
Germany's DAX index fell 1.95 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 dropped 1.97 percent,
and France's CAC-40 declined 1.38 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dexter opens books to suitors, including ISP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. (AP) - Dexter Corp., the longest-traded company on
the New York Stock Exchange, said Monday it was considering strategic
alternatives amid a protracted feud with International Specialty Products Inc.
<P>
	   Dexter, a specialty chemicals company, in December rejected a $45-per-share
offer from Wayne, N.J.-based ISP, which is headed by wealthy investor Samuel J.
Heyman.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dexter board called the ISP proposal too low.
</P>
<P>
	   Heyman, who owns 75 percent of ISP and about 10 percent of Dexter, has been
critical of Dexter's takeover of Life Technologies Inc. of Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   Dexter holds 71 percent of Life Technologies; Heyman owns most of the rest
of the company. He has said he believes Dexter and Life Technologies would be
better off apart.
</P>
<P>
	   "Based on the current circumstances that our company is facing, our board
has decided to institute a process in which we will survey all of the company's
available options," Dexter Chairman K. Grahame Walker said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   Walker blamed the move on several factors, including ISP's decision to
prevent Dexter from buying up 100 percent of Life Technologies.
</P>
<P>
	   "The board strongly believes and has confidence in the long-term prospects
for Dexter's growth strategy," Walker said. "However, ISP's self-serving
insistence on a debate confined to a short-term focus coupled with ISP's ability
to prevent Dexter from effectively implementing its growth strategy made it
necessary to explore all other options."
</P>
<P>
	   ISP is among the companies signing confidentiality agreements and conducting
due diligence on Dexter's books, the Connecticut company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dexter has made no decision on pursuing a sale, merger or restructuring, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the outcome, Dexter appears intent on moving quickly, said analyst
Jeffrey J. Zekauskus of Schroder &AMP; Co. The company's news release made a point
of mentioning its desire to maximize shareholder value in the short term, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Life Technologies produces growth media for culturing cells and enzymes
involved in genetic research, making it an attractive prospect for investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded in 1767 as a cloth mill, Dexter was one of the nation's first
conglomerates by the 1830s. It makes products for the aerospace, electronics,
food packaging, and medical markets.
</P>
<P>
	   ISP makes chemicals, mineral products and filters.
</P>
<P>
	   Dexter stock spiked sharply higher Monday, trading at $42 per share - up
$4.5625, or more than 12 percent - by mid-afternoon. ISP shares fell early but
were trading at $6.125, up $.0625 per share, by mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Life Technologies, traded over the counter, was priced at $49.25, down $1
per share.

<HEADLINE> Museum says Oregon Indian tribe has no claim to rare meteorite  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A confederation of Oregon Indian tribes has no claim to
a 15 1/2-ton meteorite that has been owned by the American Museum of Natural
History for 94 years, attorneys for the museum said Monday.
<P>
	   The attorneys asked Judge John Koeltl in papers filed in Manhattan's federal
court to deny the tribes' claim and "remove the cloud" of who owns the
Willamette meteorite once and for all.
</P>
<P>
	   The rare, metallic iron specimen crashed into the earth some 10,000 years
ago and was moved by a glacier to a hillside in West Linn, Ore. Iron meteorites
are considered rare. Of the 25,000 meteorites discovered, only 600 are metallic
iron, court papers said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is also the largest meteorite ever found in the United States and the
sixth largest in the world. Scientists believe it was once part of the core of a
planet that was shattered during the early history of our solar system.
</P>
<P>
	   A museum benefactor purchased the meteorite from the Oregon Iron and Steel
Company in 1906 for $20,600 and donated it to the museum where it has been on
display since 1935. It is the centerpiece of the museum's new $210 million Rose
Center for Earth and Space. The building had to be constructed around the
massive meteorite.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon filed a claim
for the meteorite last September under the federal Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act, saying it was a sacred object to the Clackamas
tribe.
</P>
<P>
	   Clackamas elders sent youths on vigils to the meteorite to await messages
from the spirit world and the rain water collected in its craters was considered
holy, said Ryan Heavy Head, a consultant to the tribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Evan Davis said the museum objects to the claim on grounds that,
among other things, it does not meet the definition of a sacred object under
federal repatriation laws, the tribe never "owned or controlled" the meteorite,
and it did not prove that the museum does not have "a right of possession."
</P>
<P>
	   To qualify as a sacred object it must be a specific ceremonial object needed
for present day American Indians to practice their traditional religions. It is
not sufficient to claim it is "imbued with sacredness," court papers said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said the tribe never owned or controlled the object, another
stipulation of repatriation laws. "Everybody could stop and use the water that
collected in the meteorite," Davis said. "There were no markings on it claiming
they owned it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also cited a 1905 Oregon Supreme Court ruling that said the meteorite was
part of the landscape and was owned by the Oregon Iron and Steel Company on
whose property it sat. Davis said that ownership shifted to the museum after the
iron company sold it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think we have a very strong legal case and await the judge's decision,"
Davis said. A spokesman for the tribes could not immediately be reached for
comment.

<HEADLINE> Drug Tests on Pregnant Women Studied  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, tackling a dispute over women's
privacy, said Monday it will decide whether public hospitals can test pregnant
patients for drug use and tell police who tested positive.
</P>
<P>
	   The court must determine whether a South Carolina hospital's policy aimed at
detecting pregnant women who use crack cocaine violates the Constitution's
protections against unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On one level, the question before the court is whether pregnant women have
lesser constitutional rights than other Americans,'' said Simon Heller of the
Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, one of the lawyers representing 10 women
who tested positive.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the women were arrested ``right out their hospital beds, still
bleeding from having given birth,'' he said, as the state used its
child-endangerment law to prosecute women who use illegal drugs while pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Paltrow of the Women's Law Center, another of their lawyers, called the
policy ``bad medicine'' because it deters women from seeking prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon said the case will not deter
the state's efforts. ``South Carolina's policy of protecting unborn children
from their mother's cocaine abuse will continue even at public hospitals,'' he
said. ``Search warrants can be used as well as consents to search.''
</P>
<P>
	   Condon added: ``There is no constitutional right for a pregnant mother to
use drugs. The unborn child has a constitutional right to protection from its
mother's drug abuse.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital discontinued its policy after a 1993 lawsuit was filed, but
police already had arrested 30 maternity patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices' decision, expected sometime in 2001, could determine whether
the policy ever gets reinstated and whether other hospitals consider adopting
similar tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Carolina law makes it a crime to ``refuse or neglect to provide
the proper care and attention'' so that a child ``is endangered or is likely to
be endangered.'' The state's Supreme Court has ruled that a viable fetus -- one
able to live outside the uterus -- is a child under the law and has upheld the
law's use against pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina prosecutors have brought such cases dozens of times since
1989, and the nation's highest court refused two years ago to review such
prosecutions. The highest courts in Florida, Kentucky, Nevada and Ohio have
disallowed them, however.
</P>
<P>
	   The law was enacted during the crack cocaine epidemic, but pregnant women
found to have used other drugs have also been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Medical University of South Carolina, a public hospital in
Charleston, officials decided in 1989 to help prosecutors. If a woman's urine
test indicated cocaine use, she was arrested for distributing the drug to a
minor.
</P>
<P>
	   In early 1990, the policy was changed to give drug-using patients a choice
between being arrested and enrolling for treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten women sued the hospital and others in 1993, contending among other
things that the urine testing, performed without court warrants, amounted to
unreasonable searches that violated the Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital treats indigent patients, many of them black. Of the 30 women
arrested, 27 were black. The lawsuit alleged that the hospital policy was
racially discriminatory, but that argument was not raised in the Supreme Court
appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   After a six-week trial, a federal jury ruled against the women. The 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that verdict last July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In light of the documented health hazards of maternal cocaine use and the
resulting drain on public resources, (hospital) officials unquestionably
possessed a substantial interest in taking steps to reduce cocaine use by
pregnant women,'' the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   The policy effectively advanced that interest, it said, adding that the
urine tests ``were minimally intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
	   For those reasons, the appeals court concluded the searches were reasonable
under a ``special needs'' exception to the Fourth Amendment's general
requirement that a search be authorized by court warrant or be based on
``probable cause'' to suspect a crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal called the July ruling a ``radical extension of the special needs
doctrine'' that would let police search without a warrant or individualized
suspicion any time ``the government can present a health or safety reason.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Reps. Consider Own Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bracing for a November defense of their House and Senate
majorities, congressional Republicans will push tax cuts this year that will
likely stray noticeably from the proposals of the GOP's top presidential
contenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Though they have made no final decisions, Republican lawmakers say their tax
cuts will almost certainly fall well below the $1.3 trillion in reductions Texas
Gov. George W. Bush has proposed over 10 years. They also are unlikely to
propose trimming income tax rates, as Bush would do.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, congressional Republicans are likely to exceed the 10-year tax
cuts of about $500 billion that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., wants. Eager to avoid
any tax increases, they will probably ignore McCain's plan to raise revenue by
closing corporate tax loopholes.
</P>
<P>
	   Some specific elements of the congressional plan will resemble those of the
presidential hopefuls -- such as proposals to reduce the marriage penalty, the
extra taxes many people owe because they are married. And once Republicans have
chosen their presidential nominee, many will no doubt embrace his tax plan and
lawmakers could make their own proposal closer to his.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the emerging contrast has concerned some Republicans, including House
Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio. Kasich, a Bush supporter, has
argued in internal GOP meetings that the budget Congress writes this year should
leave room for a Bush-sized tax cut.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you spend the money and have a smaller tax cut, you kill Bush's ability
to have a tax-cutting agenda'' if he is elected president, Kasich said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, he has been outnumbered by other Republican leaders. They say this
year's budget fight with President Clinton should focus on the types of tax
breaks Republicans want -- such as for education and health care -- and not on
the magnitude of the overall reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, Republicans have broken their tax cuts this year into separate
bills, rather than as a single package. So far, the House has approved a $182
billion, 10-year reduction of the marriage penalty, while the Senate is debating
an $8 billion plan to expand tax-free savings accounts for families' costs of
public and private schooling.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, many Republicans -- particularly in the House -- want tax cuts
to deflect Democratic claims of a GOP-run do-nothing Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Zip, zero,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, when asked
what effect the GOP presidential race was having on congressional tax-cutting
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have our work to do and schedule to live with,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   A divergence between GOP lawmakers and the party's presidential candidate on
cutting taxes -- long a top Republican tenet -- could make it harder for them to
have a unified tax message this fall. Since the presidential nominee will get
far more exposure during the fall campaign than lawmakers, congressional
Republicans want to be in tune with the nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   Another risk for Republicans during this fall's general election is that
Democrats could focus on differences between GOP tax plans to raise questions
about the wisdom of one proposal or the other.
</P>
<P>
	   The bigger problem would probably be for Republican lawmakers to align their
tax-cutting message with McCain, who has few supporters in Congress. He has
emphasized using budget surpluses to pay down the national debt and buttress
federal retirement programs, rather than the tax-cutting theme that
congressional Republicans have long pushed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's conservative to pay down the national debt, to save Social Security
and Medicare,'' he said Monday at a rally in Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who has many congressional allies, has focused more on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's conservative to cut taxes,'' Bush said shortly after McCain spoke in
a speech in Bellevue, Wash. ``It's compassionate to give your money back.''
</P>
<P>
	   But many congressional Republicans worry that pursuing tax cuts as large as
Bush's would make them vulnerable to Democratic charges that they are
squandering budget surpluses that should be used for debt reduction, Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're just going to have our agenda,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill. ``When our nominee becomes president, he will have an agenda to do
whatever he wants.''

<HEADLINE> Family describes ordeal in which two died  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -A man who killed two people and critically wounded
his pregnant ex-girlfriend was upset about her plans to move away, police said
Monday.
<P>
	   An Onondaga County grand jury will consider the case against Angel
Carrasquillo on Wednesday and could raise the charges against him to
first-degree murder, which would allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty
against the 38-year-old.
</P>
<P>
	   According to statements from survivors and witnesses, Carrasquillo had
complained that his former girlfriend, Nancy Jacinto, had lied to him and was
planning to move to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was upset with Nancy concerning the living arrangements that Nancy was
conducting or planning to conduct. It appears to be domestic related over the
children that they had together," Sgt. Joseph Sweeny said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrasquillo also fathered a 9-month-old daughter with Jacinto.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacinto remained hospitalized Monday. Doctors removed her spleen following
the attack and her condition was improving. Her fetus was not injured, Sweeny
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Court papers provided details about the seven-hour siege Thursday at
Leonardo and Margarita Salvador's apartment that left Margarita, 25, and her
17-year-old brother, Rumenige Jacinto, dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Dalia Santos, a relative staying with the Salvador's, told police she woke
up Thursday morning about 10:30 a.m. and found Carrasquillo in the apartment. He
had a shotgun and tied her hands and legs, she told police. Nancy and Rumenige
Jacinto also were bound.
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Jacinto and Carrasquillo began to argue and he stabbed her in the
chest. Rumenige spoke out and Carrasquillo stabbed him in the back with a
kitchen knife.
</P>
<P>
	   "He left Rumenige there to die and took Nancy into the bedroom," Santos told
police.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrasquillo made the Salvador's two children - ages 9 and 3 - watch
television while the victims were tied up in the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Santos' husband arrived home about 3 p.m. The gun-toting Carrasquillo
ordered Julio Cesar Magana to lie on the floor and tied him up with the others.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a lot of blood on the bed," Magana said. "We both lay there and
Nancy was too weak to speak. She just kept struggling with her breathing and
cried a little."
</P>
<P>
	   A short time later, the Salvador's returned home. Margarita began arguing
with Carrasquillo, who wanted her to lie on the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   "Angel pointed the gun at her and told her if she moved he would kill her,"
Santos told police. "Margarita did not want to get tied up so she said, 'What
are you waiting for? Shoot!"'
</P>
<P>
	   Carrasquillo did, hitting once in the chest with a shotgun blast.
</P>
<P>
	   Leonardo Salvador ran from the house, and Carrasquillo fled in another
direction. He was arrested Friday night near his mother's house after police
received an anonymous tip.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrasquillo will be held without bail while his case is pending.

<HEADLINE> So far, unhappy consumers batting about .500 vs. HMOs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Consumers denied coverage by their health
maintenance organizations for treatment the patients consider medically
necessary are batting about .500 in the state's new appeals process.
<P>
	   Since July 1, unhappy HMO patients can appeal to outside experts to reverse
their insurers' denial of coverage for certain procedures. The Legislature and
Gov. George Pataki in 1998 decreed that the process be set up amid complaints
from consumers, especially those with serious illnesses, of having little
recourse when their HMO refuses to provide coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of 750 requests received by the state Insurance Department for outside
appeal, 305 have been forwarded for review, spokeswoman Allison Klimmerman said.
Of those, 157 HMO denial decisions were upheld and 148 overturned, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   That roughly 50-50 breakdown between patient "winners" and "losers" is about
the same experience that other states with similar outside appeals processes
have had, Klimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think it shows that consumers are taking advantage of this appeals
process and they are getting justice in their health care decisions," Klimmerman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen cases were referred by the department for an expedited appeal -
indicating that doctors attested to the fact that patients were seriously ill or
were in life-or-death situations. Of those, nine denial decisions were reversed
and eight were upheld, according to the Insurance Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The 445 cases which were not forwarded for outside review failed to qualify
for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some were not for something that was medically necessary," Klimmerman.
"Some were complaints like, 'They didn't pay for my eyeglasses' or who knows
what."
</P>
<P>
	   Other cases were rejected by the department because the internal appeal that
consumers must make to their HMO has not been made. Still others were not deemed
eligible for review because the disputed HMO decision took place before July 1,
1999, Klimmerman said. Only those denials after that date are eligible under the
new law.
</P>
<P>
	   Klimmerman said state Insurance officials were somewhat surprised over the
number of appeal requests filed so far.
</P>
<P>
	   Arthur Levin, head of the New York City-based Center for Medical Consumers,
said the numbers of participants in New York's new appeals program also sounded
high to him. He said that because of the relative newness of the program, it is
too early to say whether the large numbers are because of some particular
unhappiness in New York with HMO coverage decisions, or simply because New York
is the largest state to set up an appeals process.
</P>
<P>
	   He, too, said the 50-50 split is typical of such appeals programs in other
states.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is hard to interpret what the numbers mean," Klimmerman said. "I don't
know if anybody has had an opportunity to do a critical analysis to see if 50-50
is a reasonable split."
</P>
<P>
	   The Insurance Department forwards the appeals at random to either the Island
Peer Review Organization of Lake Success, N.Y., or Medical Care Management of
Bethesda, Md.

question - and we have heard it from some consumer groups as well - is whatever

<HEADLINE> Illegal Democratic Donations Alleged  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The independent counsel investigating Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman has charged a Singapore businessman with making $200,000 in
illegal contributions to the Democratic Party through two U.S. businesswomen
with ties to the labor secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   Herman is not mentioned in the Feb. 16 indictment against Abdul Rahman, but
the two U.S. businesswomen, sisters Vanessa and Caryliss Weaver, are named 11
times as the contributors of record for donations which the indictment says
actually came from Rahman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the two years that the independent counsel's investigation has been
going on, they have not shown me one piece of evidence nor have I found any
indication they have any evidence that my clients' contributions were anything
but appropriate,'' Larry Barcella, the Weavers' lawyer, said Monday. Herman's
lawyer, Neil Eggleston, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanessa Weaver and Herman are close friends and Herman, who ran the White
House Office of Public Liaison before becoming labor secretary, took Caryliss
Weaver on a trade mission. Herman had been introduced to Rahman by Vanessa
Weaver on one or two occasions. Rahman was introduced to President Clinton
during the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In applying for an independent counsel investigation in 1998, Attorney
General Janet Reno stated the Justice Department had reviewed allegations that
Herman was involved in soliciting illegal donations from a foreign businessman.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurent Yene, a former partner of Vanessa Weaver, alleged that Rahman made
the donations to help obtain a Federal Communications Commission license for a
company he had ties to. The company obtained an FCC license in 1997 to develop a
telephone satellite system.
</P>
<P>
	   The Weaver sisters urged that the indictment be sealed, saying the
references to them would harm their personal and business reputations. Rahman is
not charged with conspiracy and neither of the Weaver sisters is referred to as
an unnamed co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle refused to seal the indictment,
ruling there was no compelling reason to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Rahman is charged with seven misdemeanors for allegedly contributing
$150,000 to the Democratic National Committee and four state Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Rahman also is charged with a felony for allegedly causing false election
reports to be filed regarding $50,000 in Democratic Party donations made in the
names of the Weaver sisters.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Putin Targets Corruption  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNA DOLGOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin and Communist Party head
Gennady Zyuganov on Monday agreed on at least one thing in their races for the
presidency -- Russia has to eliminate its oligarchy.
</P>
<P>
	   Corruption reaches into the highest levels of government in Russia, where a
powerful, wealthy elite has formed while many ordinary people have sunk into
deep poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is crucial for us to create equal conditions for all, so that nobody
can attach himself to the power and use these advantages for himself,'' Putin
said in a meeting with workers in his campaign for the March 26 election.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyuganov meanwhile told a news conference that he is fighting ``fat cats.''
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, employing some colloquially colorful phrasing, also said Russia needs
``not simply to knock off (corrupt officials), but to know who must be knocked
off and in what way,'' according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin and his predecessors have talked tough about tackling corruption, but
none have followed up with action against high-level functionaries suspected of
bribe-taking, kickbacks and favoritism.
</P>
<P>
	   Government policies are widely believed to be manipulated by a group of
``oligarchs'' -- powerful tycoons with close government connections -- who are
widely despised in Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin has not yet released an election program, although he published an
open letter to voters last week, promising to build a strong state, combat
crime, protect private property, streamline the government and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Putin again said he would not nationalize private assets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The guarantees of property rights are not subject to any revision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Zyuganov -- who is trailing a distant second behind Putin in most
opinion polls -- criticized Putin's lack of a detailed platform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are few specific proposals, mostly good intentions,'' Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
	   His own platform remains little changed since his losing 1996 presidential
bid, calling for partial nationalization of oil and natural resources companies
to raise pensions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm fighting the fat cats, the security regime and all the misinformation
that comes whenever there is an election,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Uncertainty about Putin's personal views and political program does not seem
to have sapped his electoral chances.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll released Monday by the independent Romir agency indicated that about
nearly 60 percent of Russians were ready to vote for Putin, with 23 percent
planning to back Zyuganov. The poll claimed a margin of error of about 4
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Journal Register Co. to sell newspapers in Illinois, Missouri and  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Journal Register Co., which publishes the New Haven
Register, said Monday it plans to sell its newspapers in Illinois, Missouri and
Ohio to boost its stock.
<P>
	   An industry analyst predicted the move will benefit the company by allowing
it to reduce its debt and putting it in position to acquire other newspapers
near its base in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ohio properties to be sold are four daily newspapers with total daily
circulation of 125,825 and Sunday circulation of 140,532: The News-Herald (Lake
County), The Morning Journal (Lorain), The Times Reporter (Dover-New
Philadelphia) and The Independent (Massillon).
</P>
<P>
	   The Missouri and Illinois properties include the Suburban Newspapers of
greater St. Louis, the largest weekly newspaper group in the United States with
distribution of approximately 1.7 million, and The Telegraph (Alton, Ill.), a
seven-day newspaper with daily circulation of 28,048 and Sunday circulation of
30,110.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said the sale will demonstrate Journal Register's underlying
value, which the board of directors said is not reflected in its stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sale of our Midwest properties will increase our financial flexibility
and enable us to further realize shareholder value," Robert Jelenic, Journal
Register chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's stock was trading at $12 a share at midafternoon on the New
York Stock Exchange, near its 52-week low of $11.37 1/2 and well below the
52-week high of $23.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will not sell any newspaper unless it gets "satisfactory
agreements with respect to price and terms," said Jean B. Clifton, Journal
Register executive vice president. Clifton said the company intends to use the
proceeds initially to reduce debt and for other corporate purposes, including
the company's share buyback program.
</P>
<P>
	   "Overall, it looks like a good move," said industry analyst Asa W. Graves of
First Union Securities Inc. Besides allowing Journal Register to shrink its debt
and buy back more stock, the sale will enhance the company's ability to acquire
newspapers near its remaining Northeastern properties, Graves said.
</P>
<P>
	   "One thing they're very good at is taking small, stand-alone organizations
and combining that in an existing cluster," Graves said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although The New York Times Co. and The Thomson Corp. also announced plans
earlier this month to sell newspapers, sellers can still command a premium
because buyers would be interested in adding to nearby existing operations to
gain economies of scale, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   If all of its newspapers in the three states are sold, Journal Register will
be left with 20 daily newspapers with total daily circulation of approximately
483,000 and Sunday circulation of approximately 449,000, and 143 non-daily
publications with total distribution of more than 2.2 million clustered in five
areas in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Journal Register's properties include the Register, Connecticut's
second-largest daily and Sunday newspaper, and 194 non-daily publications. The
company had 1999 total revenues of $470 million.
</P>
<P>
	   It operates in seven regions: Connecticut; Philadelphia and its surrounding
areas; Ohio; the greater St. Louis area; central New England; and the
Capital-Saratoga and Mid-Hudson regions of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Journal Register's announcement is the third large newspaper company
divestiture announcement this month.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, The New York Times Co. said it plans to sell seven of its smaller
newspapers and the nine telephone directories that are part of its Regional
Newspaper Group.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thomson Corp. of Canada announced Feb. 15 that it was selling its U.S.
newspapers, made up mainly of 49 local and regional dailies with circulations of
less than 50,000. Thomson is also putting up for sale five dailies in Canada and
more than 75 non-daily newspapers, most of which are based in the United States.
Its U.S. newspapers have been grouped into 21 regional clusters, the largest
being in Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 291.94; Nasdaq Up 20.67  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials soared more than 290 points today as
bargain hunters grabbed shares at reduced prices following last week's big
selloff. Technology issues, which slumped amid a bout of profit-taking early
today, bounced back in later trading.
</P>
<P>
	   In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
291.94 at 10,154.06, climbing above the 10,000-mark that it fell below Friday
for the first time in more than 10 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index, which fell 124 points earlier today, was up
20.67 at 4,603.79 as technology stocks made a comeback in the final hour of the
session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 11.83 at 1,345.19.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the stock market has been plagued in recent weeks by fears that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to reduce inflationary pressures in
the robust U.S. economy. Adding to these concerns today was a Commerce
Department report that Americans' personal income rose sharply in January to its
strongest pace in three months.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors worry that as people make more money, they will be inclined to
spend more. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
	   But investors brushed such fears aside today and took advantage of the cheap
deals available thanks to the sharp decline in blue-chip stocks over the last
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, analysts warned that the Dow's dramatic rise might be short-lived and
many expect the index to fall back into its volatile pattern in coming weeks as
investors continue to shift money into companies with the best chance for rapid
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
	   That should bode well for the Nasdaq, which comprises many companies that
are on the forefront of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are asking 'Where can I find earnings growth?" said Alan
Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. "They know that
they can find such growth in technology, Internet and telecom stocks. Those are
outperforming the old economy stocks."
</P>
<P>
	   Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in
Kansas City, Mo., added that "the momentum of this market still rests on the
shoulders of the Nasdaq. This is just a one-day flip from Nasdaq into Dow."
</P>
<P>
	   The volatility in the U.S. stock market prompted selling on financial
markets overseas today. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.49 percent,
Germany's DAX index fell 1.95 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 dropped 1.97 percent,
and France's CAC-40 declined 1.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading the Dow's rise today was American Express, which gained 9 3/16 at
133 15/16 and General Electric, up 5 13/16 at 131 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by narrow margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 827.86 million shares, down from 857.3
million shares on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.08 at 558.82.

<HEADLINE> McCain forced to use unknowns in New York battle against Bush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - In New York's presidential primary, George W. Bush
has elected state GOP lawmakers, famous names like Teddy Roosevelt IV and
millionaire lawyers running as prospective delegates.
<P>
	   John McCain has a sandhog.
</P>
<P>
	   Two statewide polls on Monday showed McCain and Bush in a statistical dead
heat in New York. But with New York's complicated election laws set up to make
it as easy as possible for the state party's favorite to carry the state, the
Super Tuesday battle comes down to a fight between Bush's famous friends and
McCain's brigade of nobodies.
</P>
<P>
	   But Christopher Conroy, a 40-year-old tunnel digging "sandhog" who says he's
most at peace when he's 800 feet underground working on the water tunnel from
New York City to the Catskills, isn't worried about name recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   "If people are going to go into that booth and go for McCain, I don't really
believe that even if you put Governor George Pataki's name there, it would
really matter," Conroy, who is working to educate McCain supporters on how the
state's ballot process works, said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Conroy's Brooklyn congressional district, Bush has Roosevelt, the
great-grandson of the nation's 26th president and New York's 33rd governor,
Teddy Roosevelt, as one of his possible delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   "People don't have a problem votin' for me, as long as John McCain comes out
the winner," Conroy said. "We're calling people, sending them mailings, letting
them know that you don't go into that booth looking for John McCain, you have to
look for his delegates."'
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, Republicans vote for delegates - not presidential candidates -
in each of the state's 31 congressional districts. Each district sends three
delegates to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
	   Making things even more difficult for McCain is the fact that delegate names
are printed in bold type. In smaller type are advisories telling voters who each
prospective delegate is committed to.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of that, having big-name delegates is considered a powerful
political plus. Bush, with the backing of Pataki and state GOP Chairman William
Powers, has the names.
</P>
<P>
	   "Republicans walk into a voting booth in a Republican primary, they will see
names they recognize and that they trust," Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   In just one eastern New York congressional district, the Bush delegate slate
includes state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue and
U.S. Rep. John Sweeney. Another upstate district has state Sens. James Wright
and Ronald Stafford as well as former state Sen. H. Douglas Barclay, a
millionaire Syracuse-area lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York City, the Bush names aren't as well known in large part because
of the much smaller number of Republicans - "I think we're outnumbered 15-to-1
in Brooklyn," Conroy said - but names like Roosevelt do show up.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's prospective delegates aren't as well known. While U.S. Rep. Peter
King is a McCain supporter, the Long Island congressman came on board too late
to become a delegate. The best-known McCain backer with his name on the ballot
is Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, a former congressman and the
father of ex-congresswoman Susan Molinari.
</P>
<P>
	   Even McCain's eight-member paid political staff in New York is largely made
up of people with only local political experience. "They have the generals, but
we have the footsoldiers," Gerry O'Brien, McCain's New York political director,
said.
</P>
<P>
	   To counter their delegates' low name recognition, O'Brien and other McCain
supporters have been pitching the life stories of delegates such as Conroy,
hoping voters may remember some of the names once in the voting booths.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno, who said he favors making the ballot clearer by making the
candidate's name bigger than the delegate's, said he nonetheless thinks
Republican voters are smart enough to pick out the candidate they want to vote
for.
</P>
<P>
	   "They know there's a big name and there's a small name, and they're going to
look for that small name," the Bush-backing Bruno said. "Now, will some people
follow me or the lieutenant governor or Congressman Sweeney and feel like, 'I
could go either way, so I'd like to go with people I know?' I hope so."

<HEADLINE> Wild Styles at Mugler, Yamamoto  </HEADLINE>
    By SUZY PATTERSON AP Fashion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- It was serious business at Yves Saint Laurent's fall-winter
show for the Rive Gauche collection Monday, with jovial designer Alber Elbaz
showing enough black to make his last show look funereal, a kind of dark swan
song.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Ford -- creative head of Gucci -- is expected to take over this
prestigious ready-to-wear collection now that Gucci owns YSL. Haute couture,
though, will still be controlled by Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge.
</P>
<P>
	   Though dark, Elbaz's show at the Louvre's Carrousel was very handsome,
featuring knee-length tailored coats, belted coats and leather suits.
</P>
<P>
	   The return of fitted coats was marvelous, especially one tobacco-brown tweed
number worn with high boots. Model Alec Wek looked regal in a knee-length belted
leather coat dress in dark chocolate brown.
</P>
<P>
	   Fluid dresses featured high-wrapped necks and gathered fronts -- like some
of the chiffon blouses for haute couture done by Saint Laurent himself.
</P>
<P>
	   One belted coat shimmered with golden ochre highlights. A suit in deep rose
topped a pair of boots. And an ochre skirt flared beneath a yellow chiffon
blouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Evening wear glittered, starting with gold suits and coats in soft leather
and featuring silver lame, sparkling sheaths and ostrich feathers. Though not as
original as the collections of Saint Laurent, Elbaz's commercial offering was
well-suited to the elegant women.
</P>
<P>
	   What's new, pussycat? was Thierry Mugler's theme this time in an amusing
parade that showed off plenty for cat fans -- including fuzzy angora coats and
wraps, and cat ears on hats and hairdos.
</P>
<P>
	   Mugler, whose shows are usually either spectacular or bare-bones, went for a
compromise this time. Though there were plenty of hot and fitted numbers,
offerings were still tame compared to some of his nuttier creations of the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Little two-piece black skirt outfits showed a bit of midriff, and
Davy-Crockett-style fur hats -- cat ears, tails and all -- crowned the ensemble.
Three-piece outfits in soft moleskin broadcloth were fun, as were the glacier
blue trouser outfits with wide decollete collars on top.
</P>
<P>
	   Fuzzy mohair in colorful wraps covered up smooth pants or skirt outfits.
</P>
<P>
	   Mugler went techno too, combining natural fabrics and shiny threads in
convertible dresses. Hidden stud fasteners and zippers made pants flare and
skirts turn inside out.
</P>
<P>
	   With his Bordeaux velvet and silver lame reversible off-shoulder sheaths, or
the moss green velvet gown with crystal neck plastron and wrist details, Mugler
hit his usual high for sexy, glamorous evening wear.
</P>
<P>
	   Wildlife also intrigued Yohji Yamamoto, who showed at one of his favorite
sites, Pigalle's Moulin Rouge space. But Toulouse Lautrec would have thought
Paris was having a cold wave. Instead of the prancing, dancing girls usually on
display here, the crowd saw wrapped-up beauties, Doctor Zhivago style.
</P>
<P>
	   Film director Wim Wenders ("Paris, Texas," among others) was there to admire
the creator he filmed in a documentary.
</P>
<P>
	   Warm and voluminous, the clothes were reminiscent of a Persian rug or a
Mongolian tapestry.
</P>
<P>
	   But models also came out wearing the softest chamois suede, some sleek black
jerseys and fox trim. The butter-soft leather skirts were jagged at the hems and
worn over flat boots.
</P>
<P>
	   With the fur hoods, muffs and hats -- in fox, wolf, coyote and synthetics --
the models at Louvre's Carrousel looked like they were on a stylish trek to the
Siberian Taiga, though Yamamoto has never been to the far north, his press
office said.

<HEADLINE> Few Clues in 1947 Argentine Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GRAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRES QUEBRADAS, Argentina (AP) -- A frozen hand with long fingernails. Human
bones and torsos preserved in ice. The ripped and faded tatters of uniforms from
a bygone era.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-two years after a British passenger plane vanished in a snowstorm over
the Andes, a rescue team has recovered human remains and pieces of debris in a
risky operation that may help determine what happened to the flight.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, called Stardust and operated by the defunct British South
American Airways, carried five crew members and six passengers. It was headed to
Santiago, Chile, on a flight originating in London, when radio contact was
suddenly lost Aug. 2, 1947.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half a century later, mountaineers stumbled upon the wreckage of
the four-engine Avro Lancastrian. Using their clues, the expedition led by the
Argentine army embarked this month on a five-day trek to recover the remains.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 22, members of the armed forces -- bundled in heavy mountain gear
and working with oxygen tanks strapped to their backs -- struggled for nearly
nine hours at 16,500 feet to gather bits and pieces of the plane's fuselage, a
fuel pump and other artifacts investigators hope will shed new light on the
fatal flight.
</P>
<P>
	   But their work came at the end of a harrowing trip: four hours by four-wheel
vehicle, nine hours by foot and mule, then a seven-hour hike up the 21,848-foot
Tupungato volcano, where debris and human remains were strewn across a glacier.
</P>
<P>
	   Local climbers insist ascending the volcano is more challenging than scaling
Aconcagua, the Andes' highest peak. The trip really requires trekking up two
peaks, first winding up to the top of the Portezuelo del Azufre, a mountain
whose peak sits at roughly 14,000 feet, before making a rapid and treacherous
descent to the base of Tupungato. From there, it's all uphill again.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching the wreckage took its toll. A soldier suffering from breathing
problems had to be brought down, while others struggled to adjust to abrupt
changes in altitude. Some vomited. Blood dripped from their noses in the
oxygen-thin air. Their heads pounded, their balance was thrown off.
</P>
<P>
	   Stubborn mules, weary from grueling climbs through rocky terrain with
hundreds of pounds of equipment on their back, frequently rebelled. Riders were
bucked off. Other mules ran off or lost their footing, stumbling down a
boulder-filled decline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew this would be difficult, especially since we have a group of
journalists who've never climbed before,'' said Lt. Col. Ricardo Bustos, the
expedition leader. ``We in the military do this a lot, and it's tough on us.''
</P>
<P>
	   After reaching the site, officers labored to collect the mummified remains
of at least three passengers, which authorities hope to identify through DNA
testing.
</P>
<P>
	   Working against rapidly changing temperatures -- clouds covering the sun
could cause rapid cooling -- and a beating mountaintop wind, soldiers chipped
away at ice that had kept some remains nearly perfectly preserved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A soldier found this small piece of clothing with a bone attached sticking
up in the ice,'' Bustos said. ``He used an ice pick to chip away at it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The recovered remains -- a frozen hand with long fingernails, several
torsos, and bones -- were placed in brown leather satchels. As soldiers
inspected the pieces, covered in dirt and ice, Bustos asked for a moment of
silence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to remember these people who are no longer with us and the
families who waited for them although they never arrived,'' he said solemnly as
soldiers and journalists bowed their heads. The passengers aboard the plane
included three Britons, a German woman, a Palestinian and a Swiss man.
</P>
<P>
	   The human remains and those of the aircraft were brought down by mule.
</P>
<P>
	   Luis Estrella, an air force official on the expedition, said authorities
were trying to determine if the plane crashed into the face of the volcano. He
said the way the debris was littered might reveal the direction from which the
plane came.
</P>
<P>
	   With little else other than an indecipherable final message, investigators
until now had few details to work from. Some had wondered if the plane had been
sabotaged to kill a British diplomatic messenger reportedly on board.
</P>
<P>
	   But the prevailing assumption of the cause was severe weather. Records
indicate heavy snow fell for three days when the plane vanished, and aviation
experts said the plane -- a converted World War II bomber -- did not have
deicing capability.
</P>
<P>
	   Strangely enough, it was a change in the weather that turned out to be the
biggest break in the decades-long investigation. Higher temperatures in recent
years atop Tupungato forced the ice fields downward and may have helped uncover
the remains, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigator Carlos Sorini said he hoped to have a final report within
months.
</P>
<P>
	   Sorini said he thought this experience could help investigators learn how to
approach solving other plane disappearances in the Andes, a virtual graveyard of
aircraft from the early days of aviation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were a lot of accidents around World War II, and those planes are
still in the mountains somewhere,'' he said, estimating at least five or six
other aircraft are still to be found. ``But we're glad to have at least made
progress on this one.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Volcano Erupts Anew  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEGAZPI, Philippines (AP) -- Belching a column of ash and molten rock four
miles high, Mayon Volcano erupted again Monday, forcing scores of nearby
residents to grab their clothes and cooking pans and run for their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Glowing red lava shot like fireworks into the sky. There were no immediate
reports of casualties after the explosion, which experts said was the most
powerful since Mayon began erupting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The initial explosion Monday was followed by lightning and continuous
rumble, said Ernesto Corpuz of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
Seismology.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayon also emitted pyroclastic flows -- superheated clouds of volcanic ash
that travel up to 50 mph and can instantly incinerate anything in their path.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People should not venture back into the prescribed danger zones'' near the
volcano, Corpuz said.
</P>
<P>
	   The volcano is in Albay province, about 215 miles southeast of Manila.
</P>
<P>
	   In Mabinit village, scores of men, women and children fled, carrying pans,
clothes and other belongings after seeing molten rocks and ash hurtling down
Mayon's slope, news photographer Nelson Salting said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 47,000 people were evacuated from nearby villages, but some have
returned in recent days to check their houses and farms, despite warnings by
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   In nearby Legazpi city, motorists stopped on roadsides to take pictures,
while residents who hadn't been evacuated climbed on rooftops and cheered as the
volcano erupted.
</P>
<P>
	   The repeated explosions indicate that magma is still rising to the dome of
the 8,100-foot volcano, and that volcanic activity could continue for up to a
month, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The volcano has been showing signs of unrest since June, spewing ash-laden
smoke in the sky several times last year, but causing no injuries. An explosion
in September forced more than 5,700 people to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayon's most violent eruption, on Feb. 1, 1814, killed more than 1,200
people and buried an entire town in volcanic mud flows. An eruption killed more
than 70 villagers in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile in southern Iceland, Mount Hekla exploded again Monday, casting
glowing streams of lava down the mountain's snow-covered slopes.
</P>
<P>
	   Hekla, the country's most active volcano, has been erupting since early
Saturday evening, when it sent a column of steam nearly 10 miles into the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   Iceland's coast guard flew over the area Sunday and said lava had moved
about 2 1/2 miles, mostly eastward.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1970, the volcano has erupted about every 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Italy Court OKs Surrogate Motherhood  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A court in Rome gave a childless couple permission Monday to use
a surrogate mother, a ruling that could set a precedent for Italy and drew quick
criticism from the health minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Most European countries either forbid surrogate motherhood or have left the
question in legal limbo -- as does Italy, where lawmakers have yet to settle on
legal guidelines for basic modern fertility treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In any case, letting wombs go for rent constitutes a commercialization of
motherhood,'' said Health Minister Rosy Bindi, whose government is backing
stalled legislation that would ban surrogate motherhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Italy's medical code of ethics prohibits doctors from assisting infertile
couples in finding another woman to bear their implanted embryo.
</P>
<P>
	   The court's ruling came in response to a request from a couple from Rome who
waited nearly five years for court approval. The ruling was seen as likely to
encourage doctors to rewrite their code to allow surrogate motherhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers and medical ethicists said the ruling -- and the alarm it set off
in the government -- showed the need to enact laws to govern fertility
treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   Absent legal guidelines, Italy has earned itself the nickname of a ``Wild
West'' of assisted fertility, with foreign women well into their 60s coming here
to have embryos implanted.

<HEADLINE> Symbols Are Key to Jerusalem Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By SARI BASHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABU DIS, West Bank (AP) -- Hidden in a well-guarded construction site on
Jerusalem's outskirts, workers drill the finishing touches on a four-story stone
auditorium some say will one day be the Palestinian parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   But the gleaming hall is in Abu Dis, a West Bank suburb, and not in
Jerusalem, claimed by Israelis and Palestinians as a capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Abu Dis may become part of the city in the future. Despite public pledges by
both sides never to compromise on Jerusalem, negotiators have considered
redrawing the city's borders in hopes of finding a solution to the stickiest
issue on the table.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, though, Abu Dis has emerged as more of an obstacle than a
solution. Peace treaty talks have collapsed -- and a U.S. envoy failed to revive
them in a weeklong shuttle that ended Monday -- in part because of a dispute
over the status of Abu Dis and Jerusalem's two other Palestinian suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians complain that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has reneged
on a promise to give them control of the suburbs in an upcoming troop
withdrawal. Barak says he made no such commitment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Palestinians feel that every time they negotiate an agreement with the
Israelis, the Israelis renegotiate it,'' said Edward Abington, a former U.S.
diplomat in Jerusalem and now a Washington-based lobbyist for the Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   While Jerusalem is the most difficult issue on the table, Israeli Justice
Minister Yossi Beilin says it may also be one of the easiest.
</P>
<P>
	   Five years ago, Beilin and Mahmoud Abbas, a deputy of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, drafted a plan to expand Jerusalem's borders to include Abu Dis
and create two capitals in the west and east, with areas of shared control in
the middle.
</P>
<P>
	   It was never adopted, but Israeli negotiators say they have again raised the
expand-and-share idea with their Palestinian partners.
</P>
<P>
	   Abu Dis, a neighborhood of about 13,000 Palestinians, straddles the
Jerusalem boundary, with 10 percent in the city and the rest in the West Bank,
under administrative control of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jordanians included Abu Dis in a 1965 plan for greater Jerusalem that
was never adopted because Israel seized the eastern part of the city in the 1967
Middle East war. It was also part of a U.N.-designated international zone for
Jerusalem, proposed in 1947 but never implemented.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 33 years since Israel captured east Jerusalem, Abu Dis has grown from
a sleepy agricultural village to a bustling commercial hub.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-story building under construction there is officially designated an
economic studies center. However, officials privately admit it is the future
Palestinian parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   A rare look inside by an Associated Press reporter revealed an
amphitheater-like hall resplendent with skylight roof, about 500 seats in a
semicircle overlooking a speaker's stand and stone stairs snaking up the sides.
</P>
<P>
	   The site is just yards from Jerusalem's boundary and two miles from the Al
Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site.
</P>
<P>
	   But suggesting Abu Dis could -- or couldn't -- become a capital raises
hackles on both sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian Parliament Speaker Ahmed Qureia, whose home is in Abu Dis, said
the neighborhood is a ``village of Jerusalem,'' but cannot be an acceptable
substitute for east Jerusalem proper.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, who opposes granting the Palestinians a
foothold in the city, warned the Palestinians would use Abu Dis ``for continuous
sabotage activities'' aimed at eventually winning control of east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   The chief Israeli negotiator, Oded Eran, said that in light of such
opposition, Barak did not want to hand over Abu Dis and the other suburbs now,
but only as part of a full peace package. ``Right now, to raise it is not smart
politically,'' Eran said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerusalem's current borders make little historic or demographic sense.
</P>
<P>
	   They were drawn after Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967 and
then added 28 square miles to the municipal area, annexing West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
	   The considerations were purely strategic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The principle was to annex maximum territory with minimum (Arab)
population,'' said Yisrael Kimchi, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute who
helped draw the boundaries.
</P>
<P>
	   The new border largely ignored the natural demography, cutting Palestinian
villages in half. It left Israel with a large Palestinian minority in the city,
now 200,000 compared to 430,000 Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   Moussa Abu Hilal, an Abu Dis storekeeper, said that whatever the outcome of
peace talks, the gerrymandered borders of his neighborhood will not remain as
they are. ``These lines?'' he said. ``No. There will be negotiations.''

<HEADLINE> Debate resurfaces on MTBE ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A week after a state report recommended lowering
levels of MTBE in gasoline, lawmakers renewed the debate over banning the
additive.
<P>
	   Opponents of methyl tertiary butyl ether say it seeps into ground water,
contaminates wells and aggravates asthma and other respiratory ailments. MTBE is
added to gasoline to cut down on car emissions and comply with federal clean air
laws.
</P>
<P>
	   "This committee has been trying to get MTBE out of gasoline for the past six
years," said Rep. Jacqueline Cocco, D-Bridgeport, co-chairwoman of the
Legislature's Transportation Committee. "I hope this year is different. We have
more knowledge about what it does and the effect it has on the water."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Environmental Protection last week recommended in a
report to the General Assembly that MTBE levels be reduced. The report also
urges the gasoline industry to come up with a replacement additive and
re-evaluate the state's underground storage tank program.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said traces of MTBE have been found in 30 percent of the
wells tested in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Lou DeLuca, R-Woodbury, the chief sponsor of the bill that would ban
MTBE, said the additive does little to reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   "The improved technology in automobiles has improved air quality," he said.
"The amount that MTBE adds to air quality is minimal. The risk it poses to water
quality is a more important issue."
</P>
<P>
	   DeLuca pushed for a MTBE prohibition last year, but the scope his bill was
reduced to merely charging the DEP with studying the chemical's effects.
</P>
<P>
	   Gasoline producers and the makers of MTBE say the chemical is not a threat
in the amounts found in groundwater.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Drevna, a director of the Oxygenated Fuels Association, said the
state should impose stricter regulations on underground gasoline storage tanks
and work to replace ones that are leaking. He said some well contamination could
be prevented if people were better educated about how MTBE can mix with ground
water.
</P>
<P>
	   Banning the additive would drive gasoline costs up in Connecticut, because
the fuel would have to go through a special refining process to remove the MTBE,
Drevna said. And using another additive such as ethanol also would increase the
cost of gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe MTBE to be the primary component that has provided clean air
benefits and price stability to Connecticut drivers," Drevna said. "The clean
air benefits and price stability are questions that have to be addressed before
we can consider any phase out - let alone any ban - of MTBE."

<HEADLINE> Mexico Probes Police Chief's Death  </HEADLINE>
   By NIKO PRICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- In this violent border town where killings occur
daily, Tijuana police tried to resolve one more case Monday: the death of their
popular police chief, whose car was riddled with bullets on a busy highway.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators hope a gray Cherokee sports utility vehicle with California
license plates may offer clues in the killing Sunday of Alfredo de la Torre
Marquez.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cherokee was believed to be one of three vehicles used in the attack on
a busy, six-lane divided highway in the northern edge of Tijuana, just across
the border from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre was driving to his office, unaccompanied by his normal
contingent of bodyguards, when gunmen using Kalashnikov rifles and 9-mm pistols
pulled up alongside his black Suburban and fired 99 rounds at him, officials
said. The vehicle crashed into a palm tree on the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Juan Manuel Salazar said De la Torre had told his
bodyguards that he had planned to stay home all day. It was not known why he
decided to go to his office. De la Torre was carrying a pistol, but apparently
didn't use it.
</P>
<P>
	   No one has been arrested and the motive of the killing is unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   Enrique Tellaeche, spokesman for the Baja California state Attorney
General's Office, said the killing was ``obviously linked to organized crime,''
but said it was too early to tell whether it was connected to the Tijuana-based
drug organization led by the Arrellano-Felix brothers, which is notorious for
its gangland-style hits.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration considers the organization one of
the most powerful and violent drug trafficking groups. One of the brothers,
Ramon Eduardo, is on the FBI's 10 most-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre had been a police officer for 25 years, working his way up from
motorcycle cop, and may have made many enemies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only motive for the killing is his job,'' said Jaime Valencia, a
police forensics supervisor who, like all his colleagues, wore a black band over
his badge. ``A person who does his job well goes against the interests of the
bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said de la Torre was loved by his fellow officers. ``He was the best
director we've had.''
</P>
<P>
	   Baja California is one of Mexico's most violent states and Tijuana is one of
the most violent cities. It recorded about 300 murders last year and the pace of
killings has picked up this year.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre is the second Tijuana police chief killed in six years. In April
1994, Federico Benitez and a bodyguard were shot to death when gunmen opened
fire on their vehicle as it drove down a highway near the city's airport.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech while visiting the state Friday, President Ernesto Zedillo
pledged to have federal and state officials improve cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Organized crime has brought to Baja California a trail of violence, a
trail of intimidation,'' he said. ``We have to make these criminals understand
that Baja California can't be their home, that the only places where they
deserve to live are in prisons.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 55 percent of the cocaine used in the United States is shipped through
Mexico or Mexican waters, according to U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the United States, under its annual ``certification'' program,''
will announce which countries are cooperating in the fight against drug
trafficking. Mexico's certification is virtually assured, but the process always
results in hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexicans consider the process humiliating and a violation of their
sovereignty. They say they are suffering from drug violence, especially on the
border, largely because the United States has done little to reduce its
consumption of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre is also the second police chief in a border city to be killed in
a week. Juan Angel Cabrera Leal, the police chief in Reynosa, was shot to death
last Tuesday. Reynosa is across the border from McAllen, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Study finds less than one in three college students have sprinklers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Two in three students living on New Jersey college
campuses occupy dorm rooms without fire suppression sprinklers, according to a
state study done in the aftermath of last month's fatal fire at Seton Hall
University.
<P>
	   The New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority, the state's lead agency in
the construction of new college buildings, released the results Monday to a
Senate committee. The lawmakers were considering legislation to mandate
sprinklers in every dorm room in New Jersey and provide $50 million in state
financing to pay for their installation.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found only about 15,290 beds in student dormitories in New Jersey
were in rooms equipped with sprinklers. That's about 29 percent of the total of
51,913 beds in the dorms at colleges and universities, both public and private.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the medium-sized and larger universities, three - Rider, Kean and Seton
Hall, site of the Jan. 19 fire that claimed three lives - have no sprinkler
coverage in any individual dorm rooms, although some buildings do have
sprinklers in common areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutgers University has sprinklers in 32 percent of its dorm rooms, Princeton
University in 14 percent. Of other large schools, The College of New Jersey had
the highest percentage of its rooms equipped with sprinklers, 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Public colleges average 39 percent sprinkler coverage in rooms, while at
private colleges only 13 percent of the rooms had sprinkler coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The Educational Facilities Authority survey was one colleges and
universities were required to answer since the authority has provided financing
to virtually all of them.
</P>
<P>
	   It pinpointed student-occupied rooms specifically, rather than asking a more
general question as to whether sprinklers existed at any location within a
residential building.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, in the aftermath of the Seton Hall tragedy, officials when
asked about sprinklers were told that four out of six dormitories had them. But
these sprinklers were installed only in common areas. The survey released Monday
said none of Seton Hall's six dormitories has sprinklers in students' rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   William Cane, executive director of the New Jersey Fire Safety Commission,
said a 1991 law required every new dormitory to include sprinklers in every
room. As with any such update to safety codes, however, the law did not apply to
existing buildings, only to new construction or buildings facing substantial
renovation.
</P>
<P>
	   Cane said while hallway sprinklers might have knocked down the Seton Hall
fire, which occurred in a third-floor lounge area, dorms need sprinklers in
every room to be safe since the greatest fire risk exists within students'
rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   "Partial coverage does not provide safety," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Facilities Authority director Victor Cantillo said colleges and universities
estimated that $85 million would be needed to install sprinklers, and industry
experts said a sudden rush to do the projects could drive the costs higher.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mixed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices were mixed Monday in choppy trading
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat led the declining commodities, falling on the outlook for continued
wet weather in much of the U.S. winter wheat belt. Prices fell about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn also fell, pressured by the threat of large deliveries being made
against the March contract. The delivery day is Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans rebounded from last Friday's fallback, when prices hit their lowest
level in more than a month. But trading was quiet and the gains were limited by
beneficial crop weather in South America over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for May delivery fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.56 3/4 a bushel; May corn fell
 3/4 cent to $2.20 3/4 a bushel; May oats rose  1/2 cent to $1.15 1/2 a bushel;
May soybeans rose  3/4 cent to $5.06 1/4 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef and pork futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   April live cattle rose .15 cent to 71.47 cents a pound; March feeder cattle
rose .20 cent to 83.47 cents a pound; April lean hogs rose .70 cent to 58.35
cents a pound; March pork bellies rose .52 cent to 90.52 cents a pound.

<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Like many 23-year-olds, Hirotada Ototake goes to college,
likes basketball and looks forward to getting married someday.
</P>
<P>
	   But when he cruises down the street, he causes a sensation: girls call out
his name and strangers try to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
	   Ototake, who was born without arms and legs, is one of Japan's most famous
personalities: a best-selling author, a prime-time news anchor, a sought-after
public speaker.
</P>
<P>
	   And he is making Japan think about an issue it has long avoided -- society's
responsibilities toward the disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite its tremendous wealth and technology, Japan is a very difficult
place to live for its estimated 3.2 million people with physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Obstacles to wheelchairs abound, from flights of stairs to cramped
restaurants and stores. Most train and subway stations do not have elevators --
although a law approved by the Cabinet this month aims to improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   By putting a human face on the issue, Ototake has made many Japanese
consider the difficulties the disabled face in a new light.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Japan, everyone just assumes that the disabled are people you feel
sorry for,'' he said in an interview. ``But I'm not pitiful. I enjoy my life,
and I want to tell people that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ototake gained nationwide fame in 1998 after publishing a hugely popular
autobiography that challenged traditional Japanese notions about disability.
</P>
<P>
	   The book, ``No One's Perfect,'' surprised many with its honest but upbeat
portrayal of living without limbs. With a photo of the smiling Ototake on the
cover, it describes everything from the difficulties of navigating a wheelchair
in the snow to the author's joy at receiving his first love letter.
</P>
<P>
	   The book has sold 4.4 million copies in Japan and has been translated into
three languages. An English version will be released in the United States in
September.
</P>
<P>
	   Ototake writes that he's come to think of disability as nothing more than
being fat or thin, tall or short. He doesn't deny that some things are hard for
him, but tries to keep busy instead of getting depressed.
</P>
<P>
	   And busy he is.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with the writing and TV appearances, Ototake says he particularly
enjoys speaking to grade school students because they aren't afraid to ask blunt
questions.
</P>
<P>
	   He's about to graduate from one of Japan's most prestigious universities,
although he admits his hectic schedule leaves him little time to study for final
exams.
</P>
<P>
	   His high profile is in itself a challenge to tradition in this often
conformist society, where many disabled people stay at home and out of sight, or
are shunted off to special education, where activists say they learn little
about how to function in the real world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Japanese have trouble accepting people who are different,'' Ototake
said. ``This makes it a hard place to live.''
</P>
<P>
	   But little by little, that appears to be changing:
</P>
<P>
	   -- The Winter Paralympics in Nagano brought the issue into the national
spotlight in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In Osaka, Japan's second-largest city, Taihen, a group of physically
disabled dancers, is winning attention at home and international acclaim with
their performances.
</P>
<P>
	   -- The most popular prime-time drama on television this season, ``Beautiful
Life,'' tells the story of a love affair between a hairdresser and a young,
wheelchair-bound woman.
</P>
<P>
	   Ototake, however, has been the most effective agent of change.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to an elementary school teacher who forced him to get out of his
wheelchair, he learned to walk by scooting along the ground. He writes by
holding a pen between his cheek and the stub of his left arm.
</P>
<P>
	   On his first day of middle school, Ototake stunned his parents by joining
the basketball team.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You alone decide if you're going to be happy,'' Ototake said. ``Of course,
I sometimes wish I looked as good as some Hollywood star, but who doesn't?''
</P>
<P>
	   Makoto Nakazawa, a physically disabled activist and employee at a large
manufacturing company, says it's optimism like this that accounts for Ototake's
appeal among the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Japan, the disabled and the able-bodied live in separate worlds,'' he
said. ``This book has lowered the wall a little.''

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Gov. Supports Clinton  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite growing protests at home, the governor of Puerto
Rico met with White House officials Monday and reaffirmed his support for
President Clinton's plan to resume limited Navy exercises on the island of
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello also took possession Monday of 110 acres of land on the
western end of Vieques that the Navy transferred to local control, part of a
deal to allow renewed training before island residents decide whether to
permanently bar the exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first step in the overall resolution of the issue was taken today,''
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said following the meeting between
Rossello and White House chief of staff John Podesta. ``There's obviously a
number of other steps that will have to be taken, including a referendum where
the people of Vieques will decide their future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, some 85,000 people demonstrated against the training in San Juan,
Puerto Rico. But Rossello insisted that the administration's proposal was the
best solution to the standoff between Vieques islanders and the Navy's need to
maintain combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that as details of the proposal become more widely known, ``it will
allow much more support for all aspects of that presidential order.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy has not announced a date for resuming training, but Rossello
pledged the Puerto Rican government's full cooperation in clearing the test
range of protesters. ``We will take any steps that are appropriate to make sure
that the range is available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Protests about the safety and environmental risks posed by the Navy's use of
Vieques have placed a hold on the training exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and Rossello agreed last month to allow the Navy to resume limited
training using inert bombs. The pact calls for a referendum, likely to be held
in 2001, that will allow Vieques residents to choose between the unfettered
resumption of training with live bombs and exercises with dummy bombs until a
Navy withdrawal in May 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossello's opponents criticized him for abandoning a pledge to stop all
bombings on Vieques immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, the Clinton administration is seeking $40 million to address
the health and environmental concerns raised by the training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people of Vieques have placed on the table concerns as to what has
happened to their health, to their environment, to their opportunity for
economic development,'' Rossello said. ``The funds that are requested are
precisely to respond to those very valid concerns.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 110 acres transferred on Monday were to be used to extend an airport on
Vieques to allow larger aircraft to use the facility and to stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
	   A deed for the land was drawn up and signed by Rossello and Adm. Kevin
Green, commander of Naval Forces South, in a small ceremony, said Maria
Echaveste, deputy White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The governor believes that actually taking steps to implement the
president's directives would be helpful in helping reduce the level of
opposition down in Puerto Rico,'' Echaveste said. ``We thought it would be good
if (they) formalized those steps.''

<HEADLINE> Cops in Diallo shooting undecided about future, lawyers say  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Three days after they were acquitted of murdering Amadou
Diallo, four police officers are all "decompressing," and have not yet decided
whether they will return to the force, their lawyers said Monday.
<P>
	   If they do return to duty, will they be able to do their jobs? Maybe, say
criminologists.
</P>
<P>
	   "They may really want to go back to police work and now that they've been
acquitted, feel they have a right to do so," said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal
justice professor at the University of South Carolina. "But rightfully or
wrongfully, they've killed someone. They should go through some serious
psychological testing to see if they're fit for duty."
</P>
<P>
	   But would they be safe on New York City streets? So far, the NYPD thinks
it's worth posting police outside the officers' homes because they've received
threats. Amid the angry response of thousands since the "not guilty" verdicts
were announced, the answer may be "no."
</P>
<P>
	   "Killer Cops!" screamed signs at weekend rallies, with pictures of all four
officers plastered on them.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't let them get away with it!" read another sign.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, the four officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon
and Richard Murphy - remain on modified duty, meaning they are assigned to desk
jobs and their badges and guns have been taken away. Pending departmental
reviews of the shooting as well as possible federal civil rights action, it
could be months before Police Commissioner Howard Safir considers restoring the
officers to full duty.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Carroll reportedly has expressed an interest in returning to the
force, his lawyer said the final decision has yet to be made.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's reflecting and he is trying to decompress," John Patten said. "I just
told him chill out, stay calm, be at peace. He needs to make his thought process
become a little clearer first."
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the three other officers said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
	   "My guy is really taking these next couple of days to think," said
McMellon's attorney, Stephen Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's too early for Rich to decide what he wants to do," said Murphy's
attorney, James Culleton.
</P>
<P>
	   "He really wants his 15 minutes to be up and he wants to fade back and live
his life," said Boss's attorney, Steven Brounstein.
</P>
<P>
	   It wouldn't surprise criminologist William Geller if one or all of the
officers decided to leave the force for good.
</P>
<P>
	   "A study done some years ago found that officers involved in fatal
encounters had a much higher likelihood of retiring prematurely," said Geller,
co-author of "Deadly Force: What We Know," a book about police shootings
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   A police shooting is an "immense event in the life of a cop," Geller said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unlike soldiers, cops are not taught to kill, they are taught to protect,"
he said. "Once he's been involved in a shooting, the cop can find himself
questioning the 'God complex. Who am I to take a life,' he asks."
</P>
<P>
	   But Geller, Alpert and others say the NYPD's concern should not be whether
the officers are restored to full duty, but how to prevent another Diallo
tragedy. The officers fired 41 times at Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building, mistakenly thinking the wallet he was holding was a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the February 1999 shooting, the officers were all part of the
Street Crime Unit, a band of plainclothes officers who roamed citywide looking
for illegal guns and patrolling high crime neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of problems with a case like Diallo is having citywide police units
that can't possibly know all the neighborhoods and parachute in," Geller said.
</P>
<P>
	   "However many inches thick the manual for police rules is, the most often
ignored rule is the 'Golden Rule' when it comes to approaching people," he added
- meaning treat people as you would have them treat you. "Police need to think,
'Suppose that was my brother, my sister,' when they approach people. That might
make encounters a lot safer."
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition,
agrees, but concedes that it's a hard thing to teach.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know of any training that will make a police officer perfect,"
Meyers said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Ventura Mull Cuba Trade  </HEADLINE>
   By FREDERIC J. FROMMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura urged President Clinton to
increase funding for special education and questioned why the United States
doesn't establish normal trade relations with Cuba during a visit to the White
House Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Clinton commended him for having the ``courage'' to leave the
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
	   As usual, Ventura was the celebrity of the annual National Governors
Association meeting, drawing a pack of journalists, admiring hellos from Secret
Service officers, and at least one request for a photograph.
</P>
<P>
	   And he did nothing to dampen his place in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Washington is always receptive to Minnesota because we're really the
leader of the country, when it comes to making decisions and electing rogue
governors and taking chances and having courage and intestinal fortitude,'' he
declared after the meeting with Clinton and other governors.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura said Reform Party politics came up in a conversation with the
president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He commended me for my courage in my decision to step away from the Reform
Party,'' Ventura said. ``He said that took a lot of guts, but it was the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura's most important message to the White House was to increase funding
for special education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Quit dilly-dallying around with all the feel-good stuff; fund their
mandate with special ed, and we in the states will have the best education
systems we possibly can if they do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trade also came up at the meeting, and Ventura said he supports Clinton's
efforts to allow China into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To me, in light of our world of technology, you can't build a wall around
your country,'' he said. ``You go out and you compete.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he called it a ``bit of hypocrisy'' to pursue normal trade relations
with China while maintaining a trade embargo against Cuba. Several lawmakers
from farm states like Minnesota have made similar arguments, seeing Cuba as a
potential market for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wanted a clearer message on why China and not Cuba,'' Ventura said.
``They gave me a lot of reasons that didn't hold a lot of water.''
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, the chairman of the governors association, Republican Gov.
Mike Leavitt of Utah, had to literally move Ventura along.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've never been able to figure out how to move Jesse Ventura aside, but we
have to report on the meeting,'' he said with a laugh.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Earns, Revenues Up  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Savings from combined operations and hot-selling
Jeeps and Mercedes-Benz luxury cars helped push earnings at automaker
DaimlerChrysler AG up 32 percent for the fourth quarter and 16 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts applauded the results Monday of the firm's first year as a merged
entity. Daimler-Benz bought out Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler Corp. in
late 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors also liked the figures, bidding shares up 2.4 percent, or 1.60
euros, in Frankfurt to close at 67.40 euros ($65.37). In New York, shares were
also up $2 to $65,50 in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
	   The German-American company said Monday it earned $1.6 billion, or $1.60 a
share, excluding one-time charges and gains in the last three months of 1999
compared to $1.21 billion, or 61 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for the quarter also rose 20 percent to $41.7 billion from about
$34.8 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, DaimlerChrysler earned $5.8 billion, or $5.77 a share, up from
$4.8 billion, or $5.05 a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler said it beat estimates of $1.54 a share for the quarter and
$6 a share for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "All the major figures were encouraging," said Andrew Blair-Smith, an auto
analyst with Commerzbank in London. "Any differences are not enough to make me
worry."
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding one-time gains from the sale of a stake in Debitel communication
services and charges from restructuring at its Adtranz train division, the auto
giant reported net income rose to $6.27 billion or $6.25 a share for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   That compares with $5.387 billion, or $5.62 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "1999 was our first full year as a combined company and it was very
successful," said co-chairman Juergen Schrempp. "But size is not an end in
itself. Profitable growth is the yardstick of success."
</P>
<P>
	   "We have created a solid foundation for a company that will also be a medium
and long-term winner," Schrempp said. "We launched nine new models last year,
and they became success stories. In 2000, we will bring another 12 car and truck
models to the market."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, revenues rose 14 percent to $151 billion from $132.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Key to the report was nearly $1.2 billion in savings achieved by combined
efforts on back office functions and purchasing. Still, it was disappointing
that these savings merely helped the company maintain its profit margins instead
of improving them, said Georg Stuerzer, an auto analyst at Hypo-Vereinsbank in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
	   A one-time tax hit also helped suppress the bottom line in 1999. Due to
changes in German tax law, the company's tax bill rose 50 percent from 1998 to
$4.56 billion. A weak euro also hurt results.
</P>
<P>
	   All figures are based on the exchange rate of $1.007 per euro in effect on
Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   During 1999, the company said its Chrysler car division revenues climbed 14
percent to $64.5 billion. Its adjusted operating profit was up 22 percent, to
$5.2 billion. Revenues were helped by a 20 percent increase in Jeep sales, to an
all-time high of 680,700 units.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mercedes-Benz and Smart car division had an operating profit in 1999 of
$2.7 billion, up 36 percent, on record revenues of $38.4 billion. Sales of
Mercedes-Benz passengers cars were up more than 10 percent for the year. Sales
of the compact Smart car, available only in Europe, achieved its goal of 80,000
units for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's commercial vehicles division had operating earnings of $1.1
billion, a 13 percent increase over last year. Its services division posted an 8
percent gain in operating earnings, to $1.03 billion. Those results exclude a
one-time gain of $1.15 billion from the sale of Debitel.

<HEADLINE> EU Chooses German IMF Candidate  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL AMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union took action Monday to prevent a
non-European from becoming the next head of the International Monetary Fund,
naming a German as its unanimous choice to face rivals from the United States
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Finance ministers from the 15 European Union nations backed Caio Koch-Weser
after weeks of wrangling over the German deputy finance minister's
qualifications to replace Michel Camdessus as IMF managing director.
</P>
<P>
	   "Koch-Weser is a strong candidate for the role and we ... support him,"
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said. Britain and France had
previously expressed reservations about his nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The job has traditionally been reserved for the Europeans' chosen candidate,
but after the EU nations began bickering over Koch-Weser, other names emerged.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan has won Asian support for its nominee, Eisuke Sakakibara, a former
deputy finance minister, and African nations are backing the IMF's deputy
managing director, Stanley Fischer of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Monday that President Clinton would
not support Germany's candidate and would hold out for a more prominent
European, despite Fischer's presence in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said Clinton told German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder that he does
not believe Koch-Weser meets criteria the IMF post requires: "a strong candidate
of maximum stature" who would enjoy broad support from other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   French Finance Minister Christian Sautter said his government backed
Koch-Weser rather than see an American get the job.
</P>
<P>
	   "What accelerated the EU decision was (partly) the presence of a candidate
with American nationality, which provoked a very strong European reaction,"
Sautter said. "That pushed us into reaching a consensus on the German
candidate."
</P>
<P>
	   The appearance of competing candidates has raised concerns the 182-nation
IMF could be in for a bruising leadership battle similar to the one that left
the World Trade Organization with a power vacuum for months last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch-Weser acknowledged it would be difficult to win over the rest of the
world. "It's important now to create consensus and trust," he said. "My chances
are not bad, but there's a lot of work to be done."
</P>
<P>
	   Koch-Weser, 55, worked at the World Bank for 25 years before joining the
center-left government in Berlin last year. He was strongly supported by
Schroeder, but ran into France and British concerns about his low political
profile and lack of experience at the highest level of international finance.
</P>
<P>
	   Asian, Latin American and African officials are unhappy with the customary
carving up of top jobs at the international financial bodies between the United
States and Europe. The head of the World Bank is traditionally an American,
while a European, usually a Frenchman, leads the IMF.

<HEADLINE> 11 Sudan Aid Organizations Withdraw  </HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG NELSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- At least 11 international aid organizations were
completing their withdrawal Monday from southern Sudan after refusing rebel
demands for higher taxes and more control over assistance to the war-ravaged
region.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 160 aid workers began leaving southern Sudan on Thursday following a
rebel ultimatum to comply with new terms for aid deliveries or face expulsion by
Wednesday, aid officials said in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
	   The pullout interrupts 75 percent of the non-United Nations aid operations
in southern Sudan and affects up to 1.5 million people at a time when food
stocks are low ahead of the major planting season that begins in late May, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Care, World Vision and Save the Children were among the organizations that
suspended aid operations in Sudan and withdrew their staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Catholic Relief Services, Lutheran World Federation and 22 other aid groups
have agreed to the rebel conditions and signed the accord, said an official for
Operation Lifeline Sudan, the U.N.-led umbrella organization that oversees the
decade-old aid relief operation.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. agencies like UNICEF and the World Food Program were not entangled in
the dispute. They operate under a separate accord with the rebels and the
Sudanese government in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
	   The aid operation in southern Sudan, based in the northern Kenyan town of
Lokichokio, is one of the longest-running and largest in the world, with about
35 groups and 500 expatriate workers delivering a million dollars a day in aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Elijah Malok, who heads the relief arm of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, acknowledged that the pullout would cause hardship among southern Sudanese
but said the donors would have eventually grown weary and pulled out on their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people are going to suffer sooner or later,'' he told The Associated
Press. ``We are telling the people, 'You must be self-reliant.' We are telling
the people, 'You must produce your own food.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Aid groups have paid taxes to the rebels since 1995. An Aug. 19 draft
memorandum of understanding called for additional fees for the use of airstrips,
roads and trucks in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   It also recommended rebel control over the hiring of Sudanese staff by the
relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks over the draft memorandum continued until Jan. 12, when the rebels
unexpectedly issued their ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
	   The war between government forces and southern-based rebels is Africa's
longest running conflict. Since 1983, the fighting has killed more than 2
million Sudanese and chased another 4 million from their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   While the civil war is often perceived as a religious war between the
Islamic north and the Christian south, it is the southern rebels' drive for
political autonomy from the Khartoum government that is at the core of the
conflict.

	   St. Louis-based Milnot's largest subsidiary is Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp.
Together, Heinz and Beech-Nut make up about 24 percent of the U.S. prepared baby
food category.
</P>
<P>
	   That's still a far cry from Gerber, the industry leader with 73 percent of
the market.
</P>
<P>
	   "Although we will still be a distant second to Gerber, a combination of
Heinz and Beech-Nut will provide the critical mass to make the U.S. baby food
market more competitive, innovative and dynamic," said William R. Johnson, Heinz
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Meader, Milnot president and CEO, said, "It will create a powerful,
national competitor from two regional players, producing for the first time a
credible challenger to Gerber."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Milnot's baby food business, Heinz will acquire the company's
other branded and private-label businesses. Those include Milnot brand
evaporated and sweetened condensed canned milk; and Chilli Man brand canned
chili.
</P>
<P>
	   A news release announcing the deal did not specify whether jobs would be
affected. Phone messages left at both companies were not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> O'Connor still ailing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Cardinal John O'Connor was still ailing Monday but
remained in his residence under doctors' care.
<P>
	   "At this point they're not looking at hospitalization," said his spokesman
Joe Zwilling. "They do want to evaluate how he's doing and determine what they
might need to do if anything."
</P>
<P>
	   Zwilling added that O'Connor, who missed the public Mass at St. Patrick's
Cathedral on Sunday, is "suffering from some pronounced weakness. He has not
been able to function as he has in the last several weeks. ... He's not been
able to work normally at his residence. The doctors don't know what is causing
that. But they are looking at it and seeing if it progresses. He spends a good
deal of time in bed, but he's not bedridden."
</P>
<P>
	   Zwilling also said that O'Connor was aware of the contents of the letter
sent to him over the weekend by George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has not made any comment on the letter at all," Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican presidential candidate sent the letter to explain his
appearance at Bob Jones University, a South Carolina institution associated with
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's decision to contact the cardinal 10 days before the New York primary
shows just how much influence the cardinal continues to wield, despite the
decline in his health. He is considered one of the most powerful Catholics in
the United States, and at age 80, is the country's oldest active bishop.
</P>
<P>
	   Although O'Connor offered his retirement to the Vatican when he turned 75,
as church rules require, the pope did not accept it then. However, cardinals
lose their power to vote for a new pope when they turn 80, and John Paul II is
widely expected to name a replacement for O'Connor some time in the next few
weeks. Those announcements are traditionally made in Rome on a Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwin O'Brien, who heads the Archdiocese for the U.S. Military, and
Buffalo's Bishop Henry Mansell are said to be among those under consideration to
replace O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
	   The Daily News reported Monday that the bishop of the Fall River, Mass.,
diocese, a Franciscan friar named Sean O'Malley, is high on the list of likely
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   John Kearns, spokesman for the Fall River diocese, said: "There's always a
lot of speculation about who might go where. In the past he's been rumored to go
to other places. We don't know."
</P>
<P>
	   Zwilling said it was impossible to predict who the next cardinal would be,
pointing out that O'Connor - then the bishop of Scranton, Pa. - was a surprise
choice when he was picked to replace Cardinal Terence Cooke.

<HEADLINE> Chechnya Rights Probe Backed  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGELA CHARLTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Surrounded by war-ruined buildings and shattered
lives, Europe's top human rights advocate called Monday for rebuilding
Chechnya's capital and said he would press for an investigation of claims of
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   Alvaro Gil-Robles, human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe, made
the statements on a one-day trip to Grozny, accompanied by Col. Gen. Gennady
Troshev, the top commander of the Chechnya offensive, and Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
acting President Vladimir Putin's news media point-man for Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   The trip did not take Gil-Robles to sites where refugees and human rights
groups have alleged that Russian troops committed atrocities such as executions
and torture.
</P>
<P>
	   Gil-Robles brushed off questions about atrocities and said, ``I am fully
satisfied with our cooperation and with the assistance Russia has rendered to
make this visit possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added that he would continue to press for investigation of human rights
abuses when he returns to Brussels on Tuesday. He said Russian authorities had
agreed that a human rights group could open an observer mission in Gudermes,
Chechnya's second-largest city, within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly shocked by the vast damage suffered by Grozny during six months of
war, Gil-Robles said: ``it is necessary to stop this war as soon as possible.
It's necessary to help this population.''
</P>
<P>
	   Troshev and Yastrzhembsky both said the fighting, now focused in the
southern mountains where rebels have their last strongholds, could be concluded
within a few days. However, other Russian officers have indicated a long fight
might still be in store.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of rebels broke through federal lines in southern Chechnya early
Monday, dodging Russian air and artillery bombardment to join their comrades
deep in the mountains, from which they can mount damaging guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They crawl out like roaches in small groups, and it's difficult to track
each one down,'' said Capt. Vladimir Maslennikov, an Interior Ministry troops
officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian military wants to vanquish the rebels before spring melts the
snow that now hampers rebel movement and before new foliage gives them better
concealment.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels fled Grozny en masse in early February, leaving a city where
skeletons of bombed-out apartment buildings tower over the streets, dotted by
tangles of twisted pipe and pitted by deep bomb craters. Plumes of black smoke
from oil refineries blasted in the war rise on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Russian officials have suggested that Grozny was so devastated that it
would not be rebuilt, but Gil-Robles said ``the reconstruction of Grozny is very
important. It is a symbol for the Chechen people.''
</P>
<P>
	   It is more than that, resident Galya Lukashevits told him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've lost my relatives. The city is all I have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of civilians with nowhere else to go stayed in Grozny during
months of relentless bombing and shelling, followed by weeks of house-to-house
fighting. Many continue to hide in basements, said Rukia Magomedova, a nurse
working for the Emergency Situations Ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are dying of starvation because they are afraid,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' first aid convoy to
Chechnya set off for Grozny, carrying 45 tons of food and other relief items
like mattresses and soap. The convoy is expected to arrive Tuesday, UNHCR
spokesman Ron Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
	   The military announced Monday that it was creating a new tactical army group
to battle the rebels in the Argun Gorge. In addition to providing a safe haven
for the militants, the gorge is a key channel for transporting rebel supplies
and reinforcements through the mountains and toward the border with Georgia. So
far, it has been largely invulnerable to Russian strikes.
</P>
<P>
	   The group will be headed by Lt.-Gen. Vladimir Bulgakov, who led the
offensive against Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal warplanes and helicopter gunships flew 60 combat missions over the
past 24 hours, the military said Monday. The aircraft bombarded suspected rebel
positions in the Shatoi region, and created landslides to block four mountain
passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent ground forces into Chechnya in late September to fight
separatist rebels whom it blamed for apartment bombings in Russia. The bombings
came after Chechnya-based Muslim fighters invaded the neighboring republic of
Dagestan in August and were driven out by Russian forces.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution charges cops with 'web of lies' to protect Schwarz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal prosecutor ripped into ex-cop Charles Schwarz
and two other police officers on Monday for spinning a "web of lies" to conceal
Schwarz's role as an accomplice in the precinct house sodomy assault of Abner
Louima.
<P>
	   In a 2 1/2 hour summation of the government's case, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Lauren Resnick reviewed a flurry of frenetic phone calls and statements to
authorities as proof that the trio tried to invent a plausible alibi for
Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that that is exactly what
these officers did," she told jurors hearing the officers' trial for conspiring
to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Resnick said that as representatives of the public trust, the officers were
obligated to tell the truth, but instead, "they told one story ... then another,
and yet another story here at the trial. They concocted a story to protect one
of their own."
</P>
<P>
	   She said there was no doubt, based on evidence, that Schwarz took part in
the Aug. 9, 1997 incident, which she called "one of the most brutal acts ever
committed by a uniformed police officer."
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz denied on the stand that he was in the 70th precinct house lavatory
when the attack occurred, but outside inspecting his patrol car for possible
hidden contraband.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Officer Justin Volpe was sentenced to 30 years in prison last year
after pleading guilty to violating Louima's civil rights by ramming a broomstick
into his rectum following his arrest during a street riot. The Haitian immigrant
suffered severe injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, who was convicted in that trial of holding Louima down during
the attack and faces a possible life sentence, is now accused along with
officers Thomas Wiese, 34, and Thomas Bruder, 37, of conspiring to conceal his
own role. The conspiracy charge carries a term of up to five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Resnick ridiculed Wiese for subjecting himself to "the least amount of
personal risk" by volunteering to investigators that he entered the bathroom
during the assault and tried to rescue Louima, but never saw Schwarz there.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiese's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, launched the defense summation by disputing
that.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why would Thomas Wiese take the risk, risk his family, his career, exposing
himself to possible indictment ... if he was not there?" Tacopina asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've never heard the term, 'blue wall of suicide,"' he said. "You don't
put yourself at the murder scene when two people are wanted and they only have
one."
</P>
<P>
	   The few phone calls and other actions involving Bruder show that he had no
part in any conspiracy, said his attorney, Stuart London.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the government glossed over lies and omissions by its own witnesses,
including Louima, to make its case against the three officers. "These people are
all part of 'Team Government,"' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In her summation, Resnick slammed Volpe as a "sadistic, lying animal" whose
testimony two weeks ago was filled with falsehoods, contradictions and an
attempt to justify his acts by blaming Louima for being defiant.
</P>
<P>
	   "He didn't want to answer direct questions ... he wiggled and waggled and
went off on tangents," she told the jury. "You knew Justin Volpe was lying when
he said Thomas Wiese and not Charles Schwarz walked Abner Louima to the
bathroom."
</P>
<P>
	   Resnick focused mainly on the dozens of phone calls among the defendants in
the days and weeks after the Louima attack, which the government has cited as
evidence of feverish efforts to contrive an alibi for Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   She said that during the first days after the incident, the three were
"lying low and keeping their mouths shut," watching to see where police Internal
Affairs Bureau detectives were going with the investigation, but keeping in
touch by phone.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the calls were many involving Schwarz himself, with Wiese and a
friend, former officer Anthony Abbate, who described himself as having offered
advice to Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Charles Schwarz was not in the bathroom, what was he so worried about?"
Resnick asked. "No one had been indicted yet. What are these defendants so
worried about if Charles Schwarz was not in that bathroom?"
</P>
<P>
	   Resnick also recalled that the officers had met privately with a police
union official, Michael Immitt, who testified he was unaware at the time that
the Louima torture story was front page news in that morning's papers.
</P>
<P>
	   "That is a joke," she said.

<HEADLINE> Limbless Student Defies Disability  </HEADLINE>
   By GINNY PARKER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Like many 23-year-olds, Hirotada Ototake goes to college,
likes basketball and looks forward to getting married someday.
</P>
<P>
	   But when he cruises down the street, he causes a sensation: girls call out
his name and strangers try to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
	   Ototake, who was born without arms and legs, is one of Japan's most famous
personalities: a best-selling author, a prime-time news anchor, a sought-after
public speaker.
</P>
<P>
	   And he is making Japan think about an issue it has long avoided -- society's
responsibilities toward the disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite its tremendous wealth and technology, Japan is a very difficult
place to live for its estimated 3.2 million people with physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Obstacles to wheelchairs abound, from flights of stairs to cramped
restaurants and stores. Most train and subway stations do not have elevators --
although a law approved by the Cabinet this month aims to improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   By putting a human face on the issue, Ototake has made many Japanese
consider the difficulties the disabled face in a new light.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Japan, everyone just assumes that the disabled are people you feel
sorry for,'' he said in an interview. ``But I'm not pitiful. I enjoy my life,
and I want to tell people that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ototake gained nationwide fame in 1998 after publishing a hugely popular
autobiography that challenged traditional Japanese notions about disability.
</P>
<P>
	   The book, ``No One's Perfect,'' surprised many with its honest but upbeat
portrayal of living without limbs. With a photo of the smiling Ototake on the
cover, it describes everything from the difficulties of navigating a wheelchair
in the snow to the author's joy at receiving his first love letter.
</P>
<P>
	   The book has sold 4.4 million copies in Japan and has been translated into
three languages. An English version will be released in the United States in
September.
</P>
<P>
	   Ototake writes that he's come to think of disability as nothing more than
being fat or thin, tall or short. He doesn't deny that some things are hard for
him, but tries to keep busy instead of getting depressed.
</P>
<P>
	   And busy he is.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with the writing and TV appearances, Ototake says he particularly
enjoys speaking to grade school students because they aren't afraid to ask blunt
questions.
</P>
<P>
	   He's about to graduate from one of Japan's most prestigious universities,
although he admits his hectic schedule leaves him little time to study for final
exams.
</P>
<P>
	   His high profile is in itself a challenge to tradition in this often
conformist society, where many disabled people stay at home and out of sight, or
are shunted off to special education, where activists say they learn little
about how to function in the real world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Japanese have trouble accepting people who are different,'' Ototake
said. ``This makes it a hard place to live.''
</P>
<P>
	   But little by little, that appears to be changing:
</P>
<P>
	   -- The Winter Paralympics in Nagano brought the issue into the national
spotlight in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In Osaka, Japan's second-largest city, Taihen, a group of physically
disabled dancers, is winning attention at home and international acclaim with
their performances.
</P>
<P>
	   -- The most popular prime-time drama on television this season, ``Beautiful
Life,'' tells the story of a love affair between a hairdresser and a young woman
who uses a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
	   Ototake, however, has been the most effective agent of change.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to an elementary school teacher who forced him to get out of his
wheelchair, he learned to walk by scooting along the ground. He writes by
holding a pen between his cheek and the stub of his left arm.
</P>
<P>
	   On his first day of middle school, Ototake stunned his parents by joining
the basketball team.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You alone decide if you're going to be happy,'' Ototake said. ``Of course,
I sometimes wish I looked as good as some Hollywood star, but who doesn't?''
</P>
<P>
	   Makoto Nakazawa, a physically disabled activist and employee at a large
manufacturing company, says it's optimism like this that accounts for Ototake's
appeal among the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Japan, the disabled and the able-bodied live in separate worlds,'' he
said. ``This book has lowered the wall a little.''

<HEADLINE> Journal Register Co. To Expand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Journal Register Co. said Monday it plans to sell its
newspapers in Illinois, Missouri and Ohio to boost its stock.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ohio properties to be sold are four daily newspapers with total daily
circulation of 125,825 and Sunday circulation of 140,532: The News-Herald (Lake
County), The Morning Journal (Lorain), The Times Reporter (Dover-New
Philadelphia) and The Independent (Massillon).
</P>
<P>
	   The Missouri and Illinois properties include the Suburban Newspapers of
greater St. Louis, the largest weekly newspaper group in the United States with
distribution of approximately 1.7 million, and The Telegraph (Alton, Ill.), a
seven-day newspaper with daily circulation of 28,048 and Sunday circulation of
30,110.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said the sale will demonstrate Journal Register's underlying
value, which the board of directors said is not reflected in its stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sale of our Midwest properties will increase our financial flexibility
and enable us to further realize shareholder value," Robert Jelenic, Journal
Register chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of the Trenton-based Journal Register Co. were trading at $12.12
1/2,, up 25 cents a share in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange -- near
its 52-week low of $11.37 1/2 and well below the 52-week high of $23.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will not sell any newspaper unless it gets "satisfactory
agreements with respect to price and terms," said Jean B. Clifton, Journal
Register executive vice president. Clifton said the company intends to use the
proceeds initially to reduce debt and for other corporate purposes, including
the company's share buyback program.
</P>
<P>
	   If all of its newspapers in the three states are sold, Journal Register will
be left with 20 daily newspapers with total daily circulation of approximately
483,000 and Sunday circulation of about 449,000, and 143 non-daily publications
with total distribution of more than 2.2 million clustered in five areas in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Journal Register's properties include the New Haven Register, Connecticut's
second-largest daily and Sunday newspaper, and 194 non-daily publications. The
company had 1999 total revenues of $470 million.
</P>
<P>
	   It operates in seven regions: Connecticut; Philadelphia and its surrounding
areas; Ohio; Greater St. Louis; central New England; and the Capital-Saratoga
and Mid-Hudson regions of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Journal Register's announcement is the third large newspaper company
divestiture announcement this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Friday, The New York Times Co. said it plans to sell seven of its
smaller newspapers and the nine telephone directories that are part of its
Regional Newspaper Group.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thomson Corp. of Canada announced Feb. 15 that it was selling its U.S.
newspapers, made up mainly of 49 local and regional dailies with circulations of
less than 50,000. Thomson is also putting up for sale five dailies in Canada and
more than 75 non-daily newspapers, most of which are based in the United States.
Its U.S. newspapers have been grouped into 21 regional clusters, the largest
being in Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana.

<HEADLINE> India To Spend Tax Revenue on Debt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India will spend nearly half its tax revenue this
fiscal year paying interest on debt, the government said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In an economic report preceding its budget proposal to Parliament, the
governmnet said rising food subsidies are another major area of concern.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts suggested that the report may indicate the government intends to
announce strong measures, such as food subsidy cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual economic survey said the government expects the fiscal deficit
for the year ending in March to be 4.1 percent of gross domestic product,
indicating the state will miss its target of bringing the deficit down to 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said that India will spend what it called a staggering 48 percent
of tax revenues this fiscal year on interest for the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   It said the large fiscal deficit has a wide range of adverse effects,
including low savings and investment, high interest rates and reduced growth.
</P>
<P>
	   India is in the midst of a broad-based industrial recovery, the report said,
but needs immediate reorganization of state-run companies and stricter corporate
governance laws to sustain the progress.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indian economy is projected to have grown by 5.9 percent in the past
year. The slowdown from 6.8 percent growth in 1998-99 was because of a fall in
agricultural growth. Some states were flooded, while some others had poor
monsoon rains.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor laws in India make it difficult for companies to get out of
unprofitable businesses, and the survey said changes in such laws are necessary
to keep the recovery going.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the report said that foreign direct investment continues to decline
from the $3.3 billion per year before the government set off nuclear tests in
1998, drawing economic sanctions from the United States, Japan and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
	   "Industrial growth is moving on a rising trajectory, and the broad-based
nature of recovery is apparent," the survey said. "Basic goods, intermediate
goods and consumer goods have all recorded accelerated growth."
</P>
<P>
	   But faster-paced reforms are needed, particularly in the financial system
and labor markets, to sustain the "broad-based industrial recovery (that) is
underway," the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other immediate needs are reorganization of state-run companies and stricter
corporate governance laws, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, more roads, electricity and telecommunications services are needed,
and should be provided faster by getting commercial businesses more involved in
building them, and relying less on government funds, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The widening gap between demand and supply of infrastructure continues to
raise questions concerning the sustainability of economic growth in future," the
survey said.

<HEADLINE> Capano appeals conviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - Lawyers for Thomas Capano filed an appeal Monday
that claims the wealthy, politically connected lawyer convicted of killing his
mistress did not get a fair trial.
<P>
	   Capano was sentenced to death last March for first-degree murder in the 1996
killing of Anne Marie Fahey, a secretary to Gov. Tom Carper.
</P>
<P>
	   The 140-page appeal was based on several arguments, including a claim that
now retired Superior Court Judge William Swain Lee erred when he refused to
instruct jurors on lesser charges such as manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   That is important because Capano claimed the killing was an accident.
</P>
<P>
	   "The trial judge made a mistake and should have given the jury more than an
all-or-nothing choice," said Capano attorney Joseph Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors contend Capano shot Fahey, then stuffed her body in a cooler,
loaded it on a boat in Stone Harbor, N.J., and dumped it in the Atlantic Ocean.
Without a body or a murder weapon, prosecutors relied on circumstantial evidence
to prove that Capano planned to kill Fahey because she wanted to end their
affair.
</P>
<P>
	   After denying any knowledge of Fahey's death for 2 1/2 years, Capano
admitted at trial that he disposed of Fahey's body. But he said another
mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, accidentally shot Fahey in a jealous, suicidal
rage.
</P>
<P>
	   MacIntyre denied the allegation and testified for the prosecution. Two of
Capano's brothers also testified against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Fahey's body has never been recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   In their appeal, Capano's lawyers also argued that Lee, who is now running
for governor, made a mistake when he let 11 witnesses recount statements that
Fahey made to them about her volatile, three-year affair with Capano. The appeal
says this was hearsay and should not have been allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Justice E. Norman Veasey gave Capano's lawyers an extra month to file
the appeal and allowed it to be longer than the 35 pages permitted under state
Supreme Court rules.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Neighborhood Left to Corpses  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KADUNA, Nigeria (AP) -- At the little concrete restaurant, the scene is as
it should be. Benches are pulled up in front of small wooden tables. Serving
dishes are stacked in the back. A green-and-white sign hangs above the door,
showing a crudely drawn knife and spoon laid across a bowl of stew.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Nache Food Restaurant doesn't belong here. It is an unsettling
island of sanity. Everything around it is destroyed, testament to one
neighborhood's apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
	   Nothing else escaped: the Primary Health Clinic, the Truth &AMP; Life Gospel
Church, the shops that sold soap and candles, the homes. Kaduna's Rigasa
neighborhood is in ruins -- except, inexplicably, for this one restaurant whose
wooden door, blowing in the afternoon breeze, opens onto Rigasa's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
	   A man's body lies in the street; pigs are eating his burned, bloated corpse.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 21, the 5,000 residents of Rigasa, a working-class neighborhood on
the edge of this northern city, saw their world explode when Christians and
Muslims went to war. Across Kaduna, neighbors turned against neighbors,
butchering men, burning buildings, forcing women and children to flee. At least
300 are dead, though some officials put the number at more than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
	   If any side ``won'' the war -- ignited by a proposal to bring sharia, or
Islamic law, to Kaduna state -- it remains unclear. For Nigeria, though, the
calls for sharia across the largely Muslim North, and the virulent Christian
opposition, could become a nationwide disaster in a country already riven with
ethnic and religious violence.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, soldiers were deployed to the eastern town of Aba, where Muslims
were targeted in revenge attacks after the bodies of Christians were returned
home from Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
	   A week after Kaduna's violence ended, Rigasa has been left to the corpses.
The bodies in the streets are reminders of distrust twisted into obscene
bigotry.
</P>
<P>
	   Who are these people? Who is the man without a head, sprawled next to a
mortar and pestle where a woman once pounded yams? Who are the three men cut
down in front of a clinic, two hanging off the building's patio, the other with
a white plastic chair thrown over his head?
</P>
<P>
	   No one seems to know. Their corpses -- 39 counted during one visit, though
many more presumably rotting out of view -- belong to people with no one to bury
them.
</P>
<P>
	   It began during a Christian protest against sharia. Rigasa's residents,
nearly all Christians, had gone downtown to join the demonstration. It quickly
turned violent.
</P>
<P>
	   Within hours, fistfights escalated into gunbattles. Entire city blocks
burned. People were doused with gasoline and set ablaze as Kaduna's Christians
and Muslims battled one another.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rigasa, things were even worse. After fighting their way home though
Muslim neighborhoods, Rigasa's Christians found themselves surrounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of attackers moved in from surrounding neighborhoods. Then, said
Caleb Zaka, an unemployed preacher, the looting, burning and slayings began.
</P>
<P>
	   People caught in the mob's path were killed, many beaten and then burned.
Christian men were herded into groups and marched away; many never returned.
Women and children were forced to their knees and ordered to chant ``Allahu
Akhbar!'' or ``God is great!''
</P>
<P>
	   But the fighting was not merely religious. The anger and distrust is linked
to Nigeria's ethnic and geographic divisions: Muslims are overwhelmingly Hausas
or Fulanis from the North, while most Christians are southerners of other
ethnicities. All are united in a nation cobbled together by British colonizers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some also see sharia as a way for Hausa northerners to reassert their
influence, which has waned since military rule ended last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Calls for sharia are cascading across northern Nigeria. It took effect last
month in neighboring Zamfara state, which is overwhelmingly Muslim. And despite
the violence in Kaduna, two more states passed sharia bills last week; others
plan to follow.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rigasa, Muslims turned on Christians. But in Kaduna, plenty of Christians
slaughtered Muslims, residents say.
</P>
<P>
	   What makes Rigasa different is that the army, fearful of a neighborhood off
the main roads, has not taken full control. Days after the violence died down,
it remains a vision of hatred gone wild.
</P>
<P>
	   Bodies are scattered in macabre anonymity -- twisted, bloated and burned,
eyes and lips eaten away by insects, skin peeling away in scaly white chunks.
They lie splayed in sewage ditches or alone in empty lots. The yearly Harmattan
wind blowing down from the Sahara has coated the town in a fine dust, leaving
everything covered in shades of brown.
</P>
<P>
	   During the day, before Kaduna's 4 p.m. curfew takes effect, small groups of
Christians wander the streets, many of them women looking for brothers, fathers,
daughters, sons. After curfew, the neighborhood empties almost completely, still
watched over by attackers who stare at visitors from a distance through the
haze.
</P>
<P>
	   Harry Zango, a solemn, 20-year-old student, spent Sunday digging graves.
``My brother,'' he says, pointing at a small mound of dirt. ``He was the one we
called Bala.''
</P>
<P>
	   A moment later, Yusuf Abdullahi walked past. A Muslim, he shook his head and
denounced the lack of policing. ``It shows an absence of law and order --
nothing but that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps. There are few phones for residents to call for help. And anyway, no
one would come: Nigeria's police are notoriously ill-equipped and ill-trained.
So the people of Risaga, both attackers and victims, made their own rules.
</P>
<P>
	   For some, the carnage, however appalling, brings hope. Perhaps the scale of
butchery, they say, will make people stop.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Muslim people don't really want to fight us,'' Zango said. ``They too
are afraid.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 176.53; Nasdaq Slips  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials soared today as bargain hunters
grabbed shares at reduced prices following last week's big selloff. Technology
issues, which slumped from a bout of profit-taking early today, bounced back in
late trading.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary figures, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
176.53 to 10,038.65, climbing above the 10,000-mark that it fell below Friday
for the first time in more than 10 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow was up more than 294 points in late afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index, which fell 124 points earlier today, finished
the day only slightly lower.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, much of the stock market -- especially blue-chip shares --
has been battered by fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to
reduce inflationary pressures in the robust U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   But today, investors brushed such concerns aside and took advantage of the
cheap prices available as a result of the sharp decline in financial services,
retail and drug stocks over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today was a mirror image of the dismal performance on Friday that left
investors trembling," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP;
Co. "But today it reversed itself and there was a genuine sigh of relief in the
market."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, analysts warned that the Dow's dramatic rise might be short-lived and
many expect the index to fall back into its volatile pattern in coming weeks as
investors continue to shift money into companies with the best chance for rapid
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
	   That should bode well for the Nasdaq, which comprises many companies that
are on the forefront of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are asking 'Where can I find earnings growth?" said Alan
Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. "They know that
they can find such growth in technology, Internet and telecom stocks. Those are
outperforming the old economy stocks."
</P>
<P>
	   Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in
Kansas City, Mo., added that "the momentum of this market still rests on the
shoulders of the Nasdaq. This is just a one-day flip from Nasdaq into Dow."
</P>
<P>
	   The volatility in the U.S. stock market prompted selling on financial
markets overseas today. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.49 percent,
Germany's DAX index fell 1.95 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 dropped 1.97 percent,
and France's CAC-40 declined 1.38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers To Vote on Pork Ads  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hog farmers will get a chance to vote on whether to keep
paying the fees that fund the "other white wheat" advertising campaign for pork,
the government announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said he had the legal authority to call
the referendum even though his department didn't validate sufficient signatures
on petitions that were submitted by farmers who oppose paying the fees, or
"checkoffs."
</P>
<P>
	   There has not been a referendum on the pork program since it was created 14
years ago. Opponents of the $48 million program, which pays for research as well
as advertising, say it has done little to stimulate pork consumption and mostly
benefits meat processors and large, corporate farm operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a matter of basic fairness, I believe that producers deserve the
opportunity to vote on this checkoff program," Glickman said in a speech to the
National Farmers Union in Salt Lake City, Utah. "It is, after all, a mandatory
assessment, akin to a tax, that all producers must pay even if they disagree
with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Under government rules, Glickman would have been required to call a
referendum if the petitions submitted to the Agriculture Department last year
contained at least 14,986 signatures. USDA officials used a sampling process to
validate the petitions but couldn't verify a sufficient number of names.
</P>
<P>
	   The fee is pay 45 cents for every $100 of a pig's value when it is sold. The
money goes to the quasigovernmental National Pork Board, which contracts
promotional services through the National Pork Producers Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the program say they get little for the fees. Pork consumption
has been relatively flat despite the advertising, rising from 51.5 pounds per
person in 1985 to 53.4 pounds last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is all about the democratic process ... and the right of hog farmers
and other producers to vote on whether the checkoff programs are working for
them," said Rhonda Perry, a Missouri hog producer who opposes the pork program.

<HEADLINE> US May Seek Expelled Cuban Testimony  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Expelled Cuban diplomat Jose Imperatori may be asked to
return to the United States to testify in the case of a U.S. immigration officer
arrested this month on charges he spied for Cuba, the State Department said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori, a consular officer at the Cuban mission in Washington, was
deported Saturday night after he ignored a State Department demand that he leave
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
	   He was accused of engaging in activities ``inconsistent with his diplomatic
status'' by maintaining contacts with Miami-based Immigration and Naturalization
Service official Mariano Faget, a Cuban-born 34-year INS veteran.
</P>
<P>
	   Before his forcible departure, Imperatori vowed to maintain a hunger strike
until he was cleared of the accusations against him.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said it was unseemly for
Imperatori to suggest that he could be exonerated quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just as peace is not made in seven days in the Middle East or in Northern
Ireland or in Ethiopia and Eritrea, a prosecutorial case is not made,
necessarily, in seven days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If and when the time comes that law enforcement officials seek his
presence in court or in other law-enforcement proceedings, and he chooses to
come, that will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 19, Imperatori was asked to leave the United States and was given
seven days to make departure arrangements. When Cuba objected to the expulsion
order, the State Department branded him PNG -- persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
	   ``PNG does not mean `please now go.' It means `persona non grata.' It means
go. And he either went voluntarily or, as you saw, he went involuntarily,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was flown to Montreal aboard a U.S. government plane. He was
expected to leave Sunday but has remained at the Cuban Embassy in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
	   A Cuban government statement said Imperatori is seeking permission to stay
in Canada ``for the time needed to find an honorable solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said he expected Imperatori
to leave Canada Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   In Havana on Sunday, scores of teen-agers shouting ``Down with the lie''
held a pro-government rally outside Imperatori's family's home.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba insists that Imperatori's relationship with Faget was unobjectionable.
It also maintains that the Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington, where
Imperatori served, never has been used for intelligence activities.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Festival Lures Cigar Lovers  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's world-famous tobacco lured hundreds of cigar
aficionados from around the globe this week for the island's second annual cigar
festival.
</P>
<P>
	   About 800 were expected at the inauguration cocktail party Monday night of
the Second International Habano Festival.
</P>
<P>
	   Those invited included editors of cigar magazines, tobacco sellers and
connoisseurs of Cuba's well-known cigar brands -- including Cohiba, Romeo y
Julieta, Partagas and others.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from being serenaded by Afro-Cuban rhythms, participants could expect
during the five-day event to visit tobacco fields, cigar factories, and a trade
fair, said Ana Lopez, marketing director of the Cuban tobacco company Habanos
S.A.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine new cigar brands were to make their debut at a final, formal dinner on
Friday at the Pabexpo convention center. Cuba's government-controlled tobacco
industry already markets 34 brands.
</P>
<P>
	   Also during the $350-a-plate dinner, seven wooden humidors fashioned by
Cuban artisans and signed by President Fidel Castro are to be auctioned off.
</P>
<P>
	   Castro himself attended the dinner held last year during the first
international festival.
</P>
<P>
	   The festival is being held as the Cuban government celebrates one of its
best harvests in 20 years. State news reports said the 1999-2000 harvest, which
is ending now, is expected to yield about 40,000 metric tons of tobacco. The
reports did not give statistics from previous harvests.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba exported 148 million cigars last year, of which 128 million were
hand-rolled and 20 million were machine-rolled, Manuel Garcia, vice president of
Habanos S.A. told a news conference last week.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that western Europe is the largest market for Cuban cigars --
accounting for 90 million cigars, or 65.5 percent of the total. Within Europe,
the biggest consumers in 1999 were Spain, consuming 43 million cigars, and
France, which bought 17.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The next largest regional market is the Americas and the Caribbean, which
accounted for 18.1 million cigars last year. That total included cigars sold at
duty free shops in Cuba and airports throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest potential market for Cuban cigars -- the United States --
remains closed because of a U.S. trade embargo nearly four decades old.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia estimated that six million Cuban cigars enter the United States each
year as contraband.

<HEADLINE> New bid, questions likely to delay nuke plant sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Under criticism from state legislators and
uncertainty about a tempting, 11th-hour counteroffer, the New York Power
Authority is not likely to approve the sale of its two nuclear power plants
Tuesday to a New Orleans company, top executives said.
<P>
	   The Power Authority had signed an agreement in principle earlier this month
to sell the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 plants to Entergy Corp. for $638
million. The authority seemed likely to close the deal during a meeting of the
authority's board Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But a $686 million counteroffer last week from Dominion Resources of
Richmond, Va., muddied the waters. And Democratic legislators on Monday raised a
laundry list of alleged problems with the Power Authority's arrangement with
Entergy that Assemblyman Richard Brodsky said should "blow up" the tentative,
non-binding deal with the Louisiana company.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislators at Monday's hearing urged caution in reaching the sale which
they said would represent the largest liquidation of state holdings in New
York's history.
</P>
<P>
	   Power Authority President Eugene Zeltman agreed at a state Assembly hearing
that several questions about the sale of the two nuclear plants exist, perhaps
too many for the board to go forward with a vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it's still as fluid tomorrow morning as it is now, then we probably
won't go forward," Zeltman said.
</P>
<P>
	   One thing complicating the situation is that the Power Authority has been
barred for two weeks ending Tuesday from talking to Dominion or any other
company about purchasing the plants. That came under an exclusivity deal it made
with Entergy when reaching an agreement in principle for the purchase on Feb.
14.
</P>
<P>
	   "How can you responsibly close on a deal when you can't talk to one of the
bidders?" Brodsky asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeltman acknowledged that not being able to get more details from Dominion
officials about their counteroffer has hindered the authority's attempt to
analyze it.
</P>
<P>
	   Brodsky and state Assemblyman Paul Tonko, a Democrat who chairs the
Assembly's energy committee, called on Power Authority Chairman Clarence
Rappleyea to not accept any offer for the two nuclear plants without holding an
auction for the facilities or at least running a competitive bidding process.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that a richer counteroffer for the plants emerged shows the
properties are desirable and no one really knows how much the authority could
ultimately get for them, legislators said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know what it's worth because we never bid it out," Brodsky said.
"We should be going out there and seeing if there is a third party willing to
offer $150 million more."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, he told reporters that the Power Authority "could have done better
with this plant (sale) on eBay."
</P>
<P>
	   Brodsky and Tonko also assailed the tentative Power Authority-Entergy pact
on other grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   They said the two New York plants would be operated by a limited liability
corporation set up by Entergy to reduce its legal exposure in case of a
catastrophic accident, and not Entergy itself. That raises questions whether the
mother company's best talent would be used operating the New York plants.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislators also said the authority, and not Entergy, would be left
liable if decommissioning costs for the plants are higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   The James A. FitzPatrick plant is on the shore of Lake Ontario north of
Syracuse. Indian Point 3 is in New York City's northern suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Navy Assured on Missile Program Role  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy will have an important role in the nation's
eventual national missile defense system, even if early stages envision only
land-based interceptors, the director of the program told Congress on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald T. Kadish told the Senate Armed Services Committee
that he shares concerns expressed by Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief of naval
operations, that ship-launched interceptors not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to be careful we don't put in barriers'' to Navy involvement, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kadish agreed with Republican senators on the committee that a ship-based
missile defense would add to the effectiveness of the program, intended to
provide all 50 states with a limited defense against a ballistic missile attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Kadish said the Pentagon did not envision a Navy component until year
2010 or later.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Pentagon advisers suggested that including a sea-based option
could be viewed as a violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with
Moscow. The treaty prohibits either country from building a national missile
defense system, although it allows certain limited defenses.	   Although the
Navy is proceeding with development of a high-altitude intercepter design,
planning for the basic national missile defense program is presently focused on
a land-based decision.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has said he will decide this summer on whether to go ahead
with construction of such a system.
</P>
<P>
	   That timetable still holds, although failure of a scheduled test in May
could make recommending that the president make a decision this summer ``a
difficult argument to make,'' said Kadish.
</P>
<P>
	   Kadish was grilled about the Navy's role after disclosure of a confidential
memo to Defense Secretary William Cohen by Johnson. In the memo, first reported
in Monday's editions of the Washington Post, the Navy's top officer challenged
the Pentagon plan for a land-based-only missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
	   He warned that sticking with a land-based-only system ``would not be in the
best long-term interests of our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the current timetable, the Pentagon hopes to have the first 100
interceptors in Alaska by 2005 if the president gives the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the United States so far has spent some $60 billion on research and
development of the system, test performances have been mixed. An interceptor
failed its most recent test, last Jan. 18, when a plumbing leak caused it to
miss its target.
</P>
<P>
	   A ship-based option has a support among Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Kadish said the Pentagon hoped to incorporate the Navy's high-altitude
interceptor in the overall program ``sometime after 2010.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one system can do it all under all circumstances. Even though we may
start off with a land-based system, ... we need a family of systems,'' Kadish
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You wouldn't know it, reading this,'' said Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., holding
up a Pentagon chart of the program that showed no Navy component.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon is expected to spending some $12.7 billion over the next six
years on the program.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Ice-Fishermen Rescued  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Hundreds of anxious fishermen spent a night on disintegrating
ice floes in Europe's largest lake, waiting for rescuers to arrive in
helicopters and boats. Six people drowned as the ice broke up, but some 900
others were rescued, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The fishermen were trapped on Lake Ladoga, northeast of St. Petersburg, when
the ice started breaking up Sunday. The lake, which covers 6,700 square miles,
is a popular ice-fishing spot for Russians who gather on its frozen surface
every winter.
</P>
<P>
	   The trapped fishermen huddled in small groups on bobbing ice floes, some
within inches of frigid water that can kill a person in minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Villagers hurried to bring boats out of winter storage, watched by nervous
relatives on shore. Helicopters circled over the lake, rescuing anglers, but
also kicking up sprays of numbing water with their rotors.
</P>
<P>
	   To get close to the helicopters without slipping, many of the fishermen had
to crawl on their bellies across the ice, pulling themselves along with picks.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 911 people were rescued, but 759 of them had to wait until Monday to
be taken off the ice, said Marina Ryklina, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of
Emergency Situations. The six people who drowned were all fishermen, said
another ministry spokesman, Viktor Beltsov.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven cars also plunged through the ice on Sunday and Monday, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Ryklina said Monday that 26 ice-fishermen were rescued in a separate
operation in the Gulf of Finland.
</P>
<P>
	   Ice-fishing is highly popular in Russia, both for sport and as a food
source, and thousands of anglers become stranded on drifting floes every year.
Many of them are carried out to sea before rescuers can reach them.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Bosnia Camp Heads on Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Their faces still haunt. The skeletal torsos
and lifeless expressions of men lined up at an iron ore mine turned into a
Bosnian prison camp were chillingly reminiscent of the emaciated Jewish
survivors photographed at the close of World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   When war correspondents discovered the starving Bosnians at Omarska camp in
1992, the news footage jolted the world's conscience and prompted calls for
intervention to stop Balkan ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the images were shown to judges at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, where the Serb policemen who allegedly ran the camp went on trial
before the U.N. court set up in response to the global outcry to punish the
perpetrators of Balkan atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the 7-year-old tribunal's first case to deal directly with what
prosecutors call a ``system of concentration camps'' within a deliberate
strategy to rid northern Bosnia of non-Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Three defendants, Miroslav Kvocka, 43, Milojica Kos, 36, and Mlado Radic,
47, are accused of running Omarska as commandants and shift commanders. The
fourth, taxi driver Zoran Zigic, 41, is accused of torturing and murdering
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   If found guilty, the defendants face life imprisonment in a European jail.
All four have pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   In his opening statement Monday, prosecutor Grant Niemann, a former
Australian war crimes investigator, painted a horrifying picture of Omarska and
the nearby Keraterm and Trnopolje camps, where hundreds died as a result of
murders, torture, rapes and beatings in the spring and summer of 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   New arrivals were beaten with batons and rifle butts and jammed into
stiflingly hot rooms with no beds and meager sanitary facilities, Niemann said
as he pointed to a replica of the Omarska complex.
</P>
<P>
	   Although a predominantly male prison, several dozen women were kept in the
administration building, where they were forced to clean floors covered with
blood, hair and teeth, and were raped nightly by guards, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interrogations in the camp's first-aid building, known as the White House,
ended in murder almost daily.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just about every morning ... at least five to ten dead bodies, and often
many more, were piled upon each other outside the White House to be carried away
by trucks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Niemann showed the court slides of corpses with ``blunt object injuries and
bullet wounds to the head,'' exhumed from a mass grave next to a demolished
mosque in a nearby village.
</P>
<P>
	   For all the horrors, it won't be an open-and-shut case.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike many cases before this tribunal, in which witnesses testified to
seeing defendants commit war crimes, the case against the alleged camp bosses
rests largely on acts they didn't commit with their own hands.
</P>
<P>
	   That raises the matter of command responsibility, which has vexed war crimes
prosecutions going back to the Nuremberg trials of Nazi officials after World
War II. Who is ultimately responsible for atrocities? Commanders who give the
orders? Or those who carry them out?
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors contend Kvocka -- as Omarska commander through June 1992 and
later as deputy commander -- was ultimately responsible for much of what
happened. Kos and Radic, described as shift commanders, ordered guards to beat
prisoners and sometimes participated themselves, prosecutors maintain.
</P>
<P>
	   The three men, they say, ``exercised the power of life and death over the
detainees,'' and acted in full knowledge that all three prison camps were
integral to the Serb leadership's strategy of ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys are expected to rebut the argument by claiming their
clients are scapegoats for the tribunal's inability to apprehend the alleged
architects of that strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite repeated calls by the tribunal for the arrest of the most senior
figures on the Serb side, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military chief Ratko Mladic remain free men.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The tribunal may not be guided by taking the line of the least resistance
and desist from prosecuting the real culprits,'' defense attorney Toma Fila said
in a pretrial brief.
</P>
<P>
	   He maintains the role of his client, Radic, ``must be considered from the
perspective of a simple man with ... his intention to preserve the bare life of
his family and of his own in a turbulent and violent time.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 176.53; Nasdaq Slips  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials soared today as bargain hunters
grabbed shares at reduced prices following last week's big selloff. Technology
issues, which slumped from a bout of profit-taking early today, bounced back in
late trading.
</P>
<P>
	   Tthe Dow Jones industrial average rose 176.53 to close at 10,038.65,
climbing above the 10,000-mark that it fell below Friday for the first time in
more than 10 months. The Dow was up more than 294 points in late afternoon
trading.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 17.07 to 1,350.43, and the Nasdaq composite
index fell 8.62 to 4,581.88.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,496 up, 1,478 down and 523 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.022 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.055 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.23 to 556.51.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, much of the stock market -- especially blue-chip shares --
has been battered by fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to
reduce inflationary pressures in the robust U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   But today, investors brushed such concerns aside and took advantage of the
cheap prices available as a result of the sharp decline in financial services,
retail and drug stocks over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today was a mirror image of the dismal performance on Friday that left
investors trembling," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP;
Co. "But today it reversed itself and there was a genuine sigh of relief in the
market."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, analysts warned that the Dow's dramatic rise might be short-lived and
many expect the index to fall back into its volatile pattern in coming weeks as
investors continue to shift money into companies with the best chance for rapid
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
	   That should bode well for the Nasdaq, which comprises many companies that
are on the forefront of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are asking 'Where can I find earnings growth?" said Alan
Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. "They know that
they can find such growth in technology, Internet and telecom stocks. Those are
outperforming the old economy stocks."
</P>
<P>
	   Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in
Kansas City, Mo., added that "the momentum of this market still rests on the
shoulders of the Nasdaq. This is just a one-day flip from Nasdaq into Dow."
</P>
<P>
	   The volatility in the U.S. stock market prompted selling on financial
markets overseas today. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.49 percent,
Germany's DAX index fell 1.95 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 dropped 1.97 percent,
and France's CAC-40 declined 1.38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Haider Reportedly Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Joerg Haider, the politician known for his
anti-foreigner statements and past praise of Nazi employment policies, resigned
Monday as head of the far-right Freedom Party, the Austria Press Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency quoted unidentified party sources at a closed-door meeting of the
group's national leadership. Party officials would not confirm the report
pending a news conference later Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   APA said Haider, who holds no post in the national government, would
continue as governor of Carinthia province. The move was seen as an attempt to
reduce international criticism of the coalition government between Haider's
rightists and the center-right Austrian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to reporters before Monday's meeting, Peter Sichrovsky, the Freedom
Party's European Union representative, said Haider had mentioned stepping down
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Already on Saturday, he mentioned it in an internal party discussion,''
Sichrovsky said. ``He has already achieved more than anyone else, and if that is
his decision, then we must respect it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has led the Freedom Party since 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Austria has come under severe international criticism since the Freedom
Party, along with the conservative Austrian People's Party, took power earlier
this month. The 14 other European Union members have moved to isolate Austria
diplomatically, mostly due to Haider's anti-foreigner stance and remarks about
the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider remains popular with many Austrians and within the party he nearly
single-handedly built up from a small, unknown group to the second-largest
political force in the country.

<HEADLINE> Pataki and Moynihan: Bush letter to Cardinal should put issue to  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Gov. George Pataki said Monday that George W. Bush's
appearance at Bob Jones University was a mistake, but that the Texas governor
had made amends with his letter to Cardinal John O'Connor.
<P>
	   A top New York Democrat, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, agreed with
Republican Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Bush did the right thing," Pataki, head of Bush's New York
campaign, said. "I think that should be the end of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Moynihan, who held a brief news conference with Pataki in the senator's
Capitol office, agreed that Bush's letter should put the matter to rest.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought it was a handsome letter," Moynihan, who is himself Roman
Catholic, said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York backers of Sen. McCain, including Staten Island Borough President
Guy Molinari, have said they plan to make Bush's visit to Bob Jones University
an issue with New York's Catholic voters who make up 46 percent of the GOP
enrollment in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Jones, a conservative Christian school in South Carolina, has come under
fire for banning interracial dating and spreading anti-Catholic views. Leaders
at the school have criticized the Pope and labeled the Catholic church a
"Satanic cult.
</P>
<P>
	   In his letter to O'Connor, made public Sunday, Bush wrote that he deeply
regretted "causing needless offense" by not clearly "disassociating myself from
anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice."
</P>
<P>
	   The 80-year-old O'Connor wields considerable power as leader of New York's
1.4 million Catholics.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush made the visit to Bob Jones as he sought to appeal to South Carolina's
conservative Republican voters. Until Sunday's letter to the cardinal, Bush had
said he had nothing to apologize for.
</P>
<P>
	   A pair of statewide polls out Monday showed Bush and McCain running
neck-and-neck among New York's GOP voters. Despite the tight poll numbers,
Pataki on Monday predicted Bush would win.
</P>
<P>
	   "As long as it is on the issues and it is on the records and the visions of
the candidate, Governor Bush will win." Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling Bush "an inclusive tolerant person," Pataki lambasted McCain,
charging that the senator had injected religion into the race. McCain has
acknowledged that his camp made phone calls to Michigan Catholics bringing up
Bush's visit to the university. McCain won last week's Michigan primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Pataki, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and some other prominent
Republicans, who are still backing Bush, have said his visit to Bob Jones
University was a mistake. The visit prompted Rep. Peter King, a Long Island
Republican and Roman Catholic, to abandon Bush and become the co-chairman of
McCain's New York campaign.

<HEADLINE> 185 Arrested in Abu-Jamal Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 185 people were arrested outside the Supreme Court
building and another 164 were arrested in San Francisco during protests Monday
seeking a new trial for a man sentenced to death for killing a Philadelphia
police officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court and city police officers led away protesters who sat in the
street or jumped a barrier and went onto the plaza in front of the court
building. Supreme Court police officers arrested 24 people, and city police
arrested about 160.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstration came while the nation's highest court took the bench to
issue orders and hear arguments in cases. It was not known whether the justices
knew of the protest.
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco police said they arrested 164 protesters who blocked the
sidewalk in front of the federal appeals court building in that city.
</P>
<P>
	   John Riley of the Free Mumia Abu-Jamal Coalition said the demonstrators in
both cities were opposing capital punishment and calling for a new trial for
Abu-Jamal, whose jailhouse writings about the justice system have attracted
worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The idea is to send a message to the Supreme Court that people all around
the country are upset that Mumia Abu-Jamal did not get a fair trial,'' Riley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Abu-Jamal, a one-time Black Panther and radio journalist, was convicted of
fatally shooting a Philadelphia police officer in 1981 after the officer stopped
Abu-Jamal's brother for driving the wrong way down a city street.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court turned down an appeal by Abu-Jamal last October. He still
could pursue a new round of appeals.

<HEADLINE> Journal Register Co. to sell newspapers in Illinois, Missouri and  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Journal Register Co. said Monday it plans to sell
its newspapers in Illinois, Missouri and Ohio to boost its stock.
<P>
	   An industry analyst predicted the move will benefit the company by allowing
it to reduce its debt and putting it in position to acquire other newspapers
near its base in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ohio properties to be sold are four daily newspapers with total daily
circulation of 125,825 and Sunday circulation of 140,532: The News-Herald (Lake
County), The Morning Journal (Lorain), The Times Reporter (Dover-New
Philadelphia) and The Independent (Massillon).
</P>
<P>
	   The Missouri and Illinois properties include the Suburban Newspapers of
greater St. Louis, the largest weekly newspaper group in the United States with
distribution of approximately 1.7 million, and The Telegraph (Alton, Ill.), a
seven-day newspaper with daily circulation of 28,048 and Sunday circulation of
30,110.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said the sale will demonstrate Journal Register's underlying
value, which the board of directors said is not reflected in its stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sale of our Midwest properties will increase our financial flexibility
and enable us to further realize shareholder value," Robert Jelenic, Journal
Register chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of the Trenton-based Journal Register Co. were trading at $12.12
1/2,, up 25 cents a share in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange - near
its 52-week low of $11.37 1/2 and well below the 52-week high of $23.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will not sell any newspaper unless it gets "satisfactory
agreements with respect to price and terms," said Jean B. Clifton, Journal
Register executive vice president. Clifton said the company intends to use the
proceeds initially to reduce debt and for other corporate purposes, including
the company's share buyback program.
</P>
<P>
	   "Overall, it looks like a good move," said industry analyst Asa W. Graves of
First Union Securities Inc. Besides allowing Journal Register to shrink its debt
and buy back more stock, the sale will enhance the company's ability to acquire
newspapers near its remaining Northeastern properties, Graves said.
</P>
<P>
	   "One thing they're very good at is taking small, stand-alone organizations
and combining that in an existing cluster," Graves said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although The New York Times Co. and The Thomson Corp. also announced plans
earlier this month to sell newspapers, sellers can still command a premium
because buyers would be interested in adding to nearby existing operations to
gain economies of scale, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   If all of its newspapers in the three states are sold, Journal Register will
be left with 20 daily newspapers with total daily circulation of approximately
483,000 and Sunday circulation of approximately 449,000, and 143 non-daily
publications with total distribution of more than 2.2 million clustered in five
areas in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Journal Register's properties include the New Haven Register, Connecticut's
second-largest daily and Sunday newspaper, and 194 non-daily publications. The
company had 1999 total revenues of $470 million.
</P>
<P>
	   It operates in seven regions: Connecticut; Philadelphia and its surrounding
areas; Ohio; the greater St. Louis area; central New England; and the
Capital-Saratoga and Mid-Hudson regions of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Journal Register's announcement is the third large newspaper company
divestiture announcement this month.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, The New York Times Co. said it plans to sell seven of its smaller
newspapers and the nine telephone directories that are part of its Regional
Newspaper Group.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thomson Corp. of Canada announced Feb. 15 that it was selling its U.S.
newspapers, made up mainly of 49 local and regional dailies with circulations of
less than 50,000. Thomson is also putting up for sale five dailies in Canada and
more than 75 non-daily newspapers, most of which are based in the United States.
Its U.S. newspapers have been grouped into 21 regional clusters, the largest
being in Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Bomb Iraqi System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq said Monday that U.S. and British jets bombed
civilian targets while patrolling the northern no-fly zone, but reported no
damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   The planes targeted ``civilian and service installations'' in the area, a
spokesman for the Iraqi Air Defense Force said, without specifying the sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraqi gunners opened fire on the planes, which entered northern Iraqi
airspace in 14 waves, the spokesman said in a statement, which was carried by
the official Iraqi News Agency. He also said the planes penetrated Iraqi
airspace in the south, but reported no incidents there.
</P>
<P>
	   Reacting to the Iraqi statement, a spokesman for Operation Northern Watch in
the southern Turkish base of Incirlik said the allied planes had fired only on
the Iraqi air-defense system and only in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iraqi forces fired anti-aircraft artillery from a site west of Bashiqah,
250 miles north of Baghdad, according to a statement from the Germany-based U.S.
European Command.
</P>
<P>
	   All allied planes left the area safely, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and British planes have been enforcing no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Shiite Muslims
and Kurds from the forces of President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq, which does not recognize the zones, has challenged the planes since
December 1998 by targeting the aircraft with surface-to-air missiles and
anti-aircraft artillery.

<HEADLINE> Detained Reporter Flown to Moscow  </HEADLINE>
   By NABI ABDULAYEV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Radio Liberty correspondent Andrei Babitsky,
whose detention by Russia sparked international concern, was being flown from
the capital of Dagestan to Moscow on Monday, the radio station reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The move came hours after acting President Vladimir Putin sought to defuse
the controversy by saying the reporter should be freed. But a Radio Liberty
spokesman said the station did not know whether Babitsky would be released once
he arrived in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   The spokesman, who did not give his name, said Babitsky was taken from the
Interior Ministry offices in Makhachkala, where he had been held since Friday,
and put on a plane for Moscow. He said he did not know at which of the capital's
airports the plane was to land.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky's wife and lawyer, both in Makhachkala, were not informed of his
departure, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesmen for the Interior Ministry in Moscow and Makhachkala declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky, whose reporting from the rebel side in Chechnya angered Russian
officials, was detained in Chechnya in January and turned over to rebels in
exchange for captured Russian soldiers. Many of Babitsky's colleagues doubted
the government's portrayal of the exchange, and feared he had been killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky resurfaced Friday in the custody of officials in Makhachkala, the
capital of the Russian republic of Dagestan, which borders Chechnya. He was
charged with carrying a forged Azerbaijani passport, and officials also took up
earlier charges of Babitsky's alleged links with Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky's lawyers have pressed for his release, citing poor health. But
investigators have turned down the plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin stepped into the case Monday, telling the Interior Ministry and the
prosecutor-general's office that Babitsky should not be held in custody,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   But echoing the government's contention that some accounts of the war in
Chechnya have been politically motivated, Putin accused Babitsky of trying to
sell the rebels' point of view.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He handled this task pretty well,'' Putin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Another of Babitsky's lawyers, Genri Reznik, said Putin's involvement was
certain to help the reporter's case, but added that there should have been no
need for such high-level interference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Does the head of state need to interfere for this question to be solved
according to law?'' Reznik said on the Echo of Moscow radio station. ``Don't you
think that this is a situation from a psychiatric asylum?''
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign officials have pressed Russia to clear up the case, saying
Babitsky's detention adds to concern over alleged human rights violations in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Reznik suggested Russian officials were trying to smear Babitsky to justify
their handling of the case. The government would like to show that Babitsky ``is
such a terrible person, that he is generally an enemy ... and that toward him
such actions were justified,'' Reznik said.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin insisted that investigators handled the case strictly according to the
law, Interfax reported. However, he said he told Interior Minister Vladimir
Rushailo that ``it is inexpedient to hold Babitsky in custody, and I asked him
to deal with this case more carefully.''

<HEADLINE> Senegal Holds Presidential Elections  </HEADLINE>
   By GLENN McKENZIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- International observers gave a thumbs up Monday to
Senegal's presidential elections, saying scattered violence and logistical
problems failed to tarnish voting in one of Africa's oldest democracies.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of observers from French-speaking nations, however, declined to
predict whether the count -- still underway -- would be entirely fair, or the
results accepted by the 2.7 million registered voters in this country of 10
million people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First comes gestation and then birth,'' said Ide Oumarou, leader of the
Francophonic delegation. ``We can say the mother is healthy for now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Oumarou said observers noted relatively few problems in Sunday's ballot,
which he called smooth and fair.
</P>
<P>
	   While many African countries hold elections, very few are considered truly
free and fair. In West Africa, where votes often take place against the backdrop
of military coups and civil wars, Senegal is one of few countries to hold
regular ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   Results were trickling in Monday from Sunday's vote -- the country's most
contentious in decades -- which pitted President Abdou Diouf against seven
challengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Not enough ballots had been counted to suggest a clear trend, but top
contender Abdoulaye Wade was already warning that one of Africa's most stable
countries would explode in popular revolt if the president retains power.
</P>
<P>
	   Diouf ``is aware if he declares himself winner, there will be clashes in the
country, demonstrations and violence,'' Wade told reporters. ``He will have to
establish an emergency state and call in the army.''
</P>
<P>
	   Scattered attacks by separatist rebels marred voting in the southern
Casamance region, and there was at least one brawl reported Sunday between rival
political supporters in the capital, Dakar.
</P>
<P>
	   If Senegal plunges into violence so soon after the December military
takeover in nearby Ivory Coast -- another traditional bastion of African
stability -- Western diplomats worry it could trigger a flight of development
aid and trade from the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Diouf and Wade claimed to be ahead Monday, though both also conceded
they might not win an outright majority.
</P>
<P>
	   If there is no clear winner, the top two contenders will face off in a
second round -- the first runoff election in Senegal, where the ruling Socialist
Party has held power since independence from France in 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   Khalifa Sall, a Cabinet minister and senior Socialist Party official,
conceded the president had a poor showing in Dakar, but said provisional results
put him in the lead in 19 of the country's 31 regions.
</P>
<P>
	   An official in Wade's camp, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his
candidate was leading in the country's two biggest cities -- Dakar and nearby
Thies -- which account for 40 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no official confirmation of their claims. Official tallies were
released haphazardly to radio stations by village and city block -- sometimes a
few dozen voters at a time.
</P>
<P>
	   The provisional outcome is expected Wednesday, but will have to be confirmed
by the high court next week, Oumarou said.

<HEADLINE> Arrests Made in Abu-Jamal Protests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 185 people were arrested outside the Supreme Court
building and another 164 were arrested in San Francisco during protests Monday
seeking a new trial for a man sentenced to death for killing a Philadelphia
police officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court and city police officers led away protesters who sat in the
street or jumped a barrier and went onto the plaza in front of the court
building. Supreme Court police officers arrested 24 people, and city police
arrested about 160.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstration came while the nation's highest court took the bench to
issue orders and hear arguments in cases. It was not known whether the justices
knew of the protest.
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco police said they arrested 164 protesters who blocked the
sidewalk in front of the federal appeals court building in that city.
</P>
<P>
	   John Riley of the Free Mumia Abu-Jamal Coalition said the demonstrators in
both cities were opposing capital punishment and calling for a new trial for
Abu-Jamal, whose jailhouse writings about the justice system have attracted
worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The idea is to send a message to the Supreme Court that people all around
the country are upset that Mumia Abu-Jamal did not get a fair trial,'' Riley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Abu-Jamal, a one-time Black Panther and radio journalist, was convicted of
fatally shooting a Philadelphia police officer in 1981 after the officer stopped
Abu-Jamal's brother for driving the wrong way down a city street.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court turned down an appeal by Abu-Jamal last October. He still
could pursue a new round of appeals.

<HEADLINE> Flight Cos. Fight For China Routes  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN BACHMAN AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines shuttles people and United Parcel Service
hauls freight to the far points of the world. Rarely do their businesses meet.
</P>
<P>
	   But now the Atlanta-based companies find themselves competing for the right
to fly to China, a gold mine of future business that American firms are
scrambling to tap.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other applicants, American Airlines and Polar Air Cargo, round out the
foursome of airlines hoping to launch China service.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Transportation will award a new route designation to one
of the four, along with up to 10 round-trip flights weekly. The three American
carriers that now fly to China -- Northwest, United and Federal Express -- also
have applied for the additional flights.
</P>
<P>
	   American, Delta, UPS and Polar plan to file the last of their arguments
Tuesday on why they should win the rights. Each company will then have until
March 28 to rebut its rivals' claims.
</P>
<P>
	   The DOT will award the route and flight frequencies during the summer,
spokesman Bill Mosley said Monday. The new flights are scheduled to begin April
1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   With two passenger carriers and two cargo carriers applying, one of the
first decisions will be which enterprise would better serve consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything that somebody can argue is in the public's interest we'll
certainly take into consideration," Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Montgomery, vice president of government and industry affairs for Long
Beach, Calif.-based Polar, said the application process has been unprecedented
because of China's commercial potential. China is working to enter the World
Trade Organization and could receive permanent status as a most-favored-nation
trading partner of the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Under an April 1999 aviation treaty, China and the U.S. agreed to double the
number of passenger and cargo flights among all U.S. airlines from 27 to 54 by
2001. The Department of Transportation awarded 17 additional routes to United,
Northwest and FedEx last year.
</P>
<P>
	   No future flights have been negotiated, which makes the current competition
even more crucial, spokesmen for the four applicants said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Polar's campaign has been dwarfed by spending among its larger rivals,
Montgomery said, calling it "a David and Goliath difference."
</P>
<P>
	   "Our hope is that it would be judged on the merits, not the amount of money
spent on public relations efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike American, Delta and UPS, Polar is seeking only six of the 10 routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta said it would offer the only nonstop flight from New York to Beijing,
shaving 10 hours from the usual travel time. That flight would begin in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta and American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, also argue that they'll
carry cargo as well as people, while UPS and Polar will not transport people.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Yohe, Delta's senior vice president of governmental affairs, said his
company considers cross-town rival UPS its biggest adversary for the routes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not discounting American. Obviously, Chicago is an important
gateway," Yohe said. "But we feel like UPS is, at least right now, our strongest
competition."
</P>
<P>
	   With 10 routes, UPS says it would fly six times weekly from Ontario, Calif.,
to Beijing and Shanghai and four times weekly from Newark, N.J., to Shanghai,
with a stop in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   American wants to fly daily from its Chicago hub to Shanghai and thrice
weekly from Chicago to Beijing. Polar wants to fly four times per week from New
York to several Chinese cities and twice weekly from Los Angeles to Beijing and
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
	   "The potential for the Chinese market is huge," said American spokesman Mark
Slitt. "If you're going to be a global player in this century then you have to
be in Asia."

<HEADLINE> Dope Ingredient May Fight Cancer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Marijuana-like drugs eradicated some brain cancers in rats
and helped other animals live longer, possibly hinting at a new approach for
treating the disease, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   But brain cancer experts said they aren't impressed.
</P>
<P>
	   The study dealt with gliomas, the most common category of cancer arising in
the brain. Gliomas are highly lethal in people despite treatment with drugs,
surgery and radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   The rat study was published in the March issue of the journal Nature
Medicine. It was conducted by scientists at the Complutense and Autonoma
universities in Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   They injected glioma cells into the brains of rats to produce tumors.
Untreated rats died within 18 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Other rats were treated with drug infusions for seven days through a tube
leading to the tumor. Fifteen rats got infusions of THC, the main active
component in marijuana. Tumors disappeared in three animals, and nine other rats
outlived the untreated ones, surviving up to 35 days.
</P>
<P>
	   When researchers used a different but similar drug, five of 15 rats became
tumor-free and four others outlived untreated animals, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dr. Philip Gutin, chief of neurosurgery at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York, said other experimental therapies work better in
rats. And the paper doesn't demonstrate that the effect came from the drugs
rather than simply the infusion of liquid into the brain, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Rolf Barth, who studies brain tumors at Ohio State University, called
the work interesting. But he said the type of glioma cells used to create the
tumors does not provide a very good mimic of the human disease.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Haider Reportedly Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Joerg Haider, the politician known for his
anti-foreigner statements and past praise of Nazi employment policies, resigned
Monday as head of the far-right Freedom Party, the Austria Press Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency quoted unidentified party sources attending a closed-door meeting
of the group's national leadership at a downtown hotel. Party officials would
not confirm the report pending a news conference expected later Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   APA said Haider, who holds no post in the national government, would stay on
as governor of Carinthia province. The move was seen as an attempt to reduce
international criticism of the new coalition government between Haider's
rightists and the center-right Austrian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency quoted party sources as saying Haider will be succeeded as party
chief by his trusted lieutenant, Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer, 39.
</P>
<P>
	   APA said Haider told the party leadership meeting that he was stepping down
because he did not want ``to stand in the way'' of the work of the new
government.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14 other European Union members have downgraded relations with Austria
because of the presence of Haider's party in the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, Peter Sichrovsky, the Freedom Party's EU representative,
said Haider had mentioned stepping down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Already on Saturday, he mentioned it in an internal party discussion,''
Sichrovsky said. ``He has already achieved more than anyone else, and if that is
his decision, then we must respect it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the international furor, Haider remains popular with many Austrians
and within the party he nearly single-handedly built up from a small, unknown
group to the second-largest political force in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At least 50 percent of the Freedom Party is Joerg Haider,'' Hans Joerg
Schimanek, from the Lower Austrian Freedom Party, told the Austria Press Agency.
``I don't need to say anything more.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has led the Freedom Party since 1986. Since last March, he has also
served as governor of Carinthia province.
</P>
<P>
	   Sichrovsky said stepping down as party head would allow Haider to
concentrate more on politics in Carinthia.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly elected head of the opposition Social Democratic party, Alfred
Gusenbauer, however, said resigning would be merely ``one of Haider's many
tactical tricks'' and would give the coalition a respite from criticism.

<HEADLINE> Census Works To Repair Image  </HEADLINE>
   By GENARO C. ARMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials with the Census Bureau -- the agency charged
with compiling accurate statistics on the population -- worked Monday to repair
the bureau's public image after it sent out 115 million census mailings with the
wrong addresses.
</P>
<P>
	   A printing glitch caused an extra digit to be printed before each
recipient's street address, Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt said. For
instance, instead of reading ''10 Main St.'', the address would read ''110 Main
St.''
</P>
<P>
	   The error only affected mailings sent to households reminding them of the
upcoming head count, and they will get to the intended addresses anyway, the
bureau insisted. The actual census surveys, which will be sent out in late
March, have the correct addresses, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem is cosmetic rather than operational. In describing the problem
as cosmetic, I do not intend to trivialize it. The public image of the census is
nearly as important as the actual operations of the census,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The mailings will still go through because a computer bar code imprinted on
them, which Postal Service scanners read to sort mail, contains the right
address, allowing carriers to deliver them to the proper homes, according to
officials at the Census Bureau and the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Prewitt acknowledged the mistake creates a public relations problem.
Bureau officials are putting out new ads this week urging residents to open the
census letter when it gets to their home.
</P>
<P>
	   Quality-control checks by the printer, Freedom Graphic Systems of Milton,
Wis., and government officials did not catch the mistake, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Freedom Graphic Systems had a $5.9 million contract with the Government
Printing Office to produce the mailings, and it was unclear if any money would
be refunded, said Anthony Allighen, government projects coordinator at the
company.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this point, I don't think anybody has gone that far yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The error was first discovered last week by postal workers in New England,
officials said. Until then, Census operations had been relatively glitch-free.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, officials noted they were ahead of schedule in attracting 1.7
million qualified applicants to fill more than 860,000 temporary jobs -- mostly
workers who will go door-to-door this summer to get information from people who
did not mail back their surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the first time the bureau is using an informational mailing in
advance of the questionnaire to publicize the census, which occurs every ten
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional overseers differed on how the public would react to the error.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Census Bureau sends an advanced notification letter with the hopes of
raising public awareness that the Census is coming, and oddly enough, this error
may help dojust that,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., ranking member of the
House Census subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., said he has asked the General
Accounting Office and the Commerce Department's Inspector General's Office to
evaluate the long-term implications of the error.

<HEADLINE> Davis Etkin admits to bribery, defrauding the government  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) - The former chief of the Off-Track Betting Corp.
covering 17 eastern New York counties pleaded guilty Monday to diverting funds
to pay for a lavish lifestyle and other wrongdoings.
<P>
	   Davis Etkin, 72, of Niskayuna faces 1 1/3 to 4 years in prison for charges
of defrauding the government and 2 1/3 to 7 years for bribing a witness, both
felonies. He must also pay restitution, the amount of which will be determined
following a hearing scheduled to begin March 24.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of a plea agreement before Judge Guy Tomlinson in Schenectady County
Court, Etkin admitted to diverting an undisclosed amount of corporate assets for
his own and others' personal use and participating in an attempt to bribe a
witness who was to testify against him.
</P>
<P>
	   "Guilty," Etkin, himself a licensed lawyer, said in response to each charge,
fidgiting slightly and looking mostly at the floor or at his son sitting on a
side row of the courtroom. Through his attorney, he insisted on phrasing such as
"diverting property" and "improperly charging items to OTB," rather than
stealing.
</P>
<P>
	   His son, 39-year-old Mark Etkin, has already been sentenced to three months
in jail and five years probation for offering witness Cheryl Flahive $2,100 to
lie before a grand jury investigating his father. Flahive was paid for a no-show
job at the agency. The younger Etkin served just days of his sentence before
being released on an appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1998, Etkin stepped down after 25 years as chairman and president
of the Capital District OTB amid scathing allegations of corruption within the
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1992 and 1996, state investigators said, the corporation had $3
million in net operating losses. It also had the highest total expenses in
relation to revenues than any OTB corporation in the state, and was the only one
of the state's OTBs to lose money four years in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   A report by the state Comptroller's office contrasted questionable spending
of millions of OTB dollars with anemic returns to counties meant to share in OTB
profits. The 36-page report pointed to such apparent excesses at corporation
expense as Etkin's eight cellular phones, $750,000 in complimentary meals and
luxury box seats at sporting events.
</P>
<P>
	   "For years, Davis Etkin authorized expenditures that rewarded his family,
friends and associates, and abused his position," said state Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer, whose office prosecuted Etkin. "With this plea, however, we have
demonstrated that public officials - no matter how influential or entrenched -
will be held accountable for their actions."
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's plea deal saves members of Etkin's family from further charges
relating to the OTB scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Davis just wanted to put it behind him and take care of himself, take care
of his family," said Stephen Coffey, Etkin's attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   The case against Davis Etkin is part of a continuing investigation by the
attorney general's office. On Wednesday, a trial begins for three men including
an OTB official indicted on felony charges of rigging bids for work contracts on
OTB venues throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Albany County Executive Michael Breslin, whose task force investigating OTB
several years ago spurred state action, said that Albany and other counties in
the region missed out on millions of dollars as a result of OTB misspending.
Monday, he said he was pleased to hear that Etkin had pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   "People said, 'Come on, Michael, you can't climb that tree," Breslin said.
"My intention all along was to get every dollar of taxpayer money back to the
taxpayer."
</P>
<P>
	   Counties and municipalities sharing revenues with the Capital District OTB
include: Clinton, Montgomery, Fulton, Greene, Columbia, Rensselaer, Warren,
Herkimer, Oneida, Franklin, Madison, Washington, St. Lawrence, Essex, Cortland
and Albany counties as well as the cities of Albany and Schenectady.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Once-a-Day Allergy Drug  </HEADLINE>
   By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Just in time for hay fever season, allergy sufferers are
getting another once-a-day drug that stops their sniffling and sneezing but
doesn't make them drowsy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration has approved a once-daily version of
Allegra, giving its manufacturer a new weapon to challenge Claritin, the world's
most popular prescription antihistamine. Previously, Allegra had to be taken
twice a day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will put us on equal footing,'' said Suzanne Wiele, a spokeswoman for
Aventis, the French-German pharmaceutical firm that makes Allegra. The new pill
will be available in mid-March, Aventis said Monday in announcing the FDA
approval.
</P>
<P>
	   The once-a-day version of Allegra will sell for $2.07 per pill compared to
$2.24 for Claritin, although both are usually covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   About 35 million Americans suffer from hay fever, known medically as
allergic rhinitis. The condition is triggered by airborne pollen that emanates
seasonally from grass, ragweed and trees. Hay fever season gets under way next
month in most parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Allegra had about $700 million in worldwide sales, making it a
distant second to Schering-Plough's Claritin, which had $2.7 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Allegra will gain some market share,'' predicted Joseph Riccardo, an
analyst with Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
	   Schering-Plough has overcome pressure to its signature product.
</P>
<P>
	   Claritin grew rapidly in the mid-1990s despite the introduction of Pfizer's
Zyrtec and Allegra's twice-a-day version. One reason is that Schering Plough has
advertised it heavily to consumers, increasing the number of people seeking
prescription drugs to treat their allergies instead of relying on
over-the-counter remedies.
</P>
<P>
	   Claritin's success can also be attributed to the convenience of once-daily
dosages and the fact that it doesn't make users sleepy.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyrtec is a once-a-day allergy pill, but does cause drowsiness.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA also approved Allegra for children as young as six, and for hives,
an allergic reaction that causes the skin to become red and itchy. But in both
of those cases, the drug needs to be taken twice a day. Claritin is taken once
daily in these cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Nover, an analyst with A.G. Edwards, predicted Allegra sales will
increase, but he doesn't expect Claritin to lose its No. 1 spot because it has
been on the market since 1993 and is well established.
</P>
<P>
	   The most common side effect for both drugs is headache.
</P>
<P>
	   Claritin's first patent is set to expire in 2002, meaning the drug will face
competition from cheaper generics that year. Schering-Plough is seeking FDA
approval for its next generation allergy drug, which is expected to take effect
more quickly than Claritin.

<HEADLINE> HMO Reform Bill Debate To Begin  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Americans and presidential candidates staunchly
favoring patients' rights, lawmakers are pressing to craft compromise HMO
protections without alienating politically powerful businesses. Key work begins
this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Insurers and corporations are waging a pitched battle against the proposed
legislation, arguing that giving Americans the right to sue over denial of care
will raise premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   They've even conducted their own polls suggesting many workers would lose
coverage because companies, fearing lawsuits, would stop offering health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers who must reconcile two versions of the legislation -- one passed
by the House that allows lawsuits and another approved by the Senate that does
not -- are caught in the crossfire of a well-heeled business lobby and the
dynamics of presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Republicans, particularly in the Senate, oppose giving patients the
right to sue.
</P>
<P>
	   But their task became more complicated when the party's presidential
frontrunner, George W. Bush, began running ads boasting he ``delivered a
patient's bill of rights'' in Texas ``while Washington politicians deadlocked.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Bush didn't even approve his state law -- it became law without his
signature.
</P>
<P>
	   But both he and his main rival, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have declared
their support for federal legislation that permits lawsuits. And that has upped
the ante for the party's congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We get the Texas model thrown up at us all the time,'' said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., a member of a House-Senate conference committee that meets
Thursday to begin hammering out a compromise. ``It puts added pressure on
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas law, among the strongest patient protection measures in the
country, allows patients to sue their HMO for delaying or denying care if those
decisions harmed patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders concede a compromise will have to include some provision
for lawsuits, but the question remains how far GOP senators will go.
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchinson predicted any GOP-backed right-to-sue provision would come with
lots of restrictions.
</P>
<P>
	   One possibility, similar to a Republican House bill rejected last fall,
would:
</P>
<P>
	   --allow lawsuits only after patients go through appeal panels;
</P>
<P>
	   --cap the size of damage awards;
</P>
<P>
	   --cover only the 48 million Americans whose health plans are exempt from
state regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   If pressure from Republican presidential hopefuls isn't enough, Americans
are widely in favor of new measures against health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public
Health showed 72 percent of voters favored patient protections. That support
dropped to 53 percent, however, if protections drove up premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have aligned themselves with the House version of the legislation,
which drew bipartisan support, and are heaping criticism on the efforts to
prevent lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The House has passed strong, effective bipartisan legislation. The Senate
has passed a weak bill that only an insurance company could love,'' said Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has made it clear he wants a bill that would allow
patients to sue health providers. The White House also has voiced concerns about
the House version of the legislation because it includes proposals to expand
medical savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Those accounts let people set aside money, tax free, to pay routine medical
bills and the premium for a high-deductible insurance. Companies with fewer than
50 workers can offer them under a pilot test set up by Congress in 1997.
Republicans want to expand that to more Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think it's premature to be expanding in this area'' said Chris
Jennings, Clinton's chief health policy advisor.
</P>
<P>
	   Both parties face pressures from their traditional campaign donors. Trial
lawyers, which overwhelming favor Democrats, staunchly support the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
	   And business groups are warning that if Republicans give even limited rights
to sue, they'll end up in hot water with one of their biggest sources of
financial support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With the control of Congress being such a thin margin, there's little room
for error,'' said Neil Trautwein, director of employment policy at the National
Association of Manufacturers. ``They can't save the store by decimating the
employer-based health care system.''
</P>
<P>
	   A third of companies in an insurance-industry sponsored survey said they
would stop offering health plans to all or some of their workers if the House
bill passed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House bill would increase
premiums for employer-sponsored plans by an average of 4.1 percent, while the
Senate version would result in a 1.3 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchinson said some lawmakers weren't buying the argument that companies
will cut off workers' health benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most members think that's a scare tactic,'' Hutchinson told a group of NAM
members last week.

<HEADLINE> Copper Down, Gasoline, Gas Up  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Copper futures tumbled to nearly a four-month low Monday amid investor
uneasiness over a possible tightening of the U.S. economy that could hurt the
construction industry, the metal's mainstay.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, gasoline and natural gas prices jumped sharply and wheat
fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Copper hit a 26-month high last month on the New York Mercantile Exchange
thanks to the new housing boom, the economy's zoom and an increase in aluminum.
But prices have fallen 10 percent since then as the rosy glow on construction
has faded somewhat.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates and comments by Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan that more can be expected have put steadily increasing pressure on
copper.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, copper for May delivery fell 3.35 cents, or 4 percent, to 79.40
cents a pound after sinking to a 3 1/2-month low of 79.15 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said there was little fresh news to cause the plunge. But when
other metals sank lower, copper jitters made it a prime candidate to be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a little bit of interest rate fear that's been kind of weighing
down the markets for a couple of weeks," said Bill O'Neill, senior futures
strategist for Merrill Lynch. "It's an accumulation of economic pressures and
concerns which have gradually been taking their toll."
</P>
<P>
	   Continuing high global inventories also are putting pressure on copper
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere on the New York Merc, March unleaded gasoline leaped 6 percent
higher, settling up 5.12 cents at 91.38 cents a gallon, on tight supplies ahead
of Tuesday's contract expiration.
</P>
<P>
	   Stronger cash prices pushed April natural gas up 6.9 cents to $2.686 per
1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   Other energy commodities retreated. April crude oil fell 22 cents to $30.13
a barrel, March heating oil fell 1.21 cent to 81.67 cents a gallon and, in
London, April Brent crude from the North Sea fell 7 cents to $27.41 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat prices declined by 1 percent on the Chicago Board of Trade on the
outlook for more wet weather in much of the U.S. winter wheat belt. Other grains
and soybeans were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for May delivery fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.56 3/4 a bushel; May corn fell
 3/4 cent to $2.20 3/4 a bushel; May oats rose  1/2 cent to $1.15 1/2 a bushel;
May soybeans rose  3/4 cent to $5.06 1/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Unions Sign Holy Year Truce  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ROME (AP) -- Government and union leaders signed a limited pact Monday aimed
at heading off strikes this year, while air traffic controllers stopped work in
Italy's latest transport-paralyzing labor protest.
</P>
<P>
	   The pact stops short of an outright moratorium on strikes for the Roman
Catholic Church's 2000 Holy Year, but is meant to make them less troublesome for
the year's projected 30 million pilgrims and tourists.
</P>
<P>
	   "Naturally, it doesn't pretend to be a miracle formula for avoiding strikes
and reducing conflicts. But it's a step in the right direction," said Rome Mayor
Francesco Rutelli.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutelli planned to follow the national accord with a local one governing
strikes and demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   The main intent of the pact is to give a mediating committee ample notice of
strikes and conflicts that could lead to strikes, with the aim of heading off
walkouts if possible.
</P>
<P>
	   Unions said strikes already scheduled wouldn't be affected by the pact.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, air traffic controllers stopped work at all of Italy's major
airports from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., causing widespread flight cancellations and
delays.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, buses, trams and subways will grind to a halt for 24 hours unless
unions and Transport Minister Pierluigi Bersani can agree on union demands for
higher wages and shorter hours.
</P>
<P>
	   On March 8, unions representing rail workers also plan a 24-hour strike.

<HEADLINE> Tougher Tax Shelter Rules Imposed  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration stepped up its attack on
corporate tax shelters Monday, imposing tougher disclosure requirements aimed at
making it easier to uncover illegal schemes estimated to cost the Treasury $10
billion annually.
</P>
<P>
	   The disclosure requirements will apply both to corporations and the tax
accountants and lawyers who market the schemes.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration also said it would ask Congress to stiffen penalties for
violation of disclosure requirements, and it announced an immediate move to shut
down a popular shelter known as a "debt straddle."
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who disclosed the proposals in a speech
to the Federal Bar Association, said the comprehensive package was aimed at
addressing "what may be the most serious compliance issue threatening the
American tax system today."
</P>
<P>
	   Tax shelters are complex plans developed by tax accountants and lawyers and
sold to corporations as a way to avoid paying taxes. The administration
estimates that illegal shelters the government has uncovered and closed over the
past decade should result in $80 billion in increased tax revenues in the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "These transactions have no goal other than to reduce a corporation's tax
liabilities. In doing so, they undermine the integrity of the tax system,"
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department said it was putting into effect immediately three
new disclosure regulations to require corporations to report use of certain
shelters to the IRS when it files a tax return.
</P>
<P>
	   Promoters of certain shelters would have to disclose these shelters to the
government and also keep a list of businesses using the shelters that would have
to be provided to IRS agents upon request.
</P>
<P>
	   The disclosure requirements would be triggered for tax-avoidance schemes
with characteristics including a fee charged by the promoter of more than
$100,000 or confidentiality protections offered to businesses that participate.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathan Talisman, acting assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said
the administration hoped that just the existence of the disclosure rules would
act as a deterrent for businesses tempted to use them.
</P>
<P>
	   The disclosure requirements come under a 1997 law passed by Congress at the
administration's urging to crack down on shelters. The administration said it
would propose new legislation this year to stiffen penalties in the tax-shelter
area including doubling the penalty from 20 percent to 40 percent for corporate
tax underreporting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican-controlled Congress may balk at the stiffer penalties, which
have already drawn complaints from business.
</P>
<P>
	   But Talisman, speaking to a small group of reporters, insisted that the
administration's crackdown on abusive shelters enjoys bipartisan support in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration said the tougher penalties could raise $23 billion for
the government over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The "debt straddle" tax shelter the administration moved against Monday
creates an artificial tax loss by setting up two debt instruments, with the
interest on one dropping to zero while the interest on the other doubles.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said the debt straddle was best described as a "heads I win, tails I
win" strategy to avoid paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The new regulations, which will be published in the Federal Register, were
put into operation immediately on a temporary basis and could be modified, based
on public comments in coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Heinz To Buy Beech-Nut's Parent Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- H.J. Heinz Co. has agreed to buy Milnot Holding Corp.,
owner of the Beech-Nut brand prepared baby foods, giving the Pittsburgh-based
company a larger stake in the baby foods industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Terms of the merger, announced Monday, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis-based Milnot's largest subsidiary is Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp.
Together, Heinz and Beech-Nut make up about 24 percent of the U.S. prepared baby
food category.
</P>
<P>
	   That's still a far cry from Gerber, the industry leader with 73 percent of
the market.
</P>
<P>
	   "Although we will still be a distant second to Gerber, a combination of
Heinz and Beech-Nut will provide the critical mass to make the U.S. baby food
market more competitive, innovative and dynamic," said William R. Johnson, Heinz
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Meader, Milnot president and CEO, said, "It will create a powerful,
national competitor from two regional players, producing for the first time a
credible challenger to Gerber."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Milnot's baby food business, Heinz will acquire the company's
other branded and private-label businesses. Those include Milnot brand
evaporated and sweetened condensed canned milk; and Chilli Man brand canned
chili.
</P>
<P>
	   A news release announcing the deal did not specify whether jobs would be
affected. Phone messages left at both companies were not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Mixed in T-Bill Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities were
mixed in Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department sold $9 billion in three-month bills at a discount
rate of 5.670 percent, up from 5.640 percent last week. An additional $8 billion
was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 5.765 percent -- unchanged from last
week's rate which was the highest since Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-month rate was the highest since May 22, 1995, when the bills sold
for 5.72 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 5.831
percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,856.70 and
6.022 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,708.50.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes in
adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 6.22 percent last week from 6.23 percent the
previous week.

</P>
<P>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Savings from combined operations and
hot-selling Jeeps and Mercedes-Benz luxury cars helped push
earnings at automaker DaimlerChrysler AG up 32 percent for the
fourth quarter and 16 percent over last year. The German-American
company said today it earned $1.6 billion, or $1.60 a share,
excluding one-time charges and gains in the last three months of
1999 compared to $1.21 billion, or 61 cents a share, in the same
period a year ago. Revenue for the quarter also rose 20 percent to
$41.7 billion. DaimlerChrysler shares were up 2 3/16 to 65 11/16.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hog farmers will get a chance to vote on
whether to keep paying the fees that fund the ``other white wheat''
advertising campaign for pork, the government announced today.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said he had the legal authority
to call the referendum even though his department didn't validate
sufficient signatures on petitions that were submitted by farmers
who oppose paying the fees, or ``checkoffs.''

Keiichi Konaga, president of Tokyo-based Arabian Oil Co., said in a
news conference that all efforts to renew the concession failed and
that the loss will halve the amount of crude oil the company
handles. Officials in Saudi Arabia said Aramco for Gulf Operations,

percent, lower at 381.51 points, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx
Index, ended down 6.34 points at 439.13 point. European equity
markets also remained uneasy about the drop in the euro, which hit
an all-time low of 93.90 cents during trading in Asia before
rebounding, and by concerns that the European Central Bank isn't
likely to raise rates to halt the common currency's slide.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers say Pataki underestimated state revenues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki underestimates revenues in his
proposed budget by as much as $1.15 billion, state lawmakers announced Monday as
they released their revenue forecasts for the next state fiscal year.
<P>
	   The Democrat-controlled Assembly said Pataki's nearly $78 billion executive
budget underestimates state revenues by at least $1.15 billion. In total, the
Democratic Assembly predicted $1.25 billion in surpluses and reserves when they
added in what they called overestimated Medicaid and public assistance spending.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican Senate said it found an additional $940 million in revenue
coming into the state that is not reflected in Pataki's spending plan.
</P>
<P>
	   When Pataki released his executive budget for fiscal 2000-01 in January,
both chambers said they would increase his spending on education and other
areas. The Assembly and Senate will likely use their revenue estimates to
justify that spending in this year's budget showdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our forecast is based on the fact that New York's economy continues to grow
and expand, new jobs are being created, businesses and individuals are enjoying
a greater success and prosperity than they have in many years," Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno's Senate Republicans are expected to outline a series of tax cut
proposals this week totaling more than $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver also credited the strong economy in New York
and across the nation for the state having the extra money. "The strength of New
York's economy is suggestive of the national expansion, which is now the longest
in our history," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Technically, the Legislature and governor are supposed to come to an
agreement on available revenues by March 10 each year, but all sides have
thumbed their noses at that requirement. In addition, for the last 15 years,
lawmakers have been unable to reach a budget agreement before the start of the
state's fiscal year on April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Minority Leader John Faso, R-Columbia, also said he believes Pataki
underestimated the state's growth. His estimate shows about $608 million in
extra revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm hopeful that there will be agreement to use these resources wisely so
we can reach agreement on a prudent and balanced budget by the April 1
deadline," Faso said.

<HEADLINE> Dilemma for Mutual-Fund Investors  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market's split personality presents mutual-fund
investors with a tricky dilemma.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who embraced mutual funds for their promise of well-rounded,
diversified assets now face a market driven almost entirely by a single sector
-- the booming technology group. As a result, financial professionals are seeing
a steady trickle of money out of wide-ranging funds and into technology and
Internet funds that offer the promise of rapid growth but carry greater risk.
</P>
<P>
	   "Blue-chips are perceived as being as old-fashioned as needlepoint," said
Brian S. Mattes, a principal at mutual fund powerhouse Vanguard Group in Valley
Forge, Pa. "The only funds that are attracting attention are tech funds, or
those that offer supercharged growth."
</P>
<P>
	   The trend isn't new, analysts said, but it has accelerated in recent weeks
as technology companies drove the Nasdaq composite index to record levels while
the blue-chip Dow industrial average foundered. Last Friday, the Dow closed
below 10,000 for the first time since April 6, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow roared higher on Monday, while the Nasdaq dipped modestly, but
analysts said a single day of blue-chip bargain-hunting was unlikely to reverse
the fortunes of the divergent market. Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment
strategist at Lehman Brothers, said in a report Monday that he expects growth
stocks to outperform value stocks for the seventh straight year in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   That undoubtedly means that mutual funds that aim for strong growth will
continue to attract waves of money at the expense of more conservative
investment vehicles, analysts said. Health care and biotechnology funds are also
hot, fund company executives said, but technology remains the top draw.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are clearly chasing performance, and the way the market has been
going, technology is the only area they think is worth chasing," said Steven
Norwitz, a vice president at mutual fund company T. Rowe Price.
</P>
<P>
	   The numbers bear him out. In the week ended Wednesday, Feb. 23, investors
poured $1.6 billion into technology stock funds, $1.2 billion into biotechnology
funds and $1 billion into aggressive growth stock funds, according to AMG Data
Services in Arcata, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   But at the same time, investors withdrew more money from Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index funds than they put in. Index funds, which are designed to mirror the
performance of a stock market index, have been among investors' favorites over
the course of the bull market, now heading into its 10th year.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, index funds provided an easy way for investors to match the broad
market's returns. But last year, as dozens of aggressive growth funds posted
returns of 100 percent or more, the double-digit returns available from most
index funds suddenly appeared sluggish.
</P>
<P>
	   More conservative vehicles, like money market and balanced funds, are also
on the wane, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Executives at several mutual fund companies say the newest technology funds
are attracting investors' money -- even without proven performance records.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong Funds Inc., based in Milwaukee, launched two new funds at the start
of the year, hoping to meet demand for technology investing, said Dana Russart,
director of retail operations. To date, the Strong Internet Fund has taken in
$66 million, while the Technology 100 Fund has swelled to $128 million in
assets, Russart said.
</P>
<P>
	   While mutual fund companies are thriving on the waves of new money,
investment professionals are concerned that investors are putting their
portfolios at risk by focusing on the volatile technology sector.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are anxious to believe that they have their money in the sectors
that are performing well, but there's a real danger in putting all your marbles
in one basket," said Geoff Bobroff, an East Greenwich, R.I.-based mutual fund
consultant.
</P>
<P>
	   Fund experts also point out that investing in one sector or group of
companies destroys the diversification that leads many investors to favor mutual
funds over individual stock investing in the first place.
</P>
<P>
	   "Trends can turn around very quickly," said Norwitz. He pointed out that
international funds and small-cap funds, which fell out of favor in 1997 and
1998, are rebounding strongly this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Professionals also caution that investors who are now chasing the stellar
performance of technology stocks could be in for a harsh disappointment if the
technology-dominated Nasdaq tumbles.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would remind investors that any fund that's capable of generating returns
of 80 percent can generate a loss of 80 percent as well," said Mattes.

<HEADLINE> Heinz To Buy Beech-Nut's Parent Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- H.J. Heinz Co. has agreed to buy Milnot Holding Corp.,
owner of the Beech-Nut brand prepared baby foods, giving the Pittsburgh-based
company a larger stake in the baby foods industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Terms of the merger, announced Monday, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis-based Milnot's largest subsidiary is Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp.
Together, Heinz and Beech-Nut make up about 24 percent of the U.S. prepared baby
food category.
</P>
<P>
	   That's still a far cry from Gerber, the industry leader with 73 percent of
the market.
</P>
<P>
	   "Although we will still be a distant second to Gerber, a combination of
Heinz and Beech-Nut will provide the critical mass to make the U.S. baby food
market more competitive, innovative and dynamic," said William R. Johnson, Heinz
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Meader, Milnot president and CEO, said, "It will create a powerful,
national competitor from two regional players, producing for the first time a
credible challenger to Gerber."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Milnot's baby food business, Heinz will acquire the company's
other branded and private-label businesses. Those include Milnot brand
evaporated and sweetened condensed canned milk; and Chilli Man brand canned
chili.
</P>
<P>
	   A news release announcing the deal did not specify whether jobs would be
affected. Phone messages left at both companies were not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Leadership Change at Citigroup  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The crowded executive suite at Citigroup Inc. is emptying
out. John S. Reed said Monday he will retire in April as co-chairman and
co-chief executive officer of the nation's largest financial services company.
His partner may not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanford I. Weill, 66, who will become the sole chairman and CEO, said he
wants the board to find a successor within two years.
</P>
<P>
	   While there are a handful of Citigroup senior executives who will be
elbowing for the top job, one of the most likely candidates already has bowed
out.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Rubin, 61, the former treasury secretary who joined the company in
October as the chairman of the board's executive committee, said Monday, "I will
not be CEO."
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Citigroup rose by nearly 3 percent, or by $1.37 1/2, to $49.37 1/2
as of the 4 p.m. EST close of the New York Stock Exchange as investors applauded
the thinning ranks at the top.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's better to have one boss than two," said James Schmidt, head of the
financial team at John Hancock Funds, which owns about 1 million shares of
Citigroup. "Up to now, the two were sharing power, but one was more equal than
the other."
</P>
<P>
	   Weill has been calling the day-to-day shots since July, while Reed has
focused on the company's Internet strategy. Reed and Weill joined forces in 1998
when they combined Citicorp and Travelers Group to form a global financial giant
that could offer consumers one-stop shopping. But Reed, a staid banker, often
clashed with Weill, a Wall Street dealmaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed, now 61, said Monday he had planned to retire at 60, but stayed to help
shepherd the integration of the companies that now include Citibank; Travelers
insurance and the Salomon Smith Barney brokerage and investment banking house.
</P>
<P>
	   While rumored for months, Reed said he first discussed his departure with
Weill in January. The final decision was made Sunday at a board meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was pretty clear, I was the one who most wanted to retire," Reed told
reporters in a conference call. He plans to leave as of the April 18
shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's announcement came less than a week after Citigroup's chief
financial officer, Heidi G. Miller, said she was leaving to join the Internet
company Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed, who was named CEO in 1984, ends a 35-year career at the bank. He has
seen a complete transformation of the industry, from the toaster-giveaway days
of regulated interest rates to fashioning the merger that brought the end to
Depression Era prohibitions against the combination of banks, brokerage and
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   As a banker, Reed was quick to embrace automated teller machines, credit
cards and electronic banking, said Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president
of the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Reed's watch, Citigroup has prospered, with earnings from operations
soaring almost 57 percent last year to almost $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed also has profited, earning $9.5 million in salary and bonus, plus $16
million in stock in 1998, the most recent figures available. He will leave with
more than 4.7 million shares of Citigroup's stock.
</P>
<P>
	   "John is going to be one of the biggest shareholders," Weill joked. "We want
to keep him happy so he doesn't complain."
</P>
<P>
	   But Weill wasn't always so concerned with Reed's mood. The two have very
different management styles. Reed has confessed to early friction in their
relations, but later said they had learned to get along.
</P>
<P>
	   Weill began his career as a messenger at the investment firm Bear Stearns
Cos. in 1955. Five years later, he borrowed $200,000 and with three friends
formed a brokerage that, through acquisitions, became Shearson Loeb Rhoades. In
1981, he sold Shearson to American Express. Two years later he was president of
American Express.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, Weill quit as it became clear he would not succeed James Robinson
III as CEO. A year later, he started the company that would become Travelers.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were not surprised to see Weill strengthen his grip on Citigroup,
nor were they disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sandy has a history of delivering to shareholders. He doesn't get bogged
down in bureaucracy. He's a doer," said Schmidt, the portfolio manager at John
Hancock.
</P>
<P>
	   The question Monday, however, was, Who will be the next "doer" at Citigroup?
</P>
<P>
	   Among the senior ranks, analysts handicapping the race named Michael
Carpenter, head of the Citigroup's investment bank; Pete Dawkins, vice chairman
of Citibank's private bank; Tom Jones, head of Citigroup's global investment
management and private banking group; Bob Lipp, head of Citigroup's global
consumer business; and Victor Menezes, head of Citibank's corporate bank.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sandy has a couple of years to groom that leader," said Scott Birnbaum, a
vice president at Mercer Management Consulting. But he also said Weill could
fill the post by acquiring another financial services company, such as American
Expesss, which has a strong candidate in CEO Kenneth I. Chenault.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Probes Police Chief's Death  </HEADLINE>
   By NIKO PRICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- In this violent border town where killings occur
daily, Tijuana police tried to resolve one more case Monday: the death of their
popular police chief, whose car was riddled with bullets on a busy highway.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators hope a gray Cherokee sports utility vehicle with California
license plates can offer more clues in Sunday's killing of Alfredo de la Torre
Marquez. Three bullet shells were found in the vehicle, suggesting this could
have been the vehicle used by the attackers, state Attorney General Juan Manuel
Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cherokee was believed to be one of three vehicles used in the attack on
a busy, six-lane divided highway in the northern edge of Tijuana, just across
the border from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre was driving to his office, and was unaccompanied by his normal
contingent of bodyguards, when gunmen using Kalashnikov rifles and 9-mm pistols
pulled up alongside his black Suburban and fired 99 rounds at him, officials
said. The vehicle crashed into a palm tree on the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Salazar said De la Torre had told his bodyguards that he planned to stay
home all day. It was not clear why he decided to go to his office. De la Torre
was carrying a pistol, but didn't use it.
</P>
<P>
	   No one has been arrested, and the motive for the killing was unknown.
Seventy witnesses and potential suspects were interviewed Sunday, but police had
no suspects, Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
	   Enrique Tellaeche, spokesman for the Baja California state Attorney
General's Office, said the killing was ``obviously linked to organized crime,''
but said it was too early to tell whether it was connected to the Tijuana-based
drug organization led by the Arrellano-Felix brothers, which is notorious for
its gangland-style hits.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration considers the organization one of
the most powerful and violent drug-trafficking groups. One of the brothers,
Ramon Eduardo, is on the FBI's 10 most-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre had been a police officer for 25 years, working his way up from
motorcycle cop, and may have made many enemies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only motive for the killing is his job,'' said Jaime Valencia, a
police forensics supervisor who, like all his colleagues, wore a black band over
his badge. ``A person who does his job well goes against the interests of the
bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said de la Torre was loved by his fellow officers. ``He was the best
director we've had.''
</P>
<P>
	   Baja California is one of Mexico's most violent states, and Tijuana is one
of its most violent cities. It recorded about 300 murders last year, and the
pace of killings has picked up this year.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre is the second Tijuana police chief killed in six years. In April
1994, Federico Benitez and a bodyguard were shot to death when gunmen opened
fire on their vehicle as it drove down a highway near the city's airport.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech while visiting the state Friday, President Ernesto Zedillo
pledged to have federal and state officials improve cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Organized crime has brought to Baja California a trail of violence, a
trail of intimidation,'' he said. ``We have to make these criminals understand
that Baja California can't be their home, that the only places where they
deserve to live are in prisons.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 55 percent of the cocaine used in the United States is shipped through
Mexico or Mexican waters, according to U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the United States, under its annual ``certification program,''
will announce which countries are cooperating in the fight against drug
trafficking. Mexico's certification is virtually assured, but the process always
results in hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexicans consider the process humiliating and a violation of their
sovereignty. They say they are suffering from drug violence, especially on the
border, largely because the United States has done little to reduce its
consumption of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre is also the second police chief in a border city to be killed in
a week. Juan Angel Cabrera Leal, the police chief in Reynosa, was shot to death
last Tuesday. Reynosa is across the border from McAllen, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Rises in January  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' incomes went up faster than their spending did
last month, the first time that's happened since October. Now with extra cash in
their pockets, consumers are expected to spend briskly in the months ahead,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Personal income, which includes wages, interest and government benefits,
increased by a sizable and expected 0.7 percent in January, the Commerce
Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of factors boosted income including cost-of-living adjustments to
Social Security payments and other government benefits programs, pay raises for
federal workers and military personnel, and federal subsidy payments to farmers,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, excluding these factors, incomes grew by 0.6 percent, suggesting that
Americans, posting strong income gains, started the new year off on solid
footing.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity
and is powering the red-hot growth in the U.S. economy, rose by a brisk 0.5
percent last month -- slightly stronger than the gain many analysts' were
forecasting.
</P>
<P>
	   "Income growth is providing a significant thrust for consumer spending,"
said Lynn Reaser, chief economist for the Bank of America Asset Management
Group.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, wages grew by a sharp 0.8 percent, following a 0.7 percent gain
the month before. And farm proprietors' income rose by 1.3 percent in January
after a big plunge.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumers will spend briskly going forward," Reaser predicted provided
there's not a sustained downturn in the stock market, which has been volatile in
recent sessions. On Friday, the Dow Jones plunged sharply closing below 10,000
for the first time in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Stock market gains -- in particular -- along with plentiful jobs and rising
incomes have made Americans feel wealthy and in the mood to spend.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates four times since June to
slow the economy and keep inflation under control. Given continuing strong
growth, many analysts widely expect the Fed will boost rates again in March and
said Monday's report showing robust consumer spending would justify such a move.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite fears of higher interest rates, the Dow, which soared more than 294
points in late afternoon trading, closed up 176.53 points at 10,038.65 as
bargain hunters grabbed shares at reduced prices after last week's big selloff.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Fed's actions made borrowing more expensive for consumers and
businesses, they haven't significantly slowed the economy, which grew at a
breakneck 6.9 percent annual rate in the last three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are no signs of any significant slowdown for consumer spending," said
Merrill Lynch economist Stan Shipley. But economist Sandra Shaber of the WEFA
Group said a downturn in the stock market could convince some to temper their
spending in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   With income growth outpacing the rise in spending, Americans' personal
savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- rose to 1.4
percent in January, following a monthly record low of 1 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
	   But that's not as dire as it seems because the calculation doesn't take into
account gains realized from such things as rising stocks and higher real estate
values for homes.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, spending rose by 1.1 percent as Americans gave retailers their
best holiday sales in years and as consumers stocked up on certain goods in
anticipation of the Year 2000 computer rollover.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1.1 percent advance was more brisk than the government previously
estimated and marked the steepest increase in spending since May 1998. At the
same time, incomes grew by a modest 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, spending on durable goods -- big-ticket manufactured items such
as washing machines and cars, increased by 0.7 percent, following a 1.2 percent
gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
	   But spending on nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, fell by 0.4 percent
in January, reflecting in part a pull back after some people hoarded groceries
and other items in December to prepare for Y2K. In December, spending on
nondurable goods rose by a sizable 2 percent.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Earns, Revenues Up  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Savings from combined operations and hot-selling
Jeeps and Mercedes-Benz luxury cars helped push earnings at automaker
DaimlerChrysler AG up 32 percent for the fourth quarter and 16 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts applauded the results Monday of the firm's first year as a merged
entity. Daimler-Benz bought out Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler Corp. in
late 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors also liked the figures, bidding shares up 2.4 percent, or 1.60
euros, in Frankfurt to close at 67.40 euros ($65.37). Shares rose $2.18 3/4 to
$65.68 3/4 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The German-American company said Monday it earned $1.6 billion, or $1.60 a
share, excluding one-time charges and gains in the last three months of 1999
compared to $1.21 billion, or 61 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for the quarter also rose 20 percent to $41.7 billion from about
$34.8 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, DaimlerChrysler earned $5.8 billion, or $5.77 a share, up from
$4.8 billion, or $5.05 a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler said it beat estimates of $1.54 a share for the quarter and
$6 a share for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "All the major figures were encouraging," said Andrew Blair-Smith, an auto
analyst with Commerzbank in London. "Any differences are not enough to make me
worry."
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding one-time gains from the sale of a stake in Debitel communication
services and charges from restructuring at its Adtranz train division, the auto
giant reported net income rose to $6.27 billion or $6.25 a share for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   That compares with $5.387 billion, or $5.62 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "1999 was our first full year as a combined company and it was very
successful," said co-chairman Juergen Schrempp. "But size is not an end in
itself. Profitable growth is the yardstick of success."
</P>
<P>
	   "We have created a solid foundation for a company that will also be a medium
and long-term winner," Schrempp said. "We launched nine new models last year,
and they became success stories. In 2000, we will bring another 12 car and truck
models to the market."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, revenues rose 14 percent to $151 billion from $132.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Key to the report was nearly $1.2 billion in savings achieved by combined
efforts on back office functions and purchasing. Still, it was disappointing
that these savings merely helped the company maintain its profit margins instead
of improving them, said Georg Stuerzer, an auto analyst at Hypo-Vereinsbank in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
	   A one-time tax hit also helped suppress the bottom line in 1999. Due to
changes in German tax law, the company's tax bill rose 50 percent from 1998 to
$4.56 billion. A weak euro also hurt results.
</P>
<P>
	   All figures are based on the exchange rate of $1.007 per euro in effect on
Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   During 1999, the company said its Chrysler car division revenues climbed 14
percent to $64.5 billion. Its adjusted operating profit was up 22 percent, to
$5.2 billion. Revenues were helped by a 20 percent increase in Jeep sales, to an
all-time high of 680,700 units.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mercedes-Benz and Smart car division had an operating profit in 1999 of
$2.7 billion, up 36 percent, on record revenues of $38.4 billion. Sales of
Mercedes-Benz passengers cars were up more than 10 percent for the year. Sales
of the compact Smart car, available only in Europe, achieved its goal of 80,000
units for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's commercial vehicles division had operating earnings of $1.1
billion, a 13 percent increase over last year. Its services division posted an 8
percent gain in operating earnings, to $1.03 billion. Those results exclude a
one-time gain of $1.15 billion from the sale of Debitel.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Watchdog Group's Records Eyed  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government watchdog group and a House committee
chairman were engaged in a bitter dispute Monday over whether the committee
should have access to the group's telephone records.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House Resources Committee, sent a
subpoena to the Project on Government Oversight, demanding the records --
including the executive director's home phone records -- by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization's lawyer, Stanley Brand, accused Young of trying to
retaliate against the group, also known as POGO, for its campaign to prevent oil
companies from shortchanging the government in royalty payments. He said the
group would not surrender the records.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how Young would proceed, although the committee could vote to
seek a contempt of Congress resolution against the group.
</P>
<P>
	   Young's committee for months has been looking into the circumstances
surrounding POGO's decision to give $350,000 each to two government officials
for their work in trying to expose problems with the way federal royalties are
calculated by oil companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The payments also are being investigation by the Interior Department's
inspector general and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The money was part of $1.2 million POGO was awarded as its share in a
settlement of a royalty payment lawsuit filed in Texas against some major oil
companies. In all, oil companies so far have paid nearly $300 million in
connection with the litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Young and several other Republican members of the House Resources Committee
have questioned whether the two officials -- Robert Berman, a former Interior
Department employee, and Robert Speir of the Energy Department -- acted properly
in accepting the payments. Young has questioned whether it was a payoff for
information.
</P>
<P>
	   But Brand said the subpoenas sent to POGO and its executive director,
Danielle Brian, seeking more documents and the telephone logs seem to go well
beyond the scope of the investigation and could risk exposing the identity of
government whistleblowers who have dealt with the group on a variety of issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to betray these whistleblowers,'' Brian said.
</P>
<P>
	   Young acknowledged that the committee's investigation has moved beyond the
specific payments made by POGO to the two officials, focusing as well on the
organization's early involvement in the Texas lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   That lawsuit was initiated by two former industry executives and was sealed
by the courts. Young said he wants to know how POGO ``discovered a secret
federal lawsuit'' that had been placed under seal.
</P>
<P>
	   The subpoena asks among other things for all telephone logs, phone invoices,
call sheets, message records and voice-mail recordings from Feb. 1, 1996 to June
30, 1997 from POGO's offices as well as Brian's home telephone records.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded in 1981, POGO is a private advocacy group that has been involved in
ferreting out government misconduct, mismanagement, waste and corruption, often
relying on government whistleblowers.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, the group raised the ire of the Energy Department when it obtained
and made public an inspector general's report on waste in the $13 billion
Superconducting Super Collider project. A short time later Congress killed the
project.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, the group came under attack from the Air Force after it accused the
government of burning hazardous wastes in a secret facility, known as Area 51,
in the Nevada desert.

<HEADLINE> Democrat Fund-Raiser Case Criticized  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutors brought charges against a low-level
Democratic fund-raiser because of her longtime association with Vice President
Al Gore, a defense lawyer suggested Monday in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department countered that Los Angeles fund-raiser Maria Hsia
``used 40 to 50 people'' to hide the true sources of more than $100,000 in
campaign donations to the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She cannot try to get away with it, when she is the one who orchestrated
the entire scheme,'' prosecutor Eric Yaffe told the jury in closing arguments at
the trial, now in its fourth week.
</P>
<P>
	   Yaffe said Hsia, an immigration consultant, used a series of ``conduits'' to
make political donations because she ``wanted to maintain herself as a mover and
a shaker in Democratic Party circles'' by being seen as a major fund-raiser. She
was trying to promote her ``business interests,'' Yaffe said.
</P>
<P>
	   The focus of closing arguments was a 1996 fund-raising event that Gore
attended at a Buddhist temple in California, a politically embarrassing episode
for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why is Maria Hsia here?'' asked defense attorney Nancy Luque.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors brought the case because of Hsia's ``relationship with the vice
president'' which ``goes back to 1989. ... That is the only thing I can think
of,'' said Luque.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not elaborate on why prosecutors might have been motivated to bring
a criminal case that would inject Gore's name into the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore attended the April 29, 1996, Buddhist temple event in Hacienda Heights,
Calif. When controversy later erupted about illegal reimbursements to donors,
the vice president said that he hadn't known it was a fund-raising event. On
various occasions, Gore has said he thought it was community outreach,
finance-related or donor maintenance.
</P>
<P>
	   The day after Gore went to the temple, Hsia handed Democratic Party
fund-raising figure John Huang an envelope containing $100,000, according to
Huang's testimony at the trial. The donations were made possible because the
temple reimbursed many of the donors.
</P>
<P>
	   Luque said there is no evidence that Hsia was aware of the reimbursements.
Prosecutor John McEnany pointed out that copies of the illegally reimbursed
checks turned up in Hsia's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsia's fund raising dates back to the late 1980s when she raised money for
Gore, who was trying to replenish his Senate campaign coffers after he
unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Luque said even if the jury believes that Hsia was behind some of the
reimbursements, she did not commit the crime with which she is charged five
times -- causing illegal statements to be filed with the Federal Election
Commission about the true source of campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
	   FEC forms don't even ask for the true source of donations, so ``I guess they
don't care,'' Luque said.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Commemorate Kosovo Deaths  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIKOSANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- About 5,000 ethnic Albanians gathered on a
hillside overlooking this Kosovo village on Monday to commemorate the 1998
Yugoslav crackdown which triggered the province's conflict and brought NATO-led
troops to the region.
</P>
<P>
	   As a sign the violence is not over, a Serb bus in northern Kosovo ran over a
land mine that French peacekeepers fear could have been intended for them. The
nearly empty bus was damaged, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 28, 1998, ethnic Albanian rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army fired
on a vehicle carrying Serb policemen, killing two and injuring two others.
Within an hour, a Serbian special anti-terrorist unit was sent into Likosane and
the neighboring village of Cirez, where the unit's members believed the
guerillas were being sheltered.
</P>
<P>
	   When the anti-terrorist unit left, more than 20 ethnic Albanians were dead.
The raid is generally regarded as the start of the 18-month Serb crackdown,
which ended when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepted a Kosovo peace
plan to end 78 days of NATO air raids.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Serbs killed many,'' Xhevded Ahmeti told the crowd gathered near the
grave site Monday. ``This came as a test for Albanians to see if they could
organize and fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alban Rama, 20, whose brother Zullnet was killed by Serbs just weeks before
NATO-led peacekeepers entered Kosovo in June, explained ethnic Albanians' mixed
views of the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On this day, as much as we feel sad, we also feel joy,'' he said.
``Because this was the day for the beginning of the road to freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the presence of peacekeepers in Kosovo, ethnic violence continues,
predominantly revenge-minded attacks against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Serb bus struck a land mine Monday near the ethnically tense northern
city of Kosovska Mitrovica. A French army spokesman, Lt. Matthieau Mabin, called
the placing of the mine near the Serb village of Zvecan ``terrorism.'' He noted
that peacekeepers use the road every day, suggesting that they could have been
the target.
</P>
<P>
	   Kosovska Mitrovica, about 20 miles north of Kosovo's provincial capital of
Pristina, is divided into ethnic Albanian and Serb parts and has been the scene
of ethnic unrest over the past months.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Yugoslav army on Monday issued a statement denying it had
strengthened its presence near the border between Montenegro and Albania, which
was recently reopened over objections by the federal government in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Monday, the NATO-led Kosovo force, or KFOR, announced maneuvers next
month involving a 2,000-strong ``strategic reserve force,'' which will be sent
into the province for the exercise. The force, made up of troops from Argentina,
Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and the United States, is to be deployed
on March 19.

    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers expressed hope Monday
that authorities in Ecuador will take the proper steps to get its economy back
on track.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers made his comments to reporters after delivering a speech on the need
to crack down on abusive corporate tax shelters to attorneys attending a tax law
conference here.

Ecuador's official currency in a move to stabilize the economy and halt
inflation. Such a move would involve gradually replacing Ecuadorean currency,
the sucre, with the U.S. greenback.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's certainly our hope that Ecuador will move to put in place the kinds of
strong measures that can strengthen its economic fundamentals and afford the

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Highway Rock-Throwing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARMSTADT, Germany (AP) -- Assailants threw stones at cars from a pedestrian
bridge over a German highway, killing two people and injuring five others,
police said Monday. Four U.S. teenagers were detained as suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   The boys, aged 14 to 18, were apprehended at a U.S. military housing area in
this southwestern city, and one of them has admitted taking part in the attacks
late Sunday, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors will seek an arrest warrant Tuesday on charges of murder and
attempted murder, a police statement said. Police said witnesses told them the
teenagers, whose names were withheld, had talked about throwing rocks from the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   A 20-year-old woman was killed when a baseball-sized rock smashed through
her windshield Sunday morning. Her 75-year-old grandparents riding in the car
were injured, the grandmother seriously, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   A short time later, a 41-year-old woman was killed when a rock splintered
her windshield from the same bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, six cars were hit by stones thrown from the bridge over a period of
about 15 minutes police said. Three other people in the other cars received
minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors had offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the
culprits.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they suspected the stones had been taken from a nearby
construction site, and concentrated their search for the assailants in
surrounding neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   German and U.S. military police cars with megaphones drove through
residential areas Monday, including the U.S. housing area, asking anyone to come
forward who might have information or seen someone on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   A special police team was set up in Darmstadt, 12 miles south of Frankfurt,
to investigate.

<HEADLINE> International Antitrust Forum Mulled  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An advisory panel of businessmen, lawyers and academics
recommended Monday that nations with antitrust laws set up an international
forum to discuss ways to harmonize enforcement actions and overcome
anti-competitive barriers to free trade.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel rejected an idea floated in other countries that the 134-member
World Trade Organization could provide such a forum to discuss government and
corporate barriers to more open world markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Trade Organization was not established to deal with competition
policy and "is not equipped to tackle the details and concerns that exist," said
co-chairwoman Paula Stern, who headed the U.S. International Trade Commission in
the Carter and Reagan administrations.
</P>
<P>
	   After two years of study and public hearings, the International Competition
Policy Advisory Committee presented its final 300-page report to Attorney
General Janet Reno and Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein, head of the
Justice Department's antitrust division, who set up the panel.
</P>
<P>
	   Co-chairman James Rill, who headed the antitrust division in the Bush
administration, said the panel advocated a new forum instead of the WTO because
"not all competition problems are trade problems, and not all trade problems are
competition problems."
</P>
<P>
	   Rill said the forum, which the panel called a Global Competition Initiative,
could help more than 60 nations that now review corporate mergers better
understand each other's policies, move toward similar policies and end friction
over international mergers.
</P>
<P>
	   Stern said the group needed to be larger than the 34-nation Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development and chosen not by the size of nation's
economy but by its interest in antitrust issues. She said it could be "a virtual
organization" without its own budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The report compared the idea to the meetings of economics ministers of the
Group of Seven large industrial nations, which has no permanent staff but still
gathers experts to analyze issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Klein thanked the panel for addressing what he called an "increasing ...
mismatch between antitrust enforcement by sovereign nations and the seamless
global economy." Last year, a record $3.4 trillion worth of mergers and
acquisitions was announced worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno said the recommendations come at "a very opportune time," because more
than 20 percent of mergers reviewed by the Justice Department involve either
foreign buyers or foreign sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel recommended that all merger reviews be completed in no more than
two stages, with the first requiring certain minimum information from the
companies and taking no more than one month to complete. It said national
antitrust agencies should be prepared to explain their objections to a merger
when asking for a second round of information.
</P>
<P>
	   In a recommendation for the United States alone, the panel said the minimum
size merger which companies are required to inform the government about in
advance should be raised from $15 million to between $33 million and $43
million.
</P>
<P>
	   It encouraged the signing of more bilateral antitrust agreements containing
provisions that allow a nation victimized by anti-competitive practices
elsewhere to be able to obtain enforcement action by the nation where the
activity is taking place.
</P>
<P>
	   It urged all countries to publish guidelines and annual reports explaining
their antitrust policies. To encourage cooperation, it urged that countries
provide notice when they exchange confidential information in the course of
antitrust investigations.

<HEADLINE> Top Citigroup Exec Search Begins  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The crowded executive suite at Citigroup Inc. is emptying
out. John S. Reed said Monday he will retire in April as co-chairman and
co-chief executive officer of the nation's largest financial services company.
His partner may not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanford I. Weill, 66, who will become the sole chairman and CEO, said he
wants the board to find a successor within two years.
</P>
<P>
	   While there are a handful of Citigroup senior executives who will be
elbowing for the top job, one of the most likely candidates already has bowed
out.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Rubin, 61, the former treasury secretary who joined the company in
October as the chairman of the board's executive committee, said Monday, "I will
not be CEO."
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Citigroup rose by nearly 3 percent, or by $1.37 1/2, to $49.37 1/2
as of the 4 p.m. EST close of the New York Stock Exchange as investors applauded
the thinning ranks at the top.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's better to have one boss than two," said James Schmidt, head of the
financial team at John Hancock Funds, which owns about 1 million shares of
Citigroup. "Up to now, the two were sharing power, but one was more equal than
the other."
</P>
<P>
	   Weill has been calling the day-to-day shots since July, while Reed has
focused on the company's Internet strategy. Reed and Weill joined forces in 1998
when they combined Citicorp and Travelers Group to form a global financial giant
that could offer consumers one-stop shopping. But Reed, a staid banker, often
clashed with Weill, a Wall Street dealmaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed, now 61, said Monday he had planned to retire at 60, but stayed to help
shepherd the integration of the companies that now include Citibank; Travelers
insurance and the Salomon Smith Barney brokerage and investment banking house.
</P>
<P>
	   While rumored for months, Reed said he first discussed his departure with
Weill in January. The final decision was made Sunday at a board meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was pretty clear, I was the one who most wanted to retire," Reed told
reporters in a conference call. He plans to leave as of the April 18
shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's announcement came less than a week after Citigroup's chief
financial officer, Heidi G. Miller, said she was leaving to join the Internet
company Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed, who was named CEO in 1984, ends a 35-year career at the bank. He has
seen a complete transformation of the industry, from the toaster-giveaway days
of regulated interest rates to fashioning the merger that was a catalyst in
ending Depression Era prohibitions against the combination of banks, brokerage
and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   As a banker, Reed was quick to embrace automated teller machines, credit
cards and electronic banking, said Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president
of the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Reed's watch, Citigroup has prospered, with earnings from operations
soaring almost 57 percent last year to almost $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed also has profited, earning $9.5 million in salary and bonus, plus $16
million in stock in 1998, the most recent figures available. He will leave with
more than 4.7 million shares of Citigroup's stock.
</P>
<P>
	   "John is going to be one of the biggest shareholders," Weill joked. "We want
to keep him happy so he doesn't complain."
</P>
<P>
	   But Weill wasn't always so concerned with Reed's mood. The two have very
different management styles. Reed has confessed to early friction in their
relations, but later said they had learned to get along.
</P>
<P>
	   Weill began his career as a messenger at the investment firm Bear Stearns
Cos. in 1955. Five years later, he borrowed $200,000 and with three friends
formed a brokerage that, through acquisitions, became Shearson Loeb Rhoades. In
1981, he sold Shearson to American Express. Two years later he was president of
American Express.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, Weill quit as it became clear he would not succeed James Robinson
III as CEO. A year later, he started the company that would eventually acquire
Travelers.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were not surprised to see Weill strengthen his grip on Citigroup,
nor were they disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sandy has a history of delivering to shareholders. He doesn't get bogged
down in bureaucracy. He's a doer," said Schmidt, the portfolio manager at John
Hancock.
</P>
<P>
	   The question Monday, however, was, Who will be the next "doer" at Citigroup?
</P>
<P>
	   Among the senior ranks, analysts handicapping the race named Michael
Carpenter, head of the Citigroup's investment bank; Pete Dawkins, vice chairman
of Citibank's private bank; Tom Jones, head of Citigroup's global investment
management and private banking group; Bob Lipp, head of Citigroup's global
consumer business; and Victor Menezes, head of Citibank's corporate bank.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sandy has a couple of years to groom that leader," said Scott Birnbaum, a
vice president at Mercer Management Consulting. But he also said Weill could
fill the post by acquiring another financial services company, such as American
Expesss, which has a strong candidate in CEO Kenneth I. Chenault.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak To Expand Rail System  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak riders in Texas, Mississippi and New England may
be the first beneficiaries of an expanded rail system, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Providing details on timing, officials said that by next spring, the
Chicago-San Antonio Texas Eagle might be making daily trips instead of running
four days a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other major changes could be launched by the spring: a Meridian,
Miss.-Dallas leg of the New York-New Orleans Crescent; and the chance for
passengers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Florida to travel the north-south
route without transferring in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next three years, Amtrak officials told a news conference,
passengers will see a much different rail system -- one that will deliver more
mail and other commercial items, run on improved rail beds and be coordinated
with local efforts to get passengers from stations to their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort to expand the rail network in 21 states rather than contract the
system is part of a grand design to have Amtrak run its daily operations without
federal subsidies by 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Amtrak will continued to need government help to purchase and
improve equipment. President Clinton on Monday proposed spending $989 million in
the next fiscal year for this purpose -- an increase of 73 percent over current
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There has never been a better time to expand our investment in Amtrak and
the nation's passenger railways,'' said Clinton, who met with Amtrak board
members.
</P>
<P>
	   Adopting a page from the airlines, the new system would have feeder routes
that would connect to major hubs.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to expansion on individual routes, the program calls for a
transcontinental train that would have limited stops and be designed for the
comfort of leisure travelers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to grow this railroad for the traveling public,'' said Amtrak's
board chairman, Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   Rail officials could not say when most of the improvements would begin.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will meet with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo this spring, the White House announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and Zedillo will hold a working visit on May 23 to ``take stock of
the steadily growing cooperation'' between their two countries, said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart. It will be their 11th meeting.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 176.53; Nasdaq Slips  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bargain hunters grabbed blue-chip stocks Monday, sending
the Dow Jones industrial average soaring more than 176 points in a sharp
recovery from last week's selloff.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Dow posted big gains, the Nasdaq composite index closed lower
after a volatile session for technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow rose 176.53 to 10,038.65, climbing back above the 10,000-mark that
it dropped below Friday for the first time since last April. The average was up
more than 294 points in late afternoon Monday before pulling back.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index, which fell 124 points early Monday, finished the
day only slightly lower with a loss of 12.65 at 4,577.85. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index rose 14.69 to 1,348.05.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stocks never go up or down in a straight line. They bounce around, and
that's exactly what we saw in the market today," said A.C. Moore, chief
investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, much of the stock market -- especially blue-chip issues --
has been battered by fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
for the fifth time in a year to reduce inflationary pressures in the robust U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   But investors managed to look past such concerns on Monday, instead focusing
on the cheap prices available as a result of the sharp decline in financial
services, retail and drug stocks over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   American Express, which has fallen sharply from the 52-week high of 169 1/2
reached on Feb. 1, rose 7 7/8 to 132 5/8 on Monday, the biggest gainer in the
Dow. General Electric, which hit 52-week high of 159 1/2 on Dec. 27, rose 2
13/16 to 128 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today was a mirror image of the dismal performance on Friday that left
investors trembling," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP;
Co. "But today it reversed itself and there was a genuine sigh of relief in the
market."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, analysts warned that the Dow's dramatic rise might be short-lived and
many expect the index to fall back into its volatile pattern in coming weeks as
investors continue to shift money into companies with the best chance for rapid
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
	   That should bode well for the Nasdaq, which comprises many companies that
are on the forefront of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, the Nasdaq has outperformed the Dow, hitting seven record
highs in February while the Dow has tumbled about 1,000 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are asking 'Where can I find earnings growth?" said Alan
Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. "They know that
they can find such growth in technology, Internet and telecom stocks. Those are
outperforming the old economy stocks."
</P>
<P>
	   Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in
Kansas City, Mo., added that "the momentum of this market still rests on the
shoulders of the Nasdaq. This is just a one-day flip from Nasdaq into Dow."
</P>
<P>
	   The volatility in the U.S. stock market prompted selling on financial
markets overseas. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.49 percent, Germany's DAX
index fell 1.95 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 dropped 1.97 percent, and France's
CAC-40 declined 1.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,496 up, 1,478 down and 523 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.24 billion shares, vs. 1.06 billion in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.94 to 557.68.

<HEADLINE> Tougher Tax Shelter Rules Imposed  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration stepped up its attack on
corporate tax shelters Monday, imposing tougher disclosure requirements aimed at
making it easier to uncover illegal schemes estimated to cost the Treasury $10
billion annually.
</P>
<P>
	   The disclosure requirements will apply both to corporations and the tax
accountants and lawyers who market the schemes.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration also said it would ask Congress to stiffen penalties for
violation of disclosure requirements, and it announced an immediate move to shut
down a popular shelter known as a "debt straddle."
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who disclosed the proposals in a speech
to the Federal Bar Association, said the comprehensive package was aimed at
addressing "what may be the most serious compliance issue threatening the
American tax system today."
</P>
<P>
	   Tax shelters are complex plans developed by tax accountants and lawyers and
sold to corporations as a way to avoid paying taxes. The administration
estimates that illegal shelters the government has uncovered and closed over the
past decade should result in $80 billion in increased tax revenues in the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "These transactions have no goal other than to reduce a corporation's tax
liabilities. In doing so, they undermine the integrity of the tax system,"
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department said it was putting into effect immediately three
new disclosure regulations to require corporations to report use of certain
shelters to the IRS when it files a tax return.
</P>
<P>
	   Promoters of certain shelters would have to disclose these shelters to the
government and also keep a list of businesses using the shelters that would have
to be provided to IRS agents upon request.
</P>
<P>
	   The disclosure requirements would be triggered for tax-avoidance schemes
with characteristics including a fee charged by the promoter of more than
$100,000 or confidentiality protections offered to businesses that participate.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathan Talisman, acting assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said
the administration hoped that just the existence of the disclosure rules would
act as a deterrent for businesses tempted to use them.
</P>
<P>
	   The disclosure requirements come under a 1997 law passed by Congress at the
administration's urging to crack down on shelters. The administration said it
would propose new legislation this year to stiffen penalties in the tax-shelter
area including doubling the penalty from 20 percent to 40 percent for corporate
tax underreporting.
</P>
<P>
	   "Better late than never," said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas. But he chided the administration for taking so long to produce
regulations needed to implement disclosure provisions of the 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm pleased that the Treasury Department has finally used the authority
Congress gave it three years ago to identify and register corporate tax
shelters," Archer said in a statement. "We must stop abuses and shut down
illegal tax shelters."
</P>
<P>
	   The administration said the tougher penalties it is seeking in the new
legislation could raise $23 billion for the government over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The "debt straddle" tax shelter the administration moved against Monday
creates an artificial tax loss by setting up two debt instruments, with the
interest on one dropping to zero while the interest on the other doubles.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said the debt straddle was best described as a "heads I win, tails I
win" strategy to avoid paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The new regulations, which will be published in the Federal Register, were
put into operation immediately on a temporary basis and could be modified, based
on public comments in coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Senegal Holds Presidential Elections  </HEADLINE>
   By GLENN McKENZIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- International observers gave a thumbs up Monday to
Senegal's presidential elections, saying scattered violence and logistical
problems failed to tarnish voting in one of Africa's oldest democracies.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of observers from French-speaking nations, however, declined to
predict whether the count -- still underway -- would be entirely fair, or the
results accepted by the 2.7 million registered voters in this country of 10
million people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First comes gestation and then birth,'' said Ide Oumarou, leader of the
French-speaking delegation. ``We can say the mother is healthy for now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Oumarou said observers noted relatively few problems in Sunday's ballot,
which he called smooth and fair.
</P>
<P>
	   While many African countries hold elections, very few are considered truly
free and fair. In West Africa, where votes often take place against the backdrop
of military coups and civil wars, Senegal is one of few countries to hold
regular ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   Results were trickling in Monday from Sunday's vote -- the country's most
contentious in decades -- which pitted President Abdou Diouf against seven
challengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Not enough ballots had been counted to suggest a clear trend, but top
contender Abdoulaye Wade was already warning that one of Africa's most stable
countries would explode in popular revolt if the president retains power.
</P>
<P>
	   Diouf ``is aware if he declares himself winner, there will be clashes in the
country, demonstrations and violence,'' Wade told reporters. ``He will have to
establish an emergency state and call in the army.''
</P>
<P>
	   Scattered attacks by separatist rebels marred voting in the southern
Casamance region, and there was at least one brawl reported Sunday between rival
political supporters in the capital, Dakar.
</P>
<P>
	   If Senegal plunges into violence so soon after the December military
takeover in nearby Ivory Coast -- another traditional bastion of African
stability -- Western diplomats worry it could trigger a flight of development
aid and trade from the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Diouf and Wade claimed to be ahead Monday, though both also conceded
they might not win an outright majority.
</P>
<P>
	   If there is no clear winner, the top two contenders will face off in a
second round -- the first runoff election in Senegal, where the ruling Socialist
Party has held power since independence from France in 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   Khalifa Sall, a Cabinet minister and senior Socialist Party official,
conceded the president had a poor showing in Dakar, but said provisional results
put him in the lead in 19 of the country's 31 regions.
</P>
<P>
	   An official in Wade's camp, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his
candidate was leading in the country's two biggest cities -- Dakar and nearby
Thies -- which account for 40 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no official confirmation of their claims. Official tallies were
released haphazardly to radio stations by village and city block -- sometimes a
few dozen voters at a time.
</P>
<P>
	   The provisional outcome is expected Wednesday, but will have to be confirmed
by the high court next week, Oumarou said.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Personality Poll Held  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush is the hubby of choice in the
presidential race. Rival John McCain is the top pick for dad. If people faced a
big exam and didn't know their stuff, they'd most want to look over Democrat Al
Gore's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   Those are among the findings in a survey by Republican pollster Frank Luntz
that looked beyond the horse race and asked questions such as: Whom would you
want as your companion if stuck at home for a week? (Answer: McCain, picked by
31 percent, followed by Bush at 24 percent).
</P>
<P>
	   The survey was done for YROCK.com, a Web site for young Republicans. Luntz
said it was done using traditional polling methods. As it turned out, only 27
percent of respondents were under 40.
</P>
<P>
	   The questions were anything but traditional. Offered a choice between
walking five miles to get home or hopping a motorcycle ride with one of the
candidates, a majority chose either riding with McCain or walking alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's Democratic rival, Bill Bradley, was not tops in any category --
either for better or worse. But he was statistically tied with McCain as the one
least likely to be audited by the IRS, a risk felt to be greatest for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   All the candidates are married. But, asked to choose, women picked Bush as
the candidate they'd most want to wed, 29 percent to 23.5 percent for Gore.
McCain was favored as the respondents' choice for father, 36 percent to 24
percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   While Gore was chosen as the best one to crib from on a tough exam, he,
McCain and Bush were statistically tied as the candidate who would be the best
adviser, or ``lifeline,'' for a contestant on ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
	   Luntz said he randomly sampled 800 likely voters by telephone on Wednesday
and Thursday, after McCain's wins in the Michigan and Arizona GOP primaries. The
poll had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Euro Claws Back From a New Low  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro briefly plummeted to a new low against the dollar
Monday as traders questioned the ability of the European Central Bank to stop
the currency's slide.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro clawed back somewhat by the end of the trading day in New York, but
dealers said sentiment toward the year-old currency remains poor. With no
interest rate increase in sight for Europe and more rate hikes likely for the
United States, traders said the euro could remain lower against the dollar for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the action Monday occurred in Asian trading, where the euro touched
a new low of 93.90 cents to the dollar, well off its level of 97.42 cents late
Friday in New York, on aggressive selling by investment funds. The previous low
of 96.68 cents was set during trading on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro struggled back to 97.19 cents in late afternoon trading in New
York, partly on indications that Austria's far-right party leader Joerg Haider
would step down. Haider did in fact resign his party post later Monday,
relieving concerns about his possible inclusion in a coalition government in
Austria, one of the 11 countries participating in the common currency.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's safe to say the dollar is king at the moment," said Ricardo Gomes,
head of foreign exchange at HSBC USA. "You have a general lack of confidence in
the ECB, and there are growing pains."
</P>
<P>
	   The euro's drubbing came less than a week after it regained the parity level
with the dollar. Since then, a report Friday of a strong upward revision in the
U.S. economy's fourth-quarter growth dispelled any remaining doubts about the
speed and momentum of the American economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, comments from European financial officials downplaying the likelihood
of any rate increase at this week's meeting of the ECB confirmed market
expectations that the euro was unlikely to get immediate support from monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ECB officials have generally taken a hands-off approach toward the euro and
its level in currency markets, saying the euro would find its own level against
the dollar and the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   But with no central financial authority in Europe equivalent to the U.S.
Treasury, currency traders have questioned how much control Europe can wield
over the euro's trading patterns.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, with the economic outlook improving in Europe, some currency watchers
expect that the euro may not decline much more against the dollar. Last week
France reported 2.7 percent economic growth for 1999, and Germany, the other
mainstay of Europe's economy, has also been showing some signs of recovery
recently.
</P>
<P>
	   The rapid decline in the euro Monday also affected trading in other
currencies, bringing the dollar down against the yen. In late afternoon
dealings, the dollar was quoted at 109.37 Japanese yen, down from 110.47 Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, the dollar also was quoted at 1.6530 Swiss francs, up from
1.6503, and 1.4511 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4492. The British pound rose to
$1.5941 from $1.5939.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Monday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0122 German marks, up from 2.0071; 6.7485
French francs, up from 6.7316; and 1,992.04 Italian lire, up from 1,987.04.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Haider Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Joerg Haider, whose anti-foreigner statements and
past praise of aspects of the Nazi regime brought international condemnation on
Austria's new government, resigned Monday as head of the far-right Freedom
Party, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials said Haider made the announcement at a closed-door meeting of
the group's national leadership at a downtown hotel. The officials, who asked
not to be identified, said a formal announcement would be made at a news
conference later Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, who holds no post in the national government, is to stay on as
governor of Carinthia province. The move was seen as an attempt to reduce
international criticism of the new coalition government between Haider's
rightists and the center-right Austrian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Austria Press Agency quoted party sources as saying Haider will be
succeeded as party chief by his trusted lieutenant, Vice Chancellor Susanne
Riess-Passer, 39.
</P>
<P>
	   APA said Haider told the party leadership meeting that he was stepping down
because he did not want ``to stand in the way'' of the work of the new
government.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14 other European Union members have downgraded relations with Austria
because of the presence of Haider's party in the government which took office
Feb. 4. The outrage was based on Haider's anti-immigrant stand and his past
praise of veterans of the murderous Waffen SS and Adolf Hitler's ``orderly''
employment policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Austrian politicians and commentators doubted that the resignation
signaled the end of Haider's influence on the national government. Riess-Passer
and others in the Freedom Party leadership have long-established reputations as
Haider disciples who owe their political positions to him.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly elected head of the opposition Social Democratic party, Alfred
Gusenbauer, said the resignation was simply ``one of Haider's many tactical
tricks'' and would give the coalition a respite from criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Prinzhorn, the Freedom Party's candidate for chancellor in the Oct. 3
parliamentary election, said Haider's resignation did not signal his withdrawal
from national politics and that the controversial Carinthia governor would
remain the ``top man'' of the party.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said Haider's
decision was the ``first sign of a breath of fresh air'' since Haider's party
finished second in the parliamentary elections, which paved the way for the
party to join the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Hier said the international criticism was pivotal in forcing Haider to step
down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We only hope that his resignation sends a strong message to other members
of the Freedom Party that no one is prepared to accept a party whose platform is
based on xenophobia and bigotry,'' Hier told The Associated Press. ``We hope the
Freedom Party will get the message.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, Peter Sichrovsky, the Freedom Party's EU representative,
said Haider had mentioned stepping down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Already on Saturday, he mentioned it in an internal party discussion,''
Sichrovsky said. ``He has already achieved more than anyone else, and if that is
his decision, then we must respect it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sichrovsky said stepping down as party head would allow Haider to
concentrate more on politics in Carinthia.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the international furor, Haider remains popular with many Austrians
and within the party that he nearly single-handedly built up from a small,
unknown group to the second-largest political force in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has led the Freedom Party since 1986. Since last March, he has also
served as governor of Carinthia province.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's party used widespread concern over the impact of immigration and EU
expansion on Austrian jobs to finish second in the parliamentary election with
52 of the 183 seats in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   The left-leaning Social Democrats finished first, winning 65 seats but too
few to govern on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   At EU ministerial meetings on Monday, Austrian delegates were publicly
shunned. At a defense ministers meeting in Sintra, Portugal, Andre Flahaut, the
Belgian delegate, skipped lunch, telling reporters, ``I don't eat with
fascists,'' in protest against the presence of Austrian Defense Minister Herbert
Scheibner.
</P>
<P>
	   Scheibner belongs to Haider's Freedom Party. So does Karl-Heinz Grasser,
Austria's finance minister, who got a frosty welcome at his first EU gathering
in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   French diplomats said ministers including their own declined to shake hands
with Grasser.
</P>
<P>
	   News photographers, allowed in for the start of the meeting, said no other
ministers spoke to Grasser. French and Belgian officials wore stickers depicting
a ``no-entry'' traffic sign superimposed on a bow-tie -- the trademark of
conservative Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel.

<HEADLINE> China Feels Looming Trade Vote  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China announced Monday that it will buy $6 million worth
of U.S. wheat, its first purchase of American agricultural products under
concessions it made last year in a bid to win improved trade relations.
</P>
<P>
	   It is considered a trial-size shipment, but Clinton administration said it
was evidence of China's intention to follow through with an agreement reached
last November. In exchange for lowering its barriers to U.S. farm products,
China is seeking U.S. backing for its entry into the World Trade Organization
and an end to the annual congressional reviews of its U.S. trade status.
</P>
<P>
	   It will mark the first time China has bought wheat from the Pacific
Northwest in more than two decades. Wheat shipments from that region had been
barred because of China's contention that the grain contained excessive amounts
of fungus.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowing shipments from the Pacific Northwest will save on freight costs and
help U.S. farmers compete with producers in other countries for sales in the
huge Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope that there will be many more such purchases to come," Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said in a speech to the National Farmers Union in Salt
Lake City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress will vote later this year on whether to grant China normal trade
relations on a permanent basis. Farm-state lawmakers who support the move have
said China needs to make some significant purchases of U.S. agricultural
products to signal its willingness to make good on the concessions it made.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to lowering its restrictions on wheat, China also agreed to
reduce tariffs on a host of farm products, including beef, oranges, grapes,
wine, cheese and poultry. The tariff on beef alone would drop from 45 percent to
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Department claims sales of farm products to China could
triple to $3 billion annually under terms of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said the wheat purchase "demonstrates the
potential long-term benefits" of improved trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sale of wheat to China from the Pacific Northwest is a significant
breakthrough for the U.S. wheat industry and we hope it is just the beginning of
a new relationship with this potentially multimillion-ton wheat market," said
Alan Tracy, president of U.S. Wheat Associates, the industry's export arm.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchase includes 30,000 tons of soft white wheat, 10,000 tons of hard
red spring wheat and 10,000 tons of hard red winter wheat.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman said U.S. farmers risk losing sales to Europe, Canada, Australia
and Argentina if Congress does not approve the China trade deal.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall As Dow Industrials Soar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds fell Monday amid a big run-up in the Dow industrials,
as traders sought to lock in gains from last week's rally in bond prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/16 point, or $6.87 1/2 per
$1,000 in face value. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price,
rose to 6.19 percent from 6.14 percent late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonds had gained in recent days due to increased volatility in stocks as the
Dow Jones industrial average last week sank below 10,000 for the first time in
more than 10 months. Because of their security, liquidity and promise of a fixed
annual return, government bonds are a traditional haven for funds in times of
financial market unrest.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the Dow up 176.53 to 10,038.65 on Monday, traders were shifting
money out of bonds back to stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the bond market, prices of short-term Treasury securities fell
3/16 point to 9/32 point and intermediate maturities fell 7/16 point to 21/32
point, according to Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.83 percent, with the discount up
0.06 percentage point from Friday to 5.66 percent. Six-month yields were 6.03
percent as the discount was up 0.06 percentage point to 5.77 percent. One-year
yields were 6.19 percent, with the discount rising 0.05 percentage point to 5.85
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.75 from 5.68 3/4 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds was fell 1/32 to 92 21/32. The yield
to maturity of the index was 6.18 percent, up from 6.17 percent on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Rights Panel Urges US on Kosovars  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of a U.S. government human rights commission
urged President Clinton on Monday to put more pressure on Yugoslavia to release
ethnic Albanians still held prisoner in Serbia while not tolerating retaliation
against Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   But an administration official said Europeans could do more to achieve
prisoner releases than the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
	   Reflecting growing frustration with NATO's inability to resolve the Balkans
crisis, the U.S. Helsinki Commission, at a hearing on Capitol Hill, faced a
variety of pleas of justice for Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, Serbs and Gypsies,
also known as Roma.
</P>
<P>
	   John K. Menzies, deputy special adviser to the president and the secretary
of state for Kosovo, told the commission that peace is gradually taking hold in
the U.N.-protected Serb province, but he said resolution of the problem of
displaced and imprisoned Kosovars is needed for violence to end.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are beginning to see results,'' Menzies told the commission, citing
progress in power generation, banking, mining and housing construction.
</P>
<P>
	   But he added: ``The continued detention of Albanians in Serbia remains a
tragic and acutely vexing issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the lack of diplomatic relations with Belgrade makes it difficult
for the United States to directly pressure Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The truth is that European nations are in a better position than the U.S.
to take the lead on this,'' Menzies said, noting that Italy, Canada and Japan
all have representatives in Belgrade. He said the Finnish and private
non-government groups have conducted some negotiations for prisoners' release.
</P>
<P>
	   Menzies cited estimates of up to 5,000 ethnic Albanians held in
Belgrade-controlled prisons. Most of the few hundred who have been released, he
said, have had relatives buy their freedom with ransoms paid to corrupt
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The Helsinki Commission, made up of senators, House members and
representatives of the Clinton administration, issued no declaration at its
hearing. But individual members urged Clinton to take a stronger interest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people who languish in Serbian prisons are not the cause of ethnic
tensions; the war criminals who took them as they fled Kosovo are,'' said Rep.
Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., agreed that the United States should press for the
prisoners' release but also said he did not vote for the NATO bombing so the
ethnic Albanians, who had been driven out of their homes, could ``do the same
thing to the Serb population.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.M., chairman of the hearing, said ethnic Albanians,
Serbs and Roma all are suffering.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many Kosovar Albanians languish in Serbian prisons, seemingly for no
reason other than the Milosevic regime's well documented desire to inflict pain
on as many innocent people as possible,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., committee co-chairman, said in a
statement that continued deployment of Western forces in Kosovo does little to
stop human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People need to get out of the refugee camps and prisons and get back to
their homes as soon as possible,'' Campbell said.

<HEADLINE> Fringe Group, Nation of Islam Ally  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A day after Louis Farrakhan called for reconciliation among
American Muslims, the Nation of Islam drove a further wedge between itself and
mainstream Jews by aligning itself with a fringe Jewish group that opposes the
state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Nation of Islam leaders held a news conference Monday with leaders of the
Neturei Karta International, a tiny Orthodox Jewish group that says the
Holocaust was punishment for Zionist Jews who called for the establishment of an
Israeli state.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, a leader of the group, also made brief remarks
Sunday to the crowd of 20,000 who came to hear Farrakhan's annual Saviours' Day
speech.
</P>
<P>
	   At the speech, Farrakhan reaffirmed his pledge to reconcile his breakaway
movement with orthodox U.S. Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan -- criticized for previously calling Judaism a ``gutter
religion,'' among other things -- said little about the religion during the
speech. But in his remarks, Weiss offered an apology ``for the chutzpah, the
nerve of the Zionist leaders ... who attack the honorable Minister Farrakhan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Weiss reiterated the remark on Monday and said that most people who claim to
be Jews are not Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's Zionism, not Judaism,'' said Weiss, who first met with Farrakhan in
Chicago in November. ``They are something which is an abomination to God. It is
a heresy to God.''
</P>
<P>
	   Neturei Karta considers Israel a heresy because it believes a Jewish state
can arise only with the arrival of the Messiah. The movement is made up of
several dozen orthodox Jewish clans in Israel as well as backers in the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan did not attend Monday's news conference. But his chief of staff,
Leonard Muhammad, said he was grateful that the Neturei Karta sought out the
Nation of Islam last year. ``We would hope other Jews might choose to do the
same thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But many Jewish leaders and groups said they considered the Nation of
Islam's affiliation with the Neturei Karta a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbi Ira Youdovin, executive director of the Chicago Board of Rabbis,
marveled at Farrakhan's decision to invite a group that he said is ``about as
far off the screen in Jewish life as they can possibly be.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He hasn't mended any fences with 99.99 percent of the Jewish community,''
Youdovin said of Farrakhan. ``But it looks good on television, doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
	   Harlan Loeb, Midwest civil rights director for the Anti-Defamation League,
called the Neturei Karta ``a profound embarrassment on the mosaic of the Jewish
community.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also called Farrakhan insincere.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What good is it for Farrakhan to say, 'We're aligned with Jews, but the
Jews we're aligned with are those who share our disdain for Zionism?''' Loeb
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Jewish leaders, including Youdovin, said it would be up to the Nation
of Islam to make the first move -- namely by repudiating past comments. If that
happened, Youdovin said he would still be willing to work with the Nation of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I might lose my job for saying so,'' Youdovin said. ``But the Nation of
Islam does a lot of good work in the black community, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a frustration not being able to participate with them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Youdovin said he also hoped that leaders in the orthodox Muslim community
whom Farrakhan has been wooing -- namely W. Deen Mohammed -- might help bring
the Nation of Islam and Jewish leaders together.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammed, head of the black orthodox Muslim American Society and the son of
late Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad, made short remarks at Sunday's
speech but did not address the Neturei Karta's stance. He also did not return a
message left Monday.

<HEADLINE> 9th Century Koran Returned to Turkey  </HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN MANNING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Johns Hopkins University on Monday returned a section of a
rare ninth century Koran to Turkey, which will reunite it with the rest of the
holy book at an Istanbul museum.
</P>
<P>
	   The first 18 chapters of the Gold Koran disappeared from Turkey sometime
after 1756. The section entered the Hopkins collection in 1942 as part of a
bequest of rare books. In 1998 it was appraised at between $1.9 million and $2.9
million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am pleased that this Koran will now be restored to its original home and
reclaim its place as an important part of the Turkish national heritage,'' M.
Istemihan Talay, minister of culture for Turkey, said during a ceremony at the
Turkish Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gold Koran is believed to have been created in either north Africa or an
area that is part of modern-day Iraq. It is written in the early Arabic script
Kufa, with lettering made of gold leaf.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the only intact example of the practice of copying the Koran into
gold,'' said Marianna Shreve Simpson, director of curatorial affairs for the
Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   The half that wound up at Hopkins was last recorded in Turkey during an
inventory conducted in 1756. Hopkins found out in 1993 that its section was part
of a larger work but had no evidence it was improperly removed from Turkey, said
James G. Neal, the university's dean of libraries.
</P>
<P>
	   The Turkish Embassy asked Hopkins to return the rare document after it was
displayed at the Walters Art Gallery in 1997. School officials decided to do so
because its origin was unclear.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of an agreement signed Monday, Turkey acknowledged that Hopkins did
not act improperly in obtaining the Gold Koran.
</P>
<P>
	   The section will be housed with the rest of the work in the Nuruosmaniye
Library.

<HEADLINE> Ex-La. Gov.'s Trial Continues  </HEADLINE>
   By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A half-dozen contractors and laborers who worked at
residences of former Gov. Edwin Edwards or his family testified Monday that they
were paid in stacks of $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors allege Edwards, his son Stephen and five other men
manipulated and profited from the awarding of riverboat casino licenses before
and after Edwards left office in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors focused Monday on evidence that appears to suggest Edwards
always had plenty of cash and spent more money than he legitimately made in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the trial began Jan. 10, one former casino owner and a former casino
consultant have testified they made large cash payments in return for Edwards'
help in getting licenses or fending off competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Landscaper Eduardo Jenkins said Monday he was paid $152,000 for installing a
swimming pool and other work at Edwin Edwards' home in 1995. About $80,000 was
paid in banded bundles of $100 bills, including a $50,000 down payment he picked
up at the Governor's Mansion, Jenkins testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Contractor Phillip Haddad testified he was paid with a $218,000 check and
$60,000 in cash when he sold a house to Edwards' son David in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Jarrod Clayborne, owner of an interior design store, said he received
$131,000 in cash from Edwards between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards' attorney, Dan Small, raised the possibility Edwards won the cash at
casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   Small asked carpenter David Kleinpeter, who had testified he was paid $800
in cash before Edwards tore up the invoice, whether $100 bills are a common form
of payment from casinos. ``I would imagine,'' Kleinpeter said, adding, ``I have
personal knowledge of $5 and $10, but not $100.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards, who served four terms as Louisiana governor, could face 350 years
in prison and $7.2 million in fines if convicted on the racketeering charges.
Stephen Edwards could get 305 years.

<P>
	   As an alternative, a percentage of Columbia shareholders can choose to
receive $74 a share in the new holding company's stock if NiSource's stock is
trading at more than $16.50 in the 30 days before the merger's closing, the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
	   Herndon-based Columbia, which has $7 billion in assets and is involved in
virtually all phases of the natural gas and propane businesses, rejected a $6.1
billion, $74 a share bid in October to look for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
	   But no better offers emerged from the dozen parties Columbia spoke with, and
utility stock prices fell in the succeeding months.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Columbia rose $2.31 1/4 to $59.37 1/2 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange, off their 52-week high of $66.31 1/4. Shares of
NiSource fell $2.56 1/4 to $13, closing at a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Heim, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, Inc., declined to
second-guess Columbia's decision to reject the $74-a-share offer. But falling
utility stocks suddenly made the deal more attractive, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "But you do have to say, if they had taken the $74 last fall, they could
have saved a lot of headaches," Heim said.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal will benefit NiSource because some Midwestern markets such as
Chicago have a surplus of natural gas, and Columbia's pipe system will allow
NiSource to move that supply into markets in the East where it is needed, Heim
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Columbia officials said NiSource does not intend any significant layoffs,
but that it was too early to say what the merger would mean to Columbia
employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The kind words of both companies' executives contrasted sharply with the
bitter takeover fight of last year, when NiSource officials questioned whether
Columbia's board was looking out for the best interest of its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   Columbia, in turn, said NiSource had a woeful environmental record and was
in too poor a financial shape to buy anyone.

<HEADLINE> Complaint Filed Vs. GM Arbitration  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Michigan's attorney general has threatened to sue General
Motors Corp., saying the automaker's employee discount program for new vehicles
illegally limits how far warranty claims can be pursued.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Jennifer Granholm filed a complaint Monday saying GM's
program illegally forces warranty claims to be decided in binding, out-of-court
arbitration and limits the damages that can be awarded.
</P>
<P>
	   She said if claims are filed in court, the vehicle owner could face legal
action or, if they are a GM employee, even be fired. The automaker has 10 days
to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   But GM said its program was legal, and that no employee would be fired for
filing claims outside arbitration. It also said no warranty cases had been
brought under arbitration since March 1, 1999, when it became mandatory.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do not force our employees to choose this program," said GM attorney
Steve Cernak. "They get a substantial discount, and as part of that program,
they agree to resolve warranty claims in this way."
</P>
<P>
	   Discount programs are one of the most beloved perks for U.S. automakers'
employees and their immediate families, often knocking thousands of dollars off
the price of a new car or truck.
</P>
<P>
	   GM imposed mandatory arbitration on its program in 1999, Cernak said, to
resolve warranty claims more quickly and cheaply for both sides. He said no
cases have been brought because such claims are settled before they reach that
stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Cernak said DaimlerChrysler AG had a similar clause in its programs. A
Chrysler spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.

<HEADLINE> Cops in Diallo Case Face Review  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA DE LA CRUZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The four police officers cleared of murdering Amadou Diallo
still face a departmental review that could keep them from ever returning to the
streets.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, who were acquitted on Friday, are all ``decompressing'' and
have not yet decided whether they will seek to return to full duty, their
lawyers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers -- Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard
Murphy -- remain on modified duty, meaning they are assigned to desk jobs and
their badges and guns have been taken away.
</P>
<P>
	   They face possible federal civil rights charges as well as a departmental
review by a board that is looking at such issues as whether the officers
properly identified themselves, stopped Diallo properly and fired only when they
thought force was necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   It could be months before Police Commissioner Howard Safir considers
restoring the officers to full duty or pursuing disciplinary action that could
include dismissal.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers fired 41 bullets at Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building, mistakenly thinking the wallet he was holding was a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, Carroll is ``reflecting and he is trying to decompress,'' said John
Patten, his attorney. ``I just told him chill out, stay calm, be at peace. He
needs to make his thought process become a little clearer first.''
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the three other officers said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He really wants his 15 minutes to be up and he wants to fade back and live
his life,'' said Boss' attorney, Steven Brounstein.
</P>
<P>
	   If they do return to duty, will they be able to do their jobs and would they
be safe on New York City streets? So far, the NYPD thinks it's worth posting
police outside the officers' homes because they've received threats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They may really want to go back to police work and now that they've been
acquitted, feel they have a right to do so,'' said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal
justice professor at the University of South Carolina. ``But rightfully or
wrongfully, they've killed someone. They should go through some serious
psychological testing to see if they're fit for duty.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court upholds 'three strikes' law for violent criminals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Turning back a plea from a robber who claimed he is
being treated like a murderer, the state Supreme Court on Monday upheld a New
Jersey law mandating life sentences for those convicted three times of serious,
violent crimes.
<P>
	   The court, in a 5-0 ruling, said the "Three-Strikes" law, enacted in 1995,
is constitutional. The court also upheld the sentence of Gregory "Red" Oliver,
46, of Paterson, making him the first criminal to receive a life sentence under
the "Three-Strikes" law.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling affects other sentences under the statute. The state attorney
general's office says at least five other three-time offenders have been
sentenced to life in prison, under the law. Another 10 who were convicted of
three lesser offenses were given extended sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Jersey's Three-Strikes Law is consistent with contemporary standards of
decency," Justice Daniel J. O'Hern wrote in the decision, noting that at least
two dozen other jurisdictions have similar laws.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision also says lawmakers were careful to make sure the law was fair.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Jersey has more finely tuned its law by limiting the number and types
of violent offenses that fall within the purview ...," the decision reads.
"Thus, one cannot be sentenced to life in prison under New Jersey's
Three-Strikes Law for passing a bad check or stealing a loaf of bread."
</P>
<P>
	   The law requires that judges hand down life sentence after the third
conviction on serious, violent crimes considered first-degree offenses,
including murder, aggravated manslaughter, kidnapping, rape, carjacking and
first-degree robbery. Those convicted cannot be eligible for parole unless they
are at least 70 years old and have served at least 35 years. The law also
increases mandatory time for those convicted three times of second-degree
crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliver had argued that the law treats robbers the same as murderers. He was
convicted of armed robbery three times dating back to 1979. The final conviction
was for a December 1995 robbery of Leon "Baldy" Johnson. Oliver was convicted of
robbing Johnson of drugs and money and fracturing his skull with a lead pipe in
a Paterson crack den.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert L. Sloan, a public defender representing Oliver, said a life sentence
for three robbery convictions is "disproportionate, especially in comparison to
a murder sentence."
</P>
<P>
	   "My main argument was that the life sentence, without parole, was so
disproportionate to the offense that it amounted to cruel and unusual
punishment," said Sloan. "You're putting this on par with other offenses that
are far more severe. I can only assume the court felt that setting sentences for
crimes was a legislative judgment."
</P>
<P>
	   The court also turned back Sloan's argument that one of Oliver's robbery
convictions should not have been counted under the "Three-Strikes" category.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Justice Deborah Poritz and Justice Peter Verniero did not participate
in the ruling. Poritz was state attorney general while the "Three Strikes" law
was being drafted and for a year after it was signed into law. Verniero replaced
Poritz as attorney general while it was being implemented.

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers To Vote on Pork Ads  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hog farmers will get a chance to vote on whether to keep
paying the fees that fund the "other white wheat" advertising campaign for pork,
the government announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said he had the legal authority to call
the referendum even though his department didn't validate sufficient signatures
on petitions that were submitted by farmers who oppose paying the fees, or
"checkoffs."
</P>
<P>
	   There has not been a referendum on the pork program since it was created 14
years ago. Opponents of the $48 million program, which pays for research as well
as advertising, say it has done little to stimulate pork consumption and mostly
benefits meat processors and large, corporate farm operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a matter of basic fairness, I believe that producers deserve the
opportunity to vote on this checkoff program," Glickman said in a speech to the
National Farmers Union in Salt Lake City, Utah. "It is, after all, a mandatory
assessment, akin to a tax, that all producers must pay even if they disagree
with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman was immediately criticized by the National Pork Producers Council,
which receives funding from the fee and questions his authority to order a
referendum on his own.
</P>
<P>
	   The referendum hurts "bonafide pork producers who created a program that
truly works to benefit pork producers of all types and sizes," said John McNutt,
president of the council and an Iowa farmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Under government rules, Glickman would have been required to call a
referendum if the petitions submitted to the Agriculture Department last year
contained at least 14,986 signatures, or 15 percent of all producers. USDA
officials used a sampling process to validate the petitions but couldn't verify
a sufficient number of names.
</P>
<P>
	   The fee is pay 45 cents for every $100 of a pig's value when it is sold. The
money goes to the quasigovernmental National Pork Board, which contracts
promotional services through the National Pork Producers Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the program say they get little for the fees. Pork consumption
has been relatively flat despite the advertising, rising from 51.5 pounds per
person in 1985 to 53.4 pounds last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is all about the democratic process ... and the right of hog farmers
and other producers to vote on whether the checkoff programs are working for
them," said Rhonda Perry, a Missouri hog producer who opposes the pork program.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA also is being petitioned to a hold a referendum on the beef promotion
program. The disputes over the two promotion programs reflect a growing division
in U.S. agriculture between the interests of large and small-scale producers.

<HEADLINE> HMO Reform Bill Debate To Begin  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Americans and presidential candidates staunchly
favoring patients' rights, lawmakers are pressing to craft compromise HMO
protections without alienating politically powerful businesses. Key work begins
this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Insurers and corporations are waging a pitched battle against the proposed
legislation, arguing that giving Americans the right to sue over denial of care
will raise premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   They've even conducted their own polls suggesting many workers would lose
coverage because companies, fearing lawsuits, would stop offering health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers who must reconcile two versions of the legislation -- one passed
by the House that allows lawsuits and another approved by the Senate that does
not -- are caught in the crossfire of a well-heeled business lobby and the
dynamics of presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Republicans, particularly in the Senate, oppose giving patients the
right to sue.
</P>
<P>
	   But their task became more complicated when the party's presidential
frontrunner, George W. Bush, began running ads boasting he ``delivered a
patient's bill of rights'' in Texas ``while Washington politicians deadlocked.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Bush didn't even approve his state law -- it became law without his
signature.
</P>
<P>
	   But both he and his main rival, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have declared
their support for federal legislation that permits lawsuits. And that has upped
the ante for the party's congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We get the Texas model thrown up at us all the time,'' said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., a member of a House-Senate conference committee that meets
Thursday to begin hammering out a compromise. ``It puts added pressure on
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas law, among the strongest patient protection measures in the
country, allows patients to sue their HMO for delaying or denying care if those
decisions harmed patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders concede a compromise will have to include some provision
for lawsuits, but the question remains how far GOP senators will go.
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchinson predicted any GOP-backed right-to-sue provision would come with
lots of restrictions.
</P>
<P>
	   One possibility, similar to a Republican House bill rejected last fall,
would:
</P>
<P>
	   --allow lawsuits only after patients go through appeal panels;
</P>
<P>
	   --cap the size of damage awards;
</P>
<P>
	   --cover only the 48 million Americans whose health plans are exempt from
state regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference committee has set a tight deadline of March 31 to finish a
compromise bill.
</P>
<P>
	   If pressure from Republican presidential hopefuls isn't enough, Americans
are widely in favor of new measures against health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public
Health showed 72 percent of voters favored patient protections. That support
dropped to 53 percent, however, if protections drove up premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have aligned themselves with the House version of the legislation,
which drew bipartisan support, and are heaping criticism on the efforts to
prevent lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The House has passed strong, effective bipartisan legislation. The Senate
has passed a weak bill that only an insurance company could love,'' said Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has made it clear he wants a bill that would allow
patients to sue health providers. The White House also has voiced concerns about
the House version of the legislation because it includes proposals to expand
medical savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Those accounts let people set aside money, tax free, to pay routine medical
bills and the premium for a high-deductible insurance. Companies with fewer than
50 workers can offer them under a pilot test set up by Congress in 1997.
Republicans want to expand that to more Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think it's premature to be expanding in this area'' said Chris
Jennings, Clinton's chief health policy advisor.
</P>
<P>
	   Both parties face pressures from their traditional campaign donors. Trial
lawyers, which overwhelming favor Democrats, staunchly support the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
	   And business groups are warning that if Republicans give even limited rights
to sue, they'll end up in hot water with one of their biggest sources of
financial support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With the control of Congress being such a thin margin, there's little room
for error,'' said Neil Trautwein, director of employment policy at the National
Association of Manufacturers. ``They can't save the store by decimating the
employer-based health care system.''
</P>
<P>
	   A third of companies in an insurance-industry sponsored survey said they
would stop offering health plans to all or some of their workers if the House
bill passed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House bill would increase
premiums for employer-sponsored plans by an average of 4.1 percent, while the
Senate version would result in a 1.3 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchinson said some lawmakers weren't buying the argument that companies
will cut off workers' health benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most members think that's a scare tactic,'' Hutchinson told a group of NAM
members last week.

<HEADLINE> $16M Pharmacy Mistake Verdict Upheld  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The state Court of Appeals on Monday upheld a judgment
that Rite Aid Corp. and a pharmacist must pay $16 million to a girl who was
given the wrong medicine and suffered permanent brain damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabrielle Hundley was given a large dose of the diabetes medicine Glynase in
1995 instead of a small dose of Ritalin, a drug used to control hyperactivity.
Both pills were yellow.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabrielle, who was 8 at the time, suffered a seizure following her second
dose of the wrong pills. Her IQ dropped 30 points. She still cannot take care of
personal hygiene or fully dress herself.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-judge appeals panel rejected all the appeal claims by Rite Aid and
pharmacist Parham Howard Jones, who was wrapping up a 12-hour shift and a
60-hour work week when the mistake was made.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pa., has called the verdict unfair. Attorneys
for the company and Jones did not return messages seeking comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Gabrielle's family won the $16 million jury award in 1996, it has
grown to nearly $23 million with interest, said Jim Anders, the family lawyer.

<HEADLINE> McCain Strategy Fraught With Risks  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain derided Pat Robertson and other evangelical
``agents of intolerance'' Monday in a high-stakes bid to stretch the Republican
coalition beyond the religious conservative base that has swayed GOP politics
for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are the party of Ronald Reagan, not Pat Robertson,'' the Arizona
senator said Monday in Virginia Beach, home of Robertson's Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a Reagan Republican who will defeat Al Gore,'' he said. Rival George
W. Bush ``is a Pat Robertson Republican who will lose to Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's advisers likened his visit to the lion's den to a 1992 address by
Bill Clinton, who criticized a black rap artist while sharing the stage with the
Rev. Jesse Jackson -- dramatizing the Arkansas governor's pledge to rip the
Democratic Party from the clutches of its most liberal elements.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's address marked a sharpening of his strategy to ``build a bigger
Republican Party'' by courting independents, Democrats and moderate Republicans
who normally don't participate in the political process. Not ceding the
evangelical vote, McCain was trying to reach beyond the leadership to social
conservatives by saying the rank-and-file should not fear ``new faces and fresh
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   Religious conservatives are an active component of the Republican coalition
that controls Congress, an electrified ``third rail'' of GOP politics rarely
crossed by candidates seeking a party nomination or needing help in a general
election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The social conservatives are an important part of the Republican coalition
and they need to be part of a winning coalition to beat Al Gore,'' said GOP
strategist Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls showed that 17 percent of the general election voters in 1996
identified themselves as Christian conservatives. An overwhelming number of them
backed Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   In Virginia, where McCain faces Bush in an important Tuesday primary, 21
percent of all voters in the 1996 general election called themselves Christian
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   And one-fourth of California Republicans who voted in the state's 1996
primary were religious conservatives. They could play a critical role in the
state's March 7 primary, which McCain believes he must win to keep his candidacy
alive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything in politics has its downside,'' McCain campaign manager Rick
Davis said. A risk for McCain, he said, would be for his comments ``to be
characterized inappropriately as going on some anti-Republican, anti-religious
right crusade.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Bush replied to the speech by accusing McCain of ``playing the
religious card.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ronald Reagan didn't point fingers. He never played to people's religious
fears like Senator McCain has shamelessly done,'' the Texas governor said during
a news conference in Bellevue, Wash. Republicans in Virginia, Washington State
and North Dakota are voting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech conceived over the weekend and written by longtime aide Mark
Salter, McCain tried not to alienate religious conservative voters. Gary Bauer,
a religious activist who dropped out of the presidential race and now supports
McCain, suggested that the Arizonan should praise prominent religious
conservatives Charles Colson and James Dobson; McCain took his advice.
</P>
<P>
	   But he singled out Robertson and Jerry Falwell for criticism, accusing the
``self-appointed leaders'' of attacking him because ``I don't pander to them.''
Robertson, he said, is no different from ``union bosses'' with a ``desire to
preserve their own political power at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, whose centerpiece issue is political reform, called himself a
Republican of ``principles -- not special interest money or empire or ego.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the risks, McCain and his advisers believe the criticism of
Robertson could help him court Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans
in northern Virginia to tip the scales the state's primary. It also could help
in independent-minded Washington, McCain supporters believe.
</P>
<P>
	   They were handing out fliers at northern Virginia subway stops Monday
encouraging riders to vote in Tuesday's GOP primary ``regardless of party
affiliation.''
</P>
<P>
	   California conservatives are more moderate than in the South, and respond to
allegations of religious intolerance, McCain advisers suggested. For that
reason, the speech dovetails with his criticism of Bush for visiting a
university in South Carolina that has espoused anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
	   Linking Bush to Robertson and the religious right may strike a chord in New
York, Ohio and New England, where large Catholic populations can influence March
7 voting. And if McCain survives that 13-state showdown, his political team is
betting that Bush has hurt himself in battleground states holding late primaries
such as Illinois, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain is attempting to make this a referendum on Pat Robertson instead of
George Bush, and I'm sure Robertson's (poll) numbers are not as good as
Bush's,'' said New York GOP strategist Kieran Mahoney. He works for New York
Gov. George Pataki, a Bush backer, but is not aligned with a presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed said the time may be ripe for McCain's gambit. ``I think the
(evangelical) leadership has been hanging around a couple cycles too long,'' he
said. ``That's what this is all about.''

<HEADLINE> Judge says hospital can offer medicine to subway pusher Goldstein  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge Monday gave hospital officials
permission to offer antipsychotic medicine to Andrew Goldstein, the former
mental patient who pushed a woman to her death beneath a subway train.
<P>
	   State Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman, who let Goldstein stop taking his
medicine earlier this month, modified her order after he punched a psychiatric
social worker during interviews twice in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The social worker, Hillel Bodek, was preparing a report for Goldstein's
second murder trial for pushing Kendra Webdale, 32, in front of an oncoming
subway train last year. Bodek was not injured by the punches.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 10, Berkman granted a defense motion to stop Goldstein's medication.
His lawyers said they wanted him to be unmedicated when doctors examine him and
when the jury sees him for his second murder trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldstein stopped taking the medicine the next day. Berkman's latest order
differs from the earlier one in that doctors now are allowed to offer the
medication to Goldstein, but he can refuse to take it if he wants to.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldstein, 30, is a schizophrenic who has been in and out of mental
hospitals for the past 12 years. He says he was having a psychotic episode when
he pushed Webdale to her death under an N train in the subway station at 23rd
Street and Broadway on Jan. 3, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite agreement that Goldstein is mentally ill, Berkman found him fit to
stand trial last fall for the murder of Webdale, from Fredonia, N.Y., a town
near Buffalo. In that trial the jury deadlocked 10-2 for conviction. Jury
selection for his retrial began last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Berkman said that since her first order to stop medicating Goldstein, he
"has requested medication on several occasions." But the medicine was withheld
until he could discuss the matter with his lawyer, Kevin Canfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Berkman said the defense request to stop medication appears to be a
litigation tactic. But she said she "recognizes that the defendant has a right
to have the jury see him in his unmedicated state if possible."
</P>
<P>
	   Canfield said he understood it would be four to six weeks before Goldstein
started deteriorating but it seems to have happened in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Berkman said Bodek's report said Goldstein's mental condition has
deteriorated but that the condition is not such that he should be medicated by
force because he is a danger to himself or others, nor has it reached a point
that a new competency examination is warranted.
</P>
<P>
	   Canfield said he is concerned that the judge's modified order will result in
staff at Bellevue Hospital Center, where Goldstein is being kept, trying to
convince him to take the psychoactive medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Canfield also complained to the judge that Bodek, whom Goldstein apparently
sees as a friend, was trying to convince the defendant to resume his
antipsychotic medication.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldstein wants to testify, said Canfield, but he will be unable to do so if
he is "doped up. The drugged Goldstein is there but that's not the real
Goldstein."
</P>
<P>
	   Canfield said he asked to have Goldstein's testimony taken now on videotape
in his undrugged state. The defendant then could take his medicine and avoid
problems related to his mental illness during the trial.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Heeds Gore on Baby's Care  </HEADLINE>
   By PEGGY ANDERSEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Aetna U.S. Healthcare has decided to continue skilled
nursing care for a baby whose case caught Vice President Al Gore's attention,
the company's chief medical officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Evaluation of Ian Malone's case was speeded up due to Gore's interest, Dr.
Arthur Leibowitz said in a telephone interview from Aetna offices in Blue Bell,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't make it a habit of routinely conducting these high-level reviews
on Sunday,'' Leibowitz conceded.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said the same decision would have been made even if the case had not
become an issue in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   During a visit Sunday, Gore -- who made the family a symbol of his call for
stronger appeal rights for those refused coverage by HMOs -- met privately with
Ian's parents, Christine and Dylan Malone, and promised to call Aetna on their
behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Dylan, a newspaper graphic artist who was a volunteer for Gore's 1988
presidential campaign, did not immediately return a call for comment Monday from
The Associated Press. Gore campaign officials also did not return a telephone
call.
</P>
<P>
	   But Christine Malone told The Seattle Times that Aetna ``cracked under
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think he saved Ian's life,'' she said of Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The baby, now about 5 months old, has brain damage caused by a difficult
birth, his parents say. He suffers seizures, can't swallow and is prone to
choking.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12-hour-a-day, in-home nursing care costs about $300 a day, the Malones
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leibowitz said a reviewer recommended in January that the in-home care be
terminated next month and that the family care for Ian full time.
</P>
<P>
	   But after reviewing the case, Leibowitz said that he and Aetna's senior
medical director decided on Sunday to overrule the reviewer.

<HEADLINE> La. Laws Voiding Gun Suit Scrapped  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN SAYRE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Gun manufacturers and sellers suffered a setback Monday
when a judge threw out state laws designed to keep the city from suing the
firearms industry for damages caused by their weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Laws passed by the Legislature last year intended to shield the gun industry
from lawsuits were declared unconstitutional by Civil District Judge Lloyd
Medley. One law changed the state's products liability law, while the other
barred cities from filing such lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   The laws, which were strongly backed by Gov. Mike Foster and the National
Rifle Association, were passed after New Orleans became the first city to file
such a lawsuit in October 1998, claiming gun makers should be held responsible
for making a product without adequate safety devices.
</P>
<P>
	   About 30 other cities and county governments have followed with similar
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   M. David Gelfand, an attorney for the city, said he was pleased by the
decision and said the case has implications far beyond the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any other favored group could come along and, with a majority of
legislators, stop a suit in midstream because it has more popularity than the
plaintiff in a suit,'' Gelfand said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Steve Scalise, a Republican who sponsored the legislation, said the
decision would be appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm disappointed, but not surprised,'' Scalise said. ``But I think the
Supreme Court will uphold the will of the Legislature and the Second
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the cities' suits have had mixed success in courts. Judges dismissed
state court suits filed by Bridgeport, Conn., and Cincinnati, but other judges
have allowed suits filed by Atlanta and Chicago to proceed and ordered the gun
industry to open its files.
</P>
<P>
	   Gun backers also have fought back in court. Twenty-three city leaders,
including New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial, were accused in a lawsuit filed in
December of conspiring to take away the rights of Americans to own firearms and
defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit, filed by Second Amendment Foundation, alleges the mayors intended
to bankrupt federally licensed gun manufacturers and dealers by forcing them to
pay to defend themselves in court.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Accepts $6B NiSource Bid  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL TOLME AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Columbia Energy Group accepted a $6 billion
takeover offer from NiSource Inc. on Monday in a deal that would create the
largest gas company east of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company would have 4.1 million gas, electric, water and propane
customers from the Midwest to New England.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger, if approved by shareholders and regulators, comes four months
after Columbia rejected a slightly higher offer from NiSource, which attempted a
hostile takeover. The agreement is worth $70 a share in cash to Columbia
shareholders, plus a security worth $2.60 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   NiSource, based in Merrillville, Ind., will also assume $2.5 billion of
Columbia's long-term debt.
</P>
<P>
	   As an alternative, a percentage of Columbia shareholders can choose to
receive $74 a share in the new holding company's stock if NiSource's stock is
trading at more than $16.50 in the 30 days before the merger's closing, the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
	   Herndon-based Columbia, which has $7 billion in assets and is involved in
virtually all phases of the natural gas and propane businesses, rejected a $6.1
billion, $74 a share bid in October to look for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
	   But no better offers emerged from the dozen parties Columbia spoke with, and
utility stock prices fell in the succeeding months.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Columbia rose $2.31 1/4 to $59.37 1/2 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange, off their 52-week high of $66.31 1/4. Shares of
NiSource fell $2.56 1/4 to $13, closing at a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Heim, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, Inc., declined to
second-guess Columbia's decision to reject the $74-a-share offer. But falling
utility stocks suddenly made the deal more attractive, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "But you do have to say, if they had taken the $74 last fall, they could
have saved a lot of headaches," Heim said.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal will benefit NiSource because some Midwestern markets such as
Chicago have a surplus of natural gas, and Columbia's pipe system will allow
NiSource to move that supply into markets in the East where it is needed, Heim
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Columbia officials said NiSource does not intend any significant layoffs,
but that it was too early to say what the merger would mean to Columbia
employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The kind words of both companies' executives contrasted sharply with the
bitter takeover fight of last year, when NiSource officials questioned whether
Columbia's board was looking out for the best interest of its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   Columbia, in turn, said NiSource had a woeful environmental record and was
in too poor a financial shape to buy anyone.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Upholds 'Three Strikes' Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court on Monday unanimously upheld
New Jersey's three-strikes law, which mandates life sentences for those
convicted three times of certain violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling stems from an appeal by Gregory ``Red'' Oliver, 46, who claims
the 1995 law is unconstitutional because it treats robbers the same as
murderers. Oliver was sentenced in 1996 to life in prison after his third armed
robbery conviction, in which he fractured a man's skull with a lead pipe.
</P>
<P>
	   Murder, aggravated manslaughter, kidnapping and rape are among the offenses
included under the law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My main argument was that the life sentence, without parole, was so
disproportionate to the offense that it amounted to cruel and unusual
punishment,'' said Oliver's attorney, Robert L. Sloan.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 5-0 ruling, the court said that the law was fair and ``consistent
with contemporary standards of decency.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sloan said a decision has not yet been made on whether to appeal.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush Trade Barbs  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Accused of dividing his party and helping the
Democrats, John McCain said Monday he was instead trying to expand the GOP to
become ``a party as big as the country we serve.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican presidential rival George W. Bush strongly disagreed, saying of
McCain, ``He is a person who obviously wants to divide people into camps.''
</P>
<P>
	   The comments followed McCain's speech here -- in the headquarters city of
Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition -- accusing some in his party of pandering
to Christian right leaders ``on the outer reaches of American politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The biting remarks were designed to appeal to moderates voting in Virginia,
Washington state and North Dakota on Tuesday, as well as in crucial contests
next week on ``Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, campaigning in Washington, said repeatedly that his rival was trying
to divide the party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain is someone who likes to castigate, not someone who likes to
lead,'' Bush said. ``It's important to unite our party and lead it to victory.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporter Dick Armey, the Republican leader in the House, took a
similar slap at McCain: ``His was not the speech of a coalition-builder and a
unifier, nor was it worthy of a Republican presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain defended his loyalty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been accused of consorting with the wrong sort of people,'' he said
in his speech, a reference to independents and Democrats from whom he has sought
support in open GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have always acted in what I believe to be the best interests of my
country,'' he said. ``And I always believed that what is good for America is
good for the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some prefer to build walls and exclude newcomers from our support,'' he
said. ``Apparently appeals to patriotism can only be heard by card-carrying
Republicans, and only certain Republicans at that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also said the McCain camp was trying to divide the party along
religious lines by making telephone calls in primary states linking Bush to
anti-Catholic sentiments at Bob Jones University, a South Carolina school
accused of religious bigotry. The McCain campaign said calls like those made
before Michigan's primary were being made in Washington state, but not in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain is running a stealth campaign, saying one thing and doing
another. He's playing the religious card,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said the Bush people were the religious dividers, telephoning voters
to ``distort by pro-life positions and smear the reputations of my supporters.''
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP race has focused on religious issues in recent days, with Bush
expressing his regrets on Sunday to Catholic leaders for his visit to Bob Jones
on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush waited too long.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His words are fine,'' said McCain. ``To me they should have been said
three weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   There also were reverberations from McCain's decision not to take part in a
debate on Thursday. McCain blamed Bush, arguing that Bush was initially evasive
about accepting the debate invitation.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said, given the delay, he scheduled events in New York that can't be
changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said, ``I'm sorry that we're not going to have the debate in Los
Angeles. I would be glad to spend the entire time on education.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, in his speech Monday, came to the heart of the religious
conservative movement to criticize its ``self-appointed leaders,'' but he
clearly was aiming at a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a Reagan Republican who will defeat Al Gore,'' McCain said.
``Unfortunately George Bush is a Pat Robertson Republican who will lose to Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   After his speech at a high school in Virginia, where polls put Bush ahead,
McCain headed to Washington where the two are in a tight race.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, polls show Bush leading McCain by as much as 20 percentage
points among likely Republican voters who will choose that state's delegates
March 7, although it put them neck-and-neck in the open primary's popular vote,
which includes independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   After discussing education with teachers in Bellevue, Wash., Bush said he
was the candidate who wants to stick to issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ronald Reagan didn't point fingers,'' Bush told reporters. ``He never
played to people's religious fears like Senator McCain has shamelessly done.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-La. Gov.'s Trial Continues  </HEADLINE>
   By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A half-dozen contractors and laborers who worked at
residences of former Gov. Edwin Edwards or his family testified Monday that they
were paid in stacks of $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors allege Edwards, his son Stephen and five other men
manipulated and profited from the awarding of riverboat casino licenses before
and after Edwards left office in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors focused Monday on evidence that appears to suggest Edwards
always had plenty of cash; they hope to show he spent more money than he
legitimately made in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the trial began Jan. 10, one former casino owner and a former casino
consultant have testified they made large cash payments in return for Edwards'
help in getting licenses or fending off competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Landscaper Eduardo Jenkins said Monday he was paid $152,000 for installing a
swimming pool and other work at Edwin Edwards' home in 1995. About $80,000 was
paid in banded bundles of $100 bills, including a $50,000 down payment he picked
up at the Governor's Mansion, Jenkins testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Contractor Phillip Haddad testified he was paid with a $218,000 check and
$60,000 in cash when he sold a house to Edwards' son David in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Jarrod Clayborne, owner of an interior design store, said he received
$131,000 in cash from Edwards between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards' daughter Anna testified that Edwin Edwards came by his fondness for
cash honestly. She said the ex-governor's father raised his sons to be wary of
banks after seeing people lose their savings during the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards' attorney, Dan Small, raised the possibility Edwards won the cash at
casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   Small asked carpenter David Kleinpeter, who had testified he was paid $800
in cash before Edwards tore up the invoice, whether $100 bills are a common form
of payment from casinos. ``I would imagine,'' Kleinpeter said, adding, ``I have
personal knowledge of $5 and $10, but not $100.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards, 72, who served four terms as Louisiana governor, could face 350
years in prison and $7.2 million in fines if convicted on the racketeering
charges. Stephen Edwards could get 305 years.

<HEADLINE> Senate panel approves dorm sprinkler bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A Senate committee Monday took the first votes on a
bill to install fire suppression sprinklers in every dorm room in New Jersey by
2002.
<P>
	   The committee in unanimous votes set the program deadline at 24 months and
set the cost to the state at $50 million. Experts were on hand to dispute both
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jane Kenny, commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, said
the administration endorses both aspects of the proposal and has funded the
project in the current budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The 5-0 votes came with the release of a study by the New Jersey Educational
Facilities Authority showing that 36,600 beds in college dorm rooms - about 71
percent of the total - have no sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   This includes eight colleges and universities where none of the dorm rooms
have sprinklers, including Rider, Kean and Seton Hall, site of the Jan. 19 fire
that claimed three lives and left six students critically injured, four of them
with extensive burns.
</P>
<P>
	   The set of bills passed by the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee would
update a 1991 law that required sprinklers in all new dorm rooms. The bill would
expand that law to require sprinklers in every room in every dorm in New Jersey
regardless of whether the building is old, new, public or private.
</P>
<P>
	   The $50 million fund would provide partial loans at discount interest rates.
Public colleges would be obligated to repay 50 percent of the debt, and the
state would cover the rest, turning half of the loan into what would in effect
be a cash grant.
</P>
<P>
	   For private institutions, the state would cover a third of the debt, leaving
the rest to the college to pay from its tuition or endowment sources. The
spending bill now heads to the budget committee, the other bills to the full
Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Community Affairs calculated the installation cost
according to the number of square feet in dorm rooms and the number of beds in
them, deriving a figure of a $6 cost per square foot.
</P>
<P>
	   But Victor Cantillo, director of the Education Facilities Authority, said
colleges and universities estimated installation costs up to $14 a square foot,
reporting a total cost of $85 million to install sprinklers in all unprotected
dorm rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry experts told lawmakers on Monday that a sudden rush by colleges to
find contractors for these projects could drive up their asking prices, and thus
could push the final cost to $100 million or more.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutgers University fire chief Joseph Zuccarello told the lawmakers the
university has a plan to fit sprinklers into some 100 dorms and student houses
over the next seven to 10 years, and that he was unsure how much that could be
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Louis Kosco, R-Bergen, said Rutgers could do the work more quickly by
simply dividing it into multiple projects and hiring more firms, but Zuccarello
said it was not that simple, in part because of design problems and in part
because of the availability of contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   Shawn Love, regional manager for Grinnell Fire Protection Systems, which he
called one of the nation's largest installation contractors, said many firms
that install sprinkler systems are small and are booked up because of the
booming construction market.
</P>
<P>
	   Grinnell has the contract to install sprinklers in every room of Seton Hall
University's dorms by September, and at its peak Love said the firm will have 20
workers at the job site.
</P>
<P>
	   Love said he doubts there are 20 firms in New Jersey that could bring that
kind of manpower to bear on such a project. Richard Hodavance, business manager
for a union representing sprinkler contractors, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, Love said he does not see how two dozen universities can be
expected to get this work done in hundreds of buildings as quickly as the
senators wish. "I think 24 months is a little bit too aggressive," he said.

<HEADLINE> Minister Cop Charged in Death  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTINE HANLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A police officer who was also a Baptist minister and
was adored for helping poor children was charged with murder after police said
he shot his mistress' husband to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Hurth, 44, was arrested and fired from the force Saturday, a week after
Ralph Gawor was found shot to death at home. Hurth was to be arraigned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's so hard to believe,'' said Anita Martinez, who credits Hurth with
getting her a job as assistant manager of an apartment complex in the struggling
Amber Way neighborhood. ``Anybody but Paul. Not Paul. He is such a sweet man.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hurth, the father of three children, was a fixture in Amber Way, finding
teens jobs and bringing families bikes and trees at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   Gawor, 43, was last seen on Feb. 18 as he left his sales manager job at an
auto dealership. His employers found his body at home the next day after he
failed to show up at the office.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators found no signs of forced entry or struggle and later
discovered physical evidence linking Hurth to the scene, police Lt. John Fries
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gawor and his wife, Nancy, were married about 12 years and did not have
children.
</P>
<P>
	   Hurth's family referred all calls to his attorney, Ernest S. Kinney. He did
not immediately return a phone call but told The Fresno Bee that his client
``was involved with the victim's wife in a romantic relationship.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This appears to be an incredible tragedy because all the people involved
are decent people,'' Kinney said. ``However, decent people can make tragic
mistakes of judgment.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Gawors' phone number was not listed and Mrs. Gawor could not be reached
for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hurth worked as a police chaplain for two years before he went to the police
academy and became an officer in 1996, the same year he received the Agency
Executive Director of the Year award from The New United Way of Fresno County
and worked with a local YWCA to reduce domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Four years ago, he began holding services for his Baptist congregation at
the Lutheran Campus Ministry, through an informal arrangement with the pastor
there, Don Romsa. Hurth attended every weekend with his wife and children, Romsa
said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Backs Use of Chemical Suits  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. DONNELLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Pentagon official on Monday defended the military's
decision to give U.S. forces in Bosnia potentially defective suits designed to
protect soldiers from chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At no time did we ever put our military forces in jeopardy,'' Army Lt.
Gen. Tom Glisson said. ``I'm confident the testing we did and the ones we issued
were good.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a hastily arranged news conference responding to an Associated Press
report about the defective suits, Glisson said 120,000 were issued for use in
Bosnia but he did not know how many were actually used.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of Congress demanded more information about the defective suits and
why the Pentagon waited five years after discovering the defects to take them
out of use.
</P>
<P>
	   A new Pentagon inspector general report criticizes the Defense Logistics
Agency, headed by Glisson, for not acting swiftly enough to take the suits out
of the inventory after criminal investigators had begun to look into allegations
the company was intentionally producing poor-quality merchandise and even after
testing had confirmed ``major'' problems in the very lot of suits issued for
posible use in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
	   This month the military told its installations worldwide not to use any of
the suits except for training.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., chairman of the House Armed Services research and
development subcommittee, said he would ask the Pentagon for a briefing on the
matter and if not satisfied with the responses would demand hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not just the cost involved,'' Weldon said. ``But the potential impact
to men and women in uniform is impossible to calculate .... There should be some
type of punitive action taken.''
</P>
<P>
	   The suits cost $49 million for 778,000, not all of which were defective.
Because of the criminal investigation, in 1994, the Pentagon froze the issuance
of 173,000 suits made under a 1992 contract with New York City-based Istratex,
Inc., Glisson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The quality of 607,000 suits made under a 1989 contract was never
questioned, Glisson said, although he acknowledged that those suits did not
undergo the same scrutiny by criminal investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general's report said the defects included holes, tears and
stitching irregularities. Though Glisson called the problems ``cosmetic,'' an
Army guidance document for chemical warfare soldiers says: ``The BDO (battle
dress overgarment) becomes unserviceable if it is ripped, torn, fastener broken
or missing'' or other problems occur.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The holes in these protective suits show the holes in the Pentagon's
procurement process,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``It's alarming that it
took two inspector generals' reports and five years for the Pentagon to finally
stop use of these dangerous suits.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said, ``This latest disclosure of mismanagement
at the Department of Defense is outrageous. Unlike other instances whrere
reports have shown that DoD simply loses major inventory items, this mistake
actually threatens lives of American soldiers. I expect someone to be held
accountable for this situation, which puts our soldiers at risk of harm and
evidently wastes millions of taxpayer dollars.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. military issued for use in Bosnia 120,000 chemical-protective suits
from the lot at issue, though the Pentagon knew the company that made the
garments was under criminal investigation since 1994 for ``discrepancies'' in
the manufacture of cold-weather parkas for the military, Glisson said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, company officials were indicted on fraud charges in connection with
the chemical protective suits. Last fall, several top executives pleaded guilty
to lesser charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The logistics agency, which manages Pentagon inventories, satisfied itself
in 1996 through its own testing that the chemical suits -- charcoal-lined
camouflage pants and jackets -- made by Istratex were functional for use in
Bosnia, Glisson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those tests turned up ``cosmetic'' flaws, Glisson said. Criminal
investigators said they actually were major. According to military regulations
``major'' problems are serious but not grave enough to trigger pulling the items
from the shelves.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense criminal investigators have said they told the logistics agency as
early as 1995 about concerns that the company was producing low- quality
chemical gear.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not until three years later that the Pentagon conducted a followup
study by the suits' Army designers -- requested by the investigators -- that
revealed ``critical'' problems that had not been previously discovered. The
tests found critical flaws in seven suits out of 500, he said, enough for the
military to send out a worldwide warning this month.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Bosnia crisis, Glisson said, the military had a dire need for the
suits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know how many of the 120,000 are still out there,'' he said of the
suits issued for Bosnia. The agency has 334,000 in a stateside depot.
</P>
<P>
	   The military has 4 million suits of this sort available, so the loss of the
Istratex number from the active inventory will not have an effect on the
readiness of forces to fight in a chemical or biological environment, Glisson
said.

<HEADLINE> Pataki and Moynihan: Bush letter to Cardinal should put issue to  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Gov. George Pataki said Monday that George W. Bush's
appearance at Bob Jones University was a mistake, but that the Texas governor
had made amends with his letter to Cardinal John O'Connor.
<P>
	   A top New York Democrat, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, agreed with
Republican Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Bush did the right thing," Pataki, head of Bush's New York
campaign, said. "I think that should be the end of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Moynihan, who held a brief news conference with Pataki in the senator's
Capitol office, agreed that Bush's letter should put the matter to rest.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought it was a handsome letter," Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Pataki and Moynihan are Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for O'Connor said the cardinal was aware of Bush's letter but
had not commented on it yet.
</P>
<P>
	   New York backers of Sen. John McCain, including Staten Island Borough
President Guy Molinari, have said they plan to make Bush's visit to Bob Jones
University an issue with New York's Catholic voters who make up 46 percent of
the GOP enrollment in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Jones, a conservative Christian school in South Carolina, has come under
fire for banning interracial dating and spreading anti-Catholic views. Leaders
at the school have criticized the Pope and labeled the Catholic church a
"Satanic cult.
</P>
<P>
	   In his letter to O'Connor, made public Sunday, Bush wrote that he deeply
regretted "causing needless offense" by not clearly "disassociating myself from
anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice."
</P>
<P>
	   The 80-year-old O'Connor wields considerable power as leader of New York's
1.4 million Catholics.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush made the visit to Bob Jones as he sought to appeal to South Carolina's
conservative Republican voters. Until Sunday's letter to the cardinal, Bush had
said he had nothing to apologize for.
</P>
<P>
	   A pair of statewide polls out Monday showed Bush and McCain running
neck-and-neck among New York's GOP voters. Despite the tight poll numbers,
Pataki on Monday predicted Bush would win.
</P>
<P>
	   "As long as it is on the issues and it is on the records and the visions of
the candidate, Governor Bush will win." Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling Bush "an inclusive tolerant person," Pataki lambasted McCain,
charging that the senator had injected religion into the race. McCain has
acknowledged that his camp made phone calls to Michigan Catholics bringing up
Bush's visit to the university. McCain won last week's Michigan primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Pataki, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and some other prominent
Republicans, who are still backing Bush, have said his visit to Bob Jones
University was a mistake. The visit prompted Rep. Peter King, a Long Island
Republican and Roman Catholic, to abandon Bush and become the co-chairman of
McCain's New York campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing Monday night on MSNBC's "Hardball with Chris Matthews" Pataki was
asked if he would appear at Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I did go I would make it very plain what my views are," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think you have an obligation to do that. Gov. Bush has said you have an
obligation to do that. He admitted making a mistake."

<HEADLINE> Committee hears new Public Records bill but withholds vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The momentum to rewrite New Jersey's 37-year-old
Public Records Law began to build Monday as lawmakers on the Assembly State
Government committee held a friendly hearing on the issue.
<P>
	   The news of the day came from the prime sponsor, Assemblyman George Geist,
R-Gloucester, in announcing that Assembly Speaker Jack Collins would cosponsor
his bill, A-1309, a key step toward winning approval, at least in the lower
house.
</P>
<P>
	   But the committee took no vote, and a few members raised concerns about some
parts of the bill while sounding supportive of the overall idea.
</P>
<P>
	   The Public Records Law mandates that any document required under statute
shall be maintained as a public record. Thus it does not apply to vast banks of
information at all levels of government, from consulting reports to land
appraisals to bill receipts, that may not be specifically mentioned in one state
law or another.
</P>
<P>
	   William "Skip" Hidlay, executive editor of the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill,
told lawmakers there are no penalties in the old law to pressure local officials
who blithely ignore legitimate requests for records.
</P>
<P>
	   Hidlay, Richard Bilotti, publisher of The Times of Trenton, the New Jersey
Press Association and the Society of Professional Journalists testified in favor
of the measure, which "declares it to be the public policy of this state that
government records shall be made readily accessible for inspection, copying or
examination by the citizens of this state ..."
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying for the New Jersey Press Association, attorney Thomas Cafferty
said the old law "is woefully inadequate ... in large part because of the law's
limited and confusing definition of what is a public record."
</P>
<P>
	   Hidlay said research by reporters for his newspaper and others in the
Gannett newspaper group showed a majority of public officials in hundreds of
town halls and school board offices dragged their feet or refused to comply with
requests for such basic items as budgets, payroll reports and contracts with
school executives.
</P>
<P>
	   News executives were joined Monday by ordinary citizens who told the
lawmakers of their frustration in seeking records in their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of their stories alleged that local officials were violating the law as
it exists now without an amendment to toughen it. But Hidlay said these
violations occurred because the old law lacks penalties for those who choose to
ignore it.
</P>
<P>
	   Assemblywoman Rose Heck, R-Bergen, said she had questions about a provision
of the bill that would require records to be produced within seven business
days. She said many towns have minimal staffs and need to be protected from a
flood of paperwork inquiries.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would apply to computer data records as well as paper files, and
would set uniform photocopying costs statewide. It would also create a $1,000
fine for public officials or employees who refuse to comply, and would limit
legal expenses for the public by allowing them to take complaints to municipal
court.
</P>
<P>
	   The League of Municipalities opposed the bill on many points, charging that
a fine would "discourage well-qualified professionals from public service and
create an atmosphere of official trepidation."
</P>
<P>
	   The League also said complying with large requests would increase municipal
costs, and that files with information about such things as dog permits, home
expansions and burglar alarm installations should remain secret.
</P>
<P>
	   A different version of the bill that died last year raised fears it would do
more harm than good by inviting state bureaucrats to label volumes of government
information as secret. Cafferty said those worrisome provisions have been
deleted from the current bill.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Hero Pleads Innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. (AP) -- An Air Force helicopter pilot, honored as a hero
for leading a daring rescue off the coast of Iceland six years ago, pleaded
innocent at his court-martial Monday to charges he molested two girls.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. James A. Sills, 48, is charged with a series of indecent acts involving
the girls, including exposing himself and sodomy, between 1988 and 1994 while he
was stationed in Florida, Illinois and Iceland. The charges did not indicate
Sills' relationship to the girls.
</P>
<P>
	   He also is charged with having an unprofessional relationship with a
secretary, assaulting his estranged wife, and lying during a security clearance
interview when asked if he had ever engaged in ``deviant sexual behavior.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sills' lawyer has said the charges are unfounded and the result of bitter
divorce proceedings. Sills made no comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   His court-martial is expected to last a week. If convicted, he could face 63
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Sills, a 25-year Air Force veteran, shared the 1994 MacKay Trophy for the
most meritorious Air Force flight of the year. He commanded two helicopters that
rescued six seamen from freezing waters off Iceland.

<HEADLINE> Poll: McCain Trails Among GOP  </HEADLINE>

	   McCain's challenge to Bush has raised public interest in the campaign,

<HEADLINE> Polls: McCain Trails Among GOP  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain has grown more popular with the public
as Gov. George W. Bush's popularity has slipped, but the Arizona senator faces

<HEADLINE> Complaint Filed Vs. GM Arbitration  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Michigan's attorney general has threatened to sue General
Motors Corp., saying the automaker's employee discount program for new vehicles
illegally limits how far warranty claims can be pursued.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Jennifer Granholm filed a complaint Monday saying GM's
program illegally forces warranty claims to be decided in binding, out-of-court
arbitration and limits the damages that can be awarded.
</P>
<P>
	   She said if claims are filed in court, the vehicle owner could face legal
action or, if they are a GM employee, even be fired. The automaker has 10 days
to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   But GM said its program was legal, and that no employee would be fired for
filing claims outside arbitration. It also said no warranty cases had been
brought under arbitration since March 1, 1999, when it became mandatory.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do not force our employees to choose this program," said GM attorney
Steve Cernak. "They get a substantial discount, and as part of that program,
they agree to resolve warranty claims in this way."
</P>
<P>
	   Discount programs are one of the most beloved perks for U.S. automakers'
employees and their immediate families, often knocking thousands of dollars off
the price of a new car or truck.
</P>
<P>
	   GM imposed mandatory arbitration on its program in 1999, Cernak said, to
resolve warranty claims more quickly and cheaply for both sides. He said no
cases have been brought because such claims are settled before they reach that
stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Cernak said DaimlerChrysler AG had a similar clause in its programs.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler spokesman Jay Cooney said the automaker asks that in
exchange for a discount on a car, employees agree to settle any disputes before
an independent, third-party arbiter. But Cooney said Chrysler does not assess a
penalty, such as termination, if an employee chooses to file a lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Haider Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Right-wing leader Joerg Haider, criticized for his
anti-foreigner statements and past praise of some Nazi-era policies, resigned as
head of the Freedom Party Monday in an apparent bid to end Austria's
international ostracism following his party's rise to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, 50, made the announcement at a closed-door meeting of his party's
national leadership at a hotel in downtown Vienna.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider remains governor of Carinthia province and insisted that his decision
does not mean he is retiring from national politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Haider holds no post in the national government, his controversial
image and his iron-hand control of the Freedom Party made him the most visible
member of the Austrian political establishment, eclipsing his coalition
partners, the center-right Austrian People's Party of Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel. The Freedom Party remains a member of the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to avoid our ministers having to face the claim that they must
refer every decision to the shadow chancellor in Carinthia,'' Haider told
reporters. ``The Freedom Party ministers are not puppets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider will be succeeded as party chief by his trusted lieutenant, Vice
Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer, 39. She told reporters she had not wanted
Haider to step aside, but she said she respects his decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The Austria Press Agency said Haider told the party leadership meeting that
he was stepping down because he did not want ``to stand in the way'' of the work
of the new government.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14 other European Union members have downgraded relations with Austria
because of the presence of Haider's party in the government which took office
Feb. 4. The outrage was based on Haider's anti-immigrant stand and his past
praise of veterans of the murderous Waffen SS and Adolf Hitler's ``orderly''
employment policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Haider bristled at suggestions that he was bowing to foreign
pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I accept no pressure from outside,'' he told reporters. ``We are
accustomed to making our own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from other EU members. In Washington,
however, State Department spokesman James Rubin said Haider's resignation was a
``step in the right direction'' but noted that the Freedom Party remains in
government ``so we'll be watching their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some Austrian politicians and commentators doubted that the resignation
signaled the end of Haider's influence on the national government. Riess-Passer
and others in the Freedom Party leadership have long-established reputations as
Haider disciples who owe their political positions to him.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly elected head of the opposition Social Democratic party, Alfred
Gusenbauer, said the resignation was simply ``one of Haider's many tactical
tricks'' and would give the coalition a respite from criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Prinzhorn, a senior Freedom Party official, said Haider would remain
the ``top man'' of the party.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said Haider's
decision was the ``first sign of a breath of fresh air'' since Haider's party
finished second in the Oct. 3 parliamentary elections, which paved the way to
joining the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Hier said the international criticism was pivotal in forcing Haider to step
down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We only hope that his resignation sends a strong message to other members
of the Freedom Party that no one is prepared to accept a party whose platform is
based on xenophobia and bigotry,'' Hier told The Associated Press. ``We hope the
Freedom Party will get the message.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, Peter Sichrovsky, the Freedom Party's EU representative,
said Haider had mentioned stepping down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Already on Saturday, he mentioned it in an internal party discussion,''
Sichrovsky said. ``He has already achieved more than anyone else, and if that is
his decision, then we must respect it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the international furor, Haider remains popular with many Austrians
and within the party he nearly single-handedly built up from a small, unknown
group to the second-largest political force in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has led the Freedom Party since 1986 and was elected governor of
Carinthia province in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's party exploited widespread concern over the impact of immigration
and EU expansion on Austrian jobs to finish second in the parliamentary election
with 52 of the 183 seats in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   The left-leaning Social Democrats finished first, winning 65 seats but too
few to govern on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   At EU ministerial meetings on Monday, Austrian delegates were publicly
shunned. At a defense ministers meeting in Sintra, Portugal, Belgian delegate
Andre Flahaut skipped lunch, telling reporters, ``I don't eat with fascists,''
in protest against the presence of Austrian Defense Minister Herbert Scheibner.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl-Heinz Grasser, Austria's finance minister, also got a frosty welcome at
his first EU gathering in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   French diplomats said ministers including their own declined to shake hands
with Grasser.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, GE Developing New Airliners  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM KLAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing will begin development of two new long-range versions
of its popular twin-engine 777 models, industry sources confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from Boeing and General Electric, which builds the GE-90 engine
for existing 777-200 and -300 aircraft, were expected to announce development
and production of the 777-200X and -300X at a Tuesday news conference in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at Seattle-based Boeing and Fairfield, Conn.-based GE declined
comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A news release said Tuesday's announcement would deal with "major product
development." Scheduled to attend were Phil Condit, Boeing president and chief
executive officer; Jack Welch, GE president and CEO; Alan Mulally, president of
Boeing Commercial Airplanes; and Jim McNerney Jr., GE Aircraft Engines president
and CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   An industry source confirmed the executives planned to announce development
and production of expanded versions of the 777 models, equipped with a larger
version of the GE-90 engine.
</P>
<P>
	   It will cost Boeing at least $1 billion to develop the long-range models,
but it needs them to battle Airbus Industrie in the Asia-Pacific market, the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The newer 777's would carry 300 to 375 passengers for distances up to 10,100
miles and be capable of flights lasting up to 18 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Airbus has a long-range version of its four-engine A-340, and is developing
the larger A340-500 and A340-600 models.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing's plans were first reported Monday in The Wall Street Journal, which
said the company has about 30 orders for the expanded 777's, valued at more than
$5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Quoting industry executives, the Journal said Japan Air Lines and the
aircraft-leasing unit of GE are among a half-dozen buyers for the new airplanes.
It said first deliveries were expected in September 2003.

<HEADLINE> Study finds fewer than third of college students have sprinklers in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Two of three students living on New Jersey college
campuses occupy dorm rooms without fire suppression sprinklers, according to a
state study done in the aftermath of last month's fatal fire at Seton Hall
University.
<P>
	   The New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority, the state's lead agency in
the construction of new college buildings, released the results Monday to a
Senate committee. The lawmakers approved legislation to mandate sprinklers in
every dorm room in New Jersey and to provide $50 million in state financing to
pay for their installation.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found only about 15,290 beds in student dormitories in New Jersey
were in rooms equipped with sprinklers. That's about 29 percent of the total of
51,913 beds in the dorms at colleges and universities, both public and private.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the medium-sized and larger universities, three - Rider, Kean and Seton
Hall, site of the Jan. 19 fire that claimed three lives - have no sprinkler
coverage in any individual dorm rooms, although some buildings do have
sprinklers in common areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutgers University has sprinklers covering 32 percent of its dorm room beds,
Princeton University 14 percent. Of other large schools, The College of New
Jersey had the highest percentage of its rooms equipped with sprinklers,
covering 82 percent of its beds.
</P>
<P>
	   Public colleges average 39 percent sprinkler coverage of dorm beds while at
private colleges only 13 percent of the beds had sprinkler coverage in those
rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   The Educational Facilities Authority survey was one that colleges and
universities were required to answer since the authority has provided financing
to virtually all of them.
</P>
<P>
	   It pinpointed student-occupied rooms specifically, rather than asking a more
general question as to whether sprinklers existed at any location within a
residential building. By counting beds, it got an accurate proportion of
students with and without fire suppression coverage because the sizes of dorm
buildings, rooms and suites vary extensively.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, in the aftermath of the Seton Hall tragedy, officials, when
asked about sprinklers, said that four out of six dormitories had them. But
these sprinklers were installed only in common areas. The survey released Monday
said none of Seton Hall's six dormitories has sprinklers in students' rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   William Cane, executive director of the state Division of Fire Safety, said
a 1991 law required every new dormitory to include sprinklers in every room. As
with any such update to safety codes, however, the law did not apply to existing
buildings, only to new construction or buildings facing substantial renovation.
</P>
<P>
	   Cane said while hallway sprinklers might have knocked down the Seton Hall
fire, which occurred in a third-floor lounge area, dorms need sprinklers in
every room to be safe since the greatest fire risk exists within students'
rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   "Partial coverage does not provide safety," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cane's supervisor, Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Jane Kenny,
testified, "All students deserve this protection, and all of their parents
deserve to sleep at night without worry."
</P>
<P>
	   Educational Facilities Authority director Victor Cantillo said colleges and
universities estimated that $85 million would be needed to install sprinklers,
and industry experts said a sudden rush to do the projects could drive the costs
higher.

<HEADLINE> New Charges Against 'Sammy the Bull'  </HEADLINE>
   By ALISA BLACKWOOD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Former Mafia hitman Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' Gravano,
arrested last week for allegedly masterminding a statewide drug ring, was
charged Monday with racketeering, conspiracy and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Napolitano filed a new complaint, charging Gravano,
three family members and 42 others with a total of 181 counts. They had all
initially been arrested on a single count of conspiracy to distribute a
dangerous drug.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of the charges are felonies carrying maximum 12 1/2-year prison
sentences -- if the suspect has no prior convictions.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano, the confessed killer of 19 whose testimony helped put New York
crime boss John Gotti behind bars, was arrested Thursday. He was being held on a
$5 million cash bond.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano is also charged with possession of dangerous drugs for sale, illegal
enterprise and participating in a criminal syndicate.
</P>
<P>
	   His attorney, Larry Hammond, was not commenting on the charges Monday,
according to an assistant.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano's wife, daughter and son were also named in the new complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   The ecstasy drug ring, which allegedly started as a small-scale operation,
was selling 20,000 to 30,000 pills a week once Gravano put his weight behind it,
authorities said. The designer drug sells for $20 to $30 per pill.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say Gravano helped turn the drug ring into a $500,000-a-week
operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecstasy is a hybrid of the hallucinogen mescaline and the stimulant
amphetamine, chemically known as MDMA. The drug is popular at rave clubs and
underground parties with high energy music and lights displays, according to
drug enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano escaped charges for the 19 murders he admitted to by testifying
against Gotti, the so-called ``Teflon Don.'' He was released in 1995, given a
new name through the witness protection program and underwent plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano, also known as Jimmy Moran, dropped out of the program by early 1997
and has since been living what appeared to be a clean life in the Phoenix suburb
of Tempe.

<HEADLINE> Ex-La. Gov.'s Trial Continues  </HEADLINE>
   By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A half-dozen contractors and laborers who worked at
residences of former Gov. Edwin Edwards or his family testified Monday that they
were paid in stacks of $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors allege Edwards, his son Stephen and five other men
manipulated and profited from the awarding of riverboat casino licenses before
and after Edwards left office in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors focused Monday on evidence that appears to suggest Edwards
always had plenty of cash; they hope to show he spent more money than he
legitimately made in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the trial began Jan. 10, one former casino owner and a former casino
consultant have testified they made large cash payments in return for Edwards'
help in getting licenses or fending off competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Landscaper Eduardo Jenkins said Monday he was paid $152,000 for installing a
swimming pool and other work at Edwin Edwards' home in 1995. About $80,000 was
paid in banded bundles of $100 bills, including a $50,000 down payment he picked
up at the Governor's Mansion, Jenkins testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Contractor Phillip Haddad testified he was paid with a $218,000 check and
$60,000 in cash when he sold a house to Edwards' son David in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Garrett Clayborne, owner of an interior design store, said he received
$131,000 in cash from Edwards between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards' daughter Anna testified that Edwin Edwards came by his fondness for
cash honestly. She said the ex-governor's father raised his sons to be wary of
banks after seeing people lose their savings during the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards' attorney, Dan Small, raised the possibility Edwards won the cash at
casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   Small asked carpenter David Kleinpeter, who had testified he was paid $800
in cash before Edwards tore up the invoice, whether $100 bills are a common form
of payment from casinos. ``I would imagine,'' Kleinpeter said, adding, ``I have
personal knowledge of $5 and $10, but not $100.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards, 72, who served four terms as Louisiana governor, could face 350
years in prison and $7.2 million in fines if convicted on the racketeering
charges. Stephen Edwards could get 305 years.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Probes Police Chief's Death  </HEADLINE>
   By NIKO PRICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- In this violent border town where killings occur
daily, Tijuana police tried to resolve one more case Monday: the death of their
popular police chief, whose car was riddled with bullets on a busy highway.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators hope a gray Cherokee sports utility vehicle with California
license plates can offer more clues in Sunday's killing of Alfredo de la Torre
Marquez. Three bullet shells were found in the vehicle, suggesting this could
have been the vehicle used by the attackers, state Attorney General Juan Manuel
Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cherokee was believed to be one of three vehicles used in the attack on
a busy, six-lane divided highway in the northern edge of Tijuana, just across
the border from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre was driving to his office, and was unaccompanied by his normal
contingent of bodyguards, when gunmen using Kalashnikov rifles and 9-mm pistols
pulled up alongside his black Suburban and fired 99 rounds at him, officials
said. The vehicle crashed into a palm tree on the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Salazar said De la Torre had told his bodyguards that he planned to stay
home all day. It was not clear why he decided to go to his office. De la Torre
was carrying a pistol, but didn't use it.
</P>
<P>
	   No one has been arrested, and the motive for the killing was unknown.
Seventy witnesses and potential suspects were interviewed Sunday, but police had
no suspects, Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
	   Enrique Tellaeche, spokesman for the Baja California state Attorney
General's Office, said the killing was ``obviously linked to organized crime,''
but said it was too early to tell whether it was connected to the Tijuana-based
drug organization led by the Arrellano-Felix brothers, which is notorious for
its gangland-style hits.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration considers the organization one of
the most powerful and violent drug-trafficking groups. One of the brothers,
Ramon Eduardo, is on the FBI's 10 most-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre had been a police officer for 25 years, working his way up from
motorcycle cop, and may have made many enemies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only motive for the killing is his job,'' said Jaime Valencia, a
police forensics supervisor who, like all his colleagues, wore a black band over
his badge. ``A person who does his job well goes against the interests of the
bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said de la Torre was loved by his fellow officers. ``He was the best
director we've had.''
</P>
<P>
	   Baja California is one of Mexico's most violent states, and Tijuana is one
of its most violent cities. It recorded about 300 murders last year, and the
pace of killings has picked up this year.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre is the second Tijuana police chief killed in six years. In April
1994, Federico Benitez and a bodyguard were shot to death when gunmen opened
fire on their vehicle as it drove down a highway near the city's airport.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech while visiting the state Friday, President Ernesto Zedillo
pledged to have federal and state officials improve cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Organized crime has brought to Baja California a trail of violence, a
trail of intimidation,'' he said. ``We have to make these criminals understand
that Baja California can't be their home, that the only places where they
deserve to live are in prisons.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 55 percent of the cocaine used in the United States is shipped through
Mexico or Mexican waters, according to U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the United States, under its annual ``certification program,''
will announce which countries are cooperating in the fight against drug
trafficking. Mexico's certification is virtually assured, but the process always
results in hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexicans consider the process humiliating and a violation of their
sovereignty. They say they are suffering from drug violence, especially on the
border, largely because the United States has done little to reduce its
consumption of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre is also the second police chief in a border city to be killed in
a week. Juan Angel Cabrera Leal, the police chief in Reynosa, was shot to death
last Tuesday. Reynosa is across the border from McAllen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Police are accustomed to running risks,'' said Tijuana's secretary of
public security, Perla Ibarra. ``You can't say that this surprises us, because
it is the reality.''

<HEADLINE> Racial issues heat up debate over reciting Declaration of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An already contentious fight over a bill that would
force schoolchildren to recite part of the Declaration of Independence turned
angry Monday when some lawmakers said the proposal is offensive to African
Americans.
<P>
	   The racial question forced the bill's Senate sponsor to table the measure
after nearly 90 minutes of emotional debate on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Gerald Cardinale, R-Bergen, asked that the bill be held because he no
longer had enough votes for it to pass.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the bill's 21 cosponsors, Sen. Byron Baer, D-Bergen, changed his mind
during the party's caucus Monday when some black lawmakers told him how outraged
they were over the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   They objected to the clause that says, "All men are created equal" because
when the declaration was written, that basic democratic principle did not apply
to black people.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was affected by how offended my African American colleagues in the
Legislature were over the legislation in its current form," said Baer.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Wayne Bryant, D-Camden, passionately conveyed that resentment to the
40-member Senate during the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is clear that African Americans were not included in that phrase," said
Bryant. "It's another way of being exclusionary and insensitive ... You have
nerve to ask my grandchildren to recite (the declaration). How dare you? You are
now on notice that this is offensive to my community."
</P>
<P>
	   Baer's change of heart left Cardinale without enough votes. Another
supporter, Sen. Walter Kavanaugh, R-Somerset, was absent because of health
problems. Cardinale said he would present the measure again when Kavanaugh
returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Cardinale said Baer's fellow Democrats coerced him into changing his vote.
</P>
<P>
	   "They threatened to go into his district and tell every black person that
he's a traitor," Cardinale said outside the Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is absolutely no truth to that," said Baer. "There were no threats
made or implied. There were impassioned arguments."
</P>
<P>
	   The controversial legislation, which has been kicking around the Statehouse
for 13 years, would require children in grades three through 12 to recite the
following portion of the historic document:
</P>
<P>
	   "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these
rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from
the consent of the governed."
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would also require school districts to teach students about the
document, explaining the historical context, such as why it refers only to men,
and that it was written while slavery was accepted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the Legislature's more emotional and philosophical debates,
senators on both sides of the aisle quoted scripture and history books, trying
to persuade their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say a daily recitation will help instill basic democratic values
in children. They say the recitation will be coupled with lessons, making it
more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the America we know is to continue in its mission, our children must
have a clear grasp of this mission statement," said Cardinale.
</P>
<P>
	   Cardinale also said Thomas Jefferson envisioned that his words would,
someday, apply to all people.
</P>
<P>
	   Karen Jones, principal at the Golden Door Charter School in Jersey City,
said she requires her students to recite the declaration, but instead of saying
"all men are created equal," students say "all people."
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to get past (the race issue) and not neglect the importance of the
ideas," said Jones, who is black and who brought her students to the Statehouse
to hear Monday's debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents, however, say a daily recitation will trivialize the ideas. They
also question why lawmakers want to single out the declaration when many other
important historical documents exist.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Robert Martin, R-Morris, said some have suggested that this particular
clause is being championed by pro-life forces because the "unalienable rights"
include life. Cardinale denied this.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin, one of the few Republicans who opposes the bill, also said the
measure violates the very principles it pretends to preserve because it imposes
state lawmakers' will on local schools.
</P>
<P>
	   He also charged that Cardinale thwarted the democratic process because he
bypassed the Senate Education Committee, which Martin chairs. Legislation
typically goes through committees that deal with specific issues. But
Cardinale's bill came to a vote in the full Senate floor after only passing the
Senate budget committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "It didn't go through the education committee because I could not guarantee
it would be released," Martin said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Can Prosecute Indians 2d Time  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB EGELKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An Indian who commits a crime on another tribe's land
and is convicted in tribal court can be prosecuted again, with a longer
sentence, in federal court, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a case from northeastern Arizona, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said the multiple prosecutions do not violate the Constitution's ban on double
jeopardy -- being prosecuted twice for the same crime.
</P>
<P>
	   An Indian tribe and the federal government are separate sovereignties and
can file separate charges for the same conduct, in the same way that someone can
be charged in both state and federal court for the same acts, the court said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tribes can prosecute Indians from any tribe for crimes committed on their
land. They cannot prosecute non-Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowing a separate federal prosecution is important because the maximum
sentence in tribal court is a year in jail, said Cathy Colbert, spokeswoman for
the U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
	   She said tribes have customarily referred serious cases to federal
authorities for further prosecution after tribal court sentences. The legality
of that procedure was well established in cases of Indians prosecuted by their
own tribes, but it was challenged in Monday's case of an Indian prosecuted by
another tribe.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael L. Enas, a member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, was charged with
stabbing and wounding a man in 1994 on land of the White Mountain Apache Tribe.
Enas pleaded guilty to assault in a White Mountain tribal court and was
sentenced to 180 days in jail and a fine of $1,180.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities then sought to charge him with assault with a deadly
weapon, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge barred the prosecution on double jeopardy grounds, saying a
tribe that prosecutes an Indian from another tribe is acting as an arm of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court disagreed in a 3-0 ruling and reinstated federal charges
against Enas.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Crash Victims Sue Van Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The parents of two of the four college students killed when
their track team's van overturned on a highway sued Ford Motor Co. Monday,
claiming the van had defects.
</P>
<P>
	   In the federal lawsuit, the families of Samuel Sturns and Jerome Jackson
claim Ford's 15-passenger vans, like the one carrying the Prairie View A&AMP;M track
team Feb. 10, exhibit stability problems when heavily loaded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the fifth incident in two months where college kids have been
seriously injured or killed in vehicles that they and their families trusted
were safe,'' said Jay English, an attorney for the families.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford spokeswoman Susan Krusel said she had not seen the lawsuit and would
not comment. She said the model involved ``is as good or better than a secure
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary report found speeding may have been a factor in the crash. The
report concluded that the van was speeding, veered onto the shoulder to avoid
another vehicle preparing to turn, then rolled when the driver tried to bring it
back on the road.

<HEADLINE> Panel Vows Ecuador Dollar Plan Aid  </HEADLINE>
    By GONZALO SOLANO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- A U.S. delegation on Monday pledged Washington's
support for a plan to make the U.S. dollar the official currency of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
	   Arturo Valenzuela, President Clinton's special assistant for Inter-American
affairs, praised Ecuador's Congress for swift action in approving a series of
laws to enable the currency switch.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the United States would use its pull with the International Monetary
Fund and other international lending institutions to "achieve the level of
financial support necessary for the Ecuadorean government's economic program to
succeed."
</P>
<P>
	   Polls have showed that more than 60 percent of Ecuadoreans reject the dollar
plan. It was one of the issues that prompted hundreds of Indians and young army
officers to seize the country's empty Congress building in January, leading to
the ouster of then-President Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   Valenzuela's comments came after a meeting with the country's new president,
Gustavo Noboa. Accompanying Valenzuela were Peter Romero, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for Latin American affairs, and Edwin Truman, assistant
secretary for international affairs in the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa hopes the move to the dollar will spur investment and bring down
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The IMF has not yet endorsed Ecuador's plan to abandon the national
currency, the sucre, and replace it with the greenback. By adopting the dollar,
Ecuador would join Panama and nine other countries in which the U.S. dollar is
legal tender.
</P>
<P>
	   Michel Camdessus, outgoing IMF chief, expressed doubts about the plan three
weeks ago, saying Ecuador should instead focus on structural reforms, including
strengthening its ailing banking system.
</P>
<P>
	   In theory, the move to the dollar would hold down inflation by preventing
Ecuador from printing more money to meet its budgetary needs after years of
deficit spending. Inflation topped 60 percent last year, the highest in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress on Friday passed 49 of 85 reforms necessary to make the currency
changeover, including a law prohibiting the Central Bank from printing new
sucres.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad, the former president, introduced the currency plan 12 days before
top military leaders forced him from power on Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   His ouster was prompted by a military-backed uprising by thousands of
Indians angry at his inability to halt Ecuador's economic slide and curb
corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian leaders have said the dollar plan is an affront to national
sovereignty and would benefit only the rich.
</P>
<P>
	   But Antonio Vargas, the Indian leader who led the Congress takeover, has
said the issue is negotiable, so long as Noboa's government gives Ecuador's 4
million Indians a greater voice in policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after Mahuad's ouster, Ecuador's military chief, Gen. Carlos Mendoza,
dissolved a three-man junta that had seized power. Mendoza resigned his post,
ceding government control to Noboa, the democratically elected vice-president.

<HEADLINE> McCain Campaign Co-Chairman Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER HOLLAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The co-chairman of Sen. John McCain's presidential
campaign in South Carolina has resigned, saying he wants no part of the attacks
over Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're growing into a national media vendetta that I cannot associate my
name to,'' state House Speaker Pro Tem Terry Haskins, a Bob Jones alumnus, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has criticized Bush's Feb. 2 speech at the Christian school and has
tried to portray the Texas governor as a captive of religious conservatives and
as anti-Catholic for appearing there. The school's leaders have criticized the
Pope and have called the Catholic church a ``Satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush apologized for the visit in a letter to Catholic leaders on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Haskins said the attacks were vicious and unjustified.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People at Bob Jones are not racist and they don't hate Catholics,'' he
said. ``No doubt Bob Jones University holds religious beliefs that are outside
the mainstream and unpopular. But the public lynching of this college has
created an environment which threatens the freedom for any individual or group
in America to hold unpopular religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
	   University spokesman Jonathan Pait said officials would no longer comment on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, former Gov. Carroll Campbell, Bush's top backer in the state,
suggested he holds no grudges against McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While we all say things in the heat of battle that upon further reflection
we may regret, once it's over I know that we are among friends and we all want a
president of whom we can be proud,'' Campbell said in a letter to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides said the comments amounted to the second apology from the Bush
camp in as many days for the campaign in South Carolina. Bush won the state's
Republican presidential primary this month with strong help from Christian
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's comment: ``It's entertaining.''

<HEADLINE> Canadian's Citizenship Questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A federal judge ruled Monday that a 76-year-old man who came
to Canada from Germany in 1954 hid his Nazi war record to gain citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling against Helmut Oberlander, 76, means he can be stripped of his
Canadian citizenship and deported by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Oberlander, who worked in the construction industry in Kitchener, Ontario,
has denied any role in atrocities by the unit he served with after German forces
occupied the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
	   But Judge Andrew MacKay said Oberlander's failure to mention the time he
served with the German unit when he applied for citizenship amounted to fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   MacKay avoided ruling on whether Oberlander participated in the killing by
the German unit of more than 90,000 people, many of them Jews. His ruling said
the evidence presented by the immigration ministry never established that
Oberlander was ``personally involved in the commission of atrocities or war
crimes or criminal activities.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian Jewish Congress said Monday that Oberlander should be stripped
of his citizenship and deported as quickly as possible.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Man Charged in Wife's Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- An elderly man charged with killing his terminally ill wife
apparently committed suicide by taking sleeping pills and drinking alcohol,
authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas May, 76, of San Diego was found Saturday at a motel in Santa Maria,
230 miles north of his home.
</P>
<P>
	   The retired Navy commander was scheduled to stand trial this spring on
murder charges for giving his 69-year-old wife, Hazel, a fatal dose of
medication last year and placing her in their car with the engine running and
the garage door closed.
</P>
<P>
	   He sat with her in the car and passed out from the fumes, but awoke about
five hours later and called his daughter, who alerted authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   May pleaded innocent, saying his wife, who was in the advanced stages of Lou
Gehrig's disease, had asked for his help to commit suicide. Prosecutors said
they did not believe Mrs. May had wanted to die.
</P>
<P>
	   While awaiting trial, May was free on $100,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Journal Register Co. to sell newspapers in Illinois, Missouri and  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Journal Register Co. said Monday it plans to sell
its newspapers in Illinois, Missouri and Ohio to boost its stock.
<P>
	   An industry analyst predicted the move will benefit the company by allowing
it to reduce its debt and putting it in position to acquire other newspapers
near its base in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ohio properties to be sold are four daily newspapers with total daily
circulation of 125,825 and Sunday circulation of 140,532: The News-Herald (Lake
County), The Morning Journal (Lorain), The Times Reporter (Dover-New
Philadelphia) and The Independent (Massillon).
</P>
<P>
	   The Missouri and Illinois properties include the Suburban Newspapers of
greater St. Louis, the largest weekly newspaper group in the United States with
distribution of approximately 1.7 million, and The Telegraph (Alton, Ill.), a
seven-day newspaper with daily circulation of 28,048 and Sunday circulation of
30,110.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said the sale will demonstrate Journal Register's underlying
value, which the board of directors said is not reflected in its stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sale of our Midwest properties will increase our financial flexibility
and enable us to further realize shareholder value," Robert Jelenic, Journal
Register chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of the Trenton-based Journal Register Co. closed at $12.50, up 62 1/2
cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange - near its 52-week low of $11.37
1/2 and well below the 52-week high of $23.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will not sell any newspaper unless it gets "satisfactory
agreements with respect to price and terms," said Jean B. Clifton, Journal
Register executive vice president. Clifton said the company intends to use the
proceeds initially to reduce debt and for other corporate purposes, including
the company's share buyback program.
</P>
<P>
	   "Overall, it looks like a good move," said industry analyst Asa W. Graves of
First Union Securities Inc. Besides allowing Journal Register to shrink its debt
and buy back more stock, the sale will enhance the company's ability to acquire
newspapers near its remaining Northeastern properties, Graves said.
</P>
<P>
	   "One thing they're very good at is taking small, stand-alone organizations
and combining that in an existing cluster," Graves said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although The New York Times Co. and The Thomson Corp. also announced plans
earlier this month to sell newspapers, sellers can still command a premium
because buyers would be interested in adding to nearby existing operations to
gain economies of scale, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   If all of its newspapers in the three states are sold, Journal Register will
be left with 20 daily newspapers with total daily circulation of approximately
483,000 and Sunday circulation of approximately 449,000, and 143 non-daily
publications with total distribution of more than 2.2 million clustered in five
areas in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Journal Register's properties include the New Haven Register, Connecticut's
second-largest daily and Sunday newspaper, and 194 non-daily publications. The
company had 1999 total revenues of $470 million.
</P>
<P>
	   It operates in seven regions: Connecticut; Philadelphia and its surrounding
areas; Ohio; the greater St. Louis area; central New England; and the
Capital-Saratoga and Mid-Hudson regions of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Journal Register's announcement is the third large newspaper company
divestiture announcement this month.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, The New York Times Co. said it plans to sell seven of its smaller
newspapers and the nine telephone directories that are part of its Regional
Newspaper Group.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thomson Corp. of Canada announced Feb. 15 that it was selling its U.S.
newspapers, made up mainly of 49 local and regional dailies with circulations of
less than 50,000. Thomson is also putting up for sale five dailies in Canada and
more than 75 non-daily newspapers, most of which are based in the United States.
Its U.S. newspapers have been grouped into 21 regional clusters, the largest
being in Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana.

<HEADLINE> McCain S.C. Campaign Leader Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER HOLLAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The co-chairman of Sen. John McCain's presidential
campaign in South Carolina has resigned, saying he wants no part of the attacks
over Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're growing into a national media vendetta that I cannot associate my
name to,'' state House Speaker Pro Tem Terry Haskins, a Bob Jones alumnus, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has criticized Bush's Feb. 2 speech at the Christian school and has
tried to portray the Texas governor as a captive of religious conservatives and
as anti-Catholic for appearing there. The school's leaders have criticized the
Pope and have called the Catholic church a ``Satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush apologized for the visit in a letter to Catholic leaders on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Haskins said the attacks were vicious and unjustified.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People at Bob Jones are not racist and they don't hate Catholics,'' he
said. ``No doubt Bob Jones University holds religious beliefs that are outside
the mainstream and unpopular. But the public lynching of this college has
created an environment which threatens the freedom for any individual or group
in America to hold unpopular religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
	   University spokesman Jonathan Pait said officials would no longer comment on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, former Gov. Carroll Campbell, Bush's top backer in the state,
suggested he holds no grudges against McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While we all say things in the heat of battle that upon further reflection
we may regret, once it's over I know that we are among friends and we all want a
president of whom we can be proud,'' Campbell said in a letter to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides said the comments amounted to the second apology from the Bush
camp in as many days for the campaign in South Carolina. Bush won the state's
Republican presidential primary this month with strong help from Christian
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's comment: ``It's entertaining.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel OKs Dorm Sprinkler Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A Senate committee Monday endorsed a bill requiring
every college dorm room in New Jersey to be equipped with fire suppression
sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall University, the site of a Jan. 19 fire that claimed three lives
and left six students critically injured, had no sprinklers in its dorm rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill passed by the Law and Public Safety Committee calls for the state
to spend $50 million for the sprinklers, part of which would be a loan schools
must repay, and set the deadline at two years. The full Senate will vote on the
proposals later.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1991 law required room-based sprinklers in new school dormitories, but
they were not required in older buildings. A study released Monday by the New
Jersey Educational Facilities Authority showed 36,600 beds in college dorm
rooms, or 71 percent of the state's total, are in rooms that are not equipped
with sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall has hired a contractor to install sprinklers in its dorms by
September.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Heeds Gore on Baby's Care  </HEADLINE>
   By PEGGY ANDERSEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Aetna U.S. Healthcare has decided to continue skilled
nursing care for a baby whose case caught Vice President Al Gore's attention,
the company's chief medical officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Evaluation of Ian Malone's case was speeded up due to Gore's interest, Dr.
Arthur Leibowitz said in a telephone interview from Aetna offices in Blue Bell,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't make it a habit of routinely conducting these high-level reviews
on Sunday,'' Leibowitz conceded.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said the same decision would have been made even if the case had not
become an issue in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   During a visit Sunday, Gore -- who made the family a symbol of his call for
stronger appeal rights for those refused coverage by HMOs -- met privately with
Ian's parents, Christine and Dylan Malone, and promised to call Aetna on their
behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without the vice president, Ian would be on his way to an unspeakable
fate,'' Malone, a newspaper graphic artist who was a volunteer for Gore's 1988
presidential campaign, said Monday in an interview. ``We'd completely lost the
battle with Aetna.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said the case shows why patients need a so-called bill of rights. He
had telephoned his thanks to Leibowitz earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's great, and I'm so happy,'' Gore said at a campaign stop in Phoenix.
``But you know what, a couple trying to save the life of their child shouldn't
have to go on national television to have the doctor's orders complied with.''
</P>
<P>
	   The baby, now nearly 6 months old, has brain damage caused by a difficult
birth, his parents say. He suffers seizures, can't swallow and is prone to
choking.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12-hour-a-day, in-home nursing care costs about $300 a day, the Malones
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leibowitz said a reviewer recommended in January that the in-home care be
terminated next month and that the family care for Ian full time.
</P>
<P>
	   But after reviewing the case, Leibowitz said that he and Aetna's senior
medical director decided on Sunday to overrule the reviewer.

<HEADLINE> SEC Head Backs Lower Trading Fees  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt
and a cadre of Wall Street officials voiced support Monday for proposed
legislation that would dramatically reduce stock trading transaction fees
charged to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed bill, which would also slash registration fees paid by
companies planning to issue stock, as well as charges related to mergers and
tender offers, is designed to bring fees collected by the SEC more in line with
the agency's budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the current fee system, the SEC collects about five times more than
its annual budget. The agency raked in $1.7 billion in fees in 1999. It's
budget, meanwhile, came to just $339 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The surplus emerged and grew in the 1990s as stock trading volume increased,
in part due to an explosion in online trading by individual investors. The extra
money goes to the U.S. Treasury Department and is then distributed to other
government programs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The proposed legislation you are considering today achieves meaningful
reductions in fee rates in a comprehensive manner," Levitt told members of the
Senate Banking Committee, which held hearings Monday at the SEC's field office
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill under consideration would alter the fee structure so the agency
would collect fees totaling just twice the agency's annual budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of the Banking Committee, said the only
hurdle facing the bill is convincing voters and their Congressional
representatives that the legislation benefits small investors as well as large
Wall Street trading firms.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is basically a working person issue," Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors stand to save $7 billion over five years if stock trading
transaction fees are reduced in accordance with the proposed legislation, titled
the Competitive Market Supervision Act, Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those savings could be plowed into mutual funds and retirement plans, Gramm
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Levitt, in answer to a question from Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., said
individual investors pay 87 percent of the transaction fees assessed for trading
New York Stock Exchange stocks, and 82 percent of the fees for trading Nasdaq
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Levitt added, however, that he feared some politicians might "demagogue" the
bill by labeling it a tax break for wealthy Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
	   J. Patrick Campbell, chief operating officer of the Nasdaq market, was one
of several Wall Street officials who testified in favor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The fees, Campbell said, "comprise a tax because they are charged in excess
of the governmental purpose for which they were enacted. The excess collections
should be returned to investors to employ toward the continued growth of the
economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from the New York Stock Exchange and three Wall Street trade
organizations -- the Securities Industry Association, the Securities Traders
Association and the Specialists Association -- also testified in support of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Levitt used the hearing to plead his case for additional funding to hire and
retain qualified SEC staffers. The agency has requested a 12 percent budget
increase over 1999. Part of the money will pay for 50 additional employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC chairman has complained that the SEC is losing top employees to
higher paying jobs in the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Monday's Canada News Briefs  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press Note: All dollars are Canadian unless otherwise noted
Canadian Budget Unveiled
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Canadian families expecting tax breaks got an average of $500
worth this year in Monday's budget, where Finance Minister Paul Martin surprised
everyone by ending income-eroding bracket creep.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin unexpectedly re-indexed income taxes to inflation to end the
insidious creep, in which personal incomes rising with inflation pushed
Canadians into higher tax brackets while reducing the value of their tax
credits.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget also came up with about $4.5 billion more for Canada's rusting
military, health, research and roads, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Provinces will get about $1 billion more for health, education and social
programs while more than $3 billion is earmarked for other spending initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   As social transfer payments to the provinces for health and education
continue to rise, they'll reach a cash total this year of $15.5 billion, still
less than before the war on the deficit began in the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin is also cutting corporate taxes by seven percentage points over five
years.

	   Defense Department Gets $1.7 Billion Over Three Years
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The Defense Department got a long-awaited infusion of money
in Monday's budget but it came like a stealth bomber and barely registered as a
blip in Finance Minister Paul Martin's speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense will get about $1.7 billion more over the next three years, a
welcome change from almost a decade of cuts that chopped 25 per cent from the
budget and reduced the ranks to 60,000 uniforms from more than 80,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The military budget, which was close to $12 billion in 1993, is just under
$10 billion this year.
</P>

Brashear Still Suffers From Headaches After Clubbing
</P>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Donald Brashear, sidelined indefinitely
after being clubbed from behind by Boston defenseman Marty McSorley, said Monday
he was still puzzled by the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never thought I'd see a player acting like that toward another player,''
the Vancouver Canucks tough guy told a packed news conference at GM Place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wonder what was going through his mind to do a thing like that, but it
happened,'' added Brashear, speaking at length for the first time since he was
hit in the head a week ago in a game against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
	   Brashear also defended his own on-ice behavior, saying fighting and taunting
is part of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he still suffers from daily headaches and must remain completely
inactive for at least two more weeks before his playing status is reevaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   The rugged six-foot-two 225-pound winger also said he remembered nothing

Ontario Man May Be Deported After Wartime Past Is Disclosed
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- An Ontario man may be forced to leave Canada, after a court
found Monday he hid his wartime past when he entered the country from Germany 46
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Helmut Oberlander obtained his Canadian citizenship fraudulently by
concealing or misrepresenting his wartime service in a German unit responsible
for the murders of more than 91,000 Jews during the Second World War, ruled
Federal Court Judge Andrew MacKay.
</P>
<P>
	   The finding comes almost five years after Oberlander, now 76, was first told
his citizenship would be revoked. It is not subject to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada's immigration minister can now recommend to the cabinet that
Oberlander be stripped of his citizenship as a first step toward deportation.
</P>
<P>
	   Oberlander, who worked for years in construction in the southwestern Ontario
city of Kitchener, has been suspected of participating in the execution of Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   But the court did not make any rulings on the truth of those allegations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urban Intelligence Criticized  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military lacks the intelligence information
needed to fight and function effectively in many cities around the world,
especially in developing countries most likely to harbor future conflicts,
congressional investigators warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent conflicts in Kosovo, Bosnia and Somalia have shown that poor
intelligence about local conditions can lead to greater risks for U.S. forces
and civilians, said the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``U.S. forces currently do not have adequate information ... due to the
lower priority the intelligence community has afforded urban warfare in its
collection efforts,'' the investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting in cities presents very different challenges to military forces
than campaigns in open areas, like the vast expanses of desert in the Persian
Gulf War. Military planners expect that future adversaries might attempt to draw
U.S. forces into dense urban areas to counter the United States' traditional
advantages of superior firepower and mobility.
</P>
<P>
	   Planners need to know in advance which streets and bridges can handle the
weight of the Army's main tanks and fighting vehicles, which tall buildings can
block communications and the location of a city's utilities, transportation and
civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian E. Sheridan, assistant secretary of defense for special operations,
agreed with the investigators' findings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is consensus across the department that significant information and
intelligence shortfalls exist for foreign urban operations,'' he said in a
letter dated Feb. 7. He added that they don't have accurate databases and maps
for a majority of foreign cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the House and Senate subcommittees on military readiness said
they had not yet read the report and couldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Department is completing a study that will identify the
information holes and the specific challenges of urban warfare, Sheridan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators said the military should also be working with the
intelligence community to reexamine their intelligence gathering priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Intelligence Agency's databases are still focused on the
potential battlegrounds of the Cold War and treat developing countries as a low
priority, which leads to problems providing current information.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency was directed in 1994 to create a worldwide urban information
system, but no full-time analysts are working on the project, only four or five
contractors. With the current staff it will take another three or four years
before the system is available for use by U.S. forces, the investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators also found that while the individual military services
have been updating their own plans and training for a shift to more urban
warfare, the different services, like the Army and Marine Corps, need to conduct
joint exercises. Training facilities are also often unrealistic because they
don't include medium-sized and tall buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   Conflicts over the last decade have shown that poor information can hinder
the military. The investigators cited these examples:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Last year in Kosovo, U.S. forces reported that before their arrival they
had outdated terrain information and lacked basic materials such as street maps
of the major cities in their sector.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In Bosnia, it took nearly 18 months to provide U.S. forces with basic
information on city layouts and the location of key facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   -- When U.S. troops went to Somalia in the early 1990s, they had only
outdated information on the country's culture, people, clan structure and the
possible threats these presented.

	   FORT DAVIS, Texas (AP) -- John Govy Prude, whose family runs a century-old
ranch that attracts thousands of tourists to the remote Davis Mountains each
year, died Thursday. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Prude Ranch, the man known as ``Big Spurs'' embraced both the tourism
and cattle businesses, managing a small herd of about 100 while always remaining
ready to play the gracious host.
</P>
<P>
	   Prude's parents, Andrew and Ora, established the ranch in the late 1890s.
</P>
<P>
	   After the stock market crash of 1929, the family had to sell cattle and
land, diminishing the ranch to its present-day 5,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
	   The ranch was declared a Texas historical site in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Senegal Leader, Rival Said in Runoff  </HEADLINE>
   By GLENN McKENZIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Senegal's incumbent president and his main rival
appeared headed for a runoff election Monday, with partial returns showing both
candidates had failed to win an outright majority in the country's presidential
election, a senior electoral official said.
</P>
<P>
	   A provisional ballot count showed President Abdou Diouf and veteran
opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade on top among the eight candidates who competed
in the election on Sunday, said the Interior Ministry official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He said each failed to gain more than 50 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The official declined to give voting figures and said a final tally would
not be available until later in the week. Those returns must then be approved by
the country's high court next week.
</P>
<P>
	   A runoff between Wade and Diouf would be the first ever in Senegal, where
the ruling Socialist Party has held power since independence from France in
1960.
</P>
<P>
	   Senegal over the years has allowed regular elections, which the Socialist
Party easily has won. It is rare for ruling parties in Africa -- which control
campaign funds and often electoral authorities -- to lose power through the
polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Diouf released figures late Monday showing the president garnered
43 percent of some 1.6 million votes counted. Wade had 30 percent, and other
candidates were trailing with lower percentages.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm the figures, and opposition
candidates were not available for comment. Nearly 2.7 million voters were
registered for the vote, but it was unclear how many actually cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   An official in Wade's camp, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his
candidate was leading in the country's two biggest cities -- Dakar and nearby
Thies -- which account for 40 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Wade, who has accused Diouf of rigging earlier votes, warned Monday morning
that Senegal would explode in popular revolt if the president retains power.
</P>
<P>
	   Diouf ``is aware if he declares himself winner, there will be clashes in the
country, demonstrations and violence,'' Wade told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   If Senegal plunges into violence so soon after the December military
takeover in nearby Ivory Coast -- another traditional bastion of African
stability -- Western diplomats worry it could trigger a flight of development
assistance and trade from the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   International observers gave a thumbs-up to Senegal's presidential
elections, saying scattered violence and logistical problems failed to tarnish
voting in one of Africa's oldest democracies.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of observers from French-speaking nations, however, declined to
predict whether the count would be entirely fair, or the results accepted by
voters in this country of 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   Ide Oumarou, leader of the French-speaking delegation, said observers noted
relatively few problems during Sunday's voting, which he called smooth and fair.
</P>
<P>
	   While many African countries hold elections, very few of those votes are
considered truly free and fair. In West Africa, where votes often take place
against the backdrop of military coups and civil wars, Senegal is one of few
countries to hold regular ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   Scattered attacks by separatist rebels marred voting in the southern
Casamance region, and there was at least one brawl reported Sunday between rival
political supporters in the capital, Dakar.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Diouf and Wade claimed to be ahead earlier Monday, though both also
conceded they might not win an outright majority.

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers To Vote on Pork Ads  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hog farmers will get a chance to vote on whether to keep
paying the fees that fund the "other white meat" advertising campaign for pork,
the government announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said he had the legal authority to call
the referendum even though his department didn't validate sufficient signatures
on petitions that were submitted by farmers who oppose paying the fees, or
"checkoffs."
</P>
<P>
	   There has not been a referendum on the pork program since it was created 14
years ago. Opponents of the $48 million program, which pays for research as well
as advertising, say it has done little to stimulate pork consumption and mostly
benefits meat processors and large, corporate farm operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a matter of basic fairness, I believe that producers deserve the
opportunity to vote on this checkoff program," Glickman said in a speech to the
National Farmers Union in Salt Lake City, Utah. "It is, after all, a mandatory
assessment, akin to a tax, that all producers must pay even if they disagree
with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman was immediately criticized by the National Pork Producers Council,
which receives funding from the fee and questions his authority to order a
referendum on his own.
</P>
<P>
	   The referendum hurts "bonafide pork producers who created a program that
truly works to benefit pork producers of all types and sizes," said John McNutt,
president of the council and an Iowa farmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Under government rules, Glickman would have been required to call a
referendum if the petitions submitted to the Agriculture Department last year
contained at least 14,986 signatures, or 15 percent of all producers. USDA
officials used a sampling process to validate the petitions but couldn't verify
a sufficient number of names.
</P>
<P>
	   The fee is pay 45 cents for every $100 of a pig's value when it is sold. The
money goes to the quasigovernmental National Pork Board, which contracts
promotional services through the National Pork Producers Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the program say they get little for the fees. Pork consumption
has been relatively flat despite the advertising, rising from 51.5 pounds per
person in 1985 to 53.4 pounds last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is all about the democratic process ... and the right of hog farmers
and other producers to vote on whether the checkoff programs are working for
them," said Rhonda Perry, a Missouri hog producer who opposes the pork program.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA also is being petitioned to a hold a referendum on the beef promotion
program. The disputes over the two promotion programs reflect a growing division
in U.S. agriculture between the interests of large and small-scale producers.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Rise in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks bounced back moderately early Tuesday in
reaction to an overnight recovery on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar was higher
against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 40.12 points, or 0.20
percent, to 19,760.22 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the
average closed down 97.79 points, or 0.49 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 109.64 yen, up 0.44 yen from late in Tokyo and also above
its late New York level of 109.37 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started higher Tuesday as investors were cheered
by gains in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 176.53, or
1.79 percent, to 10,038.65 at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stocks are firmer, but trading volumes are very light so far," said
Hiriochi Nishi, an equities manager at Nikko Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders say that stocks are likely to remain in a narrow range Tuesday, as
players are poised to adjust positions and reshuffle portfolios before closing
their books for February.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 8.17 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,720.27 points. The TOPIX
closed up 3.94 points, or 0.23 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar was steady as the euro moved higher against
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.37 yen in early Tuesday, up
from 105.37 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8050
percent from Monday's finish of 1.8200 percent. Its price rose 0.12 point to
99.95. (km-dj)

<HEADLINE> 20 Argentines To Be Tried in Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Twenty Argentines will be tried as
accomplices in the 1994 bombing attack that leveled a Buenos Aires Jewish
community center and killed 86 people, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Judge Juan Galeano said in his ruling that that the search for the
planners of the bombing would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The investigation has not ended,'' Galeano said. ``On the contrary, we are
sending to trial those people believed to be associated with policemen whose
activity could have had an effect'' on the bombing, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors are calling for the death sentence for six of the men named
Monday: a car thief and five provincial police officers known to deal in stolen
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Those men are suspected of preparing the Renault van investigators say was
later used in the attack outside the Asssociation of Argentine Jewish Mutual
Societies in downtown Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
	   The other 14 -- including 10 police officers -- are charged with lesser
crimes in connection with the bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   No court date has been announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Galeano, the lead investigator in the case, has blamed Iran for the bombing,
a charge Tehran has vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack on Jul. 18, 1994 flattened the country's largest Jewish community
center, killing 86 people and injuring hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
	   It came two years after the bombing of the Isreali embassy, which killed 29
people in the Argentine capital. No arrests have been made that bombing.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Independent Voters Surge  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUG WILLIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California voters have registered as independents
in record numbers even though the Democratic and Republican parties will ignore
their votes in the March 7 presidential primaries, new state figures show.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Decline to state,'' -- as independents are listed on election rolls -- has
risen to 2.1 million voters from 1.6 million in 1996, when state election law
was changed to allow them vote in the primary, the Secretary of State's Office
said.
</P>
<P>
	   More significantly, the number of independents rose by 77,145 in the month
before the Feb. 7 registration deadline, while the number of registered
Republicans rose by 21,578 and Democrats declined by 91,516.
</P>
<P>
	   The new totals are 6.7 million Democrats, 5.1 million Republicans, 2.1
million independents and 639,000 scattered among five minor parties. The state
now has 14.6 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Records do not indicate how many changed their registration and how many are
new voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Independent and crossover votes will count in the overall vote next Tuesday,
but state law lets Democrats and Republicans count only ballots cast by voters
in their respective parties when awarding delegates to the national conventions.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the state's number of eligible voters has risen by 1.8 million, to
21.2 million, since the 1996 presidential primary, the new total of registered
voters is up only 103,000.
</P>
<P>

Bradley in the Democratic race and Gov. George W. Bush ahead of McCain in the
Republican race.

<HEADLINE> Teen Accused in Shooting Apologizes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A suburban Atlanta teen-ager accused of shooting six
classmates in the halls of his high school last spring apologized in a letter
released Monday and said he wished he ``could take every minute of it back.''
</P>
<P>
	   Portions of the letter from T.J. Solomon, 16, were read during a televised
interview with his parents. It was the first time they had spoken publicly about
their son's arrest and the shootings that wounded six students at Heritage High
School.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes it feels lonely to be in here,'' the teen-ager wrote from the
jail where he is awaiting trial as an adult. ``If I could undo what I did to get
in here, I would. I am truly sorry for what I did last year and wish that I
could take every minute of it back.''
</P>
<P>
	   Solomon summarized his emotions in the days before the May 20 attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is hard to describe how dark and isolated I felt leading to the date of
my mistake,'' Solomon wrote. ``It almost made everything in my life not worth
waiting for.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I always thought to myself that if I could put everything I was feeling
away, somewhere inside of me, that I would be fine until my emotions were too
much for me to bear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Solomon's mother, Mae Dean Daniele, told Atlanta's WSB-TV it's ``hard to
think that your child can reach this type of a point in his life when it is so
meaningless to him. ... I had no idea on May 20 that my child was that ill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I watched him walk to the school bus, and I thought we had the perfect
life.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said she was at work when she heard about the shootings and went home,
where the district attorney called her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said he had T.J. and explained what T.J. had done. I couldn't believe
my son could do this. The whole life I knew didn't exist,'' Daniele said.
</P>
<P>
	   Solomon's attorneys have argued that the teen-ager belongs in a mental
institution, but the Georgia Court of Appeals ruled that he was not out of touch
with reality at the time of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   During an August hearing to decide whether Solomon should be tried as an
adult, an agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation described a note found
under Solomon's bed that made references to the Columbine High School massacre
and in which Solomon apparently wrote that he had been planning the attack for
years.
</P>
<P>
	   A state-appointed psychologist also testified at the hearing that Solomon
told him six days after the shooting that he didn't want to kill anyone and
``just wanted to cause a big panic.''
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted on all counts, Solomon could be sentenced to more than 350
years in prison. A trial date has not been set.

<HEADLINE> Gore Ridicules GOP 'Identity Crisis'  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- While Bill Bradley steeled himself against potential
disappointment in the Northwest, Democratic rival Al Gore campaigned Monday as
if he were already his party's nominee, ridiculing the Republicans' ``huge
identity crisis.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who has invested nearly a week in Washington state in preparation
for Tuesday's nonbinding primary there, said in Seattle, ``I knew it would be
difficult and it has been.''
</P>
<P>
	   He promised to plow ahead to the March 7 ``Super Tuesday'' primaries no
matter what.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, popping into Colorado for 16 hours, accused all the other candidates
of ignoring the state. Meanwhile, he ignored Bradley as he campaigned in
sunshine and spring-like breezes under the open-air, arched glass pavilion of
the Denver Performing Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans ``don't know who they are,'' the vice president said,
offering his take on the nomination battle between John McCain and George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he shares McCain's views on ``some things ... campaign finance
reform and taking on the tobacco companies and taking on special interests.''
But both Republican contenders would try to destroy abortion rights, he
contended.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans want to pander to the right-wing extremists and get the
government to come in and order a woman to do what the right wing says is the
right thing,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even as he campaigned in Denver and Pueblo -- and late Monday in Phoenix --
Gore kept an eye over his shoulder on Washington state. From his Denver hotel
suite, he phoned in five drive-time interviews to radio stations in Seattle. His
campaign manager, Donna Brazile, was staying in the state until the voting gets
under way.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has hoped for an invigorating -- if symbolic -- win in Washington on
Tuesday. He said on Monday, during a visit to a women's health center, ``If we
win overwhelmingly, it would send a message. But I didn't come here expecting we
would do that. I knew it would be difficult and it has been.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley started the day before dawn in Seattle, searching for votes among
commuters at the ferry terminal. He left state on a high note after a rainy but
spirited rally at the University of Washington that drew about 1,000 supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that whatever happens on Tuesday is ``not determinate of March 7.''
</P>
<P>
	   From Washington, Bradley headed to California for a day-and-a-half courtesy
call. Gore leads by a whopping 5-to-1 margin in the latest polls gauging
California's March 7 jackpot primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Bradley sounded hopeful about California.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People make up their mind in the last week. We're going to continue to
reach out as the reform candidate. Be the only reform candidate on the
Democratic side in a year where reform is a key thing. I think it's an important
consideration,'' he told KPIX-TV after arriving in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   After California, Bradley planned to turn his focus for the final days
before ``Super Tuesday'' to New York and New England, where he has shown
stronger appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore made only a brief visit to Colorado, which has 51 Democratic delegates
up for grabs in its March 10 primary. Standing on the back of a pickup truck at
a rally in Pueblo, Colo., where a gray-haired woman held a sign saying ``Gore is
a babe,'' the vice president reminisced about visiting the city with his young
wife Tipper just after he returned from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We put a tent in the back of our Chevrolet and camped in the Great Sand
Dunes,'' which Gore said should be made a national park.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the brevity of his appearance, he told Denver's KMGH-TV, ``This is a
place I've spent a lot of time in. I don't know why the other candidates have
been ignoring Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
	   He confided to Seattle's KNDD that he sometimes plays the harmonica, but
declined to prove it on the air. ``It might depress the voter turnout
tomorrow,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   In Phoenix, Gore headlined a fund-raiser for the Democratic Party's national
and congressional 2000 campaigns. ``I want you to vote for good Democrats for
Congress -- House and Senate -- all the way up and down the line,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Solo Balloonist Reaches Africa  </HEADLINE>
   By KATE N. GROSSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- American engineer Kevin Uliassi was soaring high over Africa
on Monday, the seventh day of his quest to become the first person to circle the
globe alone in a hot air balloon.
</P>
<P>
	   As Uliassi, 36, approached Mauritania, the volunteers at his flight center
in the Chicago suburb of Homewood ran into trouble trying to communicate with
French-speaking air traffic controllers in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi's mother quickly called his former high school and, within 15
minutes, a French teacher was in the command center ready to translate, flight
spokesman Scott Lorenz said.
</P>
<P>
	   By Monday evening, Uliassi was floating 30,000 feet above Mali, about 6,200
miles from his liftoff point near Rockford, Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Pete Fay, another flight spokesman, expects Uliassi to spend about three
days crossing Africa. The projected flight path takes him over Niger and through
parts of Chad, Libya and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   Fay said Uliassi has clearance to pass over those countries and others in
Africa, including Sudan, before heading toward Saudi Arabia. The flight command
center has Arabic, Chinese and Indian interpreters ready to help, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi picked up speed Monday as he moved closer to a fast-moving jet
stream, Lorenz said. As Uliassi travels across Africa, Lorenz expects the
balloon to reach speeds of around 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi says he has been in good spirits, chatting on the phone with crew
members, family and friends and enjoying the solitude. He is traveling in an
enclosed 7-by-5-foot capsule attached to a 124-foot balloon made up of two nylon
compartments -- one containing helium and the other hot air.
</P>
<P>
	   His food is stored outside the balloon, where the temperature is about 2
degrees below zero. He's feasted on roast beef with garlic, red pepper and Swiss
chard, prepared by his mother. But he admitted the altitude might be affecting
his sense of taste.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Peanut butter and cheese kind of taste the same to me up here -- that's
very odd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi, an engineer and architect who grew up in the Chicago area but now
lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., is on his second around-the-world attempt. On his
first flight in 1997, the bottom of his balloon ruptured over Chicago's O'Hare
airport and he was forced down in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi has been chasing the solo title along with several other balloonists
over the last few years. Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett has gone the
farthest. Fossett broke his own distance record in 1998, traveling more than
15,200 miles before a storm damaged his balloon, sending it plunging into the
sea off Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   Last March, balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones became the first to
circle the world nonstop in a hot air balloon.
</P>
<P>
	   Uliassi's second attempt has gone fairly smoothly, said his wife, Renee
Uliassi, after whom the balloon is named. His biggest scare was a series of
storm systems last week that kept him up for 28 hours.

<HEADLINE> Polls: McCain Trails Among GOP  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain has grown more popular with the public
as Gov. George W. Bush's popularity has slipped, but the Arizona senator faces
an uphill climb to get the Republican presidential nomination, polls suggest.
</P>
<P>
	   Two-thirds of Americans have a favorable view of McCain, according to a
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Monday, while about a fifth have an
unfavorable view. Just under six in 10 said they have a favorable view of Bush,
the Texas governor, while a third view him unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's popularity has been rising in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup and ABC
News-Washington Post polls in the last few months while Bush's popularity has
been slipping. McCain's favorable rating has gone up 24 points in the
ABC-Washington Post poll to 60 percent, while Bush's has slipped 20 points in
that poll to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush still leads McCain in the voting preferences of Republicans and those
leaning Republican nationally, 57 percent to 33 percent in the CNN-USA
Today-Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's unexpectedly strong challenge to Bush has raised public interest in
the campaign, according to Thomas Patterson, acting director of the Shorenstein
Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy. The Center is conducting an
ongoing voter survey that has found interest in the election surging, with more
than half of Americans paying at least some attention to the campaign and a
quarter paying close attention. Before the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1, six
of 10 said they were paying little or no attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The excitement surrounding the McCain candidacy is a major reason for the
shift,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain is fast approaching a day of reckoning for his candidacy, despite
the public enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
	   After contests Tuesday in Virginia, Washington state and North Dakota,
McCain will face a tougher challenge in California, New York and several other
states where only GOP votes will determine who gets delegates to the national
convention. Bush generally leads McCain among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest prize, 162 delegates from California on March 7, could prove a
major obstacle for McCain, who remains 20 points behind Bush among California
Republicans in a new Field poll.
</P>
<P>
	   When McCain and Bush are measured on public perception of their leadership
qualities in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, two-thirds said McCain is ``sincere
and authentic'' and a ``strong and decisive leader.'' Just over half said Bush
is ``sincere and authentic'' and six in 10 said he was a ``strong and decisive
leader.''
</P>
<P>
	   More people said McCain was not a typical politician, 48 percent, than
typical, 42 percent, while just a third said Bush is not a typical politician.
</P>
<P>
	   On personal traits, half in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll said Bush is smug,
people were split on whether he says one thing and does another and more than
half said he goes too far in criticizing his opponents. More than half said
McCain is not smug, that he does not say one thing and do another and about half
said he does not go too far in criticizing opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   Just half in the ABC-Washington Post poll say Bush is running a positive
campaign, while six of 10 said that of McCain and two-thirds said it of Democrat
Al Gore. Bush's ranking as ``a true conservative'' has gone up in the
ABC-Washington Post poll, however, with almost two-thirds saying that now,
compared to about half in January. Just under half said that of McCain, while
more than a third disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is about 15 points ahead of Gore in a possible November matchup among
registered voters in both polls. Bush is about 6 points ahead of Gore among
registered voters in both polls.
</P>
<P>
	   The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 1,004 adults taken Friday through Sunday
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points, larger for subgroups
like Democrats and Republicans. The ABC-Washington Post poll of 1,203 adults was
taken Thursday through Sunday has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage
points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Pushes for Milosevic Ouster  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. envoy Carl Bildt warned Monday that there is
virtually no prospect for peace in the Balkans until Slobodan Milosevic is no
longer Yugoslavia's leader.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bildt told the Security Council that the international community cannot
sit around and wait for a new regime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we do that, we might well be faced with further conflicts,'' he said.
``We must actively seek change. We must meet the provocations that are there and
actively try to prevent existing tension from boiling over into open conflict.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister who was the international community's
top representative in Bosnia and now serves as Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
special envoy for the Balkans, cited a number of flashpoints.
</P>
<P>
	   As long as there is no change of regime in Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro
``are set on a somewhat slow but very steady collision course,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Milosevic has grossly misused the federal institutions and
grossly violated the rights of Montenegro within that federation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bildt called for accelerated international help for the people of Montenegro
who suffer from ``double sanctions'' -- against Yugoslavia as a whole and de
facto sanctions from Serbia forcing them to rely on expensive food imports.
</P>
<P>
	   Southern Serbia, which is home to between 70,000 and 80,000 ethnic
Albanians, and eastern Kosovo, especially Mitrovica, are also flashpoints, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgrade must be told firmly to keep its special police out of Kosovo, he
said. At the same time, armed Kosovo Albanian groups ``that are obviously
operating across the border'' in Serbia must be told to stop, Bildt said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are both playing with fire and that message should be loud and
clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The larger issue in the Balkans is the conflict between extremists who want
to destroy the fabric of societies and those who want integrated, multiethnic
communities, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because those extremists still have the upper hand, it is imperative for the
international community to resume the search for peace starting in Kosovo, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Time might not yet be ripe for more concrete moves, but time is certainly
ripe for discussion on the core issues,'' Bildt said.
</P>
<P>
	   He stressed that the international community can't make peace without
Yugoslavia nor can it talk about regional issues without taking in Serbia. But
Milosevic and other key political and military leaders indicted by the
international war crimes tribunal ``are de facto excommunicated from any sort of
dialogue or diplomatic contact,'' Bildt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, he reiterated that the search for peace must go on.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Mayors Freed Until Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By SELCAN HACAOGLU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) -- Thousands of people celebrated Monday -- some
tossing red carnations and others freeing white doves -- after three mayors were
released from prison pending trial on charges of aiding Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   The show of support in Turkey's largest Kurdish-majority city ended when
police wearing steel helmets charged into one crowd, beating people with wooden
clubs. The demonstrators fled into side streets, where they were chased by
policemen on motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayors -- Feridun Celik of Diyarbakir, Selim Ozalp of Siirt and
Feyzullah Karaaslan of Bingol -- were arrested last week after meeting with
European officials to discuss cultural rights for Kurds. They have been charged
with aiding Abdullah Ocalan's outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the
PKK.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interior Ministry ruled late Monday night that the mayors could return
to their posts. The mayors were expected to return to their posts within the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
	   The three, however, were barred from leaving the country until their trial,
a second court announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   At a press conference in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the overwhelmingly
Kurdish southeast, Celik sounded defiant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to work for our people and for Turkey. No one can stop us,'' he
said. ``If throwing us in prison will bring peace then we will serve 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ozalp echoed Celik's tone. ``If our imprisonment will bring peace, we are
ready even for death,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The three mayors belong to the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party. Both
the rebels and the pro-Kurdish party are demanding that Kurds are granted
cultural rights, such as the right to broadcast and teach in Kurdish.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrests triggered a wave of protests from European nations, who say
Turkey must grant cultural rights to Kurds if it ever hopes to join the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
	   The German Foreign Ministry on Monday welcomed the release of the mayors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are innocent,'' defense lawyer Fethi Gumus said outside the prison
before the mayors' release. ``There is no solid evidence against them, only
fictitious allegations from an informant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Informants reportedly told police that the mayors gave money and municipal
jobs to guerrillas and their relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Celik denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Ethem Ucan ordered the mayors released, ruling that they were unlikely
to flee or tamper with evidence. But he said they must stand trial on charges
that could put them in prison for up to 7 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The three were barred from leaving the country until their trial, a second
court announced Monday. But the Interior Ministry ruled late Monday that the
mayors could take up their posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors are pushing for the closure of the party, saying it is a front
for the rebels. The PKK has said it is laying down its weapons and is looking to
become a legitimate political organization within Turkey. Turkey has said it
will never talk with the rebels.

Gore Ridicules GOP 'Identity Crisis'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Al Gore campaigned today as if he were already the Democratic
Party's presidential nominee, ridiculing the Republicans' "huge identity
crisis." The Republicans "don't know who they are," the vice president said,
offering his take on the GOP nomination battle between John McCain and George W.
Bush. Gore said he shares McCain's views on "some things ... campaign finance
reform and taking on the tobacco companies and taking on special interests." But
both Republican contenders would try to destroy abortion rights, he contended.

Austria's Freedom Party Leader Steps Down
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austrian right-wing leader Joerg Haider resigned as
head of the Freedom Party today, seen by some as a way to end his country's
international ostrascism. The outrage was based on Haider's anti-immigrant stand
and his past praise of World War II veterans of Germany's murderous Waffen SS
and Adolf Hitler's "orderly" employment policies. Haider holds no post in the
national government, But his image and his iron-hand control of the Freedom
Party made him the most visible member of the Austrian political establishment,
eclipsing his governing coalition partners, the center-right Austrian People's
Party of Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel.

Fringe Group, Nation of Islam Ally

	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A day after Louis Farrakhan called for reconciliation among
American Muslims, the Nation of Islam drove a further wedge between itself and
mainstream Jews by aligning itself with a fringe Jewish group that opposes the
state of Israel. Nation of Islam leaders held a news conference today with
leaders of the Neturei Karta International, a tiny Orthodox Jewish group that
says the Holocaust was punishment for Zionist Jews who called for the

U.S. Urban Intelligence Criticized
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military lacks the intelligence information
needed to fight and function effectively in many cities around the world,
especially in developing countries most likely to harbor future conflicts,
congressional investigators warned today. Recent conflicts in Kosovo, Bosnia and
Somalia have shown that poor intelligence about local conditions can lead to
greater risks for U.S. forces and civilians, said the General Accounting Office,
the investigative arm of Congress. Fighting in cities presents very different
challenges to military forces than campaigns in open areas, like the vast
expanses of desert in the Persian Gulf War.

Landmark Conviction in Web Gambling
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man who operated a sports betting business on the
Internet was convicted by a federal jury today in what is believed to be the
first case of its kind to go to trial. The jury in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan concluded that Jay Cohen, 33, broke a federal law by accepting bets
and wagers on sports events over the Internet and telephone. Cohen, president of
World Sports Exchange in Antigua, was among 22 defendants charged in March 1998
with operating offshore companies that took bets from Americans via the Internet
or toll-free telephone numbers. Federal law prohibits the use of the Internet
for sports betting and makes it a crime to use interstate telephone lines for
gambling.

Need for Hacker Laws Downplayed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even amid dramatic attacks by cyber vandals on some of
the Internet's flagship Web sites, the nation's technology industry appears
reluctant to ask Congress for new or expanded anti-hacker measures. The industry
appears to be maintaining its traditional reluctance against inviting government
into its affairs, even in its defense against hackers and online vandals. Those
sentiments, expected to be delivered to lawmakers at a congressional hearing
Tuesday, illustrate the gulf between Washington and the high-tech industry
beyond the 2,400 miles physically separating the epicenters of the two cultures.

Yanks' Strawberry Suspended 1 Year
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Yankee's outfielder Darryl Strawberry today was
suspended from baseball for one year because he tested positive last month for
cocaine. Baseball commissioner Bud Selig did not make any provision for
Strawberry to return early from the suspension. It was Strawberry's third
cocaine-related suspension from baseball. The eight-time All-Star, who turns 38
next month, had been counted on by the Yankees as their main designated hitter
this season. Given Strawberry's age, it's unclear if he ever will return to the
game that made him famous.

students pelted him with stones at the West Bank's Bir Zeit University for
making the comment about the acts of Lebanese guerrillas fighting Israeli
occupation forces in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   The Socialist Party, to which Jospin belongs, portrayed the incident as a
step toward truth-telling in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Socialist Party does not regret what was said,'' First Secretary
Francois Hollande said Monday on French radio. ``This movement (Hezbollah)
needed to be characterized for what it is: a movement unfavorable to the peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe,'' he continued, ``there is a moment in international life when
one must say what one thinks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Upon his return to France, Jospin also faced what Agriculture Minister Jean
Glavany said was a ``Parisian tempest over a word'' for the remark targeting
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents said he had been irresponsible in dabbling with France's delicate
Middle East diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident unleashed passions in the Middle East. Some 5,000 people
demonstrated in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley Monday, and 150 students protested in the
southern port city of Tyre. On Sunday, some 3,000 protesters demonstrated in
Sidon.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss urged France not to equate ``the attacker
and the attacked.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chirac passed his own message to the Lebanese through the visiting deputy
speaker of the French Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``France's firm policy toward Lebanon has not changed,'' Gerard Larche said
after meeting Monday with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Hoss.
</P>
<P>
	   France, a former colonial ruler in Lebanon, has long supported Lebanon in
its effort to get Israeli troops to withdraw from the southern strip of the
country. More generally, Paris has worked to be perceived as a friend of the
Arabs without abandoning Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin's comment led to the first serious confrontation with President
Jacques Chirac, a conservative sharing power with a leftist coalition government
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The French head of state, traditionally in charge of foreign policy, said by
phone to Jospin that the balance and impartiality on which French diplomacy is
built had been put in doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin was expected to come under fire during Tuesday's question period at
the National Assembly and again Wednesday at a scheduled meeting with Chirac.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin has been seen as a likely candidate in presidential elections in
2002, possibly against Chirac.
</P>
<P>
	   Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, on Monday condemned
the stoning attack on Jospin, criticizing the behavior of the rioting
Palestinian students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this is the most horrible way of doing politics,'' Prodi, who
heads the EU's executive arm, said at a joint news conference with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Cuba Spy Faces Deadline  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- An alleged Cuban spy permitted into Canada after being
expelled from the United States stayed inside the Cuban Embassy on Monday as the
time limit on his two-day transit visa ran down.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Jose Imperatori, 46, would
become an illegal alien if he remained in Canada beyond the two-day limit
allowed by the visa granted Imperatori upon his arrival in Montreal on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 10 p.m. EST Monday, Imperatori remained in Cuba's embassy in Ottawa
and there was no word on when he would leave.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was taken into custody by U.S. authorities and flown to Montreal
aboard a U.S. government plane late Saturday. He had been expected to leave
Canada for Havana on Sunday, but did not do so. Even his family members in Cuba
said they weren't sure when he would arrive home.
</P>
<P>
	   Axworthy said Canada wanted no role in the latest diplomatic fracas between
Cuba and the United States, and refused to specify what would happen if
Imperatori refused to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll have to see if the Cuban authorities live up to their
responsibilities and their basic rules and connections of diplomacy,'' Axworthy
said. ``We were simply providing a courtesy to allow him to transfer back to
Cuba, and we expect them to recognize just exactly what it was.''
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori's wife, Raquel Fundora, and the couple's 3-year-old son returned
to Havana from the United States on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Imperatori resigned his consular position, giving up his
diplomatic immunity, and said he intended to defy the U.S. State Department's
expulsion order so he could contest allegations linking him with U.S.
immigration official Mariano Faget, who has been charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI officials escorted Imperatori, accompanied by his lawyer, from his
suburban Maryland apartment to the plane that flew him to Montreal on Saturday
night. The State Department said he was expelled for not voluntarily leaving by
the appointed time.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials say that they believe the allegations are a smokescreen to
block the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush Trade Barbs  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Accused of dividing his party and helping the
Democrats, John McCain said Monday he was instead trying to expand the GOP to
become ``a party as big as the country we serve.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican presidential rival George W. Bush strongly disagreed, saying of
McCain, ``He is a person who obviously wants to divide people into camps.''
</P>
<P>
	   The comments followed McCain's speech here -- in the headquarters city of
Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition -- accusing some in his party of pandering
to Christian right leaders ``on the outer reaches of American politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The biting remarks were designed to appeal to moderates voting in Virginia,
Washington state and North Dakota on Tuesday, as well as in crucial contests
next week on ``Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, campaigning in Washington, said repeatedly that his rival was trying
to divide the party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain is someone who likes to castigate, not someone who likes to
lead,'' Bush said. ``It's important to unite our party and lead it to victory.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporter Dick Armey, the Republican leader in the House, took a
similar slap at McCain: ``His was not the speech of a coalition-builder and a
unifier, nor was it worthy of a Republican presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain defended his loyalty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been accused of consorting with the wrong sort of people,'' he said
in his speech, a reference to independents and Democrats from whom he has sought
support in open GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have always acted in what I believe to be the best interests of my
country,'' he said. ``And I always believed that what is good for America is
good for the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some prefer to build walls and exclude newcomers from our support,'' he
said. ``Apparently appeals to patriotism can only be heard by card-carrying
Republicans, and only certain Republicans at that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also said the McCain camp was trying to divide the party along
religious lines by making telephone calls in primary states linking Bush to
anti-Catholic sentiments at Bob Jones University, a South Carolina school
accused of religious bigotry. The McCain campaign said calls like those made
before Michigan's primary were being made in Washington state, but not in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain is running a stealth campaign, saying one thing and doing
another. He's playing the religious card,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said the Bush people were the religious dividers, telephoning voters
to ``distort by pro-life positions and smear the reputations of my supporters.''
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP race has focused on religious issues in recent days, with Bush
expressing his regrets on Sunday to Catholic leaders for his visit to Bob Jones
on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush waited too long.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His words are fine,'' said McCain. ``To me they should have been said
three weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   There also were reverberations from McCain's decision not to take part in a
debate on Thursday. McCain blamed Bush, arguing that Bush was initially evasive
about accepting the debate invitation.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said, given the delay, he scheduled events in New York that can't be
changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said, ``I'm sorry that we're not going to have the debate in Los
Angeles. I would be glad to spend the entire time on education.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, in his speech Monday, came to the heart of the religious
conservative movement to criticize its ``self-appointed leaders,'' but he
clearly was aiming at a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a Reagan Republican who will defeat Al Gore,'' McCain said.
``Unfortunately George Bush is a Pat Robertson Republican who will lose to Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   After his speech at a high school in Virginia, where polls put Bush ahead,
McCain headed to Washington where the two are in a tight race.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, polls show Bush leading McCain by as much as 20 percentage
points among likely Republican voters who will choose that state's delegates
March 7, although it put them neck-and-neck in the open primary's popular vote,
which includes independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in California, the Christian Coalition has distributed voter guides
slanted against McCain, showing him on the ``wrong side of several issues dear
to conservatives. The guides say McCain favors federal funding for fetal tissue
research and expanding NATO's role in Eastern Europe and opposes states' rights
to regulate gambling, according to the guides, which say Bush favors each of
those priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   After discussing education with teachers in Bellevue, Wash., Bush said he
was the candidate who wants to stick to issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ronald Reagan didn't point fingers,'' Bush told reporters. ``He never
played to people's religious fears like Senator McCain has shamelessly done.''

<HEADLINE> Two Dead After Ind. Hostage Standoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Ind. (AP) -- A man shot his estranged wife outside their child's
school and took a liquor store manager hostage Monday. The man and manager were
found dead when police stormed the store after a seven-hour standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Gregroy Miller fired a shotgun at Sue Miller, 32, as she dropped their
daughter off at Austin Middle School about 8 a.m, police said. The woman was
slightly injured and the child was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments later, Miller's pickup truck collided with another vehicle a couple
of blocks away and Miller ran about 200 feet to the Main Package Store and took
manager Kenny Ross, 45, hostage. Five people in the other vehicle were treated
for minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller, 34, made a 911 call from the store and was allowed to speak with his
wife. The call ended when the phone went dead, immediately preceded by the
possible sound of a shot being fired, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police surrounded the liquor store and negotiations began. After a long
period without any contact, state police Emergency Response Team members entered
the building about 3 p.m. and discovered the bodies of Miller and Ross. They
refused to say how the two died.
</P>
<P>
	   The Millers apparently were in the middle of getting divorced, said Sgt.
Marv. Jenkins, a spokesman for the Sellersburg post.

<HEADLINE> Leads with 8 grafs to UPDATE with Morris' removal from  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COLLINGSWOOD, N.J. (AP) - Embattled Philadelphia Teamsters Local 115
chief John Morris was ejected from a hearing Monday to determine whether he
should regain control of the local.
<P>
	   Morris was ejected from the hearing after repeatedly interrupting the
proceeding and ignoring warnings, said Don Owens, a spokesman for the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
	   "It deteriorated into a shouting match," Owens said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing began in January but was adjourned without a resolution. It
resumed Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris, accompanied by an advisor, was escorted from the union hall by the
sergeant-at-arms and several Collingswood police officers, Owens said. The
hearing ended a short time later.
</P>
<P>
	   The interruption occurred as Local 115 President Jim Smith testified about
alleged fiscal mismanagement by Morris, Owens said.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point during the testimony, Morris "cocked his finger in the shape of
a gun and made a shooting sound," Owens said. The hearing chairman then ordered
Morris removed, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris could not be reached for comment after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also had to calm a tense verbal confrontation outside the union hall
between Morris' supporters and Teamster international union members who support
his ouster.
</P>
<P>
	   Teamster international union officials expect to complete their case against
Morris when the hearing resumes Tuesday at 8:30 a.m., Owens said. Morris will
then have an opportunity to call rebuttal witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Security was scaled down at the Local 676 union hall in Collingswood where
about 40 union members attended the hearing before a three-member panel. Several
police officers could be seen inside the entrance to the building.
</P>
<P>
	   When the hearings began in January, Collingswood police called in nearly 100
officers, including sharpshooters on rooftops.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's session was the third time the panel has heard testimony in Morris'
removal. The previous hearings were adjourned without resolution and scheduling
conflicts have delayed the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're very cognizant that people want this to wrap up in a timely manner,"
Owens said.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris will get an opportunity to call rebuttal witnesses in his defense. He
has blamed his ouster as a political payback for not backing Teamsters president
James Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoffa signed an emergency order in November removing Morris as
secretary-treasurer of Local 115. Among the charges were allegations that he
bought weapons with union money and intimidated members he considered disloyal.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris, 73, won a federal court ruling that no emergency existed to remove
him without a hearing. Morris founded the 2,700-member local in 1955 and has
been at the helm since then.
</P>
<P>
	   At previous sessions of the union hearing, auditors testified about alleged
mismanagement of union funds. The two witnesses appearing before the panel this
week are expected to give testimony about intimidation, Owens said.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm fighting this thing to the end," Morris said when the hearings began in
January. "I'm going to go on to what I have to do."
</P>
<P>
	   When the testimony is complete, the panel of Teamsters officials - Charles
Byrnes, secretary treasurer of Local 926 in Pittsburgh; Denis Taylor, president
of Local 355 in Baltimore; and Ron McClain, president of Local 147 in Des
Moines, Iowa - will send a letter to Hoffa within 60 days with a recommendation
on whether a trusteeship should be imposed.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Caricaturist 'Dosh' Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Veteran caricaturist Kariel Gardos, whose cartoon character
Srulik became a symbol of Israel as recognizable to his countrymen as Uncle Sam
is to Americans, died of cardiac arrest Monday in Tel Aviv. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
	   Known to generations of Israelis as ``Dosh,'' Gardos created the image of
Srulik as a little boy wearing a floppy sun hat, the ``kova tembel.'' It was
Srulik who reacted every morning to the political events of the previous day in
a cartoon in the daily newspaper Maariv.
</P>
<P>
	   Yosef ``Tommy'' Lapid, once an editor at Maariv and now the head of a small
opposition party in parliament, said Gardos was one of the greatest
caricaturists of the 20th century and had a profound influence on the opinions
of the Israeli public and the actions of politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He created little Srulik, who became the symbol of Israel, just as
Marianne is the symbol of France or Uncle Sam is the symbol of the United
States,'' Lapid said.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in 1922 in Budapest as Karl Gardos, he survived the Holocaust and came
to Israel in 1948, where he changed his first name to Kariel.
</P>
<P>
	   He said many years later that he became a caricaturist because he did not
speak Hebrew when he arrived, and the visual medium enabled him to express
himself without knowing the language.
</P>
<P>
	   He is survived by his common law wife, Tova Pardos, a daughter and a son,
Mickey. Arrangements for his funeral were not announced.

<HEADLINE> Brokers Group Expels LT Lawrence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A self-regulatory brokers' group has expelled from the
securities industry the brokerage firm LT Lawrence &AMP; Co. Inc., its chief
executive officer and its president for allegedly defrauding investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The two LT Lawrence officials have agreed to repay 300 customers a total
$275,000, NASD Regulation announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the firm's compliance officer has agreed in a settlement to pay
a $20,000 fine and to be suspended from the industry for 30 days. The compliance
officer, Mitchell J. Halpern, neither admitted nor denied the regulators'
allegation, made in a September 1998 complaint, that he failed to enforce rules
prohibiting fraudulent conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   NASD Regulation, the enforcement arm of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, said CEO Lawrence Principato and President Todd E. Roberti
had cheated LT Lawrence customers by charging them excessive markups in 350
stock transactions in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Principato and Roberti agreed in a settlement to fully reimburse 300
customers in 37 states and Britain who lost a total $275,000, NASD Regulation
said. The two, who also agreed to be barred from the industry, neither admitted
nor denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're going on with their lives," said their attorney, Ira Lee Sorkin. He
declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Markups are differentials over the prevailing market price for securities.
Regulators consider markups of more than 10 percent to be fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, LT Lawrence's head trader, Thomas J. Dalton, settled a related
disciplinary action by agreeing to a $40,000 fine and a three-month suspension.
He neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Flap May Put ABC Affiliate Off Air  </HEADLINE>
    By C. BRYSON HULL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Time Warner cable subscribers here could be cut off from
their local ABC affiliate, which has become a pawn in a battle between the media
giant and rival Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney-owned ABC threatened to pull ABC programming from the Time Warner
cable system in Houston, after the companies failed to reach a national deal
over retransmission rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations broke down over The Disney Channel, which, among other things,
ABC wants included in Time Warner's basic cable package, both parties said late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The cable provider balked at converting it from a pay channel, citing a
systemwide cost of $100 million which would be passed to Time Warner customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The impasse came during negotiations for a national retransmission
agreement, in which cable companies provide compensation to over-the-air
networks for the right to broadcast their programming.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreements have been mandated since Congress passed the Cable Act of
1992, which requires cable operators to carry local broadcast affiliates on
their systems.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's vitally important to us that we do get fair value for our content,"
ABC senior vice president and general counsel Alan Braverman said. "We have no
choice. The hardest thing for a broadcaster to do is to disrupt its viewers."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC's motivation is to force Time Warner back to the negotiating table,
Braverman said.
</P>
<P>
	   If no deal can be reached, KTRK-TV in Houston will go off the cable system
as of 12:01 a.m. CST Thursday, when the current retransmission agreement
expires. About 665,000 subscribers would be without ABC programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner spokesman Mike Luftman said ABC pulled a finalized deal off the
table at the last minute and changed its terms.
</P>
<P>
	   "They basically reneged. We think a deal should be a deal, and we cannot
accept a deal that will raise costs by more than $100 million nationwide,"
Luftman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cable company cannot air ABC content once the current retransmission
agreement expires, Luftman said. The deal expired Dec. 31, but ABC extended the
deadline temporarily during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC chose Houston because it would cause the least disruption, since cable
penetration is lower in the nation's fourth-largest city than it is in other
large markets, Braverman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The signal is easy to pick up, and it's a market in which Direct TV and
EchoStar both allow local-to-local channels by satellite," Braverman said.
</P>
<P>
	   To that end, ABC is negotiating with satellite providers to help Houston
customers sign up for new satellite services. Braverman declined to comment on
which satellite providers could be involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner officials said Houston customers are the unfortunate victims in
a power play.
</P>
<P>
	   "I liken it to what happens when a terrorist takes hostages. They will often
pick one out and shoot them just to show they mean business," Luftman said.
"That's apparently what Disney and ABC are going to do to Houston."
</P>
<P>
	   Should KTRK go off the cable system, Time Warner plans to offer HBO Family,
normally a pay channel, in its place at no extra cost to subscribers, Luftman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cable company also plans to provide free antennas to customers who want
to tune in KTRK the old fashioned way -- over the airwaves.

<HEADLINE> Cops in Diallo Case Face Review  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA DE LA CRUZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The four police officers cleared of murdering Amadou Diallo
still face a departmental review that could keep them from ever returning to the
streets.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, who were acquitted on Friday, are all ``decompressing'' and
have not yet decided whether they will seek to return to full duty, their
lawyers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers -- Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard
Murphy -- remain on modified duty, meaning they are assigned to desk jobs and
their badges and guns have been taken away.
</P>
<P>
	   They face possible federal civil rights charges as well as a departmental
review by a board that is looking at such issues as whether the officers
properly identified themselves, stopped Diallo properly and fired only when they
thought force was necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   It could be months before Police Commissioner Howard Safir considers
restoring the officers to full duty or pursuing disciplinary action that could
include dismissal.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers fired 41 bullets at Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building, mistakenly thinking the wallet he was holding was a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, Carroll is ``reflecting and he is trying to decompress,'' said John
Patten, his attorney. ``I just told him chill out, stay calm, be at peace. He
needs to make his thought process become a little clearer first.''
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the three other officers said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He really wants his 15 minutes to be up and he wants to fade back and live
his life,'' said Boss' attorney, Steven Brounstein.
</P>
<P>
	   If they do return to duty, will they be able to do their jobs and would they
be safe on New York City streets? So far, the NYPD thinks it's worth posting
police outside the officers' homes because they've received threats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They may really want to go back to police work and now that they've been
acquitted, feel they have a right to do so,'' said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal
justice professor at the University of South Carolina. ``But rightfully or
wrongfully, they've killed someone. They should go through some serious
psychological testing to see if they're fit for duty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, people upset over the verdict rallied in Baltimore and
Minneapolis. In Baltimore, dozens turned out. In Minneapolis, about 200
protesters rallied at the federal courthouse, saying they wanted to send the
message that police brutality can happen anywhere.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The next 41 could hit you,'' read one placard.
</P>
<P>
	   There were several large protests over the weekend in New York.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chiefs Returner Ass't Indicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A former personal assistant to Kansas City Chiefs
kick returner Tamarick Vanover was one of four men indicted by a federal grand
jury on charges involving an alleged cocaine distribution ring.
</P>
<P>
	   Gregory Burns, Marcus Hammond, Gregory Watson and Roosevelt Williamson were
charged in various counts of an indictment returned under seal by a grand jury
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate indictment Monday, Norbert Scarlett was charged in his alleged
role in the sale and transport of a stolen sport utility vehicle, which has been
linked to Vanover.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictments were unsealed and made public Monday. The indictment of the
four men replaces a federal criminal complaint, filed Jan. 25, which charged
only Burns with one count of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   In an FBI affidavit related to the investigation, Burns has been identified
as Vanover's personal assistant. Vanover has not been charged in the drug
investigation but did plead guilty last week to aiding and assisting in the sale
of a stolen vehicle. Vanover also agreed to cooperate with the investigation by
the FBI and Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Burns was named in an FBI affidavit last month filed in connection with a
federal investigation into what was described as a large cocaine and marijuana
ring that smuggled drugs into Missouri and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Chiefs running back Bam Morris also was mentioned in the FBI
affidavit as being a passenger in a vehicle that was found with a residue of
marijuana after leaving Vanover's driveway. Morris has not been charged.

<HEADLINE> Sparky Anderson May Get Hall of Fame  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN WALKER AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- This could be the year Sparky Anderson actually sets
foot inside the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
	   Third on baseball's career win list and the only manager to win World Series
titles in both leagues, the popular Cincinnati and Detroit skipper seemed sure
to get the call Tuesday from the Veterans Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson twice visited Cooperstown when his teams played there. But he never
toured the shrine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I always made myself a promise that I would never go inside the Hall of
Fame unless I made it,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   Ted Williams, Stan Musial and the rest of the 14-man Vets panel also can
elect a big league player. Results were to be announced at 2 p.m. EST, and
voting looked close: Would it be Bill Mazeroski, Mel Harder or Gil Hodges?
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel like there's a chance, a better chance than last year,'' Mazeroski
said prior to spring training. ``It's just a feeling.''
</P>
<P>
	   In all, the committee can choose one person in each of four categories --
former major leaguers; a combination of managers, umpires, executives and Negro
Leaguers; 19th century players and personnel; and Negro Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey Stearnes, an outfielder who played nearly two decades, looked like
the top candidate among the Negro Leaguers. Outfielder Jimmy Ryan and second
baseman Bid McPhee led the 19th century list.
</P>
<P>
	   It takes 75 percent for election, same as with the Baseball Writers'
Association of America. Tony Perez and Carlton Fisk were elected in January.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vets panel usually has 15 members. Buck O'Neil, however, is not able to
attend this year's meeting because of a minor health problem that prevents him
from traveling.
</P>
<P>
	   If Anderson is picked, it will make for a Red-letter day in Cooperstown on
July 23. Perez, a former Cincinnati first baseman, and Reds broadcaster Marty
Brennaman are being inducted that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm so happy for both of them,'' Anderson said from his home in Thousand
Oaks, Calif. ``I hope for it, but we'll have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
	   There had been talk the Vets were going to pick former manager Dick Williams
over Anderson as the 16th manager in the Hall. But Williams pleaded no contest
after being arrested on an indecent exposure charge in January, and that seems
to have derailed his chances for now.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, who turned 66 last week, is in his first year of eligibility. With
a record of 2,194-1,834, he trails only Connie Mack (3,731) and John McGraw
(2,784) for lifetime victories.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson managed Cincinnati from 1970-78, winning two World Series titles
with the Big Red Machine. He guided Detroit from 1979-95 and won another Series
ring. Along the way, he won two other pennants and a pair of division
championships.
</P>
<P>
	   He is the only manager ever to top two franchises in career wins. That could
present a problem if he's elected -- he's still not sure which cap he'd put on
his Hall plaque.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vets panel also faced a dilemma. Which former big leaguer to pick?
</P>
<P>
	   Ted Williams, an influential voice in the meeting room, was said to be
pushing for Harder, 223-186 lifetime for the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mel Harder was a great pitcher,'' Williams said. ``He had a great
curveball, great control. He was so tough to hit against.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harder is now 90, and some members would like to see him on the Hall
platform this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Judging by some of these other guys that got in, I think I've got a good
chance,'' Harder said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mazeroski, regarded by many as the best fielding second baseman ever, hit
one of the most famous home runs in history. His bottom-of-the-ninth shot lifted
Pittsburgh over the New York Yankees in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Harder, Maz is getting key support. The chairman of the Veterans
Committee is Joe Brown, the Pittsburgh general manager during Maz's entire
career for the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
	   First-time panel member Hank Aaron likes Mazeroski, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Bill Mazeroski should be in the Hall of Fame. If they can show me
a better second baseman, I don't know who he is,'' Aaron said last year. ``He
was one of the most gifted athletes to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hodges has been backed by an intense letter-writing campaign from fans
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The late Brooklyn first baseman hit 370 home runs and also managed the 1969
Miracle Mets to the World Series title. Under panel rules, both accomplishments
can count in his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Oliva also is being considered for the first time. He batted .304 in 15
years with Minnesota and won three batting titles.

<HEADLINE> Capano appeals conviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - A wealthy, politically connected lawyer
convicted of killing his mistress did not get a fair trial because jurors' only
choice was a first-degree murder charge, according to an appeal filed Monday.
<P>
	   Thomas Capano was sentenced to death last March for first-degree murder in
the 1996 killing of Anne Marie Fahey, a secretary to Gov. Tom Carper.
</P>
<P>
	   The 140-page appeal was based on 15 arguments, including a claim that
now-retired Superior Court Judge William Swain Lee erred when he refused to
instruct jurors on lesser charges such as manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   That is important because Capano claimed the killing was an accident.
</P>
<P>
	   "The trial judge made a mistake and should have given the jury more than an
all-or-nothing choice," Capano attorney Joseph Bernstein said after he filed the
appeal brief and its accompanying 563-page appendix.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal claims the jury could have concluded that Capano was criminally
responsible for Fahey's death - but did not try to murder her.
</P>
<P>
	   "The refusal to charge on lesser included offenses improperly skewed the
verdict in favor of first-degree murder," the appeal states.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Hallidy, spokesman for Attorney General Jane Brady, said lawyers for
the state would review the appeal. The state has 30 days to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal seeks to overturn both Capano's conviction and his death
sentence. And if Capano is tried again, Bernstein said he will argue that Capano
should not be eligible for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors contend Capano shot Fahey, then stuffed her body in a cooler,
loaded it on a boat in Stone Harbor, N.J., and dumped it in the Atlantic Ocean.
Without a body or a murder weapon, prosecutors relied on circumstantial evidence
to prove that Capano planned to kill Fahey because she wanted to end their
affair.
</P>
<P>
	   After denying any knowledge of Fahey's death for 2 1/2 years, Capano
admitted at trial that he disposed of Fahey's body. But he said another
mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, accidentally shot Fahey in a jealous, suicidal
rage.
</P>
<P>
	   MacIntyre denied the allegation and testified for the prosecution. Two of
Capano's brothers also testified against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Fahey's body has never been recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   In their appeal, Capano's lawyers also argued that Lee, who is now running
for governor, made a mistake when he let a "parade" of witnesses - including
Fahey's friends, family and therapists - recount statements that Fahey made to
them about her volatile, three-year affair with Capano.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal says this was hearsay and should have not been allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors also improperly questioned Capano during his cross-examination,
the appeal alleges, by asking Capano if other witnesses were lying when their
stories conflicted with his testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   "The clear message of such questions was that it was not the other witnesses
who were lying - it was Capano," the appeal says. "Such questions are deemed
improper because they unfairly suggest to the jury that in order to acquit the
defendant, they must conclude that the state's witnesses have lied."
</P>
<P>
	   Further, the appeal claims that Lee made a mistake by dismissing a juror
without properly investigating a claim that the juror was following news
accounts of the trial and had been expressing opinions about the outcome of the
case.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee interviewed the juror before excusing him from the panel, but did not
talk to any of the other jurors, the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Justice E. Norman Veasey gave Capano's lawyers an extra month to file
the appeal and allowed it to be longer than the 35 pages permitted under state
Supreme Court rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-member defense team, which now includes celebrity lawyer Alan
Dershowitz, took 4 1/2 months to complete the appeal.

<HEADLINE> Sabres 5, Panthers 2  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK LONG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Stu Barnes scored a pair of goals and Dominik Hasek
stopped 30 shots as the Buffalo Sabres beat the Florida Panthers 5-2 on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Panthers lost for the fifth time in six games and finished the month
5-8, their seventh consecutive season with a losing record in February.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sabres got three second-period goals and kept Pavel Bure, the NHL's
leading scorer, quiet for much of the night to drop Florida to 7-11-1 in its
last 19 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Buffalo led 4-0 before Bure got Florida on the board in the second period
with his league-leading 43rd goal. Todd Simpson's third-period goal, his first
of the season, cut the lead to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
	   But Buffalo answered with Richard Smehlik's goal with 11:50 to play and held
off the Panthers' late push. Florida finished 0-for-8 on power plays.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sabres took a 1-0 lead in the first period with a short-handed goal.
Florida's Ray Whitney tried to keep an airborne puck in the offensive zone by
reaching high above his head to snare it. But he missed, starting a 2-on-1 break
the other way.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Peca skated up the right side and crossed the puck to Barnes, who
beat Trevor Kidd at 18:09.
</P>
<P>
	   Buffalo opened a 3-0 lead with a pair of goals in a 1:08 span of the second
period.
</P>
<P>
	   The Panthers misfired on a 3-on-1, and Buffalo's Vaclav Varada found Alexei
Zhitnik -- who had just left the penalty box -- alone at the blue line for a
breakaway goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sabres scored again about a minute later. Erik Rasmussen scored off a
faceoff, skating through the Panthers' defense and beating Kidd at 5:24.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes got his second goal of the night and 16th of the season at 12:45 of
the second. Barnes' first shot rebounded off Kidd's leg and he appeared to push
the puck in with his upper body. Referees initially said it was not a goal, but
reversed the call after reviewing the play.
</P>
<P>
	   The 4-0 lead sent Kidd to the bench. Kidd, 0-2 since returning from a
shoulder injury, was replaced by Mike Vernon.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Forward Rush Reinstated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA forward JaRon Rush's 29-game suspension was reduced
to nine games Monday, making him eligible to play for the Bruins on Saturday
against top-ranked Stanford.
</P>
<P>
	   The NCAA subcommittee on student-athlete reinstatement, responding to UCLA's
appeal of the suspension, informed the university of its decision Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's game at California will be the ninth game of the current
suspension. The Bruins (15-11, 6-8 Pac-10) hope to finish on a winning streak
that will earn them an NCAA tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't get my hopes up too high that he would be back this year," UCLA
coach Steve Lavin said Monday night after Rush worked out at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had a really tough season and this is a huge lift for the team. We're
on a good emotional roll now, with good practices, the two wins against the
Oregon schools, and the return of JaRon."
</P>
<P>
	   The coach said Rush was in relatively good shape and will play Saturday at
Stanford, although he won't start.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is as important a player as we have on our team," Lavin said. "We call
him our double-double man because he got double figures in points and rebounds
in all our big games last year. The whole team is excited to have JaRon back
because they know the adversity he's had this year."
</P>
<P>
	   Rush thanked his teammates, coaches and family for their support and also
thanked athletic director Peter Dalis and assistant athletic director Betsy
Stephenson for their work on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am very happy that the NCAA has reduced my suspension and I am relieved
that this situation is finally over," Rush said in a statement. "I'm looking
forward to being back on the basketball court with my teammates this weekend."
</P>
<P>
	   Dalis also is glad the situation has been resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   "JaRon has been twisting in the wind for a long time, over three months,"
Dalis said.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension stemmed from benefits Rush allegedly received from an AAU
coach in Kansas City, Myron Piggie, while Rush was in high school.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA suspended Rush, the Bruins' leading rebounder and third-leading scorer
last season, indefinitely on Dec. 10 while it investigated whether the sophomore
had violated NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the NCAA suspended Rush on Feb. 1 for the equivalent of one full season
-- which worked out to be the final 12 games of this season and the first 17 of
the next.
</P>
<P>
	   The NCAA also suspended Rush for 15 games this season for receiving $200
from a sports agent during the 1998-99 academic year. Rush already had missed 15
games by Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Rush has to repay $6,525, the value of benefits he allegedly received from
Piggie, working out a payment schedule that satisfies the NCAA. The payments
will go to charity.
</P>
<P>
	   Rush, 20, played in three games at the beginning of this season before UCLA
suspended him in December. He averaged 7.3 points and 11.4 points last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Kareem Rush, JaRon's brother, was suspended by the NCAA until Jan. 29 for
receiving money from the same AAU coach before enrolling at Missouri, where he's
a freshman. He missed nine games.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Cuba Spy Faces Deadline  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- An alleged Cuban spy permitted into Canada after being
expelled from the United States stayed inside the Cuban Embassy on Monday as the
time limit on his two-day transit visa ran down.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Jose Imperatori, 46, would
become an illegal alien if he remained in Canada beyond the two-day limit
allowed by the visa granted Imperatori upon his arrival in Montreal on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 10 p.m. EST Monday, Imperatori remained in Cuba's embassy in Ottawa.
It was not immediately clear how he would leave Canada Monday night if he wanted
to. There were no commercial flights scheduled to Havana, meaning he would
require a private charter or a flight arranged by one of the governments
involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was taken into custody by U.S. authorities and flown to Montreal
aboard a U.S. government plane late Saturday. He had been expected to leave
Canada for Havana on Sunday, but did not do so. Even his family members in Cuba
said they weren't sure when he would arrive home.
</P>
<P>
	   Axworthy said Canada wanted no role in the latest diplomatic fracas between
Cuba and the United States, and refused to specify what would happen if
Imperatori refused to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll have to see if the Cuban authorities live up to their
responsibilities and their basic rules and connections of diplomacy,'' Axworthy
said. ``We were simply providing a courtesy to allow him to transfer back to
Cuba, and we expect them to recognize just exactly what it was.''
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori's wife, Raquel Fundora, and the couple's 3-year-old son returned
to Havana from the United States on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Imperatori resigned his consular position, giving up his
diplomatic immunity, and said he intended to defy the U.S. State Department's
expulsion order so he could contest allegations linking him with U.S.
immigration official Mariano Faget, who has been charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI officials escorted Imperatori, accompanied by his lawyer, from his
suburban Maryland apartment to the plane that flew him to Montreal on Saturday
night. The State Department said he was expelled for not voluntarily leaving by
the appointed time.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials say that they believe the allegations are a smokescreen to
block the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Has New Miss Universe Rep  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela is sending a new contestant to the Miss
Universe contest because the regular beauty queen was in such demand this year
that she caused confusion in international pageant regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is important in this Latin American country, which has won 11 top
international beauty titles in the last two decades, more than any other nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Claudia Moreno, 22, was crowned Miss Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in a
modest ceremony in Caracas Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman who was supposed to represent Venezuela in May's Miss Universe
pageant in Cyprus was disqualified because of the likelihood she would hold two
major international beauty titles at the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuela usually has one major national pageant. The runner-up goes to the
Miss World contest and the winner represents her nation in the Miss Universe
contest.
</P>
<P>
	   But last year, Miss World officials insisted that Venezuela send its winner
to them, too. It did, and the Venezuelan contestant, 24-year-old Martina
Thorogood, was named first runner-up in the contest in London in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Thorogood was also to have competed in the Miss Universe pageant in Cyprus.
But Miss Universe officials objected, saying Thorogood wasn't eligible because
she can't be both Miss Universe and Miss World at the same time. That could
happen if the current Miss World were to abdicate her crown.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses US, Britain Over Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq accused the United States and Britain on Monday
of ``avenging themselves on an entire people'' by preventing the U.N.
humanitarian program from delivering infrastructure equipment to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and British claims that the machinery might be used for military uses
carry no weight because U.N. officials in New York and Baghdad make sure
contracts for the goods are for humanitarian purposes only, Iraqi Ambassador
Saeed Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The American and British arguments ``are no more than a crude cover for the
placing of contracts on hold for political reasons,'' Hasan said in a letter to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
	   This amounts to the countries' ``avenging themselves on an entire people,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasan's letter was circulated on the same day the outgoing U.N. humanitarian
coordinator for Iraq, Hans von Sponeck, met with Secretary-General Kofi Annan at
U.N. headquarters to discuss the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Sponeck announced his resignation earlier this month, calling for
sanctions to be lifted because he said Iraqis were suffering too much -- even
with the U.N. humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
	   During the meeting, Annan said he would review von Sponeck's ideas on how to
make the program more effective, but made clear that the Security Council alone
determines the U.N. policy in the program, according to a summary of the meeting
from Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no indication, however, that the Security Council is prepared to
alter the sanctions on Iraq, which under U.N. resolutions cannot be lifted until
weapons inspectors report Iraq is free of its banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil-for-food program was started in 1996 to care for Iraqis suffering
under sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. It allows for
U.N.-supervised sales of Iraqi oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
goods.
</P>
<P>
	   While $6.3 billion in goods has arrived in Iraq since the program's
inception, $1.7 billion worth of contracts has been held up in the U.N.
sanctions committee -- most of it equipment to improve Iraq's power grid and oil
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has placed the bulk of the disputed contracts on ``hold,''
saying it wants to review them to make sure the goods weren't ``dual-use'' items
that could help Iraqi President Saddam Hussein rebuild weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a group of American nuns and priests on Monday pleaded with
President Clinton to reconsider U.S. policy toward Iraq, saying sanctions were
hurting children.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven nuns and two priests released a letter sent to the president after
spending a week in Basra, 340 miles south of Baghdad along the Kuwait border.
The nuns and priests were visiting other members of their Dominican order who
have been working in Iraqi hospitals for the last few years.

<TEXT>
<P>
    UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Adam Oates scored his 300th career goal with 5:01
left Monday night, giving the Washington Capitals a 3-2 victory over the New
York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
	   Oates rushed down the right side on a 4-on-4 with Steve Konowalchuk. His
centering pass caromed off Aris Brimanis' skate past goalie Roberto Luongo to
give the Capitals their third win in four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Halpern and Ulf Dahlen also scored for Washington, which got 16 saves
from Olaf Kolzig. The Capitals trail Southeast Division-leading Florida by two
points with 19 games remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Brimanis and Olli Jokinen scored for New York, which lost its fourth
straight and 10th in a row to the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
	   It was also the 13th consecutive time New York has failed to beat Washington
(0-12-1) -- including seven straight losses at Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders,
who got 34 saves from Luongo, have not beaten the Capitals since Dec. 7, 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Both goalies stopped nine shots in a scoreless first period.
</P>
<P>
	   Brimanis picked up his first NHL goal at 1:46 of the second period -- during
New York's first power play -- on a 35-foot wrist shot from the left side that
got past Kolzig, who was screened.
</P>
<P>
	   Luongo made a brilliant stop about two minutes later, robbing Peter Bondra
by stretching his stick across the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington tied it at 7:42 when Halpern, standing alone at the left crease,
flipped a rebound over Luongo.
</P>
<P>
	   Dahlen put Washington ahead at 11:53 on a one-timer from the low slot.
</P>
<P>
	   Jokinen made it 2-2 when his right circle wrist shot off a rush hit Kolzig's
outstretched right pad and shot up under the crossbar at 17:58.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges To Work With Govs  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and the nation's governors grappled
with one of the thorniest issues of the Internet age Monday, debating whether
states should be allowed to charge sales taxes for online purchases.
</P>
<P>
	   With tens of billions of dollars in revenue at stake, Clinton said states
should decide quickly among themselves what to do. ``It may have to involve some
simplification of sales taxes,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said. ``But
this is something they will have to work out ... with some urgency.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton met with members of the bipartisan National Governors' Association
for two hours in the White House. Aside from Internet taxes, the group discussed
trade with China; Lockhart said general support emerged for granting permanent
normal trade relations to Beijing, a contentious issue facing Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Clinton addressed a $5.1 million fund-raising dinner for the
Democratic Governors' Association. He said the United States, with its longest
economic expansion in history, has a rare opportunity to address the nation's
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't you dare be complacent about this,'' the president told the audience
of 1,500 people at Union Station. ``I have waited for 35 years for my country to
be in shape again to build a future of our dreams for our children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sales taxes are the single largest source of revenue for most states and
local governments, about $150 billion overall. Some argue it is unfair to
penalize traditional brick-and-mortar businesses by exempting online sales from
taxes; others say online taxation would slow economic growth by shackling the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic Gov. Gray Davis of California said he opposes Internet sales
taxes because they might ``kill the golden goose laying the egg.'' He said
``money is just pouring in over the transom'' in California -- $10 billion
beyond what was estimated two years ago -- because of increases in personal
wealth, stock valuations, expanding opportunities and productivity gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, also a Democrat, said everyone agrees that
Internet access should not be taxed, but there is no agreement on the sales
taxes question. ``We are concerned that if the states lose on the average across
the country 40 percent of their revenue, what would happen to education and
other services?'' Glendening said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Paul Patton, D-Ky., said, ``About 40 of 50 state governors feel very
strongly that it is a problem that has the potential to undermine the sales tax
as a source of state revenue.''
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government should butt out, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura said.
``I support the right of each state to make that determination,'' said Ventura,
an independent. He said it is ``not the right of the government to tell us
whether we can or can't.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Far more important is for the federal government to fund special
education,'' Ventura said. ``Quit dilly-dallying around with all the feel-good
stuff -- fund their mandate on special ed.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that in this new economy,'' Clinton said, ``government's role is
to give the American people the tools and the conditions they need to make their
way and to advance our nation's progress.'' The government should focus on
fiscal discipline, investments in education and technology and new markets for
American products and services, the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, a Republican and chairman of the bipartisan
governors' association, said Clinton ``made it quite clear there should be no
preemption by the national government of states and their quest to level the
playing field'' in commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Clinton made a good point that ``if we're not able to solve that
problem, we better begin to look at the consequences, because they will be very
substantial in state and local governments and on various aspects of the retail
industry and others who sell into our economy.''
</P>
<P>
	   A commission headed by Gov. Jim Gilmore, R-Va., is studying the Internet tax
question and is due to send its recommendations to Congress in April. A federal
law placing a temporary moratorium on taxes aimed specifically at the Internet
expires in October 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think he (Gilmore) ought to be a tax czar for Tennessee,'' said
Gov. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn.

<HEADLINE> Heat 85, Knicks 76  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVEN WINE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat overcame Alonzo Mourning's absence and a
20-point first-half deficit Monday night, rallying past the New York Knicks
85-76 to remain in first place in the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Sparked by Jamal Mashburn and Clarence Weatherspoon, the shorthanded Heat
came back with smothering defense after they fell behind 37-17. The Knicks
started 12-for-16 but shot just 30 percent the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami, which has led the division for nearly the entire season, pulled 1 1/2
games ahead of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Mourning was not in uniform because of a sore left ankle he injured Saturday
at Washington, and he said he won't make the trip for Tuesday's game at San
Antonio. Heat guard Voshon Lenard also missed the game with a lower abdominal
strain.
</P>
<P>
	   Mashburn scored 24 points for Miami, and Weatherspoon had 14 points and 12
rebounds off the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Johnson led New York with 20 points. Patrick Ewing failed to take
advantage of Mourning's absence and had just eight points in 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Knicks made their first four 3-point attempts and raced to a 29-12 lead
after just seven minutes. But when New York cooled off, Weatherspoon sank four
consecutive baskets for Miami to cut the margin to 43-37 at halftime. The Knicks
had six points in the final 10:41 of the half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heat scored the final seven points of the third period, taking their
first lead at 61-60 on Mashburn's one-handed 10-footer in the final second. Dan
Majerle's 3-pointer put the Heat ahead to stay, 66-63, and they pulled away as
the Knicks missed six of their next seven shots.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was reminiscent of the most recent meeting between the archrivals,
except the roles were reversed. Miami blew an early 15-point lead and lost at
New York on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heat extended their home winning streak to nine games.

<HEADLINE> Senators 1, Penguins 1, tie  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN ROBINSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins, struggling offensively without
injured star Jaromir Jagr, got only 17 shots and few good scoring chances in a
1-1 tie with the Ottawa Senators on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins are 0-2-2 since Jagr injured his hamstring a week ago Monday in
Tampa and are 1-0-4 in five home games. Ottawa is 1-14-4 all-time in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   Pittsburgh is 1-5-3 overall without Jagr this season and has not scored more
than three goals in its last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr had surgery Friday to remove a blood clot from his left thigh. He is to
begin physical therapy later this week, but is not expected to play again until
at least mid-March.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams missed opportunities to improve their positions in the muddled
Eastern Conference playoff race. Ottawa slipped three points behind fifth-place
Washington, a 3-2 winner over the New York Islanders, and stayed six points
ahead of Pittsburgh. The seventh-place Penguins missed a chance to open a
three-point lead on the eighth-place New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins shook themselves from a lethargic start to take a 1-0 lead on
Matthew Barnaby's eighth goal at 8:21 of the first.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Civic Arena crowd of 16,081 unusually quiet during a dump-and-chase
start in which neither team generated any momentum, Barnaby suddenly broke free
on a breakaway off Jan Hrdina's lead pass and put the puck between Patrick
Lalime's pads.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnaby, never known as an offensive forward, has two goals and an assist in
his last three games.
</P>
<P>
	   Lalime, the former Pittsburgh goalie who began his NHL career with a
record-setting 14-0-2 start in 1996-97, settled down after that to make 16
saves.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senators also had scarcity of scoring opportunities against
Jean-Sebastien Aubin, but finally tied it at 5:55 of the second on Andreas
Dackall's fourth goal. Colin Forbes dug out the puck along the boards and fed up
ice to Shaun Van Allen, who set up Dackall perfectly in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Aubin was by far the more active of the two goalies, turning aside 32 shots
in his 10th consecutive start in place of Tom Barrasso, who is on a personal
leave. Barrasso's father died Monday night in Boston, and the goalie is not
expected to rejoin the Penguins soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa had an excellent opportunity to seize the lead when the Penguins'
German Titov drew a four-minute penalty for high-sticking Daniel Alfredsson at
12:20 of the third. But the Senators were held to three shots during the double
minor, and Pittsburgh actually had the best scoring chance as Lalime stopped
Martin Straka's shot on a 2-on-1 short-handed break.
</P>
<P>
	   Aubin made the best save in the overtime, going to the ice to partially
deflect the puck on Vaclav Prospal's breakaway following a Pittsburgh turnover
near the blue line.

growing more popular with the public as Governor George W. Bush is slipping.
Two-thirds of Americans have a favorable view of McCain, according to a CNN-USA

Just under six in 10 said they have a favorable view of Bush, the Texas

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austrian right-wing leader Joerg Haider resigned as
head of the Freedom Party on Monday, seen by some as a way to end his country's
international ostrascism. The outrage was based on Haider's anti-immigrant stand
and his past praise of World War II veterans of Germany's murderous Waffen SS
and Adolf Hitler's "orderly" employment policies. Haider holds no post in the
national government, But his image and his iron-hand control of the Freedom
Party made him the most visible member of the Austrian political establishment,
eclipsing his governing coalition partners, the center-right Austrian People's
Party of Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel.

Landmark Conviction in Web Gambling

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man who operated a sports betting business on the

first case of its kind to go to trial. The jury in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan concluded that Jay Cohen, 33, broke a federal law by accepting bets
and wagers on sports events over the Internet and telephone. Cohen, president of
World Sports Exchange in Antigua, was among 22 defendants charged in March 1998
with operating offshore companies that took bets from Americans via the Internet
or toll-free telephone numbers. Federal law prohibits the use of the Internet
for sports betting and makes it a crime to use interstate telephone lines for
gambling.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Higher at Midday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index rebounded Tuesday morning
in reaction to a recovery on Wall Street. The dollar rose against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 225.27 points, or 1.14
percent, to 19,945.37 at the end of the morning session. On Monday, the average
closed down 97.79 points, or 0.49 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 109.78 yen in late morning, up 0.58 yen from late in Tokyo
and also above its late New York level of 109.37 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei index opened higher Tuesday as investors
were cheered by gains in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose
176.53, or 1.79 percent, to 10,038.65 at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nikkei advanced on buying of major high technology issues, including
shares in Sony, Fujitsu, NEC and Canon.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said the overall stock market was mixed as investors are poised to
take profits following recent gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 0.21 points, insignificant in percentage terms, to 1,728.23.
The TOPIX closed up 3.94 points, or 0.23 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, traders said investors sold yen to buy dollars after
Tokyo on Tuesday said Japanese industrial production posted a
smaller-than-expected rise in January.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Japan's industrial
output rose 0.9 percent last month from December. Economists surveyed by Dow
Jones Newswires earlier had projected on average industrial production would
increase 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.27 yen late Tuesday morning,
up from 105.37 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8400
percent from Monday's finish of 1.8200 percent. Its price fell 0.17 point to
99.66.

<HEADLINE> LT Lawrence Expelled From Industry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A self-regulatory brokers' group has expelled from the
securities industry the brokerage firm LT Lawrence &AMP; Co. Inc., its chief
executive officer and its president for allegedly defrauding investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The two LT Lawrence officials have agreed to repay 300 customers a total
$275,000, NASD Regulation announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the firm's compliance officer has agreed in a settlement to pay
a $20,000 fine and to be suspended from the industry for 30 days. The compliance
officer, Mitchell J. Halpern, neither admitted nor denied the regulators'
allegation, made in a September 1998 complaint, that he failed to enforce rules
prohibiting fraudulent conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   NASD Regulation, the enforcement arm of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, said CEO Lawrence Principato and President Todd E. Roberti
had cheated LT Lawrence customers by charging them excessive markups in 350
stock transactions in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Principato and Roberti agreed in a settlement to fully reimburse 300
customers in 37 states and Britain who lost a total $275,000, NASD Regulation
said. The two, who also agreed to be barred from the industry, neither admitted
nor denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're going on with their lives," said their attorney, Ira Lee Sorkin. He
declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Markups are differentials over the prevailing market price for securities.
Regulators consider markups of more than 10 percent to be fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, LT Lawrence's head trader, Thomas J. Dalton, settled a related
disciplinary action by agreeing to a $40,000 fine and a three-month suspension.
He neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> 76ers Iverson Hurt, May Miss Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson may miss Tuesday's game against Dallas
because of a partially torn right rotator cuff, a Philadelphia 76ers team doctor
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson did not practice Monday after complaining of soreness in his right
shoulder. An MRI test revealed a bruise and partial tear of the shoulder.
Iverson's status is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
	   He originally suffered the injury against the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 20.
Iverson, the NBA's leading scorer at 30.1 points per game, has struggled since
the injury to his shooting shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   Against the Lakers, he shot just 7-of-25, including 0-for-11 in the second
half, and scored 16 points. Iverson scored 26 points on 8-for-26 shooting in an
89-88 loss to the New York Knicks on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the arrival of Toni Kukoc in a trade on Feb. 16, Iverson has shot
40-for-121 (33 percent), and is averaging 21.6 points in the five games with
Kukoc.

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Race 4 Abandoned  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- With no wind again, the America's Cup has gone to
the dogs.
</P>
<P>
	Race 4 was postponed for a second time as the Hauraki Gulf was completely
devoid of wind Tuesday, leaving New Zealand's Black Magic and Italy's Luna Rossa
floating listlessly for two hours before the race committee abandoned the race.
</P>
<P>
	The best action on the water was when a man in a motorized rubber boat pulled
his terrier on a boogie board through the spectator fleet.
</P>
<P>
	With even the race committee chairman admitting to being bored by the lack of
wind that has forced four postponements in 11 days, officials announced that the
two teams and TV rights holders have agreed to try to get in Race 4 on
Wednesday, which had been scheduled as a lay day.
</P>
<P>
	The forecast calls for tropical rain storms with winds of 12-15 knots from the
northeast. Race 5 in the best-of-9 series, which Black Magic leads 3-0, will
remain scheduled for Thursday, when the wind could build to 20-25 knots.
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some good sailing days when we're not sailing, and today another
day of no breeze where we should be sailing,'' race committee chairman Harold
Bennett said. ``But the prospects from here look a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said earlier that they didn't plan to race on lay days because they
were part of the schedule dictated by TV rights holders.
</P>
<P>
	But with the Hauraki Gulf held hostage by a high-pressure system, four racing
days have been lost to windless days, one more day than there has been racing.
Adding in four lays to this point, the regatta's momentum has been stripped
away.
</P>
<P>
	And there hasn't been much drama on the water, with Black Magic routing Luna
Rossa in all three races, with no margin closer than 1 minute, 17 seconds. That
was in the opener, which also was delayed by lack of wind.
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting bored out there, too,'' Bennett said of the race committee. ``I
think that is a problem. We want a race as much as the sailors do.''
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said discussions about racing on lay days began on Monday, and that
``delicate negotiating'' took place Tuesday. With TV contracts involved, ``I
know there were telephone calls flying all over the world from about midday
today, to see whether this was in fact possible,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
	The boats haven't raced since Saturday. Race 4 originally was scheduled for
Sunday but there wasn't enough wind.
</P>
<P>
	The wind actually has been pretty decent on a few of the lay days, including an
average of almost 10 knots Monday, according to New Zealand's weather service.
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said that despite appearances, this isn't the wrong time of year to be
racing in the Hauraki Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	``We do generally get a lot of good sea breezes,'' Bennett said. ``But the
weather pattern we're experiencing this year is a little different than what
we've seen for the last number of years. I wouldn't say it's the wrong time of
year, we've just struck a bad patch.''
</P>
<P>
	The high pressure results in sunny days that are good for sea breezes, but the
southwesterly breeze from the Tasman Sea meets the northeasterly from the
Pacific in the gulf and they cancel each other out.
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, supermodel Rachel Hunter, a Kiwi and the former wife of Rod
Stewart, came over on a chase boat for a chat with the crew of Black Magic, who
earlier ate ice cream bars as they shielded themselves from the summer sun.
</P>
<P>
	The crew on Team New Zealand's backup boat let teen-agers climb aboard and
swing off ropes into the water.
</P>
<P>
	Some of the sailors aboard Luna Rossa read Italian newspapers as they lounged
on deck, repeating a scene all to familiar in this America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> Japan Unemployment Rate Unchanged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's jobless rate was unchanged at 4.7 percent in January
from December's revised figure as the nation struggled to emerge from its
decade-long economic slump, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the number of unemployed people totaled 3.09 million in January, up
110,000, or 3.7 percent, from the same month in 1999, the statistics bureau of
the Management and Coordination Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Unemployment has risen as companies struggling for survival cut costs by
reducing their work forces. The jobless rate stood at a record 4.9 percent in
June and July last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has used public spending to jump-start the economy, which it
expects to grow by 1 percent in the coming fiscal year beginning in April.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of permanent jobholders fell 520,000, or 1.1 percent on-year, to
46.36 million, declining for the 25th straight month as companies continue to
replace lifetime workers with temporary staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Temporary workers cost less in terms of pension and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of people with temporary jobs grew by 20,000 to 5.1 million, the
agency said. The rise has continued since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Ministry said the ratio of job offers to job seekers, an indicator
of demand for labor, improved by 0.02 point to 0.52 in January from December.
The ratio shows that 52 jobs were being offered for every 100 workers seeking
employment in January.
</P>
<P>
	   That was its highest level since the ratio touched 0.53 in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the new job offers ratio showed that there were 96 new jobs for every
100 people newly seeking work, the highest level since April 1998 when the ratio
stood at 0.96. A year ago, the ratio read 0.88.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the total number of new job offers increased 11.7 percent on year
in January. All sectors in the economy, including retail, service,
manufacturing, transport, telecommunications and construction, posted gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The jobless rate for men fell 0.1 point in January to 4.8 percent, marking
the first decline in four months. The jobless rate for women rose 0.1 point to
4.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Admiral Meets With Chinese  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN LEICESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- In fence-mending talks with Chinese military leaders, the
commander of U.S. Pacific forces expressed concern Tuesday about Beijing's new
threats to attack Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Adm. Dennis Blair's visit comes amid rising tensions over Taiwan in the
run-up to the island's March 18 presidential election. China's newest threat of
force was made despite U.S. calls for restraint.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair's visit is aimed at repairing military channels of communication that
could help ease tensions. Beijing severed military ties after U.S. warplanes hit
China's embassy in Yugoslavia in May, and the dialogue only resumed last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair met Tuesday with Chinese military and government leaders, but U.S.
officials in Beijing refused to discuss the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the admiral met with Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai for ``a wide
exchange of views on international and regional security and bilateral
relations,'' China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   Xiong is a deputy chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army and a key voice in making Taiwan policy. Blair also met Shi
Yunsheng, commander in chief of China's naval forces, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a chance for everyone to get to know each other,'' a U.S official
said on condition of anonymity. ``The atmosphere was very cordial. I think the
Chinese want to succeed in re-establishing a military-to-military
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwan was discussed, along with other Asian security concerns, the official
said. The U.S. side also ``expressed its concern about the white paper'' in
which China last week threatened Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, Beijing said it might attack if Taiwan indefinitely put
off negotiations on unification. The threat, contained in a government position
paper issued Feb. 21, appeared aimed at putting pressure on the three leading
Taiwanese presidential candidates, none of whom support union on China's terms.
</P>
<P>
	   China also is angry with proposed legislation in the U.S. Congress that
would increase cooperation between the U.S. and Taiwan militaries. The Clinton
administration opposes the bill and has threatened to veto it. But the measure
has nonetheless heightened suspicions in Beijing about U.S. involvement in the
Taiwan question. China fears U.S. support could embolden Taiwan to declare
formal independence -- a move Beijing says would mean war.
</P>
<P>
	   China and Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949, with the United States
supporting Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists on the island against Mao Tse-tung's
Communists.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the United States now acknowledges China's claim to Taiwan,
Washington is obligated by law to help the island maintain an adequate defense.
</P>
<P>
	   After he concludes his meetings Tuesday, Blair is expected to travel to the
eastern city of Nanjing, headquarters for the regional military command that
would form the bulk of any Chinese attack on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates say China-U.S. military contacts can help avoid miscalculations
during times of tension.
</P>
<P>
	   Four years ago, in an attempt to influence Taiwan's first direct
presidential elections, China fired test missiles near Taiwan. The United States
sent warships in response, raising tensions to their highest level in decades.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush Trade Barbs  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Accused of dividing his party and helping the
Democrats, John McCain said Monday he was instead trying to expand the GOP to
become ``a party as big as the country we serve.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican presidential rival George W. Bush strongly disagreed, saying of
McCain, ``He is a person who obviously wants to divide people into camps.''
</P>
<P>
	   The comments followed McCain's speech here -- in the headquarters city of
Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition -- accusing some in his party of pandering
to Christian right leaders ``on the outer reaches of American politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The biting remarks were designed to appeal to moderates voting in Virginia,
Washington state and North Dakota on Tuesday, as well as in crucial contests
next week on ``Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, campaigning in Washington, said repeatedly that his rival was trying
to divide the party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain is someone who likes to castigate, not someone who likes to
lead,'' Bush said. ``It's important to unite our party and lead it to victory.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporter Dick Armey, the Republican leader in the House, took a
similar slap at McCain: ``His was not the speech of a coalition-builder and a
unifier, nor was it worthy of a Republican presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain defended his loyalty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have been accused of consorting with the wrong sort of people,'' he said
in his speech, a reference to independents and Democrats from whom he has sought
support in open GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have always acted in what I believe to be the best interests of my
country,'' he said. ``And I always believed that what is good for America is
good for the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some prefer to build walls and exclude newcomers from our support,'' he
said. ``Apparently appeals to patriotism can only be heard by card-carrying
Republicans, and only certain Republicans at that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also said the McCain camp was trying to divide the party along
religious lines by making telephone calls in primary states linking Bush to
anti-Catholic sentiments at Bob Jones University, a South Carolina school
accused of religious bigotry. The McCain campaign said calls like those made
before Michigan's primary were being made in Washington state, but not in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator McCain is running a stealth campaign, saying one thing and doing
another. He's playing the religious card,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said the Bush people were the religious dividers, telephoning voters
to ``distort by pro-life positions and smear the reputations of my supporters.''
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP race has focused on religious issues in recent days, with Bush
expressing his regrets on Sunday to Catholic leaders for his visit to Bob Jones
on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush waited too long.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His words are fine,'' said McCain. ``To me they should have been said
three weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   There also were reverberations from McCain's decision not to take part in a
debate on Thursday. McCain blamed Bush, arguing that Bush was initially evasive
about accepting the debate invitation.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said, given the delay, he scheduled events in New York that can't be
changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said, ``I'm sorry that we're not going to have the debate in Los
Angeles. I would be glad to spend the entire time on education.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, in his speech Monday, came to the heart of the religious
conservative movement to criticize its ``self-appointed leaders,'' but he
clearly was aiming at a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a Reagan Republican who will defeat Al Gore,'' McCain said.
``Unfortunately George Bush is a Pat Robertson Republican who will lose to Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   After his speech at a high school in Virginia, where polls put Bush ahead,
McCain headed to Washington where the two are in a tight race.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, polls show Bush leading McCain by as much as 20 percentage
points among likely Republican voters who will choose that state's delegates
March 7, although it put them neck-and-neck in the open primary's popular vote,
which includes independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in California, the Christian Coalition has distributed voter guides
slanted against McCain, showing him on the ``wrong side of several issues dear
to conservatives. The guides say McCain favors federal funding for fetal tissue
research and expanding NATO's role in Eastern Europe and opposes states' rights
to regulate gambling, according to the guides, which say Bush favors each of
those priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   After discussing education with teachers in Bellevue, Wash., Bush said he
was the candidate who wants to stick to issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ronald Reagan didn't point fingers,'' Bush told reporters. ``He never
played to people's religious fears like Senator McCain has shamelessly done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile Alan Keyes, the third man seeking the Republican nomination, told
reporters before a speech Monday night in Syracuse, N.Y., that he will continue
his campaign because ``politics isn't about votes only.'' Keyes has been mired
in single digits in the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not giving up. I won't give up,'' he said. ``America's moral house is
on fire.''

<HEADLINE> Study Cites Hate Groups on I-5  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM KLAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- White supremacist groups are flourishing along the populous
Interstate 5 corridor in Washington and Oregon, recruiting suburban young people
who feel their culture is threatened, the Northwest Coalition for Human Dignity
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We talk about (hate groups) as if they only exist in Idaho and Montana,
and the heaviest concentration is right here in Puget Sound,'' said Terre
Rybovich, coalition executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   In its first annual ``Hate by State'' report, the coalition drew a regional
map, using iron crosses as symbols, showing 52 white supremacist groups.
</P>
<P>
	   They range from several chapters of the World Church of the Creator and
other religious entities to Ku Klux Klan, and neo-Nazi organizations to
militias.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen of the groups were in Washington and 13 in Oregon, all but a few
arrayed along I-5, the main north-south highway from California to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   There were also 11 in Idaho -- all but one in the Panhandle -- five in
Montana and three each in Wyoming and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   Rybovich said she was surprised at the number of groups whose names were
ferreted out in Washington and Oregon. She said the number was growing ``and
that is our greatest cause for concern.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rybovich said while her organization had been able to get a count of
organizations, it wasn't able to provide a head count of skinheads, neo-Nazis,
religious and patriotic zealots and others counted among white supremacist
ranks.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the numbers for each group are likely small, since those in the
white supremacist movement have learned the best way to avoid detection is to
work locally, using small meetings and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Where they do show up, she said, is at public schools or other places they
believe are ripe for recruiting.
</P>
<P>
	   James Aho, a sociologist at Idaho State University who has written two books
on the white supremacy movement, took issue with the coalition's assertion that
the white supremacist movement is growing.
</P>
<P>
	   He said there are occasional killings and ``these are terrible tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``But the right-wing rhetoric doesn't seem to catch the public imagination
as it used to,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pinochet Test Not Requested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet has not been asked to take a second
medical examination despite last week's requests, The Daily Telegraph reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgium and France asked Home Secretary Jack Straw to order a second medical
assessment seven days ago, after the first assessment concluded the 84-year-old
former Chilean dictator was unfit to stand trial in Spain on torture-related
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon also requested a second exam, while
Switzerland argued ill health should not bar a trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet's lawyers have not yet been approached by Straw with a request, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   But chief medical officer Liam Donaldson has discussed observations of the
four governments with Sir John Grimley Evans, an Oxford University professor who
led the British medical doctors in their Jan. 5 examination, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Straw said he was inclined to let Pinochet return to his
homeland based on the findings of the original medical report. Lawyers Tuesday
speculated that the only explanation for the delay was that Straw was drafting
his statement to avoid a move by any of the four countries to block that
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw has promised to announce his decision first in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16, 1998, on a warrant issued by
Garzon that accused Pinochet of human rights violations during his 17 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
	   A report by the civilian government that succeeded Pinochet says 3,197
people died or disappeared during the general's rule.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Drug Control Effort Launched  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations has launched a $65 million drug
control initiative in the countries that border Afghanistan, seeking to stem
trafficking from the world's top producer of opium, a senior U.N. official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``security belt'' projects in Central Asia include training for border
police and law enforcement officials and help in establishing national drug
control agencies and policies, said Pino Arlacchi, the head of the U.N. Drug
Control and Crime Program.
</P>
<P>
	   The target countries for the U.N. programs are Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Iran, Pakistan, Kazakstan and Kyrgyztan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem of illicit narcotics production in Afghanistan and related
trafficking has reached alarming proportions,'' Arlacchi told a closed meeting
of regional representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The region now has the highest rates of heroin addiction in the world and
surplus production may fuel efforts to develop new markets elsewhere, Arlacchi
said, according to his prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite pledges by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia to ban poppy
cultivation, the country expanded lands under harvest and produced 4,600 metric
tons of opium last year -- almost twice as much as the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent report from the International Narcotics Control Board, a
quasi-judicial U.N. organization that monitors adherence to U.N. drug treaties,
said Afghanistan now produces 75 percent of the world's opium.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to the U.N. report, the Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah
Mohammed Omar, issued an edict ordering a one-third reduction in poppy
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
	   But Taliban officials have said they cannot persuade Afghanistan's farmers
to stop cultivating the illegal crop altogether because they have no other way
of supporting themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has launched pilot projects in four regions of
Afghanistan to help farmers switch to non-poppy harvesting, but the organization
estimates it will need dlrs 25 million a year for five years to establish
alternative development projects that would wipe out production altogether,
Arlacchi said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, the United Nations wants to stem the trafficking through
border control and other projects, including projects to stem the import into
Afghanistan of the chemical precursors needed to make opium.

<HEADLINE> Freight Train Derails in Penn.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANDERGRIFT, Pa. (AP) -- A Norfolk Southern freight train derailed northeast
of Pittsburgh Monday evening, sending at least two cars into the Kiskiminetas
River.
</P>
<P>
	   Norfolk Southern spokesman Rudy Husband said 12 to 19 cars of a 122-car
train derailed, including four cars carrying molten sulfur, which is classified
as a flammable hazardous material. The sulfur-carrying cars remained upright and
intact. Most of the other derailed cars also remained upright, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two cars that fell into the river were a tanker loaded with antifreeze
and a freight car carrying a load of steel, Husband said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this point, it does not appear to be leaking,'' Husband said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the derailment was under investigation. No injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The train originated in Conway and was headed to Roanoke, Va. It derailed
near Vandergrift, a town about 25 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Race 4 Abandoned  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- With no wind again, the America's Cup has gone to
the dogs.
</P>
<P>
	Race 4 was postponed for a second time as the Hauraki Gulf was completely
devoid of wind Tuesday, leaving New Zealand's Black Magic and Italy's Luna Rossa
floating listlessly for two hours before the race committee abandoned the race.
</P>
<P>
	The best action on the water was when a man in a motorized rubber boat pulled
his terrier on a boogie board through the spectator fleet.
</P>
<P>
	With even the race committee chairman admitting to being bored by the lack of
wind that has forced four postponements in 11 days, officials announced that the
two teams and TV rights holders have agreed to try to get in Race 4 on
Wednesday, which had been scheduled as a lay day.
</P>
<P>
	The forecast calls for tropical rain storms with wind of 12-15 knots from the
northeast. Race 5 in the best-of-9 series, which Black Magic leads 3-0, will
remain scheduled for Thursday, when the wind could build to 20-25 knots.
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some good sailing days when we're not sailing, and today another
day of no breeze where we should be sailing,'' race committee chairman Harold
Bennett said. ``But the prospects from here look a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said earlier that they didn't plan to race on lay days because they
were part of the schedule dictated by TV rights holders.
</P>
<P>
	But with the Hauraki Gulf held hostage by a high-pressure system, four racing
days have been lost to windless days, one more day than there has been racing.
Adding in four lay days to this point, the regatta's momentum has been stripped
away.
</P>
<P>
	And there hasn't been much drama on the water, with Black Magic routing Luna
Rossa in all three races, with no margin closer than 1 minute, 17 seconds. That
was in the opener, which also was delayed by lack of wind.
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting bored out there, too,'' Bennett said of the race committee. ``I
think that is a problem. We want a race as much as the sailors do.''
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said discussions about racing on lay days began on Monday, and that
``delicate negotiating'' took place Tuesday. With TV contracts involved, ``I
know there were telephone calls flying all over the world from about midday
today, to see whether this was in fact possible,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
	The boats haven't raced since Saturday. Race 4 originally was scheduled for
Sunday but there wasn't enough wind.
</P>
<P>
	The wind actually has been pretty decent on a few of the lay days, including an
average of almost 10 knots Monday, according to New Zealand's weather service.
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said that despite appearances, this isn't the wrong time of year to be
racing in the Hauraki Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	``We do generally get a lot of good sea breezes,'' Bennett said. ``But the
weather pattern we're experiencing this year is a little different than what
we've seen for the last number of years. I wouldn't say it's the wrong time of
year, we've just struck a bad patch.''
</P>
<P>
	The high pressure results in sunny days that are good for sea breezes, but the
southwesterly breeze from the Tasman Sea meets the northeasterly from the
Pacific in the gulf and they cancel each other out.
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, supermodel Rachel Hunter, a Kiwi and the former wife of Rod
Stewart, came over on a chase boat for a chat with the crew of Black Magic, who
earlier ate ice cream bars as they shielded themselves from the summer sun.
</P>
<P>
	The crew on Team New Zealand's backup boat let teen-agers climb aboard and
swing off ropes into the water.
</P>
<P>
	Some of the sailors aboard Luna Rossa read Italian newspapers as they lounged
on deck, repeating a scene all to familiar in this America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 106, Nets 101  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM KORTE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone barely missed his fourth career
triple-double, scoring 35 points, collecting 12 rebounds and distributing nine
assists as the Utah Jazz beat the New Jersey Nets 106-101 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Hornacek scored 27 points, shooting 10-of-11 from the field, and Bryon
Russell added 14 as the Jazz won for the sixth time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephon Marbury, going against John Stockton in a matchup of two of the
NBA's best point guards, led the Nets with 34 points while Kerry Kittles scored
22 and Keith Van Horn had 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Hornacek sealed the victory on a pair of free throws with 11 seconds left
after the Nets had cut their deficit to 103-101 on a 3-pointer by Marbury with
16.8 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss spoiled the return to Salt Lake City of Van Horn, the former
University of Utah standout who sat out his rookie game at the Delta Center with
an injured ankle. Last season's game was lost to the lockout.
</P>
<P>
	   After receiving a 20-second standing ovation during introductions and
scoring six of New Jersey's first eight points, things went downhill for Van
Horn. He struggled to a 5-of-16 effort and fouled out with 1.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   This month, the Jazz also went down to the wire at home against Eastern
Conference middleweights Orlando, Boston, Detroit, Milwaukee and Atlanta. The
Celtics and Bucks escaped the Delta Center with victories.
</P>
<P>
	   After Van Horn's free throw with 5:28 remaining gave the Nets an 88-87 lead,
the Jazz responded. Russell made a three-point play, Malone got a basket and
Hornacek hit a 3-pointer to make it 95-88 with 3:40 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   After a New Jersey timeout, Jim McIlvaine made one of two free throws. But
Armen Gilliam took a feed from Stockton and made a running hook shot in the lane
and Hornacek hit a jumper just inside the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockton finished with seven points and eight assists. Marbury had 11
assists.

become "a party as big as the country we serve." Republican presidential rival
George W. Bush strongly disagreed, saying of McCain, "He is a person who

another night on precarious perches above rising flood waters in Mozambique.
Officials say thousands have died in the deluge. While there was no precise
death toll, officials said it was certain that the number of dead was in the
thousands. Other aid workers said the toll would continue to climb, especially
as people begin dying of flood-borne diseases over the next few weeks. The
Mozambican government estimates more than 200,000 people have been left homeless
since torrential rains hit the impoverished African nation three weeks ago.

time limit on his two-day transit visa ran down. Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy said Jose Imperatori, 46, would become an illegal alien if he remained
in Canada beyond the two-day limit allowed by the visa granted Imperatori upon
his arrival in Montreal on Saturday night. On Saturday, Imperatori resigned his
consular position, giving up his diplomatic immunity, and said he intended to
defy the U.S. State Department's expulsion order so he could contest allegations
linking him with U.S. immigration official Mariano Faget, who has been charged

charged Monday with racketeering, conspiracy and money laundering. Attorney
General Janet Napolitano filed a new complaint, charging Gravano, three family
members and 42 others with a total of 181 counts. They had all initially been
arrested on a single count of conspiracy to distribute a dangerous drug. The
ecstasy drug ring, which allegedly started as a small-scale operation, was
selling 20,000 to 30,000 pills a week once Gravano put his weight behind it,
authorities said. The designer drug sells for $20 to $30 per pill.

Austria's Freedom Party Leader Steps Down

<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austrian right-wing leader Joerg Haider resigned as
head of the Freedom Party today, seen by some as a way to end his country's
international ostrascism. The outrage was based on Haider's anti-immigrant stand
and his past praise of World War II veterans of Germany's murderous Waffen SS
and Adolf Hitler's "orderly" employment policies. Haider holds no post in the
national government, But his image and his iron-hand control of the Freedom
Party made him the most visible member of the Austrian political establishment,
eclipsing his governing coalition partners, the center-right Austrian People's
Party of Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel.

Heat Scorch Knicks 85-76

<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat overcame Alonzo Mourning's absence and a
20-point first-half deficit Monday night, rallying past the New York Knicks
85-76. Sparked by Jamal Mashburn and Clarence Weatherspoon, the shorthanded Heat
came back with smothering defense after they fell behind 37-17. Mourning was not
in uniform because of a sore left ankle he injured Saturday at Washington, and
he said he won't make the trip for Tuesday's game at San Antonio. Heat guard
Voshon Lenard also missed the game with a lower abdominal strain.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Haider Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Right-wing leader Joerg Haider, criticized for his
anti-foreigner statements and past praise of some Nazi-era policies, resigned as
head of the Freedom Party Monday in an apparent bid to end Austria's
international ostracism following his party's rise to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, who remains governor of Austria's Carinthia province, insisted that
his decision does not mean he is retiring from national politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to avoid our ministers having to face the claim that they must
refer every decision to the shadow chancellor in Carinthia,'' Haider told
reporters. ``The Freedom Party ministers are not puppets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although Haider holds no post in the national government, his controversial
image and his iron-hand control of the Freedom Party made him the most visible
member of the Austrian political establishment, eclipsing his coalition
partners, the center-right Austrian People's Party of Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel. The Freedom Party remains a member of the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, 50, announced his resignation at a closed-door meeting of his
party's national leadership at a hotel in downtown Vienna. He will be succeeded
as party chief by his trusted lieutenant, Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer,
39.
</P>
<P>
	   She told reporters she had not wanted Haider to step aside, but she said she
respects his decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Austrian politicians and commentators said they doubted that Haider's
resignation signaled the end of his influence on the national government.
Riess-Passer and others in the Freedom Party leadership have long-established
reputations as Haider disciples who owe their political positions to him.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly elected head of the opposition Social Democratic party, Alfred
Gusenbauer, said the resignation was simply ``one of Haider's many tactical
tricks'' and would give the coalition a respite from criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Prinzhorn, a senior Freedom Party official, said Haider would remain
the ``top man'' of the party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Austria Press Agency said Haider told the party leadership meeting that
he was stepping down because he did not want ``to stand in the way'' of the work
of the new government.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14 other European Union members have downgraded relations with Austria
because of the presence of Haider's party in the government which took office
Feb. 4. The outrage was based on Haider's anti-immigrant stand and his past
praise of veterans of the murderous Waffen SS and Adolf Hitler's ``orderly''
employment policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Haider bristled at suggestions that he was bowing to foreign
pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I accept no pressure from outside,'' he told reporters. ``We are
accustomed to making our own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from other EU members. In Washington,
however, State Department spokesman James Rubin said Haider's resignation was a
``step in the right direction'' but noted that the Freedom Party remains in the
government, ``so we'll be watching their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said Haider's decision was
the ``first sign of a breath of fresh air'' since Haider's party finished second
in the Oct. 3 parliamentary elections, which paved the way to joining the ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Hier said the international criticism was pivotal in forcing Haider to step
down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We only hope that his resignation sends a strong message to other members
of the Freedom Party that no one is prepared to accept a party whose platform is
based on xenophobia and bigotry,'' Hier told The Associated Press. ``We hope the
Freedom Party will get the message.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, Peter Sichrovsky, the Freedom Party's EU representative,
said Haider had mentioned stepping down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Already on Saturday, he mentioned it in an internal party discussion,''
Sichrovsky said. ``He has already achieved more than anyone else, and if that is
his decision, then we must respect it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the international furor, Haider remains popular with many Austrians
and within the party he nearly single-handedly built up from a small, unknown
group to the second-largest political force in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has led the Freedom Party since 1986 and was elected governor of
Carinthia province in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's party exploited widespread concern over the impact of immigration
and EU expansion on Austrian jobs to finish second in the parliamentary election
with 52 of the 183 seats in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   The left-leaning Social Democrats finished first, winning 65 seats but too
few to govern on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   At EU ministerial meetings on Monday, Austrian delegates were publicly
shunned. At a defense ministers meeting in Sintra, Portugal, Belgian delegate
Andre Flahaut skipped lunch, telling reporters, ``I don't eat with fascists,''
in protest against the presence of Austrian Defense Minister Herbert Scheibner.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl-Heinz Grasser, Austria's finance minister, also got a frosty welcome at
his first EU gathering in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   French diplomats said ministers including their own declined to shake hands
with Grasser.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Cuba Spy Faces Deadline  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- An alleged Cuban spy permitted into Canada after being
expelled from the United States stayed inside the Cuban Embassy on Monday as the
time limit on his two-day transit visa ran down.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Jose Imperatori, 46, would
become an illegal alien if he remained in Canada beyond the two-day limit
allowed by the visa granted Imperatori upon his arrival in Montreal on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 11:30 p.m. EST Monday, Imperatori remained in Cuba's embassy in
Ottawa. It was not immediately clear how he would leave Canada Monday night if
he wanted to. There were no commercial flights scheduled to Havana, meaning he
would require a private charter or a flight arranged by one of the governments
involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori was taken into custody by U.S. authorities and flown to Montreal
aboard a U.S. government plane late Saturday. He had been expected to leave
Canada for Havana on Sunday, but did not do so. Even his family members in Cuba
said they weren't sure when he would arrive home.
</P>
<P>
	   Axworthy said Canada wanted no role in the latest diplomatic fracas between
Cuba and the United States, and refused to specify what would happen if
Imperatori refused to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll have to see if the Cuban authorities live up to their
responsibilities and their basic rules and connections of diplomacy,'' Axworthy
said. ``We were simply providing a courtesy to allow him to transfer back to
Cuba, and we expect them to recognize just exactly what it was.''
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori's wife, Raquel Fundora, and the couple's 3-year-old son returned
to Havana from the United States on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Imperatori resigned his consular position, giving up his
diplomatic immunity, and said he intended to defy the U.S. State Department's
expulsion order so he could contest allegations linking him with U.S.
immigration official Mariano Faget, who has been charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI officials escorted Imperatori, accompanied by his lawyer, from his
suburban Maryland apartment to the plane that flew him to Montreal on Saturday
night. The State Department said he was expelled for not voluntarily leaving by
the appointed time.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials say that they believe the allegations are a smokescreen to
block the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.
