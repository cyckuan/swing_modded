 TENNIS NOTEBOOK: SHOPPING AT THE U.S. OPEN; SUING OVER THE U.S.
OPEN; LONG SHOTS AT THE U.S. OPEN; THE N.J. OPEN

<P>
   The U.S. Open tennis championships, which began Monday, are akin
to a two-week trip to the mall, with forehands and backhands added.
</P>
<P>
   At the sprawling National Tennis Center, there was tennis, to be
sure. There was also an orgy of things to buy, notably leisure
clothing, food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   Strips of shops outside the courts offered rackets _ Prince from
$55 to $290, Yonex from $99 to $240, stringing included. From the
US Open Collection, there were sweatshirts from $58 to $105,
polo-style shirts from $52 to $70 and baseball caps from $20 to
$23. For $120, Bolle was selling sunglasses that muted all colors
except optic yellow, a boon for players using yellow tennis balls.
</P>
<P>
   At the food court, you could buy a kosher hot pastrami sandwich
for $10.50 or 10 Buffalo chicken wings for $9.75 or a chicken
Ceaser (that's the way it was spelled) salad for $7.95. You could
wash that down with a strawberry daiquiri ($7) or a Pepsi ($3.25).
Pepsi is a sponsor, so there was not a Coke to be had. The
well-connected ate at the U.S. Open Club (``Occupancy by more than
649 persons is dangerous and unlawful.''). The Grand Buffet was
$28.95, the chicken Caesar (spelled correctly) salad $14 and the
Pepsi still $3.25.
</P>
<P>
   As for the tennis, it was everywhere simultaneously, from the
22,500-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium, the scaled-down, 10,000-seat Louis
Armstrong Stadium, the 5,000-seat grandstand and the 15 field
courts, where seating ranged from 288 to 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   As usually happens during the first few days of the tournament,
most spectators roamed the grounds. They watched such seeded
players as Dominique Van Roost, Barbara Schett and Amelie Mauresmo
winning on the field courts and Andre Agassi and Alexandra
Stevenson practicing. When Venus Williams rushed through a
54-minute victory over Tatiana Poutchek, at least half of the seats
in Arthur Ashe Stadium were empty.
</P>
<P>
   PROTESTING FOR INNER CITIES
</P>
<P>
   William Washington, a tennis coach and father, filed a complaint
Friday in U.S. District Court in New York against the U.S. Tennis
Association, which governs American tennis and conducts the Open.
Washington, an African-American, said there was a lack of player
development in inner cities and discrimination in selecting Olympic
and Davis Cup teams.
</P>
<P>
   His tennis-playing children were given three of the 16 wild-card
berths in the Open. Mashiska, 25, ranked 312th in the world among
men, lost Monday to Jan Kroslak of Slovakia, 6-1, 2-6, 7-6 (7-3),
7-5. Mashona, 23, ranked 159th among women, will play Jelena
Kostanic of Croatia Tuesday. MalaVai, 31, the Wimbledon men's
runner-up in 1996, withdrew last week after reinjuring a knee.
</P>
<P>
   Mashiska Washington had no comment on the complaint. But he said
he definitely felt his first-round performance justified his wild
card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all American players should have an opportunity to
play America's tournament,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also made it clear that his father's campaign opened the door
for him. He said: ``Would I be drinking from the same water
fountain you would if certain people wouldn't have protested? Do
things come up voluntarily or do things accidentally happen?
Self-explanatory.''
</P>
<P>
   A PITCH FOR TEEN-AGERS
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov on whether 19-year-old Marat
Safin, his Davis Cup teammate from Russia, will match up well
against No. 1-seeded Pete Sampras: ``I would think so. He's got
nothing to lose. It's a perfect, perfect position for him to be in.
Nobody really expects him to win. Perhaps he has a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen-year-old Philip King of Long Beach, Calif., the U.S.
boys' 18 champion, after losing to 12th-seeded Richard Krajicek:
``When I was in elementary school, I worked a couple of nights a
week in my dad's fish-and-chips shop. I was cashier. I didn't do
any cooking. I wasn't tall enough back then. I couldn't reach over
the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE TO HOME FOR GIMELSTOB
</P>
<P>
   For Justin Gimelstob, one of the young hopes in American tennis,
playing in the U.S. Open so close to his home state, New Jersey,
has advantages and disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always get good support here,'' said Gimelstob, who defeated
Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy, 6-1, 6-3, 6-2, in the first round. ``I
have to understand how to use that as an advantage, not as
something that works against me.'' He said he had taken steps to
cut down on distractions during the two weeks of the Open. He said
callers to his cellular phone get a recorded message, saying:
``Hey, how you doing, you've reached Justin, blah, blah, blah. If
you've called about tickets, call someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob admitted that the victory over Gaudenzi meant a little
more after the Davis Cup loss to Italy in last year's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff sticks with me more than it should,'' Gimelstob
said. ``They stuck it to us pretty good.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Streak ends at 10 as Reds sock Glavine
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ After finding every possible way to win for 10
games, the Braves found a bunch of ways to lose Monday night _ and
most of them were aimed over Tom Glavine's head _ as their longest
winning streak in seven years came to a screeching halt in an 11-3
pounding by the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   With Glavine as the whipping boy for two of their three home
runs, the Reds opened a three-game series with their first win in
seven games against the Braves this season. The Braves' NL East
lead slipped to 2 1/2 games over the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be the guy who ends (the streak), but with
every win the law of averages is bound to catch up with you,'' said
Glavine, who lost to the Reds for the first time since 1996 and for
only the third time in 17 decisions at Cinergy Field. ``I don't
feel like I pitched as badly as the line score indicated, but
unfortunately that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine gave up six earned runs in four innings, his shortest
and least effective outing since giving up a career-high nine runs
to Milwaukee on May 24. He dropped to 11-10, but the loss was the
first for the Braves in his last eight starts. Home runs by Walt
Weiss and Andruw Jones in the fourth inning cut Cincinnati's lead
to 4-3, but Glavine couldn't hold back the Reds. That was evident
when he gave up a single to Barry Larkin and a two-run homer to
Sean Casey in the bottom of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, he just didn't look comfortable out there,''
Chipper Jones said of Glavine. ``He got behind hitters and when
he's forced to come over the plate, people are going to hit him.
You've got to give credit to their hitters. Tommy's great at
expanding the strike zone. They didn't swing at any bad pitches all
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' bats were chilled by a series worth of good pitching
from the Braves last week, but they made up for it with the most
runs off Atlanta pitching since an 11-6 loss in Toronto on July 20.
Denny Neagle earned his first win in three tries this year against
his former team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any loss to end a streak is going to be painful,'' Chipper
Jones said. ``We were probably due to play a poor game. As long as
it doesn't carry over into tomorrow, we can accept it and move on.

YANKEES DEFEAT ATHLETICS 7-4  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.,   Mass.)   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aside from one speedbump, the Yankees continued to
steamroll toward the postseason Monday night, rallying from a 4-0
deficit to defeat the Oakland Athletics, 7-4, after being held
hitless and scoreless into the fifth inning at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu labored for the second straight game, though,
allowing four runs on four hits in 4 1/3 innings. He has struggled
in his last two starts. After winning eight straight decisions
earlier this season, Irabu has been hit hard and often since the
7-3 loss at Texas last week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Irabu got beat up again. When he left the game,
the Yankees were trailing by 4-0. Even on ground outs and fly outs,
Irabu's pitches were hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets behind in the count,'' said Yankees manager Joe Torre.
``The splitter just wasn't there tonight. That's the pitch that got
him in trouble. He has to keep working on it. We just need to find
that splitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Irabu's recent struggles are reminiscent of his
problems during the second half of last season, Torre said: ``I
think he's a better pitcher that he was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But it could not have been a comforting sight for the Yankees,
who continue to steamroll toward the postseason. Irabu struggled
the second half of last season and was left off the postseason
pitching roster. Postseason rosters for this season must be
considered soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Irabu struggled, his counterpart, rookie Tim Hudson, was
cruising through the Yankees lineup. Hudson held the Yankees
hitless through 4 2/3 innings in front of 32,712 fans at the
Stadium. But after controlling the game early on, Hudson (8-2)
inexplicably fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind by 4-0 early in Monday night's game, the
Yankees came back to tie the game in the fifth inning at 4-4 and
then put the game away in the eighth inning, scoring three runs as
the A's pitching completely unraveled. A's reliever Buddy Groom
allowed three crucial runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees started the comeback in the fifth inning, scoring
four runs on five straight hits off Hudson to tie the score at 4-4.
Chuck Knoblauch hit a three run home run, nailing a Hudson changeup
over the leftfield wall with Jorge Posada and Luis Sojo aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees bullpen was solid again. Allen Watson was
outstanding in middle relief, Jeff Nelson shutdown the A's and
Mariano Rivera came in to close out the game.
</P>
<P>
   The A's took a 2-0 lead in the second inning on a two-run home
run by Miguel Tejada. Irabu left a changeup about waist high, right
over the middle of the plate and Tejada drilled inside of the
rightfield fair pole. Ben Grieve, the A's leftfielder, was on base.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu was hit hard again in the fourth inning, surrendering two
more runs as the A's lead grew to 4-0. Irabu was relieved by Allen
Watson, who bailed out the Yankees, striking out Ben Grieve and
getting Tejada to ground out, with A's on first and third. Watson
has pitched 7 2/3 straight scoreless inning in his last three
relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, whose offense has exploded for a league-best 192 runs
in August, are a major player in the American League wild card
race. Entering Tuesday night's game, the A's (71-59) were one game
behind Boston (72-58). Should the A's capture the wild card, and
the Yankees win the AL, these two teams could meet in the first
round of the playoffs. But Torre downplayed any relevance the
four-game series, which began Monday night, could have on the
postseason.

MAN WIELDING HAMMER FATALLY SHOT BY POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A mentally disturbed man wielding a hammer was shot
at least seven times and killed by police in the Borough Park
section of Brooklyn Monday night, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of the man, an Orthodox Jew identified by police as
Gidone Busch, brought several hundred angry Jews into the street to
protest what they said was excessive force by police. The
protesters chanted ``justice,'' strained against barricades and
occasionally threw objects at police, but no one was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   An officer who tried to subdue the man was hit several times
with the hammer and hurt his arm, police said, but the officer was
not seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Busch, 29, was known on his block of 46th Street in Borough Park
for his outbursts, and had been the subject of many calls to police
before, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called to Busch's house, at 1619 46th St., about
6:40 p.m. Monday, said Detective Robert Samuel, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   When the four officers reached the house, Busch confronted them
with the hammer, Samuel said. Police ordered Busch to drop it and
one officer sprayed him with tear gas, but the man lunged at an
officer with the hammer, and police opened fire, Samuel said.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator at the scene said the officers fired seven to 15
shots. Busch was dead on arrival at Maimonides Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   A witness who would give his name only as Leo said that police
warned Busch three times to drop the hammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time, he came out swinging,'' the man said. ``He
jumped out of the basement swinging. He had a hammer in one hand
and something else in the other hand. Before they shot him, he held
it up as a cross. They pulled out their guns. They warned him a
second time. The third time he swung it like a baseball bat. Then
they started shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and other officials at the scene said Busch was from New
Jersey and had moved to Borough Park six months ago. Officials said
that when he was shot, he was wearing a prayer shawl and teffilin _
leather boxes hung from straps and containing pieces of scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Borough Park's city councilman, Noach Dear, called on the crowd
not to rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of rumors out there,'' Dear said above the noise
of shouts and banging. ``We need to have a full investigation.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All bluster and no balm, the U.S. Open, inarguably
the most chaotic Grand Slam, got under way Monday at the National
Tennis Center. Those who coped with the ball-bullying breezes moved
one round closer to a record $750,000 payday. Those who couldn't
cope moped home with their $10,000 condolence checks.
</P>
<P>
   And anybody in the crowd of 27,809, a record for an Open day
session, who neglected to tote a windbreaker along with their
binoculars was doomed to shiver just the way third-seeded Venus
Williams did in her backless blue dress. No wonder she made like a
gale-force wind and whipped through her initial assignment in a
scant 54 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Arthur Ashe Stadium, the upsets occurred inside the
players' minds _ as exasperated tennis technicians watched
textbook-executed shots spirited up and out of bounds _ but not on
the scoreboard. First, 10th-seeded Arantxa Sanchez &UR; - &LR; Vicario, the
Open's 1994 champion, then eighth-seeded Carlos Moya, the 1998
French Open champion, and finally Williams, still a Grand Slam
champion wannabe, used the adverse conditions to handcuff their
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   In the night session, an inspired Andre Agassi provided his own
whirlwind: The second-ranked Las Vegan pulverized Nicklas Kulti of
Sweden, 10 years ago the world's No.1 junior but relegated Monday
night to the role of a prop in the Agassi show, 6-0, 6-1, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the place to be; this is the place so much great
tennis played this year is coming down to,'' said Agassi, this
year's French Open champion and the U.S. Open's most enthusiastic
leading man. ``It brings focus of its own, being here. I love the
energy of the crowd. It almost feels like theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Agassi's evening, Martina Hingis's was slow to resolve
itself. It took her almost as long to play two sets as Agassi took
for three. After a nearly flawless first set, the top-seeded
Hingis, intent on doing remedial work for her failures at the
French Open and Wimbledon, scrambled out of a 3-0 second-set
deficit and then had to serve twice for the match before
eliminating 74th-ranked Kveta Hrdlickova, &QC; 6-1, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very windy, and I had to improvise some,'' said
Williams, whose shotmaking, whether rote or inventive, was too much
for 145th-ranked Tatiana Poutchek, a ponytailed Belarussian now
coached by Natasha Zvereva's father, Marat Zverev. Despite
acquitting herself favorably in the Open's qualifying rounds,
Poutchek bowed out of her first-ever visit to a Grand Slam
tournament's main draw, 6-1, 6-2, a victim of the 19-year-old
Williams' superior brawn and court coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Venus is a favorite'; people actually think Venus
is going to win,'' said Williams, whose Open fan club includes
athletes Ricky Williams, Keyshawn Johnson and Rickey Henderson and
is headed up by her loquacious coach and father, Richard, who has
been telling anyone who will listen that his daughters will be
locking horns in the final in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Very much to their liking, Venus Williams and her younger
sibling, the seventh-seeded Serena, landed on opposite sides of the
draw here, and Monday Venus defended the family's tactic of
scheduling its two stars for different tournaments except at the
Grand Slam events. ``If it's a crime, I should be arrested,'' she
joked about her preference for avoiding matches with her sister.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Poutchek, who spent 1994 in the United States
taking her tennis training at the Brooklyn Racquet Club, never got
the chance to avoid Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't difficult at all, especially since I knew I
was much more experienced than her; whenever I faced a break point
or she had a game point, I knew exactly what to do with the ball,''
said Williams, who described herself as eight titles and 61 ranking
spots better than the unseeded rookie who gilded her phenom status
by reaching the 1997 final. ``I have a bigger serve, make better
decisions, cover the net more, things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Williams did not underestimate her unpolished opponent the
way she did this year at the French Open, where another
inexperienced qualifier, 125th-ranked Barbara Schwartz of Austria,
upended her in the fourth round. ``I've learned my lesson; I had to
learn it the hard way, in a Grand Slam,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's most prolific champion, the 27-year-old
Sanchez &UR; - &LR; Vicario, administered a lesson of sorts to Australia's
Jelena Dokic, the Belgrade native who as a 16-year-old qualifier
rode a wave of upsets, including a victory over Hingis in the first
round, to this year's Wimbledon quarterfinals. Down by 4-1 in the
first set, the Spaniard accepted the wind factor, adjusted her
patience quotient, and started making Dokic, last year's Open
junior champion, do all the running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried never to get upset,'' Sanchez &UR; - &LR; Vicario said of her
7-5, 6-1 victory. ``It was difficult with the wind. You have to be
looking at the ball really careful, be very concentrated. As long
as you feel you can compete with them, it's fine,'' she said of the
influx of teen-agers that's rejuvenated the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   Dokic, limited by the Women's Tennis Association's age
eligibility rules to 10 events plus the Grand Slam tournaments,
blamed her defeat on a loss of patience brought on by a lack of
sufficient match play. ``I started making errors and just gave a
lot away,'' she said. ``Knowing you've got five tournaments for the
next eight months, that's a big difference compared to most of the
players who can play as much as they want. At Wimbledon I came
through qualifying, which is much tougher; it was a different
story. It was a different player.''
</P>
<P>
   What Spain's top male player, the eighth-seeded Moya, contended
with Monday was a player with a history of making life difficult
for stars at Grand Slam events. But fortunately for Moya,
22nd-ranked Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia did not temper his game in
the swirling conditions, made 60 unforced errors and paid an
obvious price, a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 6-4 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very windy and very fast, and when you play with windy
conditions, you have to be more conservative because the ball
doesn't go where you want the ball to go,'' Moya said. ``If it's
windy, if it's not windy, he's hitting so hard, he doesn't care
about anything. When he plays well, everything is in; when he plays
bad, he doesn't try to change his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, in a scramble here
with second-seeded Agassi for Pete Sampras' top ranking, was
harried by the wind and a human ball machine of an opponent,
Alberto Martin, but escaped with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind makes my life so miserable, I had to struggle,''
Kafelnikov said, ``but I'm glad I got through.''
</P>
<P>
   The only seeded player who did not get through the first round
Monday was No. 6 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa, who fell by 6-1,
7-5 to Irina Spirlea, the contentious Romanian who exchanged the
infamous semifinal changeover bump with Venus Williams in 1997.

BENNETT HAS JITTERS, BUT ISN'T WORRIED

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA quarterback Drew Bennett figures he'll be as
nervous for his first college start as he was for his first high
school start in 1995. That's good and bad news for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw three (interceptions),'' Bennett recalled, ``but we
won.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-year junior, Bennett isn't worried about his
performance Saturday against Boise State. He knows the system and
the personnel. He's excited, he's eager, and yes, he's nervous. But
he's not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could all change when I get in the game, but right now I
think I'm prepared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he'll be thinking as kickoff approaches, Bennett
said: ``I just hope my palms are dry enough to throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his family will attend the game, he said: ``I told my
brother, who goes to Arizona, to come. In a worst-case scenario,
this could be my only start.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Bennett hasn't lost his sense of humor. Then again,
Cade McNown, whose grit Bennett hopes to emulate, never joked about
failing _ not even during his freshman season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins aren't concerned about Bennett's grasp of the
offense, his athleticism or his arm, which was inconsistent in
training camp. But they don't know what to make of his head: Is he
tough enough? How will he react to the pressure? Will he make the
proper decisions?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``That's the
thing that makes it exciting. He hasn't looked great in practices,
but in scrimmages, he's turned it up a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers: Less than half of UCLA's 1992-93 freshman class
graduated within six years, according to graduation rates released
Monday by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The figures represent a significant drop from the previous year.
While 63 percent of the 1991-92 entering freshman graduated, only
49 percent of the 1992-93 class earned degrees.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA credited part of the decline to the elimination of men's
swimming and men's gymnastics in June of 1994, which prompted a
slew of athletes to transfer. (Transfers count as non-graduates
from their originating school, whether they graduate somewhere else
or not.)
</P>
<P>
   The football team's graduation rate dropped from 65 percent for
the 1992 freshman class to 53 percent for the 1993 class. The men's
basketball team increased its graduation rate from 50 percent for
the 1992 class to 67 percent for the 1993 class: Kevin Dempsey and
Marquis Burns received degrees, while Ike Nwankwo did not.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer update: UCLA will remove the protective boot from
receiver Danny Farmer's sprained left ankle today, and he'll jog
lightly for the first time since suffering the injury 10 days ago.
He's listed as doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Two for two-way: After two weeks of experimentation, it's
official: tailback DeShaun Foster will play safety and receiver
Freddie Mitchell will play cornerback Saturday in passing
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Farmer also practiced with the secondary but will
not play defense.

MANY DISTRICTS COPE WITH SEVERE SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS that qualified teachers tend to clustered in Midwest in 9th
graf of 2nd take.) 
(ATTN: Texas, Fla., D.C., Minn., Wis., Calif., N.Y., Mass.)   (jw) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As children across the United States swarm back to school,
principals from the nation's capital to Palm Beach, Fla., and from
Houston to Los Angeles say they face the most serious teacher
shortage in recent memory, one that has been caused by swelling
enrollments and a push to reduce class sizes while more teachers
are retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not a depleted pool of teachers nationwide: there
are at least 180,000 recent graduates with teaching degrees and
about 80,000 veterans looking for new jobs, enough to fill the
estimated 200,000 teaching vacancies posted in the nation's public
schools since last school year, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The driving issues are geography and expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in states where there are sometimes hundreds of
applicants for one teaching slot, including Minnesota and
Wisconsin, have been largely unwilling to move to those states most
in need, including Texas and California. And even those teachers
game for a change of scenery are often untrained in the subjects
where shortages are greatest: mathematics, science, special
education and bilingual studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is true that at this point, more districts are
feeling the increase in demand,'' said Linda Darling-Hammond, a
professor of education at Stanford University and the director of
the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, a private
organization that has studied the issue closely. ``In some cases
they haven't planned ahead and done aggressive recruiting, and in
others there really is a shortfall.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact has been felt in places large and small, from Texas,
where there are an estimated 20,000 openings, to Belle Glade, Fla.,
a town of migrant citrus farmers near Palm Beach, which was still
searching for two first-grade teachers Monday, two weeks after the
school year began.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of teachers, to say nothing of those trained to teach
in specific subjects, districts and states have stepped up the
competition for candidates in ways that mirror the private sector
and were unheard of even five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Washington, D.C., began offering $1,000 signing
bonuses to applicants certified to teach in the general classroom,
$2,000 for those with a background in special education and $3,000
for anyone demonstrating proficiency in special education and an
additional specialty. These incentives come on top of a $3,700
raise for starting teachers _ to $31,000 this fall from $27,300
last year _ and assorted other sweeteners like $500 for relocation
assistance and $250 for school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, desperate districts persuaded the state Legislature to
pass a law permitting them to rehire recent retirees _ while
allowing the retirees to keep drawing their pensions.
</P>
<P>
   And in the New Haven Unified School District in Union City,
Calif., a district of 14,000 students outside of Oakland, the
effort to attract out-of-town talent has gotten so sophisticated
that candidates are directed to the nearest Kinko's copy shop to be
linked live with district recruiters over video-conferencing lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hired a special-ed teacher from New York through the
video interviewing,'' said Jim O'Laughlin, the personnel director
for the district. ``We've met her on TV, which is the same as
sitting across the table.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City _ which has tended to be among the last
districts in the nation to complete its hiring each year, limiting
its choices _ three early job fairs and a statewide recruiting push
have paid a dividend: the city Board of Education believes it has
has hired enough teachers to reduce class sizes to 25, from 28 or
so, in the fourth through eighth grades in its 40 lowest-performing
schools, district officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But administrators say they have all but abandoned the goal of
replacing hundreds of unlicensed math, science and
special-education teachers in those schools, and elsewhere in the
five boroughs, because of a shortage of interested, qualified
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, numerous factors have conspired to place
other districts in similar straits.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's public-school population, for example, continues to
bulge, with the 50 million students who occupied classrooms in 1995
expected to grow to 54.3 million by 2007, an average increase of
about 358,000 annually, Dr. Darling-Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   To meet that need, districts would have to add 300,000 teachers,
raising the national teaching staff to 3.3 million by 2007, from 3
million in 1995, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that effort is already being hobbled by retirements from
faculties that are unmistakably aging: nearly 1 million teachers
are between the ages of 45 and 53, with hundreds of thousands
expected to retire when they reach 55, if not sooner. In New York
City alone, union officials estimate that 17,000 teachers will
retire after this school year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the widening movement to reduce class sizes.
In California, for example, a mandate to hold class sizes to 20 in
kindergarten through third grade, as well as in ninth-grade English
and math, has been augmented this year to include eighth-grade
English.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Marubayashi, the associate director of the California
Center for Teaching Careers, a state agency, said that about 10
percent of teachers hired by districts statewide, in part to meet
such goals, do not have the proper credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, she said, districts have been hiring candidates
they rejected earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sad story,'' she said. ``But you have to have
someone in front of the class.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Unified School District, which has hired 1,658
teachers for a new school year that starts in two weeks, still has
2,500 to go, district officials said. Of those hired, 58 percent
don't have teaching credentials, the district said.
</P>
<P>
   Many were hired based solely on their experience leading church
or camping groups, said Antonio Garcia, the district's director of
recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked a lot of the field dry last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in combing the nation's young work force for teachers,
districts are often hopelessly outgunned in a thriving economy by
technology and other companies that can sometimes triple a starting
teacher's salary. School districts and such companies are often
competing for the same dwindling pool of students who choose to
major in science or math.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers who specialize in the subjects that are in demand
often would have to move thousands of miles to the nearest
available job. That is because the surpluses of teachers tend to be
clustered in the Midwest, where enrollment is grow- ing more
slowly, while the vacancies  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  are elsewhere,
often in states and inner-city districts that have experi- enced an
influx of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Further aggravating the crisis, those students who do commit to
teaching tend to choose elementary education, English or biology,
among other subjects, where the demand is less acute. And those
most qualified to teach in shortage areas are often among those
least willing to relocate, sometimes thousands of miles to the
nearest available teaching job, particularly if they live in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fairly high percentage of people who do graduate from
teacher prep programs, it may be upwards of 40 percent, don't go
into teaching,'' said Elizabeth Fideler, the executive vice
president and chief operating officer of Recruiting New Teachers, a
Massachusetts firm that works with states and districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiantown Middle School in Indiantown, Fla., near
Okeechobee, needed to hire 17 teachers this year _ to reduce class
sizes, but also to bring in fresh bodies to combat another opponent
that has plagued schools across the country: low test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The school succeeded in filling all jobs, but not without a
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting was very difficult this year because there is such
a shortage out there,'' said Debra Harper, the school principal.
``We had to go outside the county and even the state. Florida was a
major draw for some teachers, and location helped us bring them
down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has not been as lucky, and has had to turn back the clock
to fill its vacancies _ an estimated 20,000 statewide, 300 of them
in Houston alone.
</P>
<P>
   Under an article imploring ``adults 50 and older'' to learn more
about communicating via computer, the Aug. 26 edition of the
``Teacher Retirement System News'' beckons retirees of the Texas
school system to ``return to teaching on as much as a full-time
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a recently passed state law, the retirees must be
qualified in a shortage area, and have been out of the classroom
for as long as 12 months, to keep their pension payments flowing.
State officials had no immediate sense of how many retirees had
taken districts up on the offer. &QL;

<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ Proud, optimistic, determined to have the last
word, almost all the registered voters here in East Timor cast
their ballots Monday in a referendum on the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the U.N.-sponsored process began nearly
four months ago, it was a day largely free of violence and
intimidation by military-backed militias determined to block what
seems to be a growing momentum for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations announced Tuesday morning that 98.6 percent
of the 450,000 registered voters had cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This massive voter turnout is proof, absolute proof, that the
cam- paign of intimidation, violence and threats that attempted to
destabilize this process was a complete failure,'' said David
Wimhurst, the chief spokesman for the United Nations here.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Monday was on whether to accept an offer by President
B.J. Habibie of a new, autonomous status within Indonesia. In
January, Habibie announced that if the offer was rejected,
Indonesia would simply let East Timor go free.
</P>
<P>
   The day's only serious violence was the stabbing death of an
East Timorese who had been working for the United Nations in the
small western town of Ermera as he was on his way home at the end
of the day, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The overall atmosphere of calm drew a cheer from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who sent his ``warmest
congratulations'' to the people of this former Portuguese colony
that was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and has fought a separatist
insurgency ever since.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official said it would take about a week for the votes to
be counted, for the process to be evaluated by an independent panel
and for Annan to make a determination on whether to endorse the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy today,'' said Fatima Desa, 17, trying out her
high school English as she waited to vote in her Bugs Bunny
T-shirt. ``I am happy because I am East Timorese and this is my
country.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat said Monday's heavy turnout _
estimated by the United Nations at more than 90 percent of the
450,000 registered voters _ indicated a likely victory for full
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Valenzuela, deputy chief of the United Nations electoral
office, said the heavy turnout indicated a likely victory for full
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The most extraordinary development of the day was the sudden
absence from the scene of the anti-independence militias that have
terrorized East Timor for months. These ragtag thugs have been
organized, armed and protected by the Indonesian military as a last
stand in its 24-year battle to subdue this territory of 800,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven of the country's 850 polling places were forced to
suspend operations for brief periods because of small disturbances
or rumors of possible trouble, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
   Carina Pirelli, chief of the Electoral Assistance Division at
the U.N. in New York, said of the seven shutdowns, ``I would not
rate them as high-intensity incidents.'' All reopened and completed
their voting procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's special representative to East Timor, Jamsheed Marker,
was full of praise for the ``superb'' performance of the police,
who have appeared unable and unwilling to confront the militias
until now.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Martin, director of the U.N. mission here, attributed the
sudden professionalism of the security forces to foreign pressure.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Jakarta-based diplomat who is observing the vote said:
``I think there has genuinely been a lot of heat put on the police
and military from Jakarta. Finally they have become convinced that
the world is focusing on them and their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has been pretty unscrupulous about pushing for
the pro-autonomy forces to win. But it's looking like they may be
prepared to accept a loss and go on to other problems, of which
they have plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the military has resisted Habibie's notion of letting
East Timor go is a fear that this could encourage a number of other
separatist movements that have gained momentum in this period of
weak government and military disarray in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is in the midst of a long and politically
debilitating electoral process that is due to produce a new
president by the end of the year. The same assembly _ known by its
Indonesian initials as the M.P.R. _ that will vote on the
presidency must also vote on whether to accept the results of
Monday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Marker said this would be essentially a formality. Given
political realities, he said, ``it will be very difficult if not
impossible for the M.P.R. to reverse whatever the result.''
</P>
<P>
   For many voters, though, the question was a more simple one of
pride in their national identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last we have a chance to decide for ourselves,'' said Joao
Batiste, 30, a pro-independence supporter who voted Monday in a
neighborhood of Dili that has been terrorized for months by the
militias. ``I have been waiting for this moment for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Zeka da Costa, 20, said, ``After fighting for 24
years, our time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Their pride was tinged with defiance in their neighborhood on
the eastern edge of Dili, where hundreds of the people who were
voting Monday had fled into the nearby hills after a rampage by the
militias on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the people here, dressed in their threadbare Sunday
best, it was a day of intense emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Florentina dos Santos arrived at the polling place wearing black
mourning clothes and carrying a framed photograph of her husband of
just two days, Virgilio, who was shot dead on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wiping away tears, she held out the photograph of her husband,
smiling under his baseball cap, and begged, in vain, to be allowed
to cast his vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   A little later a tiny white ambulance arrived. Two nuns emerged,
along with a stretcher carrying Ussulau de Jesus Cepeda, 23, who
was wounded in the same militia attack.
</P>
<P>
   As they carried him in to vote, with his intravenous drip
dangling above him, Cepeda looked around and said: ``I want
freedom. It's now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Monday, Annan affirmed the commitment of the
United Nations to provide an interim administration to East Timor
whether it chooses independence or autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   During its quarter century of control here, Indonesia has simply
taken over the tasks of government administration and technical
expertise that are needed for a functioning state.
</P>
<P>
   Those outside experts will be withdrawn whether East Timor
becomes independent or autonomous, a status in which Indonesia
would cede control of everything except defense, foreign relations
and some judicial and financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The hope of a new East Timor may lie with people like Teraja
Dorego, a student, who stood patiently in a long line of voters,
holding her laminated registration card.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole family is voting for independence, and all my friends
too,'' said Miss Dorego, who was wearing her best gray sweater. ``I
want independence because I am East Timorese and we want to have
our own country.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 17, Miss Dorego is at the minimum age for voting. She
represents the future in this remote and utterly poor land where as
many as 80 percent of the people cannot read or write.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she hoped to be when she grows up, she smiled and
whispered, ``I want to be a doctor.''

SHIFT IN BULLPEN WORKOUTS PAYS OFF FOR DREIFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers pitching coach Claude Osteen
said right-hander Darren Dreifort has pitched well for the past
month because of improved bullpen work.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort said that improvement stems mostly from his shifting
the day he throws in the bullpen from the second to third day after
a start.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort has strengthened his chances of remaining in the
starting rotation when manager Davey Johnson and general manager
Kevin Malone sit down to discuss the matter in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dreifort took the loss in allowing four earned runs
in 71/3 innings, he's been everything scouts thought he would be as
a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Osteen said if he were asked for a recommendation on whether
Dreifort should be a starter or reliever, right now he'd speak in
favor of starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here he would throw a pen and was all over
the place,'' Osteen said. ``Now he comes down there and throws it
(with pinpoint accuracy). It comes from controlling himself.
Darren's a big guy, and there's a lot of leg work, a lot of timing.
He's gotten nothing but better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort is trying not to overanalyze why he's pitched well
lately _ he has a 3.59 ERA in his past six starts _ but it
definitely relates to his success in the bullpen between starts.
After the All-Star break he changed his workout pattern, and that's
when he began to feel a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm feels like (garbage) the second day, and the third day
it feels great,'' Dreifort said. ``On the second day my arm is
tired and I'm not able to throw the ball and feel it. Now, it feels
much better and your work is much better then.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's inability to bounce back quickly after pitching is,
ironically, what has kept him in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson thought about using Dreifort out of the bullpen before
the season, but the team's medical staff advised against it.
Dreifort missed the 1995 season after having reconstructive surgery
to repair a torn medial collateral ligament in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The question lingers, but Dreifort has pitched into the eighth
inning in each of his past three starts. He's 2-1 with a 2.59 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The progress he's made in the last three or four starts, where
he's gone deep into the game with a low pitch count, that's a
starter,'' Johnson said. ``The overthrowing, throwing 110 pitches
in five or six innings, that's a reliever.''
</P>
<P>
   Minimal call-ups: The Dodgers have apparently scrapped plans to
call up middle infielders Adam Riggs, Alex Cora and Juan Castro
when rosters are expanded Wednesday, primarily because there won't
be much playing time for them since the Dodgers are already
overloaded in that area.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers do call the three up, it will be interesting to
see if any of those names surface in trade talks during the
offseason. Johnson has said on numerous occasions he wants to be
able to take a look at any player who could help the club in the
future in order to avoid another Roger Cedeno incident. Cora, Riggs
and Castro would fit into that category, even though playing time
would be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding roster: The Dodgers are expected to activate infielder
Tripp Cromer, on the disabled list since July 6 (retroactive to
July 5) with an irregular heartbeat, when rosters expand. Triple-A
Pitchers Jeff Kubenka, Jamie Arnold, Jeff Williams, Carlos Perez
and Double-A pitcher Eric Gagne are also expected to join the
Dodgers. But the team could wait until Triple-A Albuquerque ends
its season next week to promote players.
</P>
<P>
   In closing: The Dodgers announced they renewed working
agreements one more season with Double-A San Antonio, Single-A San
Bernardino, short-season Single-A Yakima and Great Falls of the
rookie Pioneer League.... Devon White, mired in a 4-for-47 slump,
returned to the lineup after resting for two days.

   HOUSTON _ To see the out-of-town scoreboard from the visitors'
dugout at the Astrodome, the New York Mets have to crane their
necks hard to the left, but only if they are willing to concede
that they have a tiny bit of interest in a series being played
between Cincinnati and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   No Met has been willing to admit to scoreboard watching in
recent weeks, but Edgardo Alfonzo gave his teammates frequent
excuses to swing their heads in that direction Monday night,
hitting three home runs over the left field wall in a display that
had his otherwise bored teammates leaping off their bench with
astonishing regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Using a barrage of power as deadening and insistent as punches
in a heavyweight bout, the Mets bludgeoned Houston, 17-1, at the
Astrodome. Alfonzo had a record-breaking night, going 6 for 6,
knocking in five runs and scoring six times. His six hits broke a
Mets single-game record by one, and his 15 total bases surpassed by
two the previous record.
</P>
<P>
   With Cincinnati's 11-3 win over Atlanta, the Mets gain a game on
the Braves and are just 2 1/2 behind in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who set season highs for runs scored and hits (21),
remain three games up on the Reds in the wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo had never had a three-home-run game before and he picked
a propitious time to become a McGwiresque slugger. The Mets had
been staggered a bit by two losses to Arizona _ a potential
postseason opponent _ but Alfonzo had been hitting well on this
road trip, going 4 for 13 before this game. Still, the Mets had
cause for concern. They had lost ground to the Braves in the last
two days.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to manager Bobby Valentine's concerns was Mike Piazza's
sore left shoulder; Valentine waited until batting practice to see
if Piazza was feeling loose enough for him to be in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo soon eased Valentine's fears. With his first swing of
the bat on the second pitch he saw from Shane Reynolds in the first
inning, Alfonzo single-handedly produced as many runs as all the
Astros would in the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds faced the Mets last week at Shea Stadium and lost
there, too. Alfonzo's solo shot opened up a gusher of offense that
the Astros were helpless to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton opened the second inning with a home run and,
after Roger Cedeno singled, advanced on a Masato Yoshii sacrifice
and then stole third (his first successful steal since Aug. 10).
Rickey Henderson then drove in the Mets' third run of the game.
Alfonzo was back for a single and he and Henderson came home on an
Olerud double.
</P>
<P>
   Up came Piazza, who said before the game that his sore shoulder
was fine. To prove his point, he blasted a batting-practice- like
bomb for the Mets' sixth and seventh runs.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo was hitting .311 before the game, and he had set a
career high with his 18th home run on Aug. 15. But Alfonzo is
primarily a singles hitter. He is regarded as a delightful teammate
who gracefully embraced the arrival of Robin Ventura, which forced
his move to second base this season, and he is a defensive whiz in
a spectacular infield. A potential most- valuable-player? Sure. But
a threat to go deep every night? No. Before this season, he had
never hit more than 17 home runs or driven in more than 78 runs.
Those figures have now been obliterated. With his five RBIs Monday
night, he has 94 already this season.
</P>
<P>
   Of his 159 hits entering the game, only 36 were doubles and 20
were home runs. So who could have foreseen that Alfonzo would
singlehandedly give everyone a reason to keep paying attention to
this snoozer. With Rickey Henderson already on base in the fourth,
Alfonzo smashed a 1-2 pitch for his second home run, which gave him
the club record for home runs by a second baseman. In the sixth
inning, Alfonzo hit his 23rd home run of the season for his fourth
hit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He tied a club record for three home runs in the game _ the last
person to do it was Gary Carter in 1985 _ and his 16 total bases
(he had two singles and a double in addition to the homers in a 6-6
evening) broke a record Darryl Strawberry set in 1985.

OZ ENTERTAINMENT PROVIDES DETAILS ON THEME PARK FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACE HOBSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DE SOTO, Kan. _ Oz Entertainment Co. documents released Monday
provide a detailed look at how the company plans to finance a $761
million theme park big and bold enough to rival Disney.
</P>
<P>
   The company's financing plan for the Wonderful World of Oz
involves $433.6 million in private financing and investment and
$327.5 million in property and sales tax bonds, public grants and
infrastructure improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The net economic effect (of Oz) is extraordinarily positive
for all levels of government and the economy, so a public-private
partnership is a reasonable request,'' said David Westbrook, an Oz
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But one new part of the Oz financing plan could create
controversy. The company plans to ask for a property tax abatement.
Johnson County officials, who in the past have been skeptical of
property tax breaks, would have to approve the abatement.
</P>
<P>
   The company would pay about $2.25 million a year in property
taxes to the De Soto School District, as required by state law, and
would pay a fee to the county for some services. But it wants the
county to waive all other county property taxes. How much that
would save Oz is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Oz financing plan was contained in a binder of documents the
company provided Friday to the Kansas Development Finance
Authority. The documents were released to the public Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The authority will use the documents _ including a feasibility
study and a redevelopment plan _ to decide whether to issue the tax
increment financing bonds and sales tax revenue bonds for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The authority has been negotiating with the federal government
and Oz for a year to allow Oz to acquire the U.S. Army's former
ammunition plant at Sunflower near De Soto, Kan., in exchange for
cleaning it of environmental hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal, and the Oz company's financing package, are
nearing completion, according to state officials and Oz
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest plan, Oz would agree to buy $8.8 million in
insurance to guarantee that the cleanup gets done. Oz plans to
spend an additional $32 million to $40 million on the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   If the cleanup is less than $32 million, Oz would have to pay
the federal government the difference. That means Oz must pay at
least $32 million for the 9,065-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   The state finance authority board is scheduled to vote Sept. 10
to issue a resolution of intent to create a redevelopment district
at Sunflower. The step is necessary for the authority to issue
bonds for the project but does not mean the board will approve the
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds are a key part of the Oz financing plan, a complex mix
of equity, bank debt, tax-exempt bonds, public infrastructure
improvements and economic development grants.
</P>
<P>
   The total project cost is now estimated at $761 million, down
slightly from previous estimates of $771 million.
</P>
<P>
   The financing plan includes:
</P>
<P>
   - $202,048,000 in sales tax revenue bonds to be issued by the
Kansas Development Finance Authority. The bonds, commonly known as
STAR bonds, would be repaid with sales tax revenue at the park and
all of the Sunflower site, once it is developed. The bonds would be
issued to private investors and would not carry any guarantees from
the state.
</P>
<P>
   - $70,461,000 in property tax increment financing bonds. This is
a new request; Oz has said for the last year that it did not plan
to ask for tax increment financing. Oz will ask the state's finance
authority to issue bonds to be repaid with 60 percent to 80 percent
of the property tax assessed on the theme park, RV park, campground
and Emerald Resort, which includes a hotel and golf course.
</P>
<P>
   - $222,355,000 in senior construction debt and $24,731,000 in a
senior construction debt service reserve fund.
</P>
<P>
   This debt could come in the form of bank financing, possibly a
traditional financial institution; privately placed bond debt
issued to investors; and//or first mortgage bonds, in which the
bondholder takes a lien on the theme park property.
</P>
<P>
   - $56,409,000 in stock.
</P>
<P>
   - $57,252,000 in leases from vendors at the park, such as ride
companies that rent space.
</P>
<P>
   - $5 million in infrastructure financing by a vendor who would
build an energy plant at the site for heating, cooling and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   - $20 million in economic development incentives from the
federal and Kansas governments in the form of investment tax
credits.
</P>
<P>
   - $67,874,000 in financing by a developer of the resort project.
Oz plans to work with another developer to build the resort.
</P>
<P>
   - $35 million in state and local financing for infrastructure
improvements. The state would spend $23 million to improve a Kansas
10 interchange near the park; the county would spend $4 million to
build an east-west arterial road near the park; and the county or
the city of De Soto would spend $8 million for sewers at the site.
The spending has not been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Oz originally estimated it would need $270 million in STAR
bonds. The amount was lowered to $202 million because interest
rates have increased 1.5 percent in recent months, Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the higher interest rate, the expected sales tax
revenue would not be enough to cover $270 million in bonds; the new
market could support only $202 million, Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Oz is asking for tax increment financing bonds because of the
interest rate increases and the decrease in the STAR bond request,
Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax increment is the increase in property taxes assessed on
the land due to the new development. Because the land was federal
property and was not taxed, the increment in this case is 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the balance of property taxes, Oz would pay the
county a set fee for fire, ambulance and police protection at the
site. The report released Monday estimates that the fee would be
$1.8 million once attendance at the park stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   The development authority would not issue any tax increment
financing bonds without the county's approval, said Rebecca Floyd,
the authority's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   County Commissioner Johnna Lingle, whose district covers the
Sunflower site, said she remained opposed to granting Oz a property
tax break.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said before, `Just what part of ``no'' don't you
understand?' '' Lingle said. ``But I can only speak for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lingle said the property tax abatement was inappropriate because
Oz would get other state and local financing help, including the
STAR bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Other commissioners could not be reached for comment Monday or
said they did not know enough about the plan to comment.
</P>
<P>
   County Counselor Don Jarrett said the County Commission
historically has not favored property tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Oz expects the theme park and resort to generate $195 million
its first year, based on projections of 3.2 million visitors. Oz
plans to open the park in May 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Once attendance stabilizes at 3.8 million guests by 2005,
revenue should be $266 million, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   To break even, the park and resort would need to generate $139
million in the first year and $165 million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The feasibility study included in the documents estimated that
the project would bring in $161 million to Kansas and $230.5
million a year to the metropolitan region in economic activity _
after the cost of all public financing.
</P>
<P>
   The project would have an economic return to the Kansas City
area eight times the annual public investment, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said the finance authority plans to hire an accounting
firm to review the study and examine whether its predictions of Oz
revenues and attendance were reasonable.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHAT MCGWIRE'S MISSING OUT ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BBA-YANKS-OAKLAND) 
(mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark McGwire, who last year had the single greatest
home run-hitting season in baseball history and is threatening to
go there again, is envious of Jason Giambi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has said it a lot of times,'' Giambi said. Not that he is
envious, Giambi said, but the reason for his envy. ``When he was
here, he'd say there's nothing like being on a winning team. In the
situation he's in, he's not winning. We talk once or twice a week.
He talks about it all the time. He's so excited for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Giambi is an integral part of the Oakland Athletics' success
this season, the kind of success McGwire's Cardinals have not had.
The Athletics, for whom McGwire used to play, are near the front of
the American League wild-card race. The Cardinals, despite
McGwire's 51 home runs, are fighting a losing fight to have a .500
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics are one of the best stories of the season, maybe
the best. They came to New York Monday night with a 25-man roster
that earns $20 million this season. They opened a four-game series
with the Yankees, whose 25-man roster earns $86 million. Yet these
same teams could meet again at Yankee Stadium the first week of
October in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Giambi, the team leader in batting
average (.316) and runs batted in (99). ``This is my fifth year and
just about every year we finished last. Now to be here, especially
not to have been picked to be here, when people said we were going
to lose 100 games and we were going to be a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke is on those teams like the Baltimore Orioles and the
Los Angeles Dodgers, who have payrolls flirting with $80 million
and can't play well enough to salvage their dignity. Here is the
team with the fifth-lowest payroll in the major leagues, and it has
a good chance to play postseason baseball.
</P>
<P>
   They are in this position because of ``veterans'' like Giambi
and Matt Stairs, a reclamation project like John Jaha, young
players like Miguel Tejada, Eric Chavez and Ben Grieve and a
starting pitching rotation that has led the Athletics to the No. 3
spot among the league's lowest earned run averages.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hudson, at 24 years old the youngest of the team's starting
pitchers, began the series against the Yankees Monday night, taking
an 8-1 record and team-leading 3.27 era into the game. (The Yankees
won the game, 7-4.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anybody with the mound presence he has,''
Giambi said. ``He never gets rattled. Of course, he's never pitched
in New York. That's a big difference. But he went up against Pedro
Martinez and beat Pedro, and he went up against Randy Johnson and
beat him. That's pretty good to put on your resume in your first
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Oakland resume that is undergoing perhaps the most
impressive upgrading this season is the one belonging to the
general manager, Billy Beane. Taking the meager amount of money at
his disposal, Beane has scrapped and scrambled and dealt his way up
the ladder, surpassing the relatively inept efforts of general
managers with far more millions to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Beane, only 37 years old and 10 years removed from his own
playing career, did some of his best scrambling in the past several
weeks, making a series of trades for the starting pitchers Kevin
Appier and Omar Olivares, relievers Jason Isringhausen and Greg
McMichael, second baseman Randy Velarde and outfielder Rich Becker.
The trades cost the Athletics only two established players _
starter Kenny Rogers and Billy Taylor, who had been the team's
closer.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't simply that Beane made those trades; it was how he
went about them that also explains one of the strengths of these
Athletics. He actually solicited the opinion of two players, Giambi
and Stairs, before making the moves. ``We had a hand in every
trade,'' Giambi said. ``That Billy Beane has that much respect for
us is unbelievable. What do you think? Is it going to kill team
chemistry. What about this guy, what about that guy?''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Phillips, whose signing had represented another of Beane's
shrewd off-season moves, broke a leg earlier this month, and Beane
immediately consulted his two players. ``He came to us,'' Giambi
said, ``and said, `I have four guys on the table I can get right
now. Which guy do you like?' We picked Rich Becker. We said that's
who we want, and he went out and got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks earlier, Beane consulted Giambi and Stairs about a
more sensitive and critical matter. Rogers, the team's No. 1
pitcher, had asked to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called us in Seattle and told us Kenny wanted to be
traded,'' Giambi said. ``He said, `Is it going to kill the team
chemistry?' At the time, all he could get was two minor leaguers.
He wanted to know how the team would feel about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beane made the trade with the Mets and then turned around and
acquired Olivares and Appier. The Athletics won nine of 10 games
after their arrival, moving from four games back to one game behind
in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the man overseeing the Athletics' climb had also been
the subject of a conversation between the general manager and the
players. Manager Art Howe's contract was up at the end of last
season, and he appeared to be on his way out. ``Jason and I decided
to go to Billy and tell him what we thought,'' Stairs said. ``If we
were going to be around for the next three years, we wanted to know
what was going on with the manager. We wanted to tell him how we
felt toward skip.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Athletics reach the playoffs with their $20 million
payroll and Beane is named executive of the year, he might have to
share the award with Giambi and Stairs.

<HEADLINE>
REPORT LOOKS AT WIDENING WAGE GAP BETWEEN WORKERS AND CEOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If entry-level wages had risen this decade on par with the
skyrocketing pay of U.S. chief executives, the minimum wage would
be $22.08 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It's $5.15.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the pay disparities cited by United for a Fair
Economy and the Institute for Policy Studies in a jointly published
report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another:
</P>
<P>
   ``If average production worker pay had risen at the same rate as
CEO pay between 1990 and 1998, (average production) worker pay
would be $110,399 today, rather than the current $29,267.''
</P>
<P>
   The report continues the groups' efforts to fight the widening
income gap between America's wealthiest bosses and the rank and
file.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, CEO pay jumped 481 percent from 1990 to
1998, compared with a 28 percent increase in average worker pay.
Corporate profits rose 108 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations' sixth annual executive compensation survey,
this year titled ``A Decade of Executive Excess: The 1990s,'' draws
from several national surveys to blast the widening wage gap. For
example:
</P>
<P>
   - Business Week magazine found that in 1998, CEOs at the 365
largest U.S. corporations were paid 419 times the average
blue-collar worker's pay _ $10.6 million compared with $25,000. In
1990, the ratio was 120-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   - Towers Perrin, a benefits and management consulting firm,
found that CEOs of U.S. firms with annual revenue of $250 million
to $500 million made 123 percent more than their peers in 22 other
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much is enough?'' the report asked, pointing out the
phenomenal wealth of some CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, Berkshire Hathaway CEO
Warren Buffett, and Microsoft alumnus Paul Allen had combined
wealth of $156 billion,'' the report said. ``This topped the
combined GNPs of the poorest 43 nations on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Salary and bonus accounted for only 20 percent of CEO
compensation, with exercised stock options making up the biggest
share. (Even Buffett is on record criticizing the mushrooming of
CEO pay through stock options.)
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who compiled ``Executive Excess'' said CEOs of large
U.S. companies received an average compensation package of $10.6
million in 1998, up 36 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Average blue-collar wages rose 2.7 percent in the same
year-to-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The report summarizes the timeworn debate about measuring an
individual's worth:
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of top CEO pay say proven business leaders create
billions of dollars in shareholder value and are worth what they're
paid. Critics argue that workers who produce the goods and services
are the real creators of shareholder value and should be rewarded
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   But workers wages have not kept pace with the productivity gains
of U.S. businesses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the average hourly wage had tracked the 32.8 percent
increase in productivity between 1973 and 1998, it would have been
$18.10 an hour in 1998, rather than $12.77,'' the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The groups contend that failure to reign in U.S. executive pay
puts the nation's businesses at a financial disadvantage to global
competitors, that stock option compensation places undue emphasis
on short-term results and that there's a depressing effect on
workplace morale when the CEO prospers out of proportion to the
work force.
</P>
<P>
   While dumping on ``undeserving'' CEOs, the report also
recognized two CEOs for refusing bonuses at times when their
employees were being laid off or hadn't received raises in years.
But Boeing CEO Phil Condit and US Airways CEO Stephen M. Wolf still
earned $3 million and $10.9 million without their bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal, author of the Crystal Report and a national
authority on executive compensation, says the focus on CEO pay is
appropriate. Overpaying CEOs, he contends, leads to overpaying
other officers down the line and, eventually, the sum of
overpayments hurts the company's profits or stock value.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the full report are available for $5, plus $1.50
shipping, by writing to 1998 Executive Excess Report, United for a
Fair Economy, 37 Temple Place, 5th Floor, Boston, MA 02111.

ASCENT OF NORTHRIDGE'S KEARIN IS PART WORK, PART TIMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Listening to Jeff Kearin's amazing Forrest
Gump-like tales, an image becomes clear of the man who took over
the Cal State Northridge football program in July:
</P>
<P>
   He's always been the right guy in the right place at the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' Kearin said. ``This whole business is about
timing. A lot of what we do is left to chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine these stories, all true, Kearin can tell his future
grandchildren:
</P>
<P>
   _Late in 1990, Kearin got a call from George Allen, the Pro
Football Hall of Famer who was then coaching Long Beach State.
Allen knew that Kearin, then an assistant coach at Loyola High,
wanted to move up to the college ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Allen) gave me a couple of projects to do and I did them
well,'' Kearin said. ``He wanted some film converted to video. I
couldn't figure out how to do it, so finally I just went to
Hollywood and paid $50 to have it done. He was all fired up that I
was resourceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later Allen died of a heart attack. Kearin was the
last man to see him alive; he dropped the coach off at home the
night before.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin suddenly had no job. But he soon was hired as a graduate
assistant at USC by head coach Larry Smith, whose son Corby went to
Loyola.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Larry felt sorry for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _On a warm June day in 1994, Kearin was the only USC football
staff member in Heritage Hall when police officers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin was told he needed to remove O.J. Simpson's Heisman
Trophy from its display case. At that moment, Simpson was leading
the cops on a low-speed chase on the freeways of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin took the trophy out of the case and hid it for a day. He
did exactly what the LAPD had asked. He would later be known as the
person who ``stole'' the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was famous for 15 minutes,'' Kearin said. ``My brother sent
me a newspaper from France that had my picture.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple years later, Kearin learned more about Simpson than he
cared to know. He lived in an apartment above the garage of Bob
Baker, a family friend who was Simpson's defense lawyer in his
civil trial.
</P>
<P>
   _Last December, Kearin was asked by his mentor, former USC coach
John Robinson, to join Robinson's staff at Nevada-Las Vegas as
tight ends and special-teams coach.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin took the job, but he said he didn't really like Las Vegas
and he felt alienated as one of two coaches on staff who were
single.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, CSUN head coach Ron Ponciano was fired and
Kearin was hired, this time as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Some guys have all the luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they say? `Better lucky than dumb,'?'' Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   So here is Kearin, four days away from his first game as CSUN's
interim head coach, wondering if he made the smart decision to
leave a full-time assistant's position at UNLV to take a job he
will have to reapply for in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take some leaps of faith,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin interviewed for the CSUN head coaching position twice in
the past three years and didn't get it. But Dick Dull, Northridge's
athletic director, said he didn't hesitate in his decision to give
Kearin the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a natural,'' Dull said. ``(Kearin) has incredible
charisma. He knew this place. I knew very well that he was an
accommodating person.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin isn't Ponciano, whose contract was terminated in July
after a university investigation uncovered violations of NCAA and
CSUN policy. He grows weary, though, of rumors and innuendo that he
had a hand in Ponciano's firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by Ron,'' Kearin said. ``The way it went down makes it
hard. I've confronted Ron with (the rumors). I wanted to assure him
that I could not or would not be disloyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't control what other people believe or say.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano brought intensity to the job. He's not afraid to beat
down a player or a coach in practice; Ponciano has a stare that
could melt a 300-pound offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin hates confrontation and rarely loses his temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two totally different personalities,'' said Jaumal Bradley, a
senior running back who was close to Ponciano. ``A lot of the
younger, quieter players may not have known how to approach Coach
Ponciano.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin was a part-time assistant at Loyola, his alma mater, for
11 years under head coach Steve Grady. Grady, who encouraged Kearin
to pursue coaching full-time in the mid-1980s, described Kearin as
``a loyal person that would do anything you ask with a smile on his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Dull wants a head coach who knows how to work within the
framework of the athletic department. He's found a calm presence in
Kearin, a former law student who thrives on problem-solving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had an `in-charge' role in a lot of areas,''
Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kearin) has made the situation very, very comfortable,''
Bradley said. ``He's a perfect fit, coming into this situation,
with his rapport with the administration, his rapport with the
staff and his rapport with the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin, 39, thrives on preparation. He says he likes the
strategy of football and the concept of team effort. He says his
admiration probably comes from his law background.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, getting ready for a game is just like
getting ready for a case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His opening argument is Saturday at North Campus Stadium against
Western Oregon.

COLUMN: LEARNING TO BE AT EASE WITH STUTTERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Reitzes has stuttered for as long as he can
remember, which is just about all of his 27 years. Until a few
years ago, his was a life of avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   In school, he found ways to lie low if he thought the teacher
would call on him. He would not approach girls for fear of
embarrassing himself. Like many stutterers, he steered clear of any
problem-laden word. He would not say ``Freud'' in a college
psychology course because getting past the ``F'' was like wrestling
with the devil.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes his stutter determined what he ate, said Reitzes, who
is pursuing a master's degree in speech therapy at New York
University. ``I'd go to a restaurant and order a hot dog even
though I may have wanted spaghetti,'' he said. ``The only reason
was that I could say `hot dog.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuttering is more about what you don't say than what you do
say,'' he said at a picnic that two dozen New Yorkers went to on
Sunday in Commack, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   This gathering was no different from countless late-summer
barbecues, except in one respect. Just about everyone in Tom and
Lee Caggiano's back yard stuttered, including their son, Michael,
16. Or they were relatives of stutterers, and knew what it was like
to see loved ones live for years with a deep sense of shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, we just couldn't talk about stuttering,''
said David Steiner, 41, a New York lawyer. ``It was this dirty
little secret, only it really wasn't much of a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   But that part is history, he said. The same goes for Reitzes.
Not that his stutter is gone. Hardly. But he has come to allow
himself to stutter as he may, instead of avoiding words and awkward
situations. Now that he stutters openly, he finds himself
stuttering much less often. The paralyzing fear is gone.
</P>
<P>
   How immobilizing can that fear be? C. Woodruff Starkweather, a
speech-language pathologist, told of a man he knew who endured
terrible headaches because his eyeglass prescription was wrong. The
reason, Starkweather said, was that when this man read an eye
chart, he would identify only the letters he could say, not those
he could see.
</P>
<P>
   If that kind of pain was on the picnic menu, so were triumphs.
Reitzes said that he had improved so much that he sometimes
stammered deliberately, as he does on his answering machine. ``Take
as much time as you n-n-need,'' his recorded message begins. He
went out of his way to stumble on ``need,'' he said, to alert
stuttering callers that they were in friendly territory.
</P>
<P>
   The picnic was sponsored by two support groups: the
well-established National Stuttering Project, and a relatively new
organization, Friends, which is aimed at young stutterers like
Michael Caggiano.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there are support groups for every imaginable
disorder. But the stutterers said they felt that they especially
needed one because they had spent long years in isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very alone when growing up,'' said Jeff Shames, 43, who
is working on a television documentary called ``Stutter Step.'' It
was a remark heard from more than one picnicker. As a boy, Shames
thought that stuttering was ``a basic flaw'' and that ``I wasn't
worth people's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he avoids _ most of the time, anyway _ the common
tendency to switch words when stuck. ``It's my right,'' Shames
said, ``to take as much time as I need to get the word out.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing a support group does is help people see that their
problem does not necessarily rule out success. There have been many
famous stutterers, from Winston Churchill (who could surely turn a
phrase) to James Earl Jones (just try making fun of Darth Vader).
</P>
<P>
   The hows and whys of stuttering are ``all so individual,'' Rina
Moskowitz, a kindergarten teacher in Manhattan, said at the picnic.
Some people do not stammer on the phone, others all the time. Some
stutter horribly when angry, others never. Ms. Moskowitz has no
problem when talking to her pupils _ ``maybe because they're not
judgmental,'' she said. Conversations with parents are another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The picnickers said that, sure, they would love to wake up
tomorrow with tongues unknotted. But that is unlikely to happen.
``Nowadays, we are more interested in being accepted as stutterers
instead of chasing the fluency god,'' Steiner said, a point that
Reitzes echoed.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, he was eating a hot dog. He really wanted one. It
was not merely a substitute for spaghetti.

REPORT LOOKS AT WIDENING WAGE GAP BETWEEN WORKERS AND CEOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If entry-level wages had risen this decade on par with the
skyrocketing pay of U.S. chief executives, the minimum wage would
be $22.08 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It's $5.15.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the pay disparities cited by United for a Fair
Economy and the Institute for Policy Studies in a jointly published
report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another:
</P>
<P>
   ``If average production worker pay had risen at the same rate as
CEO pay between 1990 and 1998, (average production) worker pay
would be $110,399 today, rather than the current $29,267.''
</P>
<P>
   The report continues the groups' efforts to fight the widening
income gap between America's wealthiest bosses and the rank and
file.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, CEO pay jumped 481 percent from 1990 to
1998, compared with a 28 percent increase in average worker pay.
Corporate profits rose 108 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations' sixth annual executive compensation survey,
this year titled ``A Decade of Executive Excess: The 1990s,'' draws
from several national surveys to blast the widening wage gap. For
example:
</P>
<P>
   - Business Week magazine found that in 1998, CEOs at the 365
largest U.S. corporations were paid 419 times the average
blue-collar worker's pay _ $10.6 million compared with $25,000. In
1990, the ratio was 120-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   - Towers Perrin, a benefits and management consulting firm,
found that CEOs of U.S. firms with annual revenue of $250 million
to $500 million made 123 percent more than their peers in 22 other
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much is enough?'' the report asked, pointing out the
phenomenal wealth of some CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, Berkshire Hathaway CEO
Warren Buffett, and Microsoft alumnus Paul Allen had combined
wealth of $156 billion,'' the report said. ``This topped the
combined GNPs of the poorest 43 nations on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Salary and bonus accounted for only 20 percent of CEO
compensation, with exercised stock options making up the biggest
share. (Even Buffett is on record criticizing the mushrooming of
CEO pay through stock options.)
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who compiled ``Executive Excess'' said CEOs of large
U.S. companies received an average compensation package of $10.6
million in 1998, up 36 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Average blue-collar wages rose 2.7 percent in the same
year-to-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The report summarizes the timeworn debate about measuring an
individual's worth:
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of top CEO pay say proven business leaders create
billions of dollars in shareholder value and are worth what they're
paid. Critics argue that workers who produce the goods and services
are the real creators of shareholder value and should be rewarded
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   But workers wages have not kept pace with the productivity gains
of U.S. businesses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the average hourly wage had tracked the 32.8 percent
increase in productivity between 1973 and 1998, it would have been
$18.10 an hour in 1998, rather than $12.77,'' the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The groups contend that failure to reign in U.S. executive pay
puts the nation's businesses at a financial disadvantage to global
competitors, that stock option compensation places undue emphasis
on short-term results and that there's a depressing effect on
workplace morale when the CEO prospers out of proportion to the
work force.
</P>
<P>
   While dumping on ``undeserving'' CEOs, the report also
recognized two CEOs for refusing bonuses at times when their
employees were being laid off or hadn't received raises in years.
But Boeing CEO Phil Condit and US Airways CEO Stephen M. Wolf still
earned $3 million and $10.9 million without their bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal, author of the Crystal Report and a national
authority on executive compensation, says the focus on CEO pay is
appropriate. Overpaying CEOs, he contends, leads to overpaying
other officers down the line and, eventually, the sum of
overpayments hurts the company's profits or stock value.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the full report are available for $5, plus $1.50
shipping, by writing to 1998 Executive Excess Report, United for a
Fair Economy, 37 Temple Place, 5th Floor, Boston, MA 02111.

MAN WIELDING HAMMER FATALLY SHOT BY POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A mentally disturbed man wielding a hammer was fired
upon at least 12 times and killed by the police in Borough Park,
Brooklyn, Monday evening, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of the man, an Orthodox Jew identified by the
police as Gidone Busch, brought several hundred angry residents of
the largely Hasidic neighborhood into the streets to protest what
they said was excessive force by the police. The protesters chanted
``Justice,'' strained against police barricades and occasionally
threw objects at officers, but no one was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   An officer who tried to subdue Busch was hit several times in
the arm with the hammer, the police said, but the officer was not
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Busch, 29, was known on his block of 46th Street in Borough Park
for his outbursts. The police said a neighbor filed a complaint on
Sunday saying that a man believed to be Busch had attacked him with
a hammer. In a telephone interview last night, Busch's mother said
a serious kidney ailment had been diagnosed in Busch in 1991 and he
had grown increasingly depressed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   While Busch's neighbors agreed that he was emotionally
disturbed, many of the people who poured into the streets last
night complained that the police could have subdued him far less
violently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sick, and he did things that were strange, but it's not
right to shoot him so many times,'' said Mochie Klein, 28, one of
the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents also demanded to know why Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who has enjoyed strong support in the city's Hasidic neighborhoods,
did not go to Brooklyn Monday night to address their concerns.
Their anger could pose a delicate political challenge for the
mayor, who has generally been a staunch defender of the Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said the mayor ``is
confident that the NYPD is handling the investigation
appropriately.'' Members of the mayor's Community Assistance Unit
were at the scene talking to residents and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's fatal shooting prompted countless comparisons by
Borough Park residents to the killing of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed
African immigrant who was shot 19 times by officers in his Bronx
doorway in February. Diallo's death further increased anger among
critics, particularly members of minority groups, who say the
police force is overly aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday night at the 66th Precinct station
house, Assistant Chief Joseph P. Raguso, the commander of Patrol
Borough Brooklyn South, said the police had received an anonymous
911 call about 6:40 p.m. Monday reporting that a man at Busch's
address, 1619 46th Street, had been threatening a boy on his block
with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Six officers went to Busch's house, and in the basement
apartment, he threatened them with the hammer and took a swing or
two at them, Raguso said. The officers then ordered Busch to drop
the hammer, but instead he backed into the street, and the officers
followed him onto the sidewalk, the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   On the sidewalk, Officer Daniel Gravitch sprayed him with pepper
spray, which Raguso said only irritated Busch further.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer, Sgt. Terrence O'Brien, tried to block Busch's
path, and Busch hit him several times in the left arm with the
hammer, prompting four of the officers _ Gravitch, Officer Martin
Sanabria, Sgt. Joseph Memoly and Officer William Loshiavo _ to open
fire, Raguso said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they were not sure Monday night how many rounds
had been fired, but 12 shell casings were found at the scene, along
with the hammer. Busch was struck in the torso and was dead on
arrival at Maimonides Medical Center in Borough Park. O'Brien was
treated for cuts and released.
</P>
<P>
   Busch, who was from Dix Hills, N.Y., moved to Borough Park
several months ago, in part to get in touch with his religious
roots, neighbors and officials said. When he was shot, Busch was
wearing a prayer shawl and tefillin _ leather boxes hung from
straps and containing pieces of Scripture, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Busch's mother, Doris Busch Boskey, 62, described him as
``sweet, talented and brilliant,'' a former medical student who
left Mount Sinai Medical School in 1991 because of a kidney
ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spiritual awakening that led him to Israel and an
interest in Orthodox Judaism, he became progressively more
depressed and troubled, she said. He did not seek medical attention
for either his kidney disease or his increasingly depressed and
emotional state, although Mrs. Boskey's current husband, Howard
Boskey, attempted to persuade him to seek counseling. Neighbors in
Borough Park said he often walked around talking to himself and
wearing heavy clothes in the middle of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boskey learned of her son's death on the television news
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it happened,'' she cried. ``I don't why they
couldn't have found another way. I don't know why they had to kill
my son.
</P>
<P>
   She said he had been visiting Israel for long periods of time
for the last five years. He joined what she called ``a cult, a very
extreme group,'' whose philosophy was ``hard to explain,'' she
said. But her son said they had hypnotized him there ``and that can
be very bad if you don't know what you're doing if you're
untrained,'' Mrs. Boskey said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year and a half, her son had lived with her and
Boskey, who tried to dissuade him from moving to Borough Park. ``He
was adamant about moving to a more religious community. But he
needed help. He was just depressed over finding a place for
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Handling mentally disturbed people is a constant challenge for
the police. Last October, a Queens resident, Kevin Cerbelli, was
shot dead in a police precinct station house after attacking
officers with a screwdriver and a knife.
</P>
<P>
   The City Councilman in Borough Park, Noach Dear, also said he
had questions about the shooting, but urged residents of Borough
Park to reserve judgment of the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of rumors out there,'' Dear said above the noise
of shouts and banging. ``We need to have a full investigation.''

OZ ENTERTAINMENT PROVIDES DETAILS ON THEME PARK FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACE HOBSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESOTO, Kan. _ Oz Entertainment Co. documents released Monday
provide a detailed look at how the company plans to finance a $761
million theme park big and bold enough to rival Disney.
</P>
<P>
   The company's financing plan for the Wonderful World of Oz
involves $433.6 million in private financing and investment and
$327.5 million in property and sales tax bonds, public grants and
infrastructure improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The net economic effect (of Oz) is extraordinarily positive
for all levels of government and the economy, so a public-private
partnership is a reasonable request,'' said David Westbrook, an Oz
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But one new part of the Oz financing plan could create
controversy. The company plans to ask for a property tax abatement.
Johnson County officials, who in the past have been skeptical of
property tax breaks, would have to approve the abatement.
</P>
<P>
   The company would pay about $2.25 million a year in property
taxes to the De Soto School District, as required by state law, and
would pay a fee to the county for some services. But it wants the
county to waive all other county property taxes. How much that
would save Oz is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Oz financing plan was contained in a binder of documents the
company provided Friday to the Kansas Development Finance
Authority. The documents were released to the public Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The authority will use the documents _ including a feasibility
study and a redevelopment plan _ to decide whether to issue the tax
increment financing bonds and sales tax revenue bonds for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The authority has been negotiating with the federal government
and Oz for a year to allow Oz to acquire the U.S. Army's former
ammunition plant at Sunflower near De Soto in exchange for cleaning
it of environmental hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal, and the Oz company's financing package, are
nearing completion, according to state officials and Oz
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest plan, Oz would agree to buy $8.8 million in
insurance to guarantee that the cleanup gets done. Oz plans to
spend an additional $32 million to $40 million on the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   If the cleanup is less than $32 million, Oz would have to pay
the federal government the difference. That means Oz must pay at
least $32 million for the 9,065-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   The state finance authority board is scheduled to vote Sept. 10
to issue a resolution of intent to create a redevelopment district
at Sunflower. The step is necessary for the authority to issue
bonds for the project but does not mean the board will approve the
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds are a key part of the Oz financing plan, a complex mix
of equity, bank debt, tax-exempt bonds, public infrastructure
improvements and economic development grants.
</P>
<P>
   The total project cost is now estimated at $761 million, down
slightly from previous estimates of $771 million.
</P>
<P>
   The financing plan includes:
</P>
<P>
   - $202,048,000 in sales tax revenue bonds to be issued by the
Kansas Development Finance Authority. The bonds, commonly known as
STAR bonds, would be repaid with sales tax revenue at the park and
all of the Sunflower site, once it is developed. The bonds would be
issued to private investors and would not carry any guarantees from
the state.
</P>
<P>
   - $70,461,000 in property tax increment financing bonds. This is
a new request; Oz has said for the last year that it did not plan
to ask for tax increment financing. Oz will ask the state's finance
authority to issue bonds to be repaid with 60 percent to 80 percent
of the property tax assessed on the theme park, RV park, campground
and Emerald Resort, which includes a hotel and golf course.
</P>
<P>
   - $222,355,000 in senior construction debt and $24,731,000 in a
senior construction debt service reserve fund.
</P>
<P>
   This debt could come in the form of bank financing, possibly a
traditional financial institution; privately placed bond debt
issued to investors; and//or first mortgage bonds, in which the
bondholder takes a lien on the theme park property.
</P>
<P>
   - $56,409,000 in stock.
</P>
<P>
   - $57,252,000 in leases from vendors at the park, such as ride
companies that rent space.
</P>
<P>
   - $5 million in infrastructure financing by a vendor who would
build an energy plant at the site for heating, cooling and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   - $20 million in economic development incentives from the
federal and Kansas governments in the form of investment tax
credits.
</P>
<P>
   - $67,874,000 in financing by a developer of the resort project.
Oz plans to work with another developer to build the resort.
</P>
<P>
   - $35 million in state and local financing for infrastructure
improvements. The state would spend $23 million to improve a Kansas
10 interchange near the park; the county would spend $4 million to
build an east-west arterial road near the park; and the county or
the city of De Soto would spend $8 million for sewers at the site.
The spending has not been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Oz originally estimated it would need $270 million in STAR
bonds. The amount was lowered to $202 million because interest
rates have increased 1.5 percent in recent months, Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the higher interest rate, the expected sales tax
revenue would not be enough to cover $270 million in bonds; the new
market could support only $202 million, Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Oz is asking for tax increment financing bonds because of the
interest rate increases and the decrease in the STAR bond request,
Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax increment is the increase in property taxes assessed on
the land due to the new development. Because the land was federal
property and was not taxed, the increment in this case is 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the balance of property taxes, Oz would pay the
county a set fee for fire, ambulance and police protection at the
site. The report released Monday estimates that the fee would be
$1.8 million once attendance at the park stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   The development authority would not issue any tax increment
financing bonds without the county's approval, said Rebecca Floyd,
the authority's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   County Commissioner Johnna Lingle, whose district covers the
Sunflower site, said she remained opposed to granting Oz a property
tax break.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said before, `Just what part of ``no'' don't you
understand?' '' Lingle said. ``But I can only speak for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lingle said the property tax abatement was inappropriate because
Oz would get other state and local financing help, including the
STAR bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Other commissioners could not be reached for comment Monday or
said they did not know enough about the plan to comment.
</P>
<P>
   County Counselor Don Jarrett said the County Commission
historically has not favored property tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Oz expects the theme park and resort to generate $195 million
its first year, based on projections of 3.2 million visitors. Oz
plans to open the park in May 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Once attendance stabilizes at 3.8 million guests by 2005,
revenue should be $266 million, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   To break even, the park and resort would need to generate $139
million in the first year and $165 million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The feasibility study included in the documents estimated that
the project would bring in $161 million to Kansas and $230.5
million a year to the metropolitan region in economic activity _
after the cost of all public financing.
</P>
<P>
   The project would have an economic return to the Kansas City
area eight times the annual public investment, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said the finance authority plans to hire an accounting
firm to review the study and examine whether its predictions of Oz
revenues and attendance were reasonable.

CRITIC'S CHOICE : SETTING ASIDE HISTORY FOR THE ECSTASY OF THE
MOMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Ill.)   By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pierre Boulez's association with Deutsche Grammophon has given
him fine recording conditions under which to reconsider much of his
favorite music with some of the world's great orchestras: Debussy
and Messiaen with the Cleveland Orchestra, Bartok and Stravinsky
with the Chicago Symphony, Ravel and Webern with the Berlin
Philharmonic. He has also had opportunities to record new works of
his own and of composers he admires, notably Gyorgy Ligeti and
Harrison Birtwistle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a decade of perhaps predictable achievement, come
some surprises. Boulez's latest releases focus on composers who
have hitherto had a marginal place in his scheme of things:
Scriabin and Richard Strauss. He seems not to have conducted
anything by either of them until the early 1970s, when he was
expanding his repertory rapidly as music director of the New York
Philharmonic. Scriabin's ``Poem of Ecstasy'' then appeared on one
of his programs and was recorded by Columbia, but after that the
composer's name disappeared again from his repertory for nearly a
quarter of a century until Boulez returned to the ``Poem of
Ecstasy'' and added the Piano Concerto and ``Prometheus'' for
concerts with the Chicago Symphony leading to the new recording (DG
289 459 647).
</P>
<P>
   Of Strauss, he conducted ``Till Eulenspiegel'' and ``Also Sprach
Zarathustra'' in New York in 1973, and other works have
occasionally appeared on his programs, but his distance from
Strauss seems to be greater than in the case of Scriabin. In
Boulez's evolutionary picture of music, Scriabin has a place behind
Stravinsky, and his recording of the ``Poem of Ecstasy'' points up
many sources for ``The Firebird.'' Strauss, on the other hand, led
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But such historical concerns seem to interest be occupying
Boulez less now than the sheer joy, here in the present, in the
scores of two master orchestrators. His performance of the ``Poem
of Ecstasy'' is thrilling from first to last, the textures at once
sumptuous and clear, the melodies imposing and enticing by turns
(blessed especially by triumphant trumpet playing) and the
sequences of relaxation well gauged to support the rise toward a
golden conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Boulez cannot do quite so much for the Piano Concerto, which
comes from before Scriabin's best period, or for ``Prometheus,''
which always seems to promise more than it delivers, but both
performances are full of incidental pleasures from the orchestra
and from the soloist, Anatol Ugorski.
</P>
<P>
   Boulez's first Strauss recording occupies just half a CD (DG 457
649) because he couples ``Zarathustra'' with ``Totenfeier,'' the
early version of the first movement of Mahler's Second Symphony.
Again the orchestra is the Chicago Symphony, which plays
magnificently.
</P>
<P>
   In the Strauss, there is the special delight of hearing the work
not being taken entirely seriously except where its strenuous
demands are concerned. The fast sections go at top speed,
streamlined, and the contrapuntal virtuosity is all on display. The
effect is almost comic, and not inappropriately so: perhaps this is
what Nietzsche, Strauss' mentor, meant by happy science.

NEW YEAR, NEW OUTLOOK FOR KANSAS CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Students will return today to a Kansas City
School District that some administrators are hoping is much better
than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   From more rigorous academic and behavior standards to tough new
attendance and truancy policies, officials overseeing the area's
largest school system are expecting more from students.
</P>
<P>
   Recent staff shake-ups at four underperforming schools and new
leadership at several others are indications that the district is
holding teachers and principals to the same new high standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic,'' said John Murphy, Desegregation
Monitoring Committee chairman. ``Hopefully, (students) are
returning to a safe, orderly environment in which all teachers
believe that all students can be successful academically. But
everyone has to keep in mind that you're not going to see a
miracle. You're going to see incremental change, and that's the key
to a successful turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives are part of the district's ongoing efforts to
boost student achievement. The district is under pressure to
improve its poor academic performance if it hopes to win full state
accreditation and freedom from federal court control.
</P>
<P>
   By far, officials say, the most important changes this year are
aimed at the district's expected enrollment of 35,000 students. And
getting them in their seats is at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Test results clearly indicate that class attendance leads to
improved performance. District statistics also show that too many
students miss too much class. Last year, on average, district high
school students were absent nearly one in every four days of
school. Middle school numbers weren't much better. District
officials estimated that between 2,000 and 3,000 district students
were truant every day.
</P>
<P>
   This year the district is stepping up efforts to get children
off the streets and into classrooms. For the first time in many
years, district security personnel have authority, along with the
police, to pick up truants. The district plans to take truants to a
transition center at Manual High School, formerly Metro Tech High
School.
</P>
<P>
   At Manual, parents will be called and students will meet with a
counselor who will help develop an educational plan designed to get
the student back on track. The goal is to quickly get the student
back to his or her home school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope when students get back to school they're going to find
it's a place that's rewarding and enticing to them,'' said Cynthia
Kupka, a district instructional director.  &LR; brk:Tough attendance
policy
</P>
<P>
   A new attendance policy also is in effect this year. District
officials held a press conference Monday to emphasize how important
it is for students to attend school, especially the first day.
</P>
<P>
   The district has a history of large numbers of students failing
to show up for the first several days of classes.
</P>
<P>
   Elementary students who miss more than 20 days may be
automatically retained in the same grade. Middle and high school
students will be allowed 13 absences per semester before losing
course credit. More than 10,000 of the district's nearly 36,000
students last year would have been retained if the policy had been
in effect.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the district is combating absences by directing more
attention at parents.
</P>
<P>
   Students who miss school today can expect a phone call to their
home. Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. will be on the line with a
prerecorded message on the importance of school attendance and an
explanation of the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, each school is expected to make a personal call to
the home of any absent student. The district will then mail a
letter to the residence explaining the policy and the penalties for
failing to attend school.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also are being asked to sign a statement saying they are
aware of the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical piece is parents,'' Kupka said. ``They need to
work with us and know what's going on. Parents need to help by
getting their kids in school. Students should be there ready to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Students also will take several new standardized tests to better
gauge their academic performance and growth. Teachers will then be
expected to use the more detailed data to tailor instruction for
each student. Participation on the state's Missouri Assessment
Program tests is mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Students at several underperforming schools may not recognize
all of the teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Ladd Elementary School, Central Middle School and Southeast and
Lincoln College Prep high schools all underwent staff overhauls
this summer to spur improvement. The district assigned new
principals to about a dozen other schools.  &LR; brk:Transportation
changes
</P>
<P>
   Not all the changes this year are aimed at improving
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   More children will be walking, and bell times at many schools
have changed to save busing costs. Last year, the district provided
transportation for students living more than one mile from their
neighborhood school. This year, only students living more than 1.5
miles from their school will receive transportation. Officials
estimate the change will cut between 2,500 and 3,000 students from
bus routes and will help the district make up for a $2 million
overrun in last year's transportation budget.
</P>
<P>
   In Sugar Creek, parents will begin to see long-sought changes in
the grade configuration of one school, which should make it easier
on some families.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Sugar Creek Elementary served only kindergarten
through third grades. Students then often transferred to Mount
Washington Elementary for fourth and fifth grades, then to another
school for middle school. That created a burden for many families
who have children attending different schools.
</P>
<P>
   The district also is reinstituting use of surveillance cameras
in middle and high schools and establishing a hot line for students
to report campus problems. The measures are designed to make
buildings safer and students feel more secure. Some schools
operated video monitors in the past, but few have been in use in
recent years because the district could no longer afford staff to
monitor the cameras full time.
</P>
<P>
   The new system is designed to save money by allowing one person
to monitor all of the buildings from a central location.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kid is less likely to do something to another kid or do
something that is dangerous if he knows there is video
monitoring,'' said John Coleman, the district's security director.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the changes are driven by new accountability and
assessment practices developed as part of a broad plan to turn
around the long-troubled district. The recent selection of Demps as
superintendent should help ensure continued improvement, Murphy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy will have a key voice in the decision on whether the
court next year should end the long-running desegregation lawsuit
and return the district to local control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you've got some consistency at the helm and a vision
for where we're going, you're going to see some changes,'' Murphy
said. ``The key is it's coming. It's on its way. I'm not only
optimistic about this year but also about the future of Kansas City
schools.''

FURROW GIVEN DATE FOR MURDER TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal judge ordered Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr.
to stand trial Oct. 12 in the killing of a postal worker in Los
Angeles after a shooting rampage that wounded five people at a
Jewish community center.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old white supremacist, wearing an orange jail outfit
and glasses, appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Hillman
as relatives of slain postal worker Joseph Ileto looked on from the
audience gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow answered ``yes'' when Hillman asked whether he understood
his rights and had read the indictment against him. When his
attorney, Deputy Public Defender Sean Kennedy, told Hillman the
defense didn't intend to enter a plea, the magistrate entered a
plea of not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's hands were handcuffed in front of him and he was
flanked by Kennedy and Deputy Public Defender Marilyn Bednarski
throughout the 10-minute proceeding. He did not look at the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Hillman selected U.S. District Court Judge Richard Paez through
a random assignment process to hear Furrow's trial and set the
trial date.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury indicted Furrow for killing Ileto, a
Filipino-American letter carrier, while he was delivering mail in
Chatsworth and using a 9mm handgun during a violent crime that
resulted in death, charges that carry a potential death sentence.
The indictment also charges Furrow as a felon in possession of a
firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Ileto was shot about 11:55 a.m. Aug. 10, little more than an
hour after three boys, a teen-age counselor and a receptionist were
shot at the community center.
</P>
<P>
   Between the shootings, Furrow allegedly dumped his van behind a
sandwich shop and demanded the keys to a woman's car at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow turned himself in to the FBI in Las Vegas the day after
the attacks and authorities said he confessed to the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow faces separate state charges of attempted murder in the
shootings of the boys, the counselor and the receptionist at the
community center. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office
also charged Furrow in the Ileto killing, added hate crime
allegations in the shootings, and charged him with carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal murder charges carry a potential death
penalty, but neither side has yet decided whether to seek capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   If prosecutors seek the death penalty, there would be a trial to
determine guilt and whether Furrow planned the attacks and a trial
to determine the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal prosecutors have decided that the federal
trial will go first. At least one deputy district attorney will
join the federal team as a specially designated assistant U.S.
attorney, but that selection has not been made, said Sandi Gibbons,
spokeswoman for the District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office is considering adding civil rights
violations to Furrow's indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to investigate this case and there could be
additional charges,'' said Thomas Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S.
Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Terrell, is
a veteran of its major crimes unit. He is joined by Assistant U.S.
Attorney Michael Gennaco, who leads its civil rights division, and
Assistant U.S. Attorney Caroline Wittcoff, also with the division.
</P>
<P>
   Paez was the first Latino member of the federal bench in Los
Angeles when President Clinton appointed him in June 1994. Paez had
served 13 years as a Los Angeles Municipal Court judge, and for
nearly a decade before that did legal aid work in the Central
Valley and Los Angeles, according to reference works.
</P>
<P>
   Paez presided over the cases against former Rep. Jay C. Kim,
R-Diamond Bar, and Democratic fund-raisers John Huang and Maria
Hsia.
</P>
<P>
   He also blocked a city ordinance that would have banned
``aggressive panhandling.''

KARROS, BROWN LIFT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eric Karros could have been in Anaheim now, but
the Los Angeles Dodgers insisted the Angels also take Eric Young,
so the Angels backed out.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are going nowhere now, but think where they would be
if Karros weren't around.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers' season went from bad to worse, Karros
performed his best, and continues to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' two-run homer and a complete game from Kevin Brown
lifted the Dodgers to a 6-1 win against the Milwaukee Brewers in
the first of a three-game series Monday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (15-6) struck out five and allowed nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling to win the first game of a series throughout
the season, the Dodgers have won the initial game in their last
four series. They can also win their fourth straight series by
winning either today or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Karros leads the Dodgers with 29 homers and 90 RBI and is en
route to the best season of his career. The numbers rank third
among NL first baseman behind Mark McGwire and Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Karros has already established a career-high with 35 doubles. He
hit 34 homers and drove in 111 runs in 1996, and is on pace to
reach those marks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after a typically dismal April, Karros has done nothing
but produce in July and August. He drove in 26 runs in July, one
short of his career-high for a month, and has 24 RBI heading into
the last day of August.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, this is the first time since '93 we went into
August not in the middle of a playoff, so this is different,''
Karros said recently. ``It's frustrating to come to the park and
not be able to look up and see you're not a game ahead, or a game
behind, and see what the other teams are doing. You still look at
the scoreboard, but it's not like, `Oh, boy, hopefully, they lose
so we gain ground.' ''
</P>
<P>
   However, whether the Dodgers are in the middle of a pennant
chase or just playing out the string, Karros approaches things the
same way. He'll be under the stadium taking extra batting practice
nearly every day, and when the season ends Karros will have 30 or
so homers and 100 or so RBI.
</P>
<P>
   A knee injury at the beginning of last season cost Karros his
fourth straight such season, but even after missing a month with a
knee injury that sent him to the disabled list for the first time
in his career, Karros finished with 23 homers and 87 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' fifth-inning homer against the Brewers broke open a 3-0
game and gave Brown, who has won six straight decisions, plenty of
room to work.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Brown's last start, in which he allowed a grand slam to
Jose Valentin and wasted a 5-2 lead before getting a no-decision,
he made this one stick.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting a 1-0 lead in the third, Brown got out of a
first-and-third, one-out jam when he retired Jeromy Burnitz on a
pop-up and Jeff Cirillo on a fly to right.
</P>
<P>
   After being two-hit the previous day by Chicago no-name Kyle
Farnsworth, the Dodgers increased their lead 3-0 on Brown's
bases-loaded, fielder's-choice bunt and Young's fielder's-choice
groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers left five runners on base in the first three
innings, then had two baserunners in the next five innings before
Kevin Barker and Brian Banks had one-out singles in the ninth. Alex
Ochoa's bases-loaded groundout in the ninth ruined Brown's shutout
bid.

WILLIAMS FAMILY FOLLOWS PLAN WORTH EMULATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The revolution is hardly over. It takes time to
change the dynamics of race and the culture of tennis. But on the
first day of the 1999 U.S. Open, Richard Williams made a
prediction:
</P>
<P>
   His daughters, Venus and Serena Williams, will meet in the
finals of this Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to the draw that has the third-seeded Venus on one
side of the bracket and the seventh-seeded Serena on the other,
there is room for such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I don't see nothing that can stop those two
girls at all. Not at all. I think (what) we're going to see for the
first time is an all-black final,'' Richard Williams said moments
after 19-year-old Venus cruised past Tatiana Poutchek 6-1, 6-1 in
her opening match.
</P>
<P>
   ``For tennis, I think it will be the greatest thing that could
actually happen. I think the fans want it. I think the media needs
it. I think the United States needs it. I think it would be great
for tennis, and I think the world needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his unorthodox methods and parental interests, it is
tough to dismiss Richard Williams' prescription for dragging tennis
out of its racial, economic, sociological box.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it is entirely possible that Serena could handle Monica
Seles, should Seles advance to the quarterfinals, and either Mary
Pierce or the hard-hitting Lindsay Davenport in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   And Venus, who should meet no major obstacle until No. 1 Martina
Hingis in the semis, appears concerned that her failure to win a
Grand Slam title so far in her starry career is something she
should take care of now _ even if it means facing her sister in
that final match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can do that,'' Venus said. ``That would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams sisters already have met in one final, but that was
at last spring's Lipton Classic, not a Grand Slam event.
</P>
<P>
   This is the biggest stage for tennis, at least for America,
which seems to keep an ear to the loud events that take place at
Flushing Meadows during the two weeks when soap operas, story lines
and power shifts take place in this game that is better off for the
Williams' family revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Such a women's final as Richard Williams predicts for this Open
is something his family has always planned, going back to the the
lessons Richard gave his girls on the public tennis courts in
Compton, Calif., and the way he refused to be part of the tennis
system, instead keeping his girls off the junior circuit because it
was more important to be educated, to spend time as a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I wanted to do was to build confidence in my
girls because I never seen girls with confidence before. I built
their confidence by telling them they were the best thing that ever
happened in the world. You're the best person in anything,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never told them you're the best person in tennis because I
thought that would be limiting in my kids. I told them they were
the greatest students and they believed it because (when) Venus and
Serena were 9 and 10 years old, they were students at Morningside
High School in Englewood, California, making A's in algebra and
mathematics. So they believed it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in spite of being pegged as the ultimate tennis father
_ and that is hardly ever a compliment _ and in spite of his
penchant for spreading his version of the truth about professional
tennis, Williams is actually much more removed from the careers of
Venus and Serena, ranked No. 4 and 8 in the world, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Williams said he did not watch Venus' opening match
because he was too busy eating lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me six dollars for a hamburger. Now I don't have a lot
of money, so I decided that for six dollars, I was going to take 90
minutes to eat this hamburger,'' he said, amused.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he does not have great expecations about what his girls
can accomplish on the court. He said his girls can run ``faster
than the other girls'' and they are so much stronger than almost
every player except Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, after all the talk about a tennis revolution,
Williams' ultimate lesson for his daughters does not seem to be
primarily about race or about beating your opponent. It's about
being the best you can possibly be, and if along the way you can
further open America's eyes, that's a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see Venus quit at 23, but I think Venus is
going to play longer than that,'' her father said. ``But I want her
to quit because I think she should go and finish her education.
She's too smart to be a tennis player,'' he said, adding the
clincher:
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus is like an unbelievable lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the prediction about the all-black, all-Williams final,
which is a fine idea. It's these words of praise that are the real
Williams' story.

   TEACHER-SHORTAGE (undated) _ As the nation's children swarm back
to school, principals from Baltimore to Palm Beach, Fla., and from
the Texas panhandle to inner-city Los Angeles, say they are
grappling with perhaps the most acute teacher shortage in recent
memory, with student enrollments continuing to swell and a rising
tide of educators flowing out of their classrooms to retirement.
The problem is not a depleted national supply of teachers, but
rather geography and qualification. By Jacques Steinberg.

to animals like humans than to plants like lettuce. The revelation
is just one of many emerging new ideas about family ties in the

University of Michigan team analyzed 371 Web page references to one
particular cancer to determine their accuracy. Their search
revealed errors that the authors called ``shocking,'' with about a
third of the references lacking any indication that the information
had been deemed accurate by independent experts through the

amoebas _ are loners. These microscopic one-celled animals are
content to crawl through their environment, absorbing whatever food
they come across. But when famine or other catastrophes strike,
something remarkable happens: using their protruding false legs for
propulsion, the amoebas seek each other out and stick together to
create a multicelled creature that can sense light and heat and can

HOT-HITTING MARTINEZ SPARKS DOUBLEHEADER SWEEP OF WHITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The opponents' pinstripes changed Monday night, and
the Mariners reacted accordingly. Facing a middling team instead of
a strong one, the M's again looked as if maybe, just maybe, they
can get into the American League wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees spent the weekend exposing the Mariners'
flaws. The Chicago White Sox spent six hours Monday helping Seattle
ease the pain. The M's took a doubleheader at Comiskey Park, 5-2
and 14-6, and can return to .500 with a win Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several slumbering hitters awoke for Seattle, but one who's been
alert for a month was the star. Designated hitter Edgar Martinez,
batting .392 for August, started the scoring with a two-run homer
in the first game and ended it with a grand slam in the nightcap.
For the day, he was 4-for-8 with seven runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made SportsCenter,'' he said, but not for any of his
hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was speaking of his rumbling-stumbling-bumbling steal
of second in the fifth inning of Game 2. At first base after a
single, he took off on a 3-2 count as Tom Lampkin struck out.
Catcher Brook Fordyce fired to shortstop Mike Caruso breaking in,
and Martinez stopped, anticipating a rundown that would allow Alex
Rodriguez to score from third base. But the M's designated hitter
fell and crawled to second _ and it went for a double steal, since
Rodriguez scored as the ball skipped away from Caruso.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez suffered some sore neck muscles, but his ego was hurt
worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have picked up the base, held it up and said, `I'm
the greatest,''' joked Ken Griffey Jr. to Martinez after the game.
``Now you can say, `I'm so fast, that when I stop, my momentum
takes me to the base.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several other Mariners also could smile about their performances
at the plate. In the first game, Russ Davis had three hits,
including a two-run single that doubled his August RBI total, and
Dan Wilson had his third two-hit game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgent Brian Hunter had three hits in the second game and
is 10-for-29 since ending a 3-for-52 slide. Another hitter who had
been slumping, Raul Ibanez, also had three hits in Game 2, when
every M's starter but Davis had a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few days we haven't taken any batting practice at all
_ how about that _ and we've swung the bats better,'' manager Lou
Piniella said. ``We might just continue to do that the rest of this
trip. But it's good to see us put some runs on the board. We
haven't done that in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   With the 14 runs in the nightcap, the Mariners scored in
double-digits for just the second time since the All-Star break and
gave right-hander Ken Cloude the chance to pitch aggressively in
his first M's start since May.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude (4-4) worked quickly, and while he gave up two homers by
challenging hitters, he also had some highlights, such as a
fifth-inning strikeout of Frank Thomas after falling behind in the
count, 2-0. That came after the second of three four-run innings
for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what sequence of pitches I would have thrown
had we not had a lead like we did,'' said Cloude, who worked 52/3
innings. ``But we had a big lead (8-3 at the time), and that
allowed me to go right at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Garcia started and won the opener, improving to 14-7,
just one win shy of the single-season record for wins by a
Venezuelan pitcher (done twice by Wilson Alvarez).
</P>
<P>
   However, it was nothing like the 12-strikeout, six-hit shutout
he tossed his previous outing. Garcia threw 139 pitches that night,
but he was lifted after 105 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie was tired, and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he lost his stuff today, he lost it very quickly. I
probably should have taken him out one batter sooner,'' said
Piniella, who let Garcia finish last week despite his concerns over
the pitch count. ``It goes to show you, the fans in Seattle love
the 139 pitches and the shutout, but it shows for a start or two
afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Chicago runners at first and second and the M's
leading 4-2 in the sixth, Piniella called for Jose Paniagua _
earlier than he'd prefer. Paniagua induced a double play on a soft
liner, then worked a scoreless seventh and eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a superb job,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Jose Mesa retired the first two hitters on ground
balls, then allowed a single to Ray Durham and walked Mike Caruso
on four pitches. That brought up Thomas as the potential tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was booed throughout the games by the 17,190 fans, and
his Hall of Fame pace has declined sharply. He batted .265 last
year, and though his average has improved, his power has
disappeared. Since connecting off Paul Abbott at Safeco Field Aug.
11, he has been stuck on 15 home runs, startling from a hitter who
averaged 37 the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa fell behind 2-0, but he attacked Thomas' weak spot with
inside fastballs that reached 96 mph. He worked the count to
3-and-2, then buzzed one past the two-time MVP's fists for strike
three.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa pointed to the sky after the game, apparently exulting over
his 30th save. (He no longer talks to the media, for reasons
unexplained). The free agent signee, who saved 46 games in 1995 and
39 the next year for Cleveland, became the second Mariner to record
30 saves. Mike Schooler did it in 1989 (33) and 1990 (30).
</P>
<P>
   Of his 30 saves, Mesa has put at least one runner on base 25
times. His blown saves have been memorable, but he has converted
all but four chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mesa gets the job done,'' Piniella said. ``He makes it a
little exciting at times, I'll grant you that. But he gets it
done.''

</P>
<P>
   The American women, who have been busy with endorsements and
promotions since winning the World Cup, will return to the field
Saturday afternoon for the first time since their triumph in the
final on July 10 in Pasadena, Calif. They will play Ireland at
Foxboro Stadium near Boston as part of a double-header involving
the New England Revolution and the Tampa Bay Mutiny of Major League
Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tony DiCicco will take 16 of the 20 players on the World
Cup roster, including the world's career international scoring
leader, Mia Hamm, and the world's career international appearance
leader, Kristine Lilly. The game against Ireland will be televised
on tape delay by ESPN2 at 1 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will use the game against Ireland to prepare for
the Nike U.S. Women's Cup that will be staged in October at three
sites. The tournament starts on Oct. 3 with a sold-out doubleheader
at the 23,000-seat Columbus Crew Stadium in Columbus, Ohio (Brazil
vs. Finland and South Korea vs. the United States).
</P>
<P>
   Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., will be the host of the
second doubleheader, with the United States playing Finland after
Brazil meets South Korea, on Oct. 7. The last double-header will be
played at Louisville, Ky., Sunday, Oct. 10, with South Korea
playing Finland before the Americans clash with Brazil in the
round-robin tournament.

</P>
<P>
   The 18-player roster that was named Monday by coach Bruce Arena
for the game against Jamaica Sept. 8 at Kingston includes eight
players who have never played for the national team. The roster
includes only one player from overseas, Steve Cherundolo of
Germany's Hanover 96, and four members of the Olympic team, which
in April will try to qualify for the 2000 Olympic Games in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebuilding the national team is a long-term process,'' Arena
said. ``In order to insure success down the road, our younger,
talented players need to be exposed to the international game. The
Jamaica game will give me the opportunity to look at some new
faces, as well as bring back some players with previous national
team experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Cherundolo, all the players are from Major League
Soccer, with Chicago, D.C. United and Miami leading all teams with
three representatives each. Billy Walsh of the MetroStars is one of
the eight players called to the national team for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The most experienced players on the roster are Brian McBride of
the Columbus Crew with 34 national appearances and Eddie Pope of
D.C. United with 28. Eddie Lewis of the San Jose Clash is next,
with 12 of his 13 appearances taking place in the last 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   With World Cup qualifying starting next year, Arena wants to
look at as many players as possible. Along with the newcomers to
the national team, Arena will also look at a number of other
promising young players.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Jamaica game in Kingston will be part of a
double-header, featuring the two nations' under-17 national teams
in the preliminary match. Both nations have qualified for the FIFA
Under-17 World Championship in New Zealand in November. The only
player from the Northeast on the under-17 team, which is coached by
John Ellinger, is Jordan Chila of Jericho High School on Long
Island, N.Y. He is the son of Renato Chila, the former star of the
defunct New York Arrows of the Major Indoor Soccer League.
</P>
<P>
   European Leagues
</P>
<P>
   Christian Vieri, the world's most expensive player with a $49.5
million transfer fee, sent a strong message that he was the
front-runner for leading scorer in the Italian League. Vieri scored
all three goals in Inter's 3-0 triumph over Verona in the opening
game of the season on Sunday. While Fiorentina, another candidate
for the title, opened with a 1-0 victory over Bari, defending
champion A.C. Milan squandered a lead and settled for a 2-2
deadlock at newly promoted Lecce.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Andy Cole scored four goals for Manchester United in
a 5-1 triumph against struggling Newcastle United, whose Dutch
manager Ruud Gullit resigned last week after four defeats in five
matches. Liverpool presented more evidence that it is on the way
back to its glory days with a 2-0 victory over Arsenal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, Steve McManaman notched his first goal for Real Madrid
on Sunday in a 4-1 victory at home to Numancia. Real's victory was
its second in as many games and put it ahead of Barcelona on goal
difference after the Catalans' 2-1 victory against Racing
Santander. Kasey Keller posted his second victory in as many games
with his new team, Rayo Vallecano, the third Madrid-based team in
the Spanish First Division.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Frankfurt missed an opportunity to take over the
lead after a 2-2 tie with lowly Duisburg. After winning its
previous six, Frankfurt could not get the better of Duisburg, which
is without a victory this season.

GEORGE SUGARMAN, A SCULPTOR   OF COLORFUL WORKS, DIES AT 87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Switzerland, Neb., Ill., Minn.)   By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Sugarman, whose animated, meandering
polychrome sculptures are among the most inventive if least
appreciated three-dimensional artworks of the early 1960s, died on
Wednesday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 87 and
lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sugarman belonged to a talented generation that never quite
earned a name or adopted a polemic, but that began to fill the gap
left by the decline of Abstract Expressionism in the late 1950s.
His contemporaries included Al Held, Ellsworth Kelly, Agnes Martin,
Ronald Bladen and Shirley Jaffee. In different ways and often with
a boost from late Matisse, they evolved an intuitive, slightly
biomorphic geometric style that sidestepped both the emotional
gesturalism of Abstract Expressionism and the idealistic geometries
of Mondrian and the Neo-Plasticists. Many of their innovations set
the stage for Minimalism.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s Sugarman also figured in the sculptural
explosion in Europe and the United States. Along with Anthony Caro,
Donald Judd and Mark di Suvero, he was among the first to make
large-scale sculpture that spurned the traditional pedestal to sit
directly on the floor, in the viewer's space. He also embraced
horizontal, ground-hugging compositions as the more exciting way to
explore sculptural space. As he once put it: ``Objects and living
things crawled and spread out on the ground. You had to bend down
to see them properly. Your body had a different relationship to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The profuse colored forms of Sugarman's sculptures, which were
initially made of painted wood and then of painted aluminum, could
seem chaotic at first. But as the viewer walked around his works,
they unfolded in a kind of abstract narrative of color and shape.
Their improvisational complexity was out of step with the
increasingly minimalist 60s but was embraced in the 70s by the
Pattern and Decoration artists.
</P>
<P>
   His influence, or at least his precedent, can be traced through
several generations, from the environmental installations of Judy
Pfaff to the playful large-scale figurative sculptures of Keith
Haring, up to sculptors and installation artists of the 90s who
favor bright color, formal abundance, unpredictable composition and
humor, among them Jessica Stockholder, Polly Apfelbaum, Peter
Soriano and Daniel Wiener.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent Sugarman's appearance and temperament, not to
mention his very name, seemed to match his sculpture bounce for
bounce. A short man with prematurely white hair and a generally
cheerful demeanor, he resembled a cross between Santa Claus and one
of his elves. But this benign exterior belied a strong
competitiveness and nearly total dedication to his work that may
have been intensified by the fact that he began making art at a
relatively late age.
</P>
<P>
   Sugarman was born in 1912 in the Bronx. His father was a dealer
in Oriental rugs, his mother a dedicated amateur singer. He spent
much of his childhood traveling with his father on sales trips
through the Eastern and Southern United States and said that the
colors and patterning of Persian and Turkish rugs made an indelible
impression on him.
</P>
<P>
   Sugarman, who is survived by a sister, Adeline Evelyn Davis of
Riverdale, the Bronx, graduated from City College in 1934. From
1941 to 1945 he served in the Navy, assigned to a hospital in the
Pacific theater. His real art education began after the war, when
he went to Paris on the G.I. Bill, studying with the Cubist
sculptor Ossip Zadkine in 1951-52. For the next three years he
worked in Paris and traveled throughout Europe. He was especially
affected by Baroque architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to New York in 1955 Sugarman took a loft on East 23d
Street, where his neighbors included Held, Bladen and Yvonne
Rainer. Beginning in 1956 he exhibited in group shows at the Hansa
and Brata Galleries. After making carved wood sculptures that
resembled those of Raoul Hague, he made his first polychrome
sculpture in 1959. He had his first solo gallery show at the
Widdifield Gallery in 1960. He was represented in the late 60s by
the Fischbach Gallery, and between 1977 and 1986 he had five
exhibitions at the Robert Miller Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   After 1970 Sugarman turned increasingly to large outdoor
sculpture commissions, starting with one for the Xerox Corporation
in El Segundo, Calif. Over the next 20 years he executed more than
30 commissions in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He became interested in making his work user-friendly,
incorporating benches and canopies into the architecturally scaled
works. In 1975 one such piece, commissioned by the General Services
Administration for a federal building in Baltimore, was opposed by
several judges with offices in the building. They first opposed the
piece on esthetic grounds but later said that it could be dangerous
for children or could be used as a soapbox from which protesters
might make speeches.
</P>
<P>
   As it would a few years later with the opposition to Richard
Serra's ``Tilted Arc'' in lower Manhattan, the General Services
Administration held hearings about the work; unlike what happened
in the ``Tilted Arc'' case, in which the sculpture was eventually
removed, in this case the agency decided to go ahead with the
installation.
</P>
<P>
   Sugarman had retrospectives at the Kunstmuseum in Basel,
Switzerland, in 1969 and at the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha in 1982.
A truncated version of the Omaha show was seen in Manhattan at the
Whitney Museum of American Art in 1986. His most recent New York
exhibition was in 1998 at Hunter College in New York, where he
taught from 1960 to 1970. His work is in the collections of the
Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney, the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
the Art Institute of Chicago, the Walker Art Center and the
Kunstmuseum.

FRITZ SHURMUR, A COACH   OF INNOVATIVE NFL DEFENSES, DIES AT 67  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Ariz. Calif., Wash., Mich. , Wyo.)   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fritz Shurmur, one of pro football's most innovative and
successful assistant coaches never to become a head coach, died
yesterday in Suamico, Wis., near Green Bay. He was 67 and was found
in May 1999 to have liver cancer that had spread.
</P>
<P>
   From 1975 to 1998, Shurmur was a defensive coach (and, for 19
years, defensive coordinator) for the Detroit Lions, the New
England Patriots, the Los Angeles Rams, the Arizona Cardinals and
the Green Bay Packers. Last January, when the Packers' head coach,
Mike Holmgren, took over the Seattle Seahawks, Shurmur went with
him, only to become ill four months later.
</P>
<P>
   With his white hair and wire-rimmed glasses, Shurmur looked like
a mild-mannered, retired grandfather. But he ran, lifted weights
and had huge energy, and his players liked him because they could
joke with him. When it was time for business, they also liked him
because they knew he would have something new to confuse the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 with the Rams, when both outside linebackers were
injured, he improvised a 2-5 defense using one or two down linemen
and filling in with ever-changing alignments of linebackers and
defensive backs. In 1992 with the Cardinals, when two linebackers
were hurt, he created a Big Nickel defense, with five defensive
backs close enough to the line of scrimmage to rush the quarterback
or drop back.
</P>
<P>
   In the Packers' 1994 playoff game against the Detroit Lions,
Shurmur's creative defense held Barry Sanders, probably the
National Football League's best running back, to minus-1 yard on 13
carries. As LeRoy Butler, the Packers' safety, said of Shurmur,
``His level of thinking is to win three times as much as any
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur, who wrote four books on defense, laughed off his
failure to become an NFL head coach despite coaching in the league
for 24 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time,'' he said, ``I was too young and then I was too
old. I wonder what happened to the just-right years.''
</P>
<P>
   John Robinson, the Rams' head coach when Shurmur was their
defensive coordinator, was an admirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys who get into these coordinator positions,
their level of genius obscures all else, including winning and
losing and the best overall interest of the team,'' Robinson said.
``Those kinds of things don't get in the way with Fritz.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Frank Shurmur, nicknamed Fritz as a baby after his
grandfather's cocker spaniel, was born on July 15, 1932, in
Wyandotte, Mich., an industrial suburb of Detroit. He became a
Little All-America center at Albion College in Michigan and coached
at Albion and the University of Wyoming (he was Wyoming's head
coach from 1971 to 1974) before moving to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Peggy, and three children, Sally Ann
Michalov, Scott and Susie Plumb. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he reached the pros, Shurmur established himself as a
defensive creator. His scouting reports and game plans were
occasionally 75 pages long, but his philosophy was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is played so fast,'' he said. ``I really believe
there's a wire that goes from the brain to the feet, and the more
the brain's involved, the slower the feet are. Our job is to help
players respond instinctively, to recognize tendencies and pounce
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shurmur once told The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel:
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize there's more than one good answer, one solution to
every program. And it's out there someplace. And there's always a
better one. By God, if you can be the guy who finds the better one
just once in a while, then you've got a little bit of an advantage
and your player's got a little bit of an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense always is reaction. We react to what the offense does.
But I have found if we come up with something different, something
a little more creative, something they have not had a chance to
look at, then we get them responding to us.''

EVELYN SHRIFTE, PUBLISHING HOUSE PRESIDENT, DIES AT 98  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evelyn Shrifte, the longtime president of Vanguard
Press, which published the first books of Saul Bellow, Dr. Seuss
and Joyce Carol Oates, died on Aug. 8 at her home in Manhattan. She
was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shrifte, whose name is pronounced ``Shrift,'' was one of the
first women to head a book publishing company. She began working
for the independent Vanguard full time in the early 1930s and was
its president from 1952 until it was sold to Random House in 1988,
when it was 62 years old. For many years it was at 424 Madison
Ave., near 49th Street, in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In his history of American book publishing, ``Between Covers,''
John Tebbel wrote, ``Vanguard never became a large and important
house, but it continued to publish quality books year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   Those books included Bellow's first two novels, ``Dangling Man''
and ``The Victim''; Dr. Seuss' first two books, ``And to Think That
I Saw It on Mulberry Street'' and ``The 500 Hats of Bartholomew
Cubbins,'' and a score of books by Ms. Oates, including the novel
``Them,'' which won the National Book Award. Ms. Shrifte edited
books by Ms. Oates, James T. Farrell, Marshall McLuhan and other
authors at Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   After the sale she said: ``Random House will take good care of
our books and authors. But I'm trying not to cry while I break the
news to our authors.'' She said the sale was prompted by the poor
health of some of Vanguard's investors. In its last years Vanguard
published fewer than 20 new titles annually, but it had 500 books
on its backlist.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Ms. Shrifte received a bachelor's degree in
1921 from Barnard. She worked for the Musical Quarterly and opened
a bookshop in Manhattan before joining Vanguard. After it was sold,
she retired.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a sister, Bernice Woll of Larchmont, N.Y.,
two nephews, two nieces and four grand-nieces.

MARVIN SANDS, WINERY'S CHAIRMAN, DIES AT 75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Calif., France, Mexico, Canada, Britain)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marvin Sands, chairman of Canandaigua Brands, the nation's
second-largest winery, died on Saturday after a brief illness.
</P>
<P>
   Sands died of cancer at his home in Canandaigua, N.Y., according
to the company. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Sands took over a small bulk wine producer in Canandaigua, about
25 miles southeast of Rochester, that his father had acquired,
eventually building it into one of America's big makers of
mass-produced wine.
</P>
<P>
   The Sands family was in the wine business as early as 1932, when
Mordecai E. Sands, Marvin Sands' father, was a partner in a winery
in Long Island City, Queens. In 1945, when Marvin Sands was just
out of the Navy, the Sands family bought a Canandaigua, N.Y.,
sauerkraut factory-turned-winery for $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   From 1945 to 1954, Canandaigua Industries, as it was called,
struggled, selling fruit wines in bulk to local bottlers, who would
then sell them under their own brand names. As California companies
like Gallo and Italian Swiss Colony began creating national brands,
Sands tried to create a brand himself.
</P>
<P>
   He failed with King Solomon kosher wine and a Sands line, but in
1954 finally succeeded with a flaming-red blend of dessert wine
named Richard's Wild Irish Rose, after his son Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Irish Rose became synonymous with Canandaigua, representing
more than 90 percent of the company's sales during the early 1960s.
On that base Sands slowly expanded, acquiring 11 small wineries
through 1984.
</P>
<P>
   At first, these were relatively small deals _ $10 million to $20
million _ for small, well-known wine brands like Manischewitz and
Italian Swiss Colony. As the sales volume swelled, distribution
overhead stayed relatively steady and profit rose. The acquisition
pace was stepped up in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In a buying spree that began in 1991, Canandaigua acquired Guild
Wineries and Distillers, a California growers' cooperative whose
Cook's champagne made Canandaigua the nation's No. 2 producer of
sparkling wine, after Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the acquisition of Barton Inc. carried the rights to
import Corona Beer from Mexico. Vintners International, picked up
four months later, brought in brands including Paul Masson and
Taylor California Cellars.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1994, Canandaigua acquired Almaden and Inglenook from
Heublein Inc. In 1995, it bought 30 brands of spirits from United
Distillers Glenmore.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Clark PLC, a big British producer and distributor of
everything from wine to bottled water, joined the fold in 1998. So
far this year, Canandaigua has picked up eight brands of Canadian
whisky, including Black Velvet and Golden Wedding, two Canadian
distilleries and two California estate wineries, Simi and
Franciscan Estates.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Canandaigua is the country's second-largest wine producer
after E.&AMP; J. Gallo; the second-largest beer importer, after
Heineken, and the fourth-largest spirits producer. Worldwide, it is
third in wine production and 10th in spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Sands served as chief executive of Canandaigua, which is now
based in Fairport, a suburb of Rochester, from 1945 until 1993.
During his career, he was also president of the Finger Lakes Wine
Growers Association and was a founder of the American Vintners
Association, a national trade association.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sands took over as president of Canandaigua in 1993 and
chief executive in 1996. Another son, Robert Sands, is chief
executive for international operations and vice president and
general counsel of Canandaigua Brands and chief executive of the
Canandaigua Wine Co.
</P>
<P>
   Sands was active in community affairs and in philanthropy. Among
his leadership roles, he was chairman of F.F. Thompson Health
Systems and affiliated organizations for more than 25 years. He was
instrumental in the establishment of the Finger Lakes Performing
Arts Center, which was constructed as the summer home of the
Rochester Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Sands graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. He served as an ensign in the Navy during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his sons, he is survived by his wife of 52 years,
Mickey Sands, of Canandaigua; a son-in-law, Dr. Andrew Stern, of
Pittsford, N.Y., and several grandchildren. His daughter, Dr.
Laurie Sands, died of cancer in 1995.

GARNER SUSPENDED FOR VIOLATING TEAM RULES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A seemingly quiet training camp apparently wasn't
so serene, as the second USC football player has been suspended for
violating team rules, according to coach Paul Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Junior wide receiver Troy Garner of Notre Dame High has been
suspended for two weeks, Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Garner is the second Trojan to be suspended during training
camp. Sophomore linebacker Michael Pollard was suspended one week
for missing curfew.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett would not divulge which rules Garner broke, but
according to sources, Garner got into an argument with strength
coach Matt Schiotz last week at UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Garner is not allowed to attend workouts or practices during the
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to come back and see me in two weeks,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garner could not be reached for comment. He is sitting out this
season after tearing ligaments in his left knee in spring practice.
Pollard is also sitting out after tearing ligaments in his left
knee in spring drills. He returned from his one-week suspension
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cassel visits: Chatsworth quarterback Matt Cassel visited USC's
practice Sunday at the Coliseum. Cassel, who has grown to
6-foot-4{, orally committed to USC last spring. His little brother,
Justin, who will be a freshman defensive end/quarterback for the
Chancellors, also visited.
</P>
<P>
   Walk-ons awarded scholarships: Three walk-on players were given
scholarships Sunday night: Freshman cornerback Kevin Arbet, the son
of former USC wide receiver Jeff Simmons; junior free safety John
Morgan and senior cornerback Antoinne Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett has never given a freshman walk-on a scholarship, but
Arbet has been impressive in the preseason. Because he will receive
a scholarship, he will not redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real story is (Arbet),'' Hackett said. ``From the time he
got here, he's caught everybody's eye. He's at No. 2 cornerback.
He's done everything. He's had a great two weeks. He's going to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   No kicking decision: Little was decided during Sunday's practice
regarding the kicking battle between David Bell and David Newbury.
Both missed 47-yard attempts at the Coliseum under game conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is way too close to call,'' Hackett said. ``I'd really like
to make a decision before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: The sprained ankles of defensive tackles Bernard
Riley and Aaron Williams have healed and Hackett said both will
play against Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Darrell Rideaux was bothered by back spasms Sunday,
but is expected to be OK. Freshman tailback Sultan McCullough
tweaked his knee but it was not serious.
</P>
<P>
   Two-position player: Hackett said freshman Troy Polamalu has
been switched from safety to outside linebacker because the
coaching staff envisions him as a David Gibson-type player who can
play either position without much adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Hawaii in a run-and-shoot, most of his work would be at
linebacker,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Polamalu is technically considered a backup to Markus Steele at
weak-side linebacker, with Henry Wallace switching to middle
linebacker.

EDITORIAL: THE RUSSIAN MONEY TRAIL
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The suspected Russian laundering of billions of dollars through
the Bank of New York is giving the world a disquieting look into
some of the darkest corners of Russian life. The financial threads
that American and Russian investigators are now tugging on seem to
lead most directly to the international operations of the Russia
mafia. But even more important is the possibility that the inquiry
will uncover evidence of corruption at top levels of the Russian
government, including illegal diversion of loans from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the sensitivity of the investigation, and the
political fallout it may produce as elections approach in both
Moscow and Washington, it is critical that the inquiry be
unflinching but fair. Politicians in both countries are already
rushing to apportion blame for misconduct that has yet to be
formally alleged, much less proved. There will be ample time to
review the performance of Russian officials, and the Clinton
administration's handling of Russia, if high-level corruption in
Moscow is confirmed. For now, the need is to investigate thoroughly
and without fear of where the evidence may lead.
</P>
<P>
   So far the only firmly established information is that at least
$4.2 billion and possibly as much as $10 billion from Russia passed
through the Bank of New York last fall and winter. Bank executives,
eager to expand their overseas business, initially seemed happy to
receive the deposits, even though the gusher of money should have
raised suspicions. Investigators believe the banking transactions
were designed in part to launder dollars collected by the Russian
mafia, a varied array of criminal organizations that feast off the
chaotic Russian economy. But the scale of the operation suggests
that other sources of money were involved as well.
</P>
<P>
   One theory, advanced by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a Russian
businessman under investigation in the inquiry, is that Russian
officials used the bank to shield profits earned from the
manipulation of government securities before the ruble devaluation
a year ago. Another line of speculation is that some of the
billions of dollars in IMF loans to Russia this decade were
siphoned off by Russian politicians. In Moscow's hothouse
atmosphere, these suggestions have added to charges,
unsubstantiated so far, that President Boris Yeltsin, his family
and his closest aides have secretly shipped millions of dollars
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   It is premature to judge any of these assertions. Certainly,
conditions conducive to high-level corruption abound in Russia.
Criminal syndicates are active, law enforcement is lax and in
recent years a small group of government leaders has managed the
transfer of billions of dollars' worth of state assets to private
hands. But the presumption of corruption in general, which is a
reasonable belief, is far different from proving actual criminal
conduct by specific individuals.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a leap to suggest at this early stage in the
investigation that the case shows the Clinton Administration has
mishandled relations with Russia by supporting Yeltsin and his
government. The White House would have been irresponsible if it
failed to assist the first democratically elected government in
Russian history. Whether the administration was sufficiently
sensitive to corruption problems in the Kremlin can and should be
debated as the presidential campaign here unfolds. &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: HELPING EMBATTLED CHILDREN IN AMERICA'S
CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (mk) 
 By DUDLEY CLENDINEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For almost 20 years, Paramjit Joshi, a pediatrician and child
psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University Medical School, has
treated black children who suffer from the lives they lead in East
Baltimore. It is the poorest, most violent, drug-ridden part of the
city, a place of little hope, low employment and high teen-age
maternity rates, where guns and murder are familiar, but fathers
are not.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect it is like parts of Atlanta, Los Angeles,
Milwaukee, Boston, Philadelphia and much of the rest of urban
America. But it was not until about five years ago, when Dr. Joshi
began going to help children caught in the ethnic warfare in Bosnia
and Croatia, that she realized how much worse off the children of
East Baltimore were than some of the children of the Balkans. For
all the terror they had suffered from guns and bombs, from the loss
of fathers and homes and communities in the ethnic wars, the
Croatian and Bosnian children showed a resilience, an ability to
cope and recover, because they came from stable lives and families,
from childhoods based on love and trust. For them, war was an
aberration. But for the thousands of children from East Baltimore
that Dr. Joshi saw at her clinic at the Hopkins Children's Center,
life was an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   They had schoolmates and family members killed, and taken away
to prison too. But they could not trust that things would be all
right. They did not feel safe in the streets, in the schools or at
home. They lived not only in acutely dysfunctional families, but in
dysfunctional neighborhoods, in large dysfunctional metropolitan
areas. Love-starved, abandoned by fathers, driven to distraction by
drug-addicted mothers or sisters or brothers, they clung to the
families they had, even as family problems became more severe.
</P>
<P>
   For some, a grandmother or great-grandmother is the only source
of strength and love. But those women, devoted to their church and
families, are dying off, and one of the critical questions for
American culture has been what to do to help children caught in
conditions that stem from chronic poverty. What therapy could be
given on such a scale? How could it be delivered? How would the
children respond? From East Baltimore, some answers have begun to
come.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, with a grant from an agency of the Federal Department
of Health and Human Services, a pilot program of counseling began
to be offered through social service agencies, the juvenile justice
system and the schools. For several years now, in each of 15 poor
black elementary schools, two middle schools and two high schools,
there has been a trained mental health counselor, with a master's
degree or doctorate in psychology, and with a private office, a
computer and a phone. And each week a psychiatrist, able to review
the case files and prescribe medications, visits each school.
</P>
<P>
   What they have found, says Gayle Porter, the Johns Hopkins
medical school psychologist who administers the program, is
broad-scale depression and hostility, what therapists call
oppositional/defiant disorder. Almost half the children in those
schools need counseling, she says, more than a third of them
long-term. What the therapists offer is counseling for them and
their families, and workshops for the teachers. They can see any
child once without parental permission. Almost half the therapists
are white, and one is from Ireland, but time has shown, Dr. Porter
says, that the children are receptive to help across cultural
lines.
</P>
<P>
   There is drug abuse in perhaps 70 percent of the families of the
children they see. Most of those children do not see their fathers
regularly. Many, bouncing from foster home to foster home, do not
see their mothers. In one high school a group of children asked the
counselor if they could have a group meeting on Mother's Day. Other
children had mothers, and they wanted someone themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the counselor in an elementary school noticed
that the signatures looked identical on five of the second-graders'
parental permission slips. She called the children in to ask why,
and they began to snuffle, and confess. They wanted counseling, but
their mothers wouldn't sign or weren't around, so the 7-year-olds
had hired a third-grader who could write in longhand to sign the
forms.
</P>
<P>
   In 25 to 30 percent of the cases in which parents are drug
abusers, the parents are persuaded to come in for counseling, Dr.
Porter says, and in about half those cases they are persuaded to
seek treatment. But it is the effect of the counseling on the
children that excites her.
</P>
<P>
   This last school year, for the first time, they checked the
report cards of a sample of 130 elementary students who had been in
counseling for 60 days or more, after beginning the year with
unsatisfactory marks in conduct, math and reading. By the third
quarter, she said, 50 percent of them were achieving at a
satisfactory level. That is a gain that could hold promise for
children and educators everywhere.

DISNEY SET TO END SPORT RETAILING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Walt Disney Co. pulled the plug Monday on its
trio of ESPN Stores, ending the entertainment giant's 2-year-old
venture into sports retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which originally planned to open hundreds of ESPN stores
as a way of taking advantage of the cable network's powerful brand
name, will redirect its efforts toward its two-outlet ESPN Zone
restaurants, Internet operations and its licensing program. A third
ESPN Zone will open Sept. 14 in New York City, and an expanded
ESPNstore.com Web site, offering more than 15,000 items, will
launch next month.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which began a corporationwide cost-cutting program four
months ago, will close its flagship ESPN outlet at the Glendale
Galleria, along with stores at MainPlace in Santa Ana and Del Amo
Fashion Center in Torrance by the end of September. About 40
employees, including managers and corporate staff, will be
pink-slipped, although some will be transferred to The Disney Store
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttering the stores is a humbling admission by Disney that its
well-tuned marketing machine was unable to deliver on the promise
of attracting free-spending males between ages 18 and 34 -- the key
ESPN viewer -- to malls. The stores feature video monitors, team
apparel, collectibles and interactive kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your target market may be hard to find at malls, and when they
are there, they tend to get in and get out,'' said sports
consultant David M. Carter. ``They don't spend the whole afternoon
at the mall. In fact, there's a compelling case that Disney should
invest every spare dollar in e-commerce because that's where their
target customers are spending their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment analyst Linda Bannister of Edward Jones said
Disney is making the right decision to ditch the ESPN Stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the stores were living up to their expectations,
and I applaud Disney for taking a hard look at some of their more
recent investments,'' she said. ``They are clearly not going to
roll out things that don't make sense from a financial
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock fell 62.5 cents Monday to $28.50. Company
management has been under pressure from Wall Street to boost share
price, and cost-reductions efforts have included hundreds of job
cuts in its TV, movie and video operations and the sale of its
Fairchild magazines for $650 million.
</P>
<P>
   A Disney spokesman said the announcement has no impact on the
720-outlet Disney Stores chain, which is planning a redesign of
mall-based stores, or on Disney's year-old licensing deal with
Sears Roebuck for stores-within-stores selling ESPN-branded
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Disney moved into retail in 1987 with the launch of the first
Disney Store at the Glendale Galleria. That chain became one of the
best examples of Chairman Michael Eisner's dedication to the
strategy of synergy -- using one part of the company to boost
awareness of another.
</P>
<P>
   It ditched the idea of moving into fast food when it closed a
pair of mall-based Mickey Kitchens after a year in the early 1990s.
But it has launched a wide array of other ventures in recent years
aside from the ESPN Zones, including a cruise line, the new Animal
Kingdom theme park, the DisneyQuest interactive park and the Club
Disney indoor play parks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the ghastly scale of the death toll in Turkey's earthquake
became apparent in the days after the tremor, so did the tardiness
of the official rescue and relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock and grief of last week, the predominant
sentiment in Turkey this week was anger. Anger at the government
for not reacting swiftly enough to rescue and help survivors. Anger
at the army for not pulling into action sooner. And anger at the
country's bureaucrats for allowing the poorly constructed
buildings, which crumbled like sand castles, to have been put up in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this anger is properly directed. But some of it could
lead to the wrong conclusions about how to avoid such appalling
loss of life _ 13,000 dead by the middle of this week, with many
thousands more believed dead under the rubble _ next time.
</P>
<P>
   It seems incredible that Turkey, which sits on a geological
fault line, had no dedicated rescue team. Not only did the
government fail to train and equip such a force, it also failed to
mobilize the one institution whose strength and discipline are
legendary: the army.
</P>
<P>
   As skilled foreign technicians bored, chiselled and hacked their
way into the mounds of compacted debris, and as Turkish volunteers
ferried in food and dug desperately with their own machinery, tools
and hands, their government froze.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Saturday, fully four days after the quake, that
the army _ admittedly reeling from casualties of its own _ went
into action.
</P>
<P>
   For these two failures, the blame lies squarely with the
government. More complicated, however, is the matter of the flimsy
buildings, a big contributor to the heavy death toll.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the comment since the quake, both in Turkey and the
West, has centered on the need for tougher regulation of the
building industry. In the aftermath of such a catastrophe, that is
an easy demand to make. But Turkey had building regulations: they
were evaded (with official collusion) or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed is more effective regulation, which is a
different and more difficult thing.
</P>
<P>
   If rules are to prevent the shoddy and reckless work that has
cost many lives _ blocks built on shallow foundations, cement mixed
with too much sand _ they must be designed so that they are
feasible both to obey and to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations that were merely ``tougher'' could be quickly
introduced, but in all likelihood would be neither.
</P>
<P>
   There is another problem. The lessons from the earthquakes in
Los Angeles in 1994 (54 deaths) and Kobe, Japan, in 1995 (6,500
deaths) suggest that _ other things being equal _ the critical
factor determining the death toll is the nature of the building
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Weight is the killer: Turks were crushed by the collapsing
structures above their heads. In Japan, heavy-roofed buildings put
up to withstand the frequent typhoons also proved lethal. In
California, timber-framed houses with light roofs, bolted to a
concrete foundation, rode out the tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Before Turkey and foreign well-wishers rush to rebuild heavy
high-rise cement buildings, they might do well to consider
old-fashioned timber.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, of course, that all things are far from equal. The
harsh and unavoidable fact is that natural disasters kill more
people in poor countries than they do in rich ones.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddy construction is one of the deprivations of poverty. And
though the poor world has no monopoly of bureaucratic corruption,
enforcing rules designed to make buildings safer (and dearer) will
always be easier in countries that are richer and which have more
accountable governments.
</P>
<P>
   This week's outburst of popular Turkish anger at their state for
failing them has been startling. Could it become a force for
change?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, if it prompts more of the humility shown by at least
one member of the government this week _ and if this translates
into a willingness to allow greater openness and freedom in Turkey,
even in ways that challenge the secular creed bequeathed by Kemal
Ataturk in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Turkey's best prospects of becoming a better
governed and more prosperous place may lie in the embrace of the
European Union. Here too some hope emerges from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   EU governments have repeatedly snubbed Turkey, refusing to take
seriously its hope of membership and huddling conveniently behind
the objections of its old antagonist, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Eventual Turkish membership would be a matter for delicate
negotiation. But the generous hand held out to Turkey by Greece
this week offers a hope that objections to opening such talks may
yet be overcome. &QL;

ABORTION CHALLENGE DROPPED; ARIZONA LAWMAKERS WANT INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER AND MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Gov. Jane Hull on Monday dropped any challenge of a
controversial Arizona Supreme Court decision that allowed a
14-year-old girl to seek a late-term abortion in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, criticized by abortion foes, effectively ends the
appeals process in Arizona courts, and dimmed any prospect of an
appeal in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a state lawmaker asked the attorney general for an
investigation into how supposedly confidential information about
the girl and her situation leaked to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative hearings will be conducted soon to try to discover:
</P>
<P>
   _Why the girl was allowed to have a late-term abortion.
</P>
<P>
   _Why the man who raped the girl and caused the pregnancy has not
been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   _How government funds are being used for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   _How the girl's situation was allowed to become a political
football. One lawmaker said such leaks should be considered
felonies, not misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Hull also is asking for an investigation into how confidential
information leaked.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who is 24 weeks pregnant and a ward of the Arizona
Department of Economic Security, was headed under court order to
Kansas for an abortion because Arizona's time limit for ending a
pregnancy is 20 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The story was leaked to abortion opponents last week. State
officials appealed and temporarily halted the procedure. But the
Arizona Supreme Court on Sunday voted 3-2 to allow the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going any further,'' said Francie Noyes, Hull's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Hull said she remains concerned that
allowing the girl to go out of state for the procedure could
violate Arizona laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision yesterday,''
Hull said. ``I have read that there may be legal efforts under way
to go to federal court. My office is not part of any of these
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   John Jakubczyk, president of Arizona Right to Life, said Hull's
decision effectively ended legal efforts to stop the abortion. He
said he could not appeal to federal court because he has no legal
standing in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not an avenue in the federal courts,'' he said, adding
that Hull's decision to drop the appeal was a ``major
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to try and fail,'' Jakubczyk said. ``It's
another thing not to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull vowed a ``complete'' review of the case, including an
investigation into how confidential information was leaked about
the girl's case to groups opposing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not come to any decision on how that review will be
conducted,'' Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull also wants to review the policies and decisions made by
Child Protective Services, a division of DES.
</P>
<P>
   Because the information could have come from state child welfare
officials, the Attorney General's Office or Maricopa County
Superior Court, conflict-of-interest rules may require any criminal
investigation to be conducted by a law enforcement agency outside
of Maricopa County.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights supporters continue to press for a thorough
inquiry into the release of the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing the information that has dribbled out,''
said Bryan Howard, president of Planned Parenthood of Central and
Northern Arizona. ``There are lots of legal questions to be asked
about leaks and confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Health Committee Chairwoman Sue Grace, R-northeast
Phoenix, asked Attorney General Janet Napolitano to prosecute
whoever leaked the information on the pending abortion to abortion
opponents and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the attorney general will start that investigation
today,'' Grace said Monday. ``We need to find out who broke the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Burke, special assistant attorney general, was reviewing
requests for an investigation from several people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take appropriate action and respond to those
requests,'' Burke said. ``We'll begin with our own attorneys
looking into it _ to figure out if any releasing of records to the
public or press violated any Arizona laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Releasing confidential information on state wards is a
misdemeanor, punishable by up to four months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to be a felony,'' Grace said. ``Her rights were
violated. It clearly affected her health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fallout continued from the Supreme Court's decision
to overturn a stay on the abortion issued Saturday by state Court
of Appeals Judge Michael Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stanley Feldman, Ruth McGregor and Frederick Martone
voted to overturn the stay, with Chief Justice Thomas Zlaket and
Vice Chief Justice Charles Jones saying no.
</P>
<P>
   John MacDonald, a Supreme Court spokesman, said the justices
would not discuss their ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accused Feldman of conflict-of-interest rules, citing a
1973 case in which Feldman represented Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald said Planned Parenthood wasn't a party to the case of
the 14-year-old girl. Before Sunday's hearing, Feldman said he had
once represented Planned Parenthood and offered to recuse himself.
</P>
<P>
   After answering several questions about the 1973 case, MacDonald
said, attorneys in the case said they did not object to Feldman
remaining on the case. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the ghastly scale of the death toll in Turkey's earthquake
became apparent in the days after the tremor, so did the tardiness
of the official rescue and relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock and grief of last week, the predominant
sentiment in Turkey this week was anger. Anger at the government
for not reacting swiftly enough to rescue and help survivors. Anger
at the army for not pulling into action sooner. And anger at the
country's bureaucrats for allowing the poorly constructed
buildings, which crumbled like sand castles, to have been put up in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this anger is properly directed. But some of it could
lead to the wrong conclusions about how to avoid such appalling
loss of life _ 13,000 dead by the middle of this week, with many
thousands more believed dead under the rubble _ next time.
</P>
<P>
   It seems incredible that Turkey, which sits on a geological
fault line, had no dedicated rescue team. Not only did the
government fail to train and equip such a force, it also failed to
mobilize the one institution whose strength and discipline are
legendary: the army.
</P>
<P>
   As skilled foreign technicians bored, chiselled and hacked their
way into the mounds of compacted debris, and as Turkish volunteers
ferried in food and dug desperately with their own machinery, tools
and hands, their government froze.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Saturday, fully four days after the quake, that
the army _ admittedly reeling from casualties of its own _ went
into action.
</P>
<P>
   For these two failures, the blame lies squarely with the
government. More complicated, however, is the matter of the flimsy
buildings, a big contributor to the heavy death toll.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the comment since the quake, both in Turkey and the
West, has centered on the need for tougher regulation of the
building industry. In the aftermath of such a catastrophe, that is
an easy demand to make. But Turkey had building regulations: they
were evaded (with official collusion) or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed is more effective regulation, which is a
different and more difficult thing.
</P>
<P>
   If rules are to prevent the shoddy and reckless work that has
cost many lives _ blocks built on shallow foundations, cement mixed
with too much sand _ they must be designed so that they are
feasible both to obey and to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations that were merely ``tougher'' could be quickly
introduced, but in all likelihood would be neither.
</P>
<P>
   There is another problem. The lessons from the earthquakes in
Los Angeles in 1994 (54 deaths) and Kobe, Japan, in 1995 (6,500
deaths) suggest that _ other things being equal _ the critical
factor determining the death toll is the nature of the building
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Weight is the killer: Turks were crushed by the collapsing
structures above their heads. In Japan, heavy-roofed buildings put
up to withstand the frequent typhoons also proved lethal. In
California, timber-framed houses with light roofs, bolted to a
concrete foundation, rode out the tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Before Turkey and foreign well-wishers rush to rebuild heavy
high-rise cement buildings, they might do well to consider
old-fashioned timber.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, of course, that all things are far from equal. The
harsh and unavoidable fact is that natural disasters kill more
people in poor countries than they do in rich ones.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddy construction is one of the deprivations of poverty. And
though the poor world has no monopoly of bureaucratic corruption,
enforcing rules designed to make buildings safer (and dearer) will
always be easier in countries that are richer and which have more
accountable governments.

<P>
   They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work. This half-serious
summary of communist economics contained a kernel of truth: for
Soviet workers, the freedom to pilfer and dawdle made up, to some
extent, for empty shelves and wretched wages.
</P>
<P>
   Like other illusions, it served a purpose for a while, though
that could not last.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet collapse, a different sort of illusion about
the Russian economy has been cultivated in western capitals as well
as in Moscow: ``You Russians pretend to be creating a law-based,
market-friendly liberal democracy. We westerners pretend to believe
you _ and what's more, we pay you for it.''
</P>
<P>
   This new fiction has also served a purpose. By fostering a
climate of determined optimism, both the American and Russian
governments persuaded voters and skeptical legislators that the
promised land of prosperity and reform was just around the corner.
That was politically expedient.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever its virtues, the post-communist illusion was
likewise doomed to be shattered _ if only because Russians and
Americans had such different expectations about the ``promised
land.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans were led to believe that, for an outlay of a few
billion dollars, Russia could be transformed into a country in
their own image: open to American business and cooperative with
American diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Russians were encouraged to think they could enjoy the benefits
of a market economy without the hard slog; and that economic
strength would enable them to flex their muscles, and defy America,
on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Any remaining illusions about the efficacy of western-backed
reform in Russia have been evaporating over the past few weeks with
exceptional speed. Soon there may be nothing left of them, and
Russian-western relations will have to be rethought from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The final blow could be the broadening probe by America's
federal authorities into one of the largest money-laundering
scandals they have ever uncovered: the apparent use of accounts at
the Bank of New York, as well as at several European banks, to
process about $10 billion in ill-gotten Russian gains.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also want to know whether the Bank of New York
was one of a chain of banks through which at least $200 million may
have been diverted from credits granted to Russia by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   This follows an acknowledgment by the Russian central bank that
it channelled tens of billions of dollars, including money received
from the IMF, into a shadowy offshore company in Jersey _ which
then speculated in a lucrative government-bond market that the
central bank was supposed to be regulating.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's admission that ``we were lied to'' by the Russian
central bank about the location of $1 billion in foreign-exchange
reserves in 1996 has done nothing to allay the suspicion that worse
happened both before and after.
</P>
<P>
   In one of history's odder political alliances, American
Republicans and Russian Communists are questioning the IMF's $4.8
billion emergency payout to Russia last year. This failed in its
stated aim of shoring up the ruble and probably provided windfall
profits for Russia's financial oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   With elections looming in both Russia and America, skeletons may
come tumbling out of cupboards at a faster pace than anyone in the
Kremlin or the White House can control.
</P>
<P>
   Far from ``civilizing'' the wreckage of the Soviet economy,
economic transactions between Russia and the West are running the
risk of corrupting the western side, if only by forcing it to wink
at practices that would be outlawed in more established economies.
</P>
<P>
   There is a particular irony in the fact that one western party
is the IMF, whose stated purpose is to propagate the virtues of
sound economic policy and good governance.
</P>
<P>
   But if the IMF's integrity has been compromised, the cause does
not lie in its own sloppy controls; it lies in the collusion of the
American and Russian governments to cover up failures and press the
Fund into treating Russia with greater generosity than its economic
performance would warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The fibbing cannot go on forever, if only because both Russia
(however imperfectly) and America are lively and rambunctious
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration should clear the air and admit some
hard truths about western policy towards Russia. The real aim is
not to create ideal outcomes, but to avert catastrophe: a hard-line
coup, a civil war, a nuclear leak.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding disaster in a country with tens of thousands of nuclear
warheads is undeniably a worthy aim of policy. But if this is the
main purpose of credits to Russia, then America and other western
nations had far better say so rather than pretend to be rewarding
Russia for its government's less-than-impressive economic
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that western governments should be prepared to
take responsibility for whatever emergency aid they give to Russia,
rather than force the IMF to engage in games of make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   A policy based explicitly on saving Russia from self-destruction
carries risks too: it creates an incentive for Russia's rulers to
engineer situations that are fractionally short of disastrous, and
then extort credits from the West.
</P>
<P>
   But if western governments suspect the Russian government of
playing this game, they should voice their suspicions _ and make
sure the Russian electorate gets the message. That is better than
conspiring with the Kremlin to deceive voters in both countries. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The authorities also want to know whether the Bank of New York
was one of a chain of banks through which at least $200 million may
have been diverted from credits granted to Russia by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   This follows an acknowledgment by the Russian central bank that
it channelled tens of billions of dollars, including money received
from the IMF, into a shadowy offshore company in Jersey _ which
then speculated in a lucrative government-bond market that the
central bank was supposed to be regulating.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's admission that ``we were lied to'' by the Russian
central bank about the location of $1 billion in foreign-exchange
reserves in 1996 has done nothing to allay the suspicion that worse
happened both before and after.
</P>
<P>
   In one of history's odder political alliances, American
Republicans and Russian Communists are questioning the IMF's $4.8
billion emergency payout to Russia last year. This failed in its
stated aim of shoring up the ruble and probably provided windfall
profits for Russia's financial oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   With elections looming in both Russia and America, skeletons may
come tumbling out of cupboards at a faster pace than anyone in the
Kremlin or the White House can control.
</P>
<P>
   Far from ``civilizing'' the wreckage of the Soviet economy,
economic transactions between Russia and the West are running the
risk of corrupting the western side, if only by forcing it to wink
at practices that would be outlawed in more established economies.
</P>
<P>
   There is a particular irony in the fact that one western party
is the IMF, whose stated purpose is to propagate the virtues of
sound economic policy and good governance.
</P>
<P>
   But if the IMF's integrity has been compromised, the cause does
not lie in its own sloppy controls; it lies in the collusion of the
American and Russian governments to cover up failures and press the
Fund into treating Russia with greater generosity than its economic
performance would warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The fibbing cannot go on forever, if only because both Russia
(however imperfectly) and America are lively and rambunctious
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration should clear the air and admit some
hard truths about western policy towards Russia. The real aim is
not to create ideal outcomes, but to avert catastrophe: a hard-line
coup, a civil war, a nuclear leak.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding disaster in a country with tens of thousands of nuclear
warheads is undeniably a worthy aim of policy. But if this is the
main purpose of credits to Russia, then America and other western
nations had far better say so rather than pretend to be rewarding
Russia for its government's less-than-impressive economic
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that western governments should be prepared to
take responsibility for whatever emergency aid they give to Russia,
rather than force the IMF to engage in games of make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   A policy based explicitly on saving Russia from self-destruction
carries risks too: it creates an incentive for Russia's rulers to
engineer situations that are fractionally short of disastrous, and
then extort credits from the West.
</P>
<P>
   But if western governments suspect the Russian government of
playing this game, they should voice their suspicions _ and make
sure the Russian electorate gets the message. That is better than
conspiring with the Kremlin to deceive voters in both countries. &QL;

<P>
   ``If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood
what I said,'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal
Reserve, once told a congressman. Wall Street, however, finds the
Fed's message clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market shrugged off the Fed's quarter-point increase
in interest rates, to 5.25 percent, on Aug. 24 _ just as it had the
Fed's previous rate rise two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing interest rates so timidly, the Fed is allowing
investors to believe that each rate rise may be the last. This
belief is dangerously misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   America's economic expansion is now 101 months old, and, like
many Americans this summer, the economy is looking uncomfortably
hot. Even if you believed that the country's potential growth rate
had risen thanks to faster productivity growth, its current pace
would still be unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market is getting ever tighter, with widespread
reports of labor shortages; wage inflation is starting to pick up.
The much-touted slowdown in GDP growth in the second quarter
largely reflected a drop in stock-building, which may rebound in
the second half of the year as firms cushion themselves against the
risks posed by the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent figures bear out fears that growth in domestic
demand remains too strong. Consumer spending is being fuelled both
by rising share prices and by a borrowing spree. Robust demand is
also sucking in imports, pushing the trade deficit to a record
level in June.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that consumer-price inflation remains relatively
subdued, at 2.1 percent in July, but it is a mistake to take too
much comfort from this lagging indicator when so many other
forward-looking ones are flashing red.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a mistake to turn a blind eye to other worrying
imbalances in the economy. The Economist has long been fretting
about America's financial bubble. But it is not just the level of
share prices that gives sleepless nights; it is also the fact that
it has been accompanied by mushrooming consumer and corporate debt.
</P>
<P>
   Negative personal savings and the increase in the private-sector
financial deficit to a record 5 percent of GDP all point the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   Spending cannot increase faster than income forever. Faced with
this truism, a prudent central bank would have tightened policy
more aggressively by now. Yet even after this week's rise, American
short-term interest rates are still a quarter of a point lower than
they were a year ago, before the Fed eased in response to the
financial jitters caused by Russia's default.
</P>
<P>
   Since inflation has edged up over that period, nominal rates
would need to rise to around 6 percent merely to take real interest
rates back to their level of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   So long as a buoyant stock market and rampant credit expansion
continue to boost growth, it will take more than a few small
interest-rate rises to slow America's boom. Indeed, such timid
moves may falsely reassure Wall Street that the Fed has everything
safely under control _ encouraging the stock market to ever giddier
heights.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the rest of the world economy, which was a
big concern a year ago, has also perked up. Not only has this put
upward pressure on oil prices, it has also made the dollar less
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   America's current-account deficit is likely to widen to almost 4
percent of GDP this year. If foreigners' appetite for dollar assets
wanes, the dollar could tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the dollar's strength over the past two years has helped
to hold down American inflation, any weakening would have the
reverse effect, pushing up import prices.
</P>
<P>
   A vulnerable dollar, a stock market that on most measures looks
hugely overvalued, a monstrous overhang of personal and corporate
debt: all combine to make it more likely that America's boom will
end in a hard landing.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this will test the revered (if opaque) Greenspan to the
limit. But his dilemma is largely of his own making: it reflects a
failure to tackle America's economic imbalances earlier, before
they had become so severe. &QL;

<P>
   The stir over whether George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, has
used cocaine is not the first and will not be the last example of
America's unique ferocity in testing its elected politicians to
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Before the country takes another lurch towards regarding moral
ambiguity as a disqualification from office, it makes sense to ask:
which questions are legitimate for voters to ask? Which aren't?
</P>
<P>
   Private matters become public depending on what a candidate says
and the nature of the question in hand. For example, adultery in
itself is not a legitimate matter of electoral scrutiny. It becomes
one if a politician, rather than remaining silent on the subject,
proclaims his fidelity or makes great play of ``family values.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to speak out is vital because voters have a right
to know whether somebody is lying, and a lie about a personal
matter is a valid gauge of truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Many people argued during the Monica Lewinsky affair that Bill
Clinton was justified in lying in public because it was a private
matter, and anyone would tell lies to protect their marriage. But
lying in public means deceiving the voters and is a legitimate
matter for scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate's willingness to speak out also helps decide how far
back enquiry can reasonably go. If he or she talks about the
distant past, it opens that period up to legitimate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, that means the past 25 years, the period he says
he has not taken drugs. So far, there is no evidence that he is
telling lies _ and no one has come forward with accusations about
his behavior. On these grounds, then, voters ought to be satisfied
with his answers so far.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the issue also matters. Not all actions deserve
the same degree of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, many people have argued that, since possession of
cocaine is a felony, Bush should reassure voters that he has never,
ever, taken coke.
</P>
<P>
   His friends might reply that, when it comes to setting a
political statute of limitations, there are different kinds of
offense. A crime of violence, for example, is worse than possession
of cocaine, even though both are felonies.
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that Bush's incomplete statements reflect a wider
ambivalence in the public attitude towards drugs. Since so many
Americans have taken them, they are more tolerant of this
particular felony than of others.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Lewinsky affair, journalists have justified
any and all enquiries on the grounds that, because candidates have
been talking about restoring the honor and dignity of the
presidency, anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   The public seems to disagree. But even if a candidate is not
lying, and even if the issue might not justify public scrutiny,
there remains a further test: voters are entitled to ask whether a
candidate is a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, two questions about double standards were
pertinent. First, could he pass the background drugs tests required
of federal employees? Second, and more significant, did his
personal history invalidate his policies towards drugs?
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Texas, Bush has approved a law that allows judges
to imprison people convicted of selling or possessing less than one
gram of cocaine. In the United States, thousands are in jail for
this, some as young as 14.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine for a minute that he had sniffed cocaine before he was
24. Would it be wrong of him to support mandatory jail sentences
for young cocaine users now?
</P>
<P>
   Candidates should be able to change their minds in good faith,
and voters should be willing to let them. Bush ought to be allowed
to say that he has learned from his mistakes and has concluded that
tough anti-drugs laws work (mistaken as he may be about that).
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly have been more convincing if he had said that
he had used cocaine, that that was the temper of the times and it
was this experience which had persuaded him of the need for tough
anti-drugs policies. But he has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush simply refuses to confirm or deny. He has chosen to be less
than candid. It is indeed a kind of hypocrisy _ one with which the
American public, not for the first time, seems happy to go along. &QL;

<P>
   The stir over whether George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, has
used cocaine is not the first and will not be the last example of
America's unique ferocity in testing its elected politicians to
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Before the country takes another lurch towards regarding moral
ambiguity as a disqualification from office, it makes sense to ask:
which questions are legitimate for voters to ask? Which aren't?
</P>
<P>
   Private matters become public depending on what a candidate says
and the nature of the question in hand. For example, adultery in
itself is not a legitimate matter of electoral scrutiny. It becomes
one if a politician, rather than remaining silent on the subject,
proclaims his fidelity or makes great play of ``family values.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to speak out is vital because voters have a right
to know whether somebody is lying, and a lie about a personal
matter is a valid gauge of truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Many people argued during the Monica Lewinsky affair that Bill
Clinton was justified in lying in public because it was a private
matter, and anyone would tell lies to protect their marriage. But
lying in public means deceiving the voters and is a legitimate
matter for scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate's willingness to speak out also helps decide how far
back enquiry can reasonably go. If he or she talks about the
distant past, it opens that period up to legitimate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, that means the past 25 years, the period he says
he has not taken drugs. So far, there is no evidence that he is
telling lies _ and no one has come forward with accusations about
his behavior. On these grounds, then, voters ought to be satisfied
with his answers so far.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the issue also matters. Not all actions deserve
the same degree of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, many people have argued that, since possession of
cocaine is a felony, Bush should reassure voters that he has never,
ever, taken coke.
</P>
<P>

   DES MOINES, IOWA _ ``I am convinced from evidence in our house
that my husband listened to the grain markets at noon, as he
usually did, heard them go lower, and then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enclosed a copy of the letter he left me. It reads:
`The only thing I will regret is leaving (the children) and you.
This farming has brought me a lot of memories, some happy, but most
of all grief. All I ever wanted was to farm since I was a little
kid, and especially this place. I know now that is never going to
happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   This stark letter, written by a farmer's widow to the governor
of Iowa, is an extreme expression of the most severe agricultural
downturn in America since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Iowa State Fair, one of the country's
agricultural showpieces, the talk is gloomy. ``It's the start of
the end of family farming. We can't cover our costs and many will
go to the wall,'' says Leland Fynaardt, of Searsboro.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Severin of Lowden agrees. ``The big guys are coming into
this business,'' he says, while staring bleakly at Rumpelstiltskin,
the winner of the fattest pig in the fair (487 kilos, or 1,071
pounds), who looks like a pink zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are squeezing the heck out of the small farmer and the
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, the same message is blaring forth: ``It is
not an overstatement to say,'' declares Byron Dorgan, the
Democratic senator from North Dakota, ``that we are approaching the
end-game for family-based agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   If that were true, it would be a huge change in what is still
America's second-largest exporting industry.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, family farms _ a few hundred acres looked after by
a man, his wife and their sons _ have been the weft and weave of
the Midwest. But is family farming really dying?
</P>
<P>
   ``The romantic view of one family, with some corn, a few cows,
pigs and chickens on 200 acres _ that died out in the 1960s,'' says
Ray Bardole, who farms 1,400 acres (560 hectares) in Rippey, in
central Iowa's billowing landscape of black earth and waving corn.
</P>
<P>
   He is right: since 1950, the number of farms has fallen from 5.6
million to 2.2 million. Thousands of farmers continue to leave the
land every year, responding to technological changes that have
doubled agricultural productivity over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are different this year. There are unnerving
parallels with the farm crisis of the mid-1980s, which gutted
communities throughout the central states.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, three years of good weather produced bumper crops,
and deep price falls when demand fell in world markets at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   This year has been worse. Soybean farmers are harvesting their
third record crop in a row, even while prices have hit their lowest
since 1972, about $4 a bushel. This is less than most farmers' cost
of production. Two years ago, soybeans fetched $8 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in meat prices has been even more dramatic. Last year,
the pork price fell to just $8 a hundredweight. This was even less
than during the Great Depression and a third of the cost of
production.
</P>
<P>
   Some family farmers will not survive for long. Bankers in the
Midwest are already asking for next year's financial plan even
before this year's harvest is in.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have only survived this long because, in one respect,
they are better off than during the 1980s crisis. Then, the
increase in farm incomes in earlier years had bid up the price of
land, which in parts of Iowa trebled to $4,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the farm woes occurred when the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates to cool off the Reagan expansion, making it
impossible for thousands of farmers to service the debts they had
taken out to buy land at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fed raised interest rates this week, farmers'
financing costs are still low compared with what they were in the
1980s. Then farmers' debt-service costs were around 14 percent of
production expenses; they are now 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, then, farmers are in better shape than they were
the last time things got really tough. Still, with prices so low a
renewed shakeout is inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1981 and 1987, the number of farms fell by 250,000. If
the same thing were to happen again, the number would fall to 1.94
million by 2005 _ a 12 percent decline in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of most industries, that would count as a
modest decline. But farmers are not like most other workers _ their
way of life, self-respect and sense of identity are often
intimately entwined with their job.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even those that remain on the land fret that the
relentless growth of corporate farming will leave them as little
more than hired tractor-drivers, a prospect most find humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   John Gilbert of the Iowa Farmers' Union explains: ``Turkey and
eggs used to be an essential part of diversified farming. It was
how you learned the business. That's been taken over by one or two
processors. Then came beef. Now three or four packers buy most of
the cattle. Everyone thought it would never happen to pigs. They
were too diversified and easy to raise. But look at it now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the pig industry has been transformed. Family
pig farms in Iowa, the main hog-producing state (and the
second-largest farm state after California), used to have up to 500
sows, each producing about 20 piglets a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, industrial-scale pig warehouses are appearing, with 16,000
sows raising 320,000 piglets a year. The stench from these huge
battery pig farms spreads for miles. But they are only the most
visible and smelliest evidence of change.
</P>
<P>
   More significant is the way in which pigs are marketed. Where
family farmers used to take their piglets straight to market, they
now raise them on behalf of the large warehouse farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, a tenth of America's pigs were raised in this
way, under contract. Now two thirds are.
</P>
<P>
   It is this contract-farming system that the family owners now
fear as much as bankruptcy. They have seen poultry, beef, and pig
farming swallowed by the system. The next domino to fall could be
grain.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the firms involved in agriculture, the largest are
already the grain traders and seed producers, most of the latter
owned by big chemical firms. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,500) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Last year, Cargill, one big firm, bought the grain-trading
operations of another, Continental. For many, this exemplified the
trend toward greater concentration and monopoly purchasing
threatening farmers. They fear being crushed between these
corporate millstones, and that the big companies will then buy up
their farms.
</P>
<P>
   That is possible. But the pattern of rapidly increasing
consolidation is not quite the unstoppable, Darwinist expansion
that it seems.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is nothing relentless or rapid about the
growth of the biggest beef companies. Although a few big firms
dominate slaughtering, it took them 30 years to get to the point
where they slaughter about two-thirds of all cattle, and they still
have only about 22-24 percent of cattle under contract. That share
has been stable for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there is nothing mysterious about the rise of these
operations. They succeed where they have a price advantage, as in
the pork business, where superior feeding, veterinary and other
techniques are important. But they do not have this advantage
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, calf raising, which is largely a matter of looking
after cows and calves as they forage, is run by small farmers. It
seems likely that the family grain farms are more like the
calf-foraging operations than the pork factories.
</P>
<P>
   There is no obvious advantage to size. A typical Midwestern
grain farm is roughly the acreage that one family can farm.
Improvements to tractors or fertilizers make it possible for one
person to look after a slightly larger area each year, so farms get
bigger and a few more people leave.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no technological gain to dramatic increases in
scale. So family farms should survive. But not unaltered.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bardole shows how they are changing. His farm provides an
income for himself and his family, and his two sons and their
families. About half the money comes from soybeans and corn. But
one daughter-in-law works in a day-care center; one is a speech
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   He runs a pig nursery for a large hog producer. He rents out a
special piece of farm-drilling equipment. And about half of his
soybeans are grown under contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I use contract farming as a tool,'' he concludes,
``it's a good deal. If a big company is using me as a tool, then
it's a problem.'' &QL;

increase in farm incomes in earlier years had bid up the price of
land, which in parts of Iowa trebled to $4,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the farm woes occurred when the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates to cool off the Reagan expansion, making it
impossible for thousands of farmers to service the debts they had
taken out to buy land at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fed raised interest rates this week, farmers'
financing costs are still low compared with what they were in the
1980s. Then farmers' debt-service costs were around 14 percent of
production expenses; they are now 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, then, farmers are in better shape than they were
the last time things got really tough. Still, with prices so low a
renewed shakeout is inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1981 and 1987, the number of farms fell by 250,000. If
the same thing were to happen again, the number would fall to 1.94
million by 2005 _ a 12 percent decline in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of most industries, that would count as a
modest decline. But farmers are not like most other workers _ their
way of life, self-respect and sense of identity are often
intimately entwined with their job.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even those that remain on the land fret that the
relentless growth of corporate farming will leave them as little
more than hired tractor-drivers, a prospect most find humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   John Gilbert of the Iowa Farmers' Union explains: ``Turkey and
eggs used to be an essential part of diversified farming. It was
how you learned the business. That's been taken over by one or two
processors. Then came beef. Now three or four packers buy most of
the cattle. Everyone thought it would never happen to pigs. They
were too diversified and easy to raise. But look at it now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the pig industry has been transformed. Family
pig farms in Iowa, the main hog-producing state (and the
second-largest farm state after California), used to have up to 500
sows, each producing about 20 piglets a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, industrial-scale pig warehouses are appearing, with 16,000
sows raising 320,000 piglets a year. The stench from these huge
battery pig farms spreads for miles. But they are only the most
visible and smelliest evidence of change.
</P>
<P>
   More significant is the way in which pigs are marketed. Where
family farmers used to take their piglets straight to market, they
now raise them on behalf of the large warehouse farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, a tenth of America's pigs were raised in this
way, under contract. Now two thirds are.
</P>
<P>
   It is this contract-farming system that the family owners now
fear as much as bankruptcy. They have seen poultry, beef, and pig
farming swallowed by the system. The next domino to fall could be
grain.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the firms involved in agriculture, the largest are
already the grain traders and seed producers, most of the latter
owned by big chemical firms. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Last year, Cargill, one big firm, bought the grain-trading
operations of another, Continental. For many, this exemplified the
trend toward greater concentration and monopoly purchasing
threatening farmers. They fear being crushed between these
corporate millstones, and that the big companies will then buy up
their farms.
</P>
<P>
   That is possible. But the pattern of rapidly increasing
consolidation is not quite the unstoppable, Darwinist expansion
that it seems.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is nothing relentless or rapid about the
growth of the biggest beef companies. Although a few big firms
dominate slaughtering, it took them 30 years to get to the point
where they slaughter about two-thirds of all cattle, and they still
have only about 22-24 percent of cattle under contract. That share
has been stable for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there is nothing mysterious about the rise of these
operations. They succeed where they have a price advantage, as in
the pork business, where superior feeding, veterinary and other
techniques are important. But they do not have this advantage
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, calf raising, which is largely a matter of looking
after cows and calves as they forage, is run by small farmers. It
seems likely that the family grain farms are more like the
calf-foraging operations than the pork factories.
</P>
<P>
   There is no obvious advantage to size. A typical Midwestern
grain farm is roughly the acreage that one family can farm.
Improvements to tractors or fertilizers make it possible for one
person to look after a slightly larger area each year, so farms get
bigger and a few more people leave.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no technological gain to dramatic increases in
scale. So family farms should survive. But not unaltered.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bardole shows how they are changing. His farm provides an
income for himself and his family, and his two sons and their
families. About half the money comes from soybeans and corn. But
one daughter-in-law works in a day-care center; one is a speech
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   He runs a pig nursery for a large hog producer. He rents out a
special piece of farm-drilling equipment. And about half of his
soybeans are grown under contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I use contract farming as a tool,'' he concludes,
``it's a good deal. If a big company is using me as a tool, then
it's a problem.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, IOWA _ ``I am convinced from evidence in our house
that my husband listened to the grain markets at noon, as he
usually did, heard them go lower, and then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enclosed a copy of the letter he left me. It reads:
`The only thing I will regret is leaving (the children) and you.
This farming has brought me a lot of memories, some happy, but most
of all grief. All I ever wanted was to farm since I was a little
kid, and especially this place. I know now that is never going to
happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   This stark letter, written by a farmer's widow to the governor
of Iowa, is an extreme expression of the most severe agricultural
downturn in America since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Iowa State Fair, one of the country's
agricultural showpieces, the talk is gloomy. ``It's the start of
the end of family farming. We can't cover our costs and many will
go to the wall,'' says Leland Fynaardt, of Searsboro.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Severin of Lowden agrees. ``The big guys are coming into
this business,'' he says, while staring bleakly at Rumpelstiltskin,
the winner of the fattest pig in the fair (487 kilos, or 1,071
pounds), who looks like a pink zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are squeezing the heck out of the small farmer and the
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, the same message is blaring forth: ``It is
not an overstatement to say,'' declares Byron Dorgan, the
Democratic senator from North Dakota, ``that we are approaching the
end-game for family-based agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   If that were true, it would be a huge change in what is still
America's second-largest exporting industry.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, family farms _ a few hundred acres looked after by
a man, his wife and their sons _ have been the weft and weave of
the Midwest. But is family farming really dying?
</P>
<P>
   ``The romantic view of one family, with some corn, a few cows,
pigs and chickens on 200 acres _ that died out in the 1960s,'' says
Ray Bardole, who farms 1,400 acres (560 hectares) in Rippey, in
central Iowa's billowing landscape of black earth and waving corn.
</P>
<P>
   He is right: since 1950, the number of farms has fallen from 5.6
million to 2.2 million. Thousands of farmers continue to leave the
land every year, responding to technological changes that have
doubled agricultural productivity over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are different this year. There are unnerving
parallels with the farm crisis of the mid-1980s, which gutted
communities throughout the central states.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, three years of good weather produced bumper crops,
and deep price falls when demand fell in world markets at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   This year has been worse. Soybean farmers are harvesting their
third record crop in a row, even while prices have hit their lowest
since 1972, about $4 a bushel. This is less than most farmers' cost
of production. Two years ago, soybeans fetched $8 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in meat prices has been even more dramatic. Last year,
the pork price fell to just $8 a hundredweight. This was even less
than during the Great Depression and a third of the cost of
production.
</P>
<P>
   Some family farmers will not survive for long. Bankers in the
Midwest are already asking for next year's financial plan even
before this year's harvest is in.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have only survived this long because, in one respect,
they are better off than during the 1980s crisis. Then, the
increase in farm incomes in earlier years had bid up the price of
land, which in parts of Iowa trebled to $4,000 an acre.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Illegal substances, and the question of whether or not he
consumed them, have given George W. Bush a spot of bother recently.
In the coming months Bush will, with luck, face equally probing
questions about substance of a different sort.
</P>
<P>
   After months of telegenic grins and a single stump speech, the
Republican front-runner has finally promised a series of policy
speeches. If these are to contain any content at all, it will most
likely come from the governor's chief economic adviser, Larry
Lindsey, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative think-tank.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey is the man overseeing 12 working groups that are
preparing the Bush economic agenda. Their mission is to give some
meaning to what Bush has so far used as something of a security
blanket, the all-purpose slogan ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Lindsey is enough to understand how he got this
position. Affable, funny, opinionated, and with an evident gift for
explaining complex concepts in plain English, Lindsey is the kind
of economist a straight-talking Texan would warm to.
</P>
<P>
   And on top of that, he is a heavyweight, in the intellectual as
well as physical sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   He was a staff economist at the Council of Economic Advisers in
the early Reagan years; associate professor at Harvard; author of
``The Growth Experiment'' (a 1990 book that is probably the most
valiant intellectual defense of the Reagan tax cuts); domestic
policy advisor in the Bush Administration; and a governor of the
Federal Reserve for much of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad record for a man who is only 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the Lindsey take on economic policy is pure
mainstream Republican. He talks a lot about incentives and reducing
unnecessary regulation. He favors the partial privatization of
Social Security by diverting a share of payroll taxes into
individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   He wants Medicare reform that includes choice and means-testing,
lamenting that ``Medicare regulations are four times the number of
pages of IRS regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants greater defense spending. (``We [have] a defense
program run by budget numbers and not by military needs.'')
</P>
<P>
   He wants tax rates ``consistent with sensible incentives'' and
believes that surplus tax revenue should be returned to those who
paid the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so uncontroversial. But there is more to Lindsey than
predictable mainstream opinions, at least judging from his
publications. Although ``The Growth Experiment'' is best remembered
as a staunch defense of supply-side tax cuts, it is the
lesser-known second half that merits rereading.
</P>
<P>
   Here Lindsey set out a tax agenda for the 1990s which might
qualify as a truly radical plan for compassionate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   He advocated a single 19 percent tax rate on all income
(including, flat-taxers take note, on capital gains). The income
threshold up to which no taxes were paid would rise substantially,
but exemptions would be sharply curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   His aim was to improve incentives by broadening the tax base and
reducing rates, while at the same time specifically lowering the
tax burden on low and moderate-income Americans. (He suggested, for
instance, extending mortgage-interest relief to poorer tax payers
but limiting its amount, so that the mansions of the rich were no
longer subsidized by the government.)
</P>
<P>
   Look beyond ``The Growth Experiment'' and there is no doubt that
this is a man who cares deeply about tax and regulatory impediments
facing lower-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He claims an early personal lesson in how red tape is a
proportionately bigger burden for the small guy: in college Lindsey
faced reams of red tape when trying to set up a summertime hot-dog
stall. The experience seems to have scarred him for life.
</P>
<P>
   He has also had professional experience with anti-poverty policy
(as a governor of the Federal Reserve he chaired the Neighborhood
Reinvestment Corporation, a small government agency that promotes
urban renewal efforts). And he is currently writing a book that
asks whether, and why, the market fails in the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the intellectual ingredients for a radical,
compassionate conservative agenda exist. But radicalism is unlikely
to be the hallmark of a Bush agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor would doubtless gulp at some of the more
populist ideas in Lindsey's 1990 book. It is hard to imagine any
Republican, compassionate or otherwise, depriving rich homeowners
of their tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And, steeped in the murky reality of policy advice, Lindsey
himself has become a staunch proponent of incrementalism. Taking
policy changes gradually, he now conveniently claims, makes
economic as well as political sense.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he is too much of a political operator to try and rock
the Republican boat by pushing too far or too fast in any
direction. Nonetheless, he appears to offer at least the glimmer of
a sensible, long-term Republican tax agenda: low rates, fewer
exemptions, and better incentives, especially for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, if Lindsey's predictions about the American
economy are correct, then a President Bush in 2001 will not have
the luxury of concentrating on such long-term matters. For Lindsey
has made no secret of the fact that he considers the American
economy to be suffering from an asset-price bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledges there have been fundamental
improvements in America's economy, he has no doubt that Wall Street
is overvalued. As far as he is concerned, the only real issue is
how painful the inevitable bursting of the bubble will be.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, in testimony to Congress, he argued that a tax
cut was needed as an insurance policy against future recession.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy roaring along, his arguments were discounted
(probably rightly) as an opportunistic attempt to justify the
Republicans' political agenda with clever-sounding economics.
Neither then, nor now, does the American consumer's appetite need
fueling with tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But, if Lindsey's bubble analysis is correct, the sharp drop in
stock prices he fears might well be followed by economic slowdown,
and perhaps a recession. Then fiscal loosening could be
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   It is comforting to know that Bush is being advised by someone
who is thinking seriously about what to do in bad times as well as
good. On the other hand, if the governor really shared his
adviser's pessimism, he might be wiser not to run at all. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Illegal substances, and the question of whether or not he
consumed them, have given George W. Bush a spot of bother recently.
In the coming months Bush will, with luck, face equally probing
questions about substance of a different sort.
</P>
<P>
   After months of telegenic grins and a single stump speech, the
Republican front-runner has finally promised a series of policy
speeches. If these are to contain any content at all, it will most
likely come from the governor's chief economic adviser, Larry
Lindsey, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative think-tank.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey is the man overseeing 12 working groups that are
preparing the Bush economic agenda. Their mission is to give some
meaning to what Bush has so far used as something of a security
blanket, the all-purpose slogan ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Lindsey is enough to understand how he got this
position. Affable, funny, opinionated, and with an evident gift for
explaining complex concepts in plain English, Lindsey is the kind
of economist a straight-talking Texan would warm to.
</P>
<P>
   And on top of that, he is a heavyweight, in the intellectual as
well as physical sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   He was a staff economist at the Council of Economic Advisers in
the early Reagan years; associate professor at Harvard; author of
``The Growth Experiment'' (a 1990 book that is probably the most
valiant intellectual defense of the Reagan tax cuts); domestic
policy advisor in the Bush Administration; and a governor of the
Federal Reserve for much of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad record for a man who is only 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the Lindsey take on economic policy is pure
mainstream Republican. He talks a lot about incentives and reducing
unnecessary regulation. He favors the partial privatization of
Social Security by diverting a share of payroll taxes into
individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   He wants Medicare reform that includes choice and means-testing,
lamenting that ``Medicare regulations are four times the number of
pages of IRS regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants greater defense spending. (``We [have] a defense
program run by budget numbers and not by military needs.'')
</P>
<P>
   He wants tax rates ``consistent with sensible incentives'' and
believes that surplus tax revenue should be returned to those who
paid the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so uncontroversial. But there is more to Lindsey than
predictable mainstream opinions, at least judging from his
publications. Although ``The Growth Experiment'' is best remembered
as a staunch defense of supply-side tax cuts, it is the
lesser-known second half that merits rereading.
</P>
<P>
   Here Lindsey set out a tax agenda for the 1990s which might
qualify as a truly radical plan for compassionate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   He advocated a single 19 percent tax rate on all income
(including, flat-taxers take note, on capital gains). The income
threshold up to which no taxes were paid would rise substantially,
but exemptions would be sharply curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   His aim was to improve incentives by broadening the tax base and
reducing rates, while at the same time specifically lowering the
tax burden on low and moderate-income Americans. (He suggested, for
instance, extending mortgage-interest relief to poorer tax payers
but limiting its amount, so that the mansions of the rich were no
longer subsidized by the government.)
</P>
<P>
   Look beyond ``The Growth Experiment'' and there is no doubt that
this is a man who cares deeply about tax and regulatory impediments
facing lower-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He claims an early personal lesson in how red tape is a
proportionately bigger burden for the small guy: in college Lindsey
faced reams of red tape when trying to set up a summertime hot-dog
stall. The experience seems to have scarred him for life.
</P>
<P>
   He has also had professional experience with anti-poverty policy
(as a governor of the Federal Reserve he chaired the Neighborhood
Reinvestment Corporation, a small government agency that promotes
urban renewal efforts). And he is currently writing a book that
asks whether, and why, the market fails in the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the intellectual ingredients for a radical,
compassionate conservative agenda exist. But radicalism is unlikely
to be the hallmark of a Bush agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor would doubtless gulp at some of the more
populist ideas in Lindsey's 1990 book. It is hard to imagine any
Republican, compassionate or otherwise, depriving rich homeowners
of their tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And, steeped in the murky reality of policy advice, Lindsey
himself has become a staunch proponent of incrementalism. Taking
policy changes gradually, he now conveniently claims, makes
economic as well as political sense.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he is too much of a political operator to try and rock
the Republican boat by pushing too far or too fast in any
direction. Nonetheless, he appears to offer at least the glimmer of
a sensible, long-term Republican tax agenda: low rates, fewer
exemptions, and better incentives, especially for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, if Lindsey's predictions about the American
economy are correct, then a President Bush in 2001 will not have
the luxury of concentrating on such long-term matters. For Lindsey
has made no secret of the fact that he considers the American
economy to be suffering from an asset-price bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledges there have been fundamental
improvements in America's economy, he has no doubt that Wall Street
is overvalued. As far as he is concerned, the only real issue is
how painful the inevitable bursting of the bubble will be.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, in testimony to Congress, he argued that a tax
cut was needed as an insurance policy against future recession.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy roaring along, his arguments were discounted
(probably rightly) as an opportunistic attempt to justify the
Republicans' political agenda with clever-sounding economics.
Neither then, nor now, does the American consumer's appetite need
fueling with tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But, if Lindsey's bubble analysis is correct, the sharp drop in
stock prices he fears might well be followed by economic slowdown,
and perhaps a recession. Then fiscal loosening could be
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   It is comforting to know that Bush is being advised by someone
who is thinking seriously about what to do in bad times as well as
good. On the other hand, if the governor really shared his
adviser's pessimism, he might be wiser not to run at all. &QL;

<P>
   It has important converts among Wall Street's most visible
strategists. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has even
acknowledged that it could be valid. And it clearly does a better
job than the conventional wisdom of explaining how quarter after
quarter of economic growth at better than 4 percent can coexist
with low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect what's known as the New Paradigm to stop the
Federal Reserve from raising interest rates. Even though the
numbers don't make an airtight case for a need to raise rates to
head off inflation, no one among the Federal Reserve's board of
governors wants to go down as a martyr to a new economic theory.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem facing the Federal Reserve _ and investors
trying to map a path through the current turmoil in the financial
markets. Conventional economic wisdom says the economy can grow
only just so fast before it starts to overheat. The exact speed
limit for the economy varies from expert to expert _ some say 2
percent, others 2.5 percent, and a few radicals crawl out on a limb
and mention 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that debate isn't important now, because the economy is
clearly growing at a speed that puts it off the dial. First-quarter
gross domestic product grew by 4.1 percent. And that's just the
latest in a string of quarters all well above the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   By now, according to the conventional wisdom, the economy ought
to be showing serious signs of an uptick in inflation. Wages should
be climbing in a steepening spiral. Prices for everything from raw
materials to capital equipment to consumer goods should be marching
higher day by day.
</P>
<P>
   But through the first third of the year, there were no signs of
those inflationary pressures. Yes, labor markets were tight, but
hourly earnings climbed just 0.2 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum producers continued to plan for lower prices; computer
makers, still struggling with the bottom-line consequences of
$1,000 PCs, worried about prices falling below $800; and consumer
companies were, by and large, cutting prices.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional economics at a loss to explain the persistence
of above-the-speed-limit growth and low inflation, more and more
economists are willing to give the New Paradigm a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on in the U.S. economy right now makes sense, this
theory holds, once you consider some of the consequences of the
profound changes in the U.S. economy in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   What, for example, is the effect on domestic inflation of the
transformation from a manufacturing economy into a service-based
one? The New Paradigm answer: First, since imports of manufactured
goods make up a bigger slice of domestic consumption, excess global
industrial capacity reduces the inflationary effect of any U.S.
bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   If a U.S. manufacturer can't keep up with demand, a foreign
supplier probably can, so there should be no price hikes because of
scarcity.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the increasing percentage of U.S. goods coming from
overseas plays into the recent improvement in the distribution
infrastructure in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Just-in-time inventory, computerized stocking and delivery
systems, the Internet, superstores, and more have all worked to
reduce the costs of getting stuff to U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Third, productivity in service industries in the U.S. may
finally be starting to pick up after years of investment
information systems.
</P>
<P>
   In area after area _ the increased flow of pricing information
to consumers because of computer systems and the Internet, the new
global wage competition even in service industries, the increased
efficiency of financial markets _ the New Paradigm argues that
things are different now.
</P>
<P>
   In his May testimony to Congress, Alan Greenspan even
acknowledged that the New Paradigm might be onto something. But, in
retrospect, that was the high-water mark for the theory, at least
in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   The economic numbers in May were just troubling enough to swing
the balance at the Fed back toward the conventional wisdom. For
example, the National Association of Purchasing Management's
Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 55.2 for May _ way above
April's 52.8.
</P>
<P>
   New-home sales soared 9.2 percent in April _ total numbers were
just shy of November's record _ and the average price climbed 3.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers aren't infallible harbingers of inflation. The
NAPM index has jumped like this before without producing inflation
at the wholesale or consumer level. (Anything above 50 indicates
prices are climbing.)
</P>
<P>
   The surge in housing sales and prices is at least partially a
reaction to rising interest rates _ consumers jump to buy when they
fear mortgage rates are headed up.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the bond market was spooked: The yield on the
30-year Treasury bond hit 5.96 percent on June 2, up from the low
of 4.72 percent in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And that has put the Fed in a tough political position. If the
central bankers decide not to act after the bond market has clearly
signaled it sees signs of inflation, they risk losing part of their
hard-won credibility as inflation fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Worries that the Fed has gone soft would, perversely, send the
bond market lower and set interest rates above the levels that Fed
would prefer.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-basis-point hike this summer would, on the other hand,
demonstrate the Fed's toughness and reassure the markets. And such
a hike might even actually fend off inflation _ just in case the
conventional wisdom about the economy is right.
</P>
<P>
   So let's calculate the odds. On the side of an interest rate
hike: a need to protect Federal Reserve credibility, a desire to
calm the U.S. bond market, some worrisome statistics indicating
that inflation may be kicking up, and the conventional economic
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Against the rate hike: the potentially correct _ but ultimately
untested _ theories of the New Paradigm.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't sound like much of a contest, does it? &QL;

head off inflation, no one among the Federal Reserve's board of
governors wants to go down as a martyr to a new economic theory.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem facing the Federal Reserve _ and investors
trying to map a path through the current turmoil in the financial
markets. Conventional economic wisdom says the economy can grow
only just so fast before it starts to overheat. The exact speed
limit for the economy varies from expert to expert _ some say 2
percent, others 2.5 percent, and a few radicals crawl out on a limb
and mention 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that debate isn't important now, because the economy is
clearly growing at a speed that puts it off the dial. First-quarter
gross domestic product grew by 4.1 percent. And that's just the
latest in a string of quarters all well above the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   By now, according to the conventional wisdom, the economy ought
to be showing serious signs of an uptick in inflation. Wages should
be climbing in a steepening spiral. Prices for everything from raw
materials to capital equipment to consumer goods should be marching
higher day by day.
</P>
<P>
   But through the first third of the year, there were no signs of
those inflationary pressures. Yes, labor markets were tight, but
hourly earnings climbed just 0.2 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum producers continued to plan for lower prices; computer
makers, still struggling with the bottom-line consequences of
$1,000 PCs, worried about prices falling below $800; and consumer
companies were, by and large, cutting prices.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional economics at a loss to explain the persistence
of above-the-speed-limit growth and low inflation, more and more
economists are willing to give the New Paradigm a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on in the U.S. economy right now makes sense, this
theory holds, once you consider some of the consequences of the
profound changes in the U.S. economy in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   What, for example, is the effect on domestic inflation of the
transformation from a manufacturing economy into a service-based
one? The New Paradigm answer: First, since imports of manufactured
goods make up a bigger slice of domestic consumption, excess global
industrial capacity reduces the inflationary effect of any U.S.
bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   If a U.S. manufacturer can't keep up with demand, a foreign
supplier probably can, so there should be no price hikes because of
scarcity.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the increasing percentage of U.S. goods coming from
overseas plays into the recent improvement in the distribution
infrastructure in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Just-in-time inventory, computerized stocking and delivery
systems, the Internet, superstores, and more have all worked to
reduce the costs of getting stuff to U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Third, productivity in service industries in the U.S. may
finally be starting to pick up after years of investment
information systems.
</P>
<P>
   In area after area _ the increased flow of pricing information
to consumers because of computer systems and the Internet, the new
global wage competition even in service industries, the increased
efficiency of financial markets _ the New Paradigm argues that
things are different now.
</P>
<P>
   In his May testimony to Congress, Alan Greenspan even
acknowledged that the New Paradigm might be onto something. But, in
retrospect, that was the high-water mark for the theory, at least
in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   The economic numbers in May were just troubling enough to swing
the balance at the Fed back toward the conventional wisdom. For
example, the National Association of Purchasing Management's
Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 55.2 for May _ way above
April's 52.8.
</P>
<P>
   New-home sales soared 9.2 percent in April _ total numbers were
just shy of November's record _ and the average price climbed 3.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers aren't infallible harbingers of inflation. The
NAPM index has jumped like this before without producing inflation
at the wholesale or consumer level. (Anything above 50 indicates
prices are climbing.)
</P>
<P>
   The surge in housing sales and prices is at least partially a
reaction to rising interest rates _ consumers jump to buy when they
fear mortgage rates are headed up.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the bond market was spooked: The yield on the
30-year Treasury bond hit 5.96 percent on June 2, up from the low
of 4.72 percent in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And that has put the Fed in a tough political position. If the
central bankers decide not to act after the bond market has clearly
signaled it sees signs of inflation, they risk losing part of their
hard-won credibility as inflation fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Worries that the Fed has gone soft would, perversely, send the
bond market lower and set interest rates above the levels that Fed
would prefer.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-basis-point hike this summer would, on the other hand,
demonstrate the Fed's toughness and reassure the markets. And such
a hike might even actually fend off inflation _ just in case the
conventional wisdom about the economy is right.
</P>
<P>
   So let's calculate the odds. On the side of an interest rate
hike: a need to protect Federal Reserve credibility, a desire to
calm the U.S. bond market, some worrisome statistics indicating
that inflation may be kicking up, and the conventional economic
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Against the rate hike: the potentially correct _ but ultimately
untested _ theories of the New Paradigm.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't sound like much of a contest, does it? &QL;

<P>
   TIAA-CREF, the largest pension fund in the world, was founded on
the progressive instincts of Andrew Carnegie. When the steel tycoon
found out how low the salaries of college professors were, he was
shocked. The threat of poverty, he felt, would dissuade talented
individuals from entering academia and thus deny the nation a vital
resource.
</P>
<P>
   His remedy: a $1 million gift in 1918 to start a pension fund
for professors.
</P>
<P>
   Now a group of professors wants Carnegie's pension fund to
strike out against the poverty of others _ but the giant is
resisting.
</P>
<P>
   The growing campaign, led by Neil Wollman and Abigail Fuller,
married professors at Manchester College in Indiana, proposes to
commit more pension money to enterprises ``that are models of
social and environmental responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, they've gotten nowhere: TIAA-CREF rejects the plan as
both impracticable and potentially damaging to returns.
</P>
<P>
   The money Wollman and Fuller are fighting for would come out of
the pension plan's Social Choice Account, an investment pool that
already bars from its portfolio companies that fail a set of
screens in such things as environmental safety or that make
products such as weapons or alcohol. But the portfolio does not
actively identify companies that can change the world for the
better.
</P>
<P>
   Most participants in the Social Choice Account, Wollman and
Fuller say, want their money to do more good for others, and they
argue that returns probably wouldn't be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical debate is not new to TIAA-CREF. The fund serves over two
million participants, the majority of whom work in higher
education. That group, says Tom Pinto, the fund's director of media
relations, ``is a little more interested in social issues'' than
the average investor.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, TIAA-CREF inaugurated its Social Choice Account
only after a five-year campaign by the rank and file, Wollman says.
Today, it's the world's largest socially responsible fund, with
around $3.6 billion in assets. In the past five years, it has
returned an annual average of 18.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wollman cites a TIAA-CREF internal survey conducted four years
ago in which 81 percent of current contributors supported investing
in companies that have an ``outstanding record of good performance
on social issues'' rather than pass negative screens.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be invested mostly in small- and micro-company
stocks, as well as in inner-city banks and community-development
corporations _ companies that are usually off the radar of fund
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six percent of plan participants would accept more
``financial risk in (their) investments if they created more
desirable social change.''
</P>
<P>
   Wollman's use of the study has ticked off TIAA-CREF officials,
who say it was conducted for internal review only and have now
distanced themselves from it. But Pinto says a proactive socially
responsible fund is just not feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Wollman disagrees. ``TIAA-CREF created a socially responsible
fund when participants demanded it,'' he explains, ``but now that
we want to do better with our money, the fund is reverting to its
old stance and running our money its own way.'' &QL;

   ``Uncle, you cried this before, go ahead, short it, short as
much as you can. go on. have a ball. you bought in at 18 my left
leg. ive read your old posts, who are you trying to kid?''
(``Hroark'' on the Bidnow.com board at Raging Bull) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, now that I know you are a Mr. Know-it-All
Zero-Personality social idiot, it won't happen again.'' (``E.
Graphs'' on the Razorfish board at Silicon Inventor) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, financial message boards represent what is worst
about the Internet: irresponsible anonymity, blatant
rumor-mongering, personal attacks, atrocious writing.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who has spent the barest amount of time on these
boards knows, much of the discussion consists of small-company hype
(usually written entirely in capital letters) followed by
hysterical finger-pointing when the tip, inevitably, turns out to
be less than wildly profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Even barring pure fraud, as in the case of the PairGain employee
who has been charged with dummying up a fake Bloomberg News page
about his company's imminent takeover and linking to it from Yahoo
Finance, stock message boards represent an extraordinarily
unreliable source of insight.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the dubious quality of most messages, the sheer volume
can be overwhelming. And for the most part there is no way of
telling which messages contain a nugget of knowledge and which
consist merely of speculation and uninformed opinion.
</P>
<P>
   To unearth anything of value, you typically have to read through
dozens of screens of utterly useless boosterism.
</P>
<P>
   Why even bother? Well, for one thing, lying in the murky depths
is often some real insight.
</P>
<P>
   Most financial journalists can't tell a fiber-optic cable from a
strand of spaghetti, but on the financial message boards, some of
the most active participants are employees of tech companies. (It's
no coincidence that the most active boards focus on the technology
sector. This may also explain why the writing on the boards is so
spectacularly bad.)
</P>
<P>
   When enough of these techies gather in a place and when they
manage to restrain themselves from foaming at the mouth, some truly
powerful insights emerge.
</P>
<P>
   When I worked for a major hard-disk-drive manufacturer, I
regularly trawled the boards for insight into the market conditions
for drives. The cataclysmic fall in disk-drive stocks in 1997 was
predicted at least a month in advance on Silicon Investor, as
employees of the component suppliers started whispering about
orders drying up and technology problems with the next generation
of heads.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to pay attention: Most of the participants on the
boards are individual investors. This means their insights have a
longer shelf life than those spun out by Wall Street analysts,
since the volume of trading around any insight is typically fairly
small.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, while the odds of any small investor's being able to
capitalize on Mary Meeker's upgrades or downgrades are minuscule,
most of the money made off Internet message boards accrues to
holders of small discount-brokerage accounts rather than to some
underregulated hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Still, panning for gold in this particular stream can be
exhausting. In a thoroughly unscientific test, I compared four
message boards recently, using two large-company stocks (AT&AMP;T and
Novell) and two Internet stocks (Razorfish and eBay) as test cases.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the boards are old mainstays of this form: Yahoo
Finance (quote.yahoo.com), Silicon Investor (www.techstocks.com),
and the venerable pioneer of the genre, Motley Fool (www.fool.com).
The fourth is a newcomer, Raging Bull (www.ragingbull.com).
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Investor is the only one with a fee: $10 a month if you
want to post messages; nothing just to read them.
</P>
<P>
   I looked for ease of use, the quality of the average and best
messages, the sheer number of interesting messages, and a catch-all
category I called ``other goodies'' _ which enabled me to skew the
outcome of the competition whichever way I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   First, a caveat. The experiences were, to one extent or another,
frustrating, and all in reasonably similar and predictable ways:
Far too many messages in total, a truly awful ratio of interesting
to utterly worthless messages, disturbing numbers of spitball
fights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I found something of value about each of the companies _
and in no instance did it take me more than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most cogent discussion I've seen anywhere _
including in the press _ of AT&AMP;T's proposed acquisition of Media
One cropped up on Raging Bull; that site also featured a thoughtful
explanation of Novell's strategy for the next year.
</P>
<P>
   I found on Yahoo a penetrating discussion of Razorfish posted
within minutes of its red-hot initial public offering and, on
Silicon Inventor, an entertaining _ if anecdotal _ comparison of
the various auction sites (including eBay, uBid, Bidnow, and
others), based on the experience of buying identical Pez dispensers
from all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites, the clear winner was Raging Bull, whose tools
streamline the experience in a noticeably superior way. It's simple
to customize the site to your preferences, including screening out
messages from habitually annoying participants _ a sort of twit
filter.
</P>
<P>
   The site also features a highlighted list of ``Top Posts'' every
day and makes it easy to reach boards that have topics of wide
interest (``Hot Stock Tips'' or ``Top 40'' boards). And as a nice
freebie, it tosses in unlimited free real-time stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important distinction between Raging Bull and the
other sites is one of character.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Raging Bull's ridiculous name and logo, both redolent of
the hype preceding a market crash, its members seem somewhat calmer
and more introspective than those at other sites.
</P>
<P>
   While this is by no means universal _ witness the message at the
beginning of this story _ most of the participants seem to have
chosen Raging Bull based on some common belief in insight and
relative civility.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Retroavia,'' a regular user of Raging Bull, writes, ``There
are quite a few very savvy investors posting here,'' and ``if you
sort through the B.S. (pun intended), you can reap the benefits of
synergism.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the site is ``a great word picture of the mood of
the investors in stocks of interest to me. You can almost feel
their adrenaline rush or their fury and frustration at times from
their posts.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the kernels of knowledge, this may in fact be the
most useful function of financial message boards. As individual
investors play a larger role in the market, judging their sentiment
has become increasingly important. But it's no mean task: With
millions of investors spread across the country, calling a few
pundits or watching CNBC is of little use.
</P>
<P>
   Raging Bull is almost always a nice, if somewhat unscientific,
weather vane and occasionally quite a bit more _ a democratic and
observant analyst report. &QL;

   ``Uncle, you cried this before, go ahead, short it, short as
much as you can. go on. have a ball. you bought in at 18 my left

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In many ways, financial message boards represent what is worst
about the Internet: irresponsible anonymity, blatant
rumor-mongering, personal attacks, atrocious writing.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who has spent the barest amount of time on these
boards knows, much of the discussion consists of small-company hype
(usually written entirely in capital letters) followed by
hysterical finger-pointing when the tip, inevitably, turns out to
be less than wildly profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Even barring pure fraud, as in the case of the PairGain employee
who has been charged with dummying up a fake Bloomberg News page
about his company's imminent takeover and linking to it from Yahoo
Finance, stock message boards represent an extraordinarily
unreliable source of insight.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the dubious quality of most messages, the sheer volume
can be overwhelming. And for the most part there is no way of
telling which messages contain a nugget of knowledge and which
consist merely of speculation and uninformed opinion.
</P>
<P>
   To unearth anything of value, you typically have to read through
dozens of screens of utterly useless boosterism.
</P>
<P>
   Why even bother? Well, for one thing, lying in the murky depths
is often some real insight.
</P>
<P>
   Most financial journalists can't tell a fiber-optic cable from a
strand of spaghetti, but on the financial message boards, some of
the most active participants are employees of tech companies. (It's
no coincidence that the most active boards focus on the technology
sector. This may also explain why the writing on the boards is so
spectacularly bad.)
</P>
<P>
   When enough of these techies gather in a place and when they
manage to restrain themselves from foaming at the mouth, some truly
powerful insights emerge.
</P>
<P>
   When I worked for a major hard-disk-drive manufacturer, I
regularly trawled the boards for insight into the market conditions
for drives. The cataclysmic fall in disk-drive stocks in 1997 was
predicted at least a month in advance on Silicon Investor, as
employees of the component suppliers started whispering about
orders drying up and technology problems with the next generation
of heads.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to pay attention: Most of the participants on the
boards are individual investors. This means their insights have a
longer shelf life than those spun out by Wall Street analysts,
since the volume of trading around any insight is typically fairly
small.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, while the odds of any small investor's being able to
capitalize on Mary Meeker's upgrades or downgrades are minuscule,
most of the money made off Internet message boards accrues to
holders of small discount-brokerage accounts rather than to some
underregulated hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Still, panning for gold in this particular stream can be
exhausting. In a thoroughly unscientific test, I compared four
message boards recently, using two large-company stocks (AT&AMP;T and
Novell) and two Internet stocks (Razorfish and eBay) as test cases.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the boards are old mainstays of this form: Yahoo
Finance (quote.yahoo.com), Silicon Investor (www.techstocks.com),
and the venerable pioneer of the genre, Motley Fool (www.fool.com).
The fourth is a newcomer, Raging Bull (www.ragingbull.com).
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Investor is the only one with a fee: $10 a month if you
want to post messages; nothing just to read them.
</P>
<P>
   I looked for ease of use, the quality of the average and best
messages, the sheer number of interesting messages, and a catch-all
category I called ``other goodies'' _ which enabled me to skew the
outcome of the competition whichever way I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   First, a caveat. The experiences were, to one extent or another,
frustrating, and all in reasonably similar and predictable ways:
Far too many messages in total, a truly awful ratio of interesting
to utterly worthless messages, disturbing numbers of spitball
fights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I found something of value about each of the companies _
and in no instance did it take me more than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most cogent discussion I've seen anywhere _
including in the press _ of AT&AMP;T's proposed acquisition of Media
One cropped up on Raging Bull; that site also featured a thoughtful
explanation of Novell's strategy for the next year.
</P>
<P>
   I found on Yahoo a penetrating discussion of Razorfish posted
within minutes of its red-hot initial public offering and, on
Silicon Inventor, an entertaining _ if anecdotal _ comparison of
the various auction sites (including eBay, uBid, Bidnow, and
others), based on the experience of buying identical Pez dispensers
from all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites, the clear winner was Raging Bull, whose tools
streamline the experience in a noticeably superior way. It's simple
to customize the site to your preferences, including screening out
messages from habitually annoying participants _ a sort of twit
filter.
</P>
<P>
   The site also features a highlighted list of ``Top Posts'' every
day and makes it easy to reach boards that have topics of wide
interest (``Hot Stock Tips'' or ``Top 40'' boards). And as a nice
freebie, it tosses in unlimited free real-time stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important distinction between Raging Bull and the
other sites is one of character.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Raging Bull's ridiculous name and logo, both redolent of
the hype preceding a market crash, its members seem somewhat calmer
and more introspective than those at other sites.
</P>
<P>
   While this is by no means universal _ witness the message at the
beginning of this story _ most of the participants seem to have
chosen Raging Bull based on some common belief in insight and
relative civility.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Retroavia,'' a regular user of Raging Bull, writes, ``There
are quite a few very savvy investors posting here,'' and ``if you
sort through the B.S. (pun intended), you can reap the benefits of
synergism.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the site is ``a great word picture of the mood of
the investors in stocks of interest to me. You can almost feel
their adrenaline rush or their fury and frustration at times from
their posts.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the kernels of knowledge, this may in fact be the
most useful function of financial message boards. As individual
investors play a larger role in the market, judging their sentiment
has become increasingly important. But it's no mean task: With
millions of investors spread across the country, calling a few
pundits or watching CNBC is of little use.
</P>
<P>
   Raging Bull is almost always a nice, if somewhat unscientific,
weather vane and occasionally quite a bit more _ a democratic and
observant analyst report. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For over a year we have heard the pundits and pooh-bahs say that
weak foreign economies pose the biggest risk to U.S. markets and
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai baht crisis of 1997 was supposed to knock us down. Same
for the Russian crisis of 1998. Ditto the Brazilian currency
collapse of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these falling dominoes, the American economy has been
growing at better than 4 percent, and the Dow easily pierced 10,000
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ma &AMP; Pa investor, who ignored the foreign headlines and kept
funneling their savings into the market, proved smarter than the
swamis.
</P>
<P>
   Hence my willingness to turn the conventional claims on their
head and declare that stronger foreign economies pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds loony, I know. Had I said that a dozen years ago, when I
was teaching economics, I might have been tossed from Harvard Yard:
Economics is not supposed to be a zero-sum game. Nonetheless, the
collapse of Asia has been a boon to U.S. consumers and to many U.S.
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to devalued Asian currencies, we've been getting TVs,
microwave ovens, and computer chips at bargain prices, so our
consumer price index has stayed amazingly low.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the emerging markets (and a sagging Japan)
have reduced their purchases of such commodities as gold, oil, and
copper, allowing U.S. firms to snap up raw materials at record low
prices and widen profit margins. (True, U.S. exporters to Asia like
Boeing and Caterpillar have suffered, but most Americans don't work
for such firms).
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign companies enter bankruptcy, they stop
borrowing money. That has meant lower rates for Americans borrowing
to buy homes and cars. The result: low inflation, high stock
prices, and happy consumers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   When the foreign economies heal, however, Americans will lose
these freebies. As Asian countries have begun to recover _ South
Korea is now growing at a 5 percent pace _ the value of their
currencies has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Their goods will look more expensive to U.S. consumers. Asians
will begin borrowing more funds for new investments; worldwide
interest rates will creep up. And stronger foreign economies will
use more commodities, including copper, oil, and nickel.
</P>
<P>
   We have gotten used to falling prices for commodities and
foreign goods, deflation that has offset the inflationary pressures
of a tight labor market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under this ``world rebound'' scenario, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan might feel compelled to raise interest rates to
prevent a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, higher rates could put the brakes on the U.S.
economy, especially slowing the now surging car and housing
markets. (Remember, the housing propels furniture, refrigerator,
and washer-dryer sales.)
</P>
<P>
   We could even tip into a recession, if the Fed jacks up rates
too high. Even though some U.S. exporters would enjoy the world
rebound, most consumers would feel the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, could the U.S. be better off if the rest of the world
remained in recession? Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-busines sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 until now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

RED SOX BEAT ROYALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a Red Sox team five weeks away from reaching the playoffs
for the second straight season, there can be no better sight than
Pedro Martinez in the full bloom of health.
</P>
<P>
   That was underscored yet again in Monday night's 9-1 mismatch
against the Kansas City Royals, Boston's fourth straight win, in
which Martinez struck out 11, walked just one, and didn't allow a
runner past first base after the second inning. Jimy Williams
dismissed him after the sixth inning, ahead, 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who gave up just four hits, is 3-1 with a 1.74 ERA in
five starts since coming off the disabled list at the start of the
month. He is 19-4, matching his 1998 win total with potentially six
starts left. The Royals' only run scored on a second-inning wild
pitch after a double by Jermaine Dye and single by Mike Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day I'm feeling better and better,'' said Martinez, who
yielded to John Wasdin and Mark Guthrie after throwing 103 pitches.
``Stronger and healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Sox are banking on a refreshed Martinez to carry
them down the stretch, they may be forced to reclaim their
wild-card spot without John Valentin. The third baseman, who
already had missed three of the last five games with a sore left
knee, departed after four innings Monday night and admitted he may
be finished for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible, sure,'' Valentin said. ``I hate to say it, but
yeah, it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who replaced Valentin with rookie Donnie Sadler, all
but conceded that reinforcements are on their way. Asked about
Trenton third baseman Wilton Veras, who played splendidly when
Valentin was on the DL earlier this season after a beaning,
Williams said, ``I'm not making that decision now, but that's
pretty good speculation. We called him up before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox would not have to make a move to add Veras Wednesday,
when rosters can be expanded beyond their normal 25-man limit. But
if the Sox intend to have Veras eligible for postseason play, they
may decide to place Valentin on the DL Tuesday and have Veras on
board in time for Tuesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to take him out of a game,'' Williams said. ``That's
not good. No collision, nothing. We need to get him checked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the team has been home for five days, Valentin still
has not undergone a magnetic resonance imaging, which presumably
would show whether there is an injury requiring surgery. Valentin
was scheduled to have an MRI last Friday but according to him the
machine was malfunctioning. He's scheduled to go this morning, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Bret Saberhagen, meanwhile, flew to New York Monday
morning for an MRI with his own doctor, had the results analyzed
while he was there (frayed rotator cuff), and was still back in the
clubhouse three hours before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Why the apparent absence of urgency with Valentin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a comment for you,'' Valentin said. ``We'll take
care of it (Tuesday).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat my fault, to basically have blown off the fact
that my knee hurts. When you're a player, you just want to play. I
basically go out there and if I can walk, I can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not working, which is very, very, very frustrating.
If I would have said something, I probably should have said
something in spring training, but I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin said over the weekend that he has been hurt since
midseason a year ago, but after the season was told by the Sox
medical staff that only rest was required. But only a couple of
weeks into spring training, the condition flared up, but he didn't
say anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping it was just temporary,'' he said. ``But it
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, after playing four games on the artificial turf in
Toronto, he said he intended to go home and have an MRI, but never
did. He said at that time that the medical staff told him it was
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've got to play with,'' Valentin said at the
time. ``Does it feel better? Well, it doesn't bother me when I
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   In 12 games since Aug. 15, Valentin's play has declined
noticeably. He is batting .122 (5 for 41) in that span, with more
than twice as many strikeouts (11) as hits (5) and as many errors
(2) as RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   After waving at a ground ball single by Joe Randa in the fourth
inning, Valentin came into the dugout and told trainer Jim Rowe
that he couldn't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do it no more,'' Valentin said. ``I tried. Shoot. It's
just been like this for the longest time. I've been playing in pain
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler reached and scored in Boston's four-run fifth when an
opponent bobbled his sacrifice bunt attempt for the second time in
two days. He also singled and scored in the two-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, fresh off a three-game sweep of Mo Vaughn's Angels, had
14 hits, four by Jose Offerman, while taking the measure of another
former teammate, Royals pitcher Jeff Suppan. They moved 15 games
above .500 for the first time this season while increasing their
their lead over Oakland in the AL wild-card race to two games with
31 left.
</P>
<P>
   It's play like this that will carry the Sox to the playoffs.
Valentin, meanwhile, pondered the possibility that he'll be reduced
to the role of spectator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been affecting my play all year,'' he said. ``But you
still try to rise above it. You want to help your team to the
playoffs. There isn't anyone who doesn't want to play.''

<P>
   For over a year we have heard the pundits and pooh-bahs say that
weak foreign economies pose the biggest risk to U.S. markets and
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai baht crisis of 1997 was supposed to knock us down. Same
for the Russian crisis of 1998. Ditto the Brazilian currency
collapse of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these falling dominoes, the American economy has been
growing at better than 4 percent, and the Dow easily pierced 10,000
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ma &AMP; Pa investor, who ignored the foreign headlines and kept
funneling their savings into the market, proved smarter than the
swamis.
</P>
<P>
   Hence my willingness to turn the conventional claims on their
head and declare that stronger foreign economies pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds loony, I know. Had I said that a dozen years ago, when I
was teaching economics, I might have been tossed from Harvard Yard:
Economics is not supposed to be a zero-sum game. Nonetheless, the
collapse of Asia has been a boon to U.S. consumers and to many U.S.
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to devalued Asian currencies, we've been getting TVs,
microwave ovens, and computer chips at bargain prices, so our
consumer price index has stayed amazingly low.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the emerging markets (and a sagging Japan)
have reduced their purchases of such commodities as gold, oil, and
copper, allowing U.S. firms to snap up raw materials at record low
prices and widen profit margins. (True, U.S. exporters to Asia like
Boeing and Caterpillar have suffered, but most Americans don't work
for such firms).
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign companies enter bankruptcy, they stop
borrowing money. That has meant lower rates for Americans borrowing
to buy homes and cars. The result: low inflation, high stock
prices, and happy consumers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   When the foreign economies heal, however, Americans will lose
these freebies. As Asian countries have begun to recover _ South
Korea is now growing at a 5 percent pace _ the value of their
currencies has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Their goods will look more expensive to U.S. consumers. Asians
will begin borrowing more funds for new investments; worldwide
interest rates will creep up. And stronger foreign economies will
use more commodities, including copper, oil, and nickel.
</P>
<P>
   We have gotten used to falling prices for commodities and
foreign goods, deflation that has offset the inflationary pressures
of a tight labor market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under this ``world rebound'' scenario, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan might feel compelled to raise interest rates to
prevent a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, higher rates could put the brakes on the U.S.
economy, especially slowing the now surging car and housing
markets. (Remember, the housing propels furniture, refrigerator,
and washer-dryer sales.)
</P>
<P>
   We could even tip into a recession, if the Fed jacks up rates
too high. Even though some U.S. exporters would enjoy the world
rebound, most consumers would feel the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, could the U.S. be better off if the rest of the world
remained in recession? Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-busines sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 until now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

HOMELESS UNDER ATTACK AS CRIMINALS SEEK EASY PREY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CLAY THOMPSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ They are the least among us, broken by poverty,
illness or addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the men and women who scratch out their existences in
Phoenix's homeless district are increasingly finding themselves
easy prey for criminals who take by force what little the homeless
have.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police report that aggravated assaults in the area are
up about 15 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 56 assaults in the downtown area near the
railroad tracks. There have been 40 attacks in the first seven
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The area is heavily peopled by the homeless, but it is not
possible to determine how many of the victims were street people.
Those records aren't kept. And police say they can't explain the
increase.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who live on the streets or frequent the shelters
or cheap hotels downtown say many of the attacks are against them,
and increasingly, they're fueled by drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not safe down here. You get a guy with $5 or $13 or $20
and and somebody will rob him for it,'' Mike Moss of Phoenix said
over lunch at the St. Vincent de Paul dining room downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's drugs. There are a lot of drugs and robberies around
here. It's just a crime-infested area. There are too many people
hanging out on the streets,'' said Moss, who is not homeless but
takes advantage of the dining room's free meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``And 90 percent of the time, the guy won't tell the police.
They don't want to get known as a snitch.'' &QL; 
`GETTING MORE AGGRESSIVE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The director of Central Arizona Shelter services, a homeless
shelter in the area, said he recently has been receiving many
complaints about area violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be getting more and more aggressive out on the
streets here,'' Mark Holleran said. ``Our clients complain of being
threatened, we had a staff member punched today and I had a man
threaten to beat me. It's been pretty bad and I'm not sure why.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a loosely organized group of seven men were
arrested following early morning robberies of three people in the
area, one of whom was shot, police said. Phoenix police said they
believe the group is responsible for a series of similar attacks
over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When 4 (p.m.) comes, you can't walk around outside here.
They're dealing (drugs) out here. There are cars coming and going
all the time,'' said Irene Molina as she and Carol Woodord walked
from the dining room back to the CASS homeless shelter on Madison
Street. Both are CASS clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here a week, at CASS,'' Woodord said. ``I'm scared
to death to go out at night. Even during the day it's not safe.'' &QL; 
`VERY VULNERABLE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For criminals, the pickings are slim but easy along Madison
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Street people ``are very, very vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are carrying everything they own. Many of them are
mentally ill. Some are physically disabled,'' said Kay Martin, who
runs an ecumenical ministry for street people at First Presbyterian
Church, 402 West Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens often, too often,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Without bank accounts, the homeless carry what cash they have
with them and in a neighborhood filled with desperation, you can
get rolled for a quarter. Identification cards, a necessity for
getting welfare or help from agencies that aid the homeless, are a
popular target for thieves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of predators,'' homeless advocate Louisa Stark
said. ``It's horrible, horrible. Almost every crime there is
committed against them.`
</P>
<P>
   Muggings are especially numerous around ``Mother's Day,'' the
day welfare checks arrive at a postal substation across the street
from the St. Vincent de Paul dining room. &QL; 
MANY CRIMES UNREPORTED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many of the crimes are never even reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gerald Roseberry, a retired Presbyterian minister and a
homeless advocate who once lived on the streets of Phoenix and
Tucson for a month, said homeless people often are reluctant to
turn to the police for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't necessarily look on the police as their friends,''
he said. ``They don't always trust the police (like) an averaged
middle-class person does.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Bob Ragsdale, a Phoenix police spokesman, said street
people, especially illegal immigrants, may be anxious to avoid
contact with the police, even to report a crime against themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, police respond swiftly when notified.
</P>
<P>
   Officers were on the scene of last week's shooting in the
homeless district within one minute of getting the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will evaluate every incident on its merit,'' he said. &QL;

BROWN LIFTS DODGERS TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Brown is a huge Star Wars fan. He
understands hype, and the inability to live up to it when it
reaches the level the Phantom Menace did.
</P>
<P>
   He also understands it's virtually impossible to live up to
expectations after signing for $105 million. For the 15th time in
21 decisions as a Los Angeles Dodger, Brown won, and yet more seems
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by Eric Karros' two-run homer, Brown was a 6-1
complete-game winner against Milwaukee at Dodger Stadium on Monday,
but it wasn't that easy. Nothing's been that easy for Brown this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not having the type of year I'd like to have,'' said
Brown, who is 15-6 with a 3.24 ERA. ``It's not easy for me, every
year you don't click. There's been a lot of tough games where
there's been tough breaks. I've pitched bad in some games and in
some games you need to get breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has won six straight decisions, hasn't lost since July 5
and his mannerisms and work ethic have begun to wear off on others
on the Dodgers staff. He has failed to pitch at least seven innings
in just one of his past nine starts, and since his last loss his
ERA is 2.44; that includes seven earned runs in his last start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as comfortable (as last season),'' Brown said. ``I'm
not as consistently locked in. Overall, I don't feel as good as I
did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown came very close to his first shutout as a Dodger on a
potential double-play grounder. He still leads the staff in any
positive category you can come up with for a starter, but he admits
all isn't rosy.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening-day start against Arizona in which he allowed
five runs in 52/3 innings, to the four-start stretch in which he
went without a win a few months ago, to the grand slam he allowed
to Milwaukee's Jose Valentin in his last start, there has always
been something that has cropped up this year that wasn't there in
Brown's last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He led Florida to the 1997 World Series title by going 16-8 with
a 2.69 ERA. Last year he was 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA in taking San
Diego to the World Series before losing to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all haven't seen the best of him yet,'' Dodgers left fielder
Gary Sheffield said. ``I'm living proof of that. I saw him in
Florida. He's pitching great, but I've seen him better. I think his
competitive desire is great no matter what. When it's the playoffs,
he takes it to another level. It's like, just get him a run.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said, Brown has tried to
shoulder too much of the responsibility in helping to develop the
rest of the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was the time Brown sat and talked with Chan Ho Park
for a few hours after Park was hit hard in a start. Darren Dreifort
talked about watching Brown's work ethic and ability to bear down
in crucial situations, and learning from it.
</P>
<P>
   During a 16-inning loss to Arizona in the second week of the
season, Brown asked to pitch in relief. Johnson balked at it. Brown
has asked a few times since, and been turned down each time.
</P>
<P>
   But that desire also prompted Johnson to let Brown finish the
ninth inning after two one-out singles. Brown, who threw 126
pitches in his third complete-game of the season, nearly got Alex
Ochoa to ground into a double play with the bases loaded. A run
scored to make it 6-1, but Marquis Grissom grounded to short to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also the matter of the last time Brown pitched. He
blew a 5-2 lead and allowed a Jose Valentin grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complete game, yeah, but I don't like to push him too
far,'' Johnson said of why he left Brown in. ``I had to let him get
that shot at the shutout.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For over a year we have heard the pundits and pooh-bahs say that
weak foreign economies pose the biggest risk to U.S. markets and
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai baht crisis of 1997 was supposed to knock us down. Same
for the Russian crisis of 1998. Ditto the Brazilian currency
collapse of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these falling dominoes, the American economy has been
growing at better than 4 percent, and the Dow easily pierced 10,000
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ma &AMP; Pa investor, who ignored the foreign headlines and kept
funneling their savings into the market, proved smarter than the
swamis.
</P>
<P>
   Hence my willingness to turn the conventional claims on their
head and declare that stronger foreign economies pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds loony, I know. Had I said that a dozen years ago, when I
was teaching economics, I might have been tossed from Harvard Yard:
Economics is not supposed to be a zero-sum game. Nonetheless, the
collapse of Asia has been a boon to U.S. consumers and to many U.S.
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to devalued Asian currencies, we've been getting TVs,
microwave ovens, and computer chips at bargain prices, so our
consumer price index has stayed amazingly low.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the emerging markets (and a sagging Japan)
have reduced their purchases of such commodities as gold, oil, and
copper, allowing U.S. firms to snap up raw materials at record low
prices and widen profit margins. (True, U.S. exporters to Asia like
Boeing and Caterpillar have suffered, but most Americans don't work
for such firms).
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign companies enter bankruptcy, they stop
borrowing money. That has meant lower rates for Americans borrowing
to buy homes and cars. The result: low inflation, high stock
prices, and happy consumers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   When the foreign economies heal, however, Americans will lose
these freebies. As Asian countries have begun to recover _ South
Korea is now growing at a 5 percent pace _ the value of their
currencies has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Their goods will look more expensive to U.S. consumers. Asians
will begin borrowing more funds for new investments; worldwide
interest rates will creep up. And stronger foreign economies will
use more commodities, including copper, oil, and nickel.
</P>
<P>
   We have gotten used to falling prices for commodities and
foreign goods, deflation that has offset the inflationary pressures
of a tight labor market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under this ``world rebound'' scenario, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan might feel compelled to raise interest rates to
prevent a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, higher rates could put the brakes on the U.S.
economy, especially slowing the now surging car and housing
markets. (Remember, the housing propels furniture, refrigerator,
and washer-dryer sales.)
</P>
<P>
   We could even tip into a recession, if the Fed jacks up rates
too high. Even though some U.S. exporters would enjoy the world
rebound, most consumers would feel the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, could the U.S. be better off if the rest of the world
remained in recession? Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-busines sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 until now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

<P>
   Between Jan. 15 and April 15, Mexico's IPC index, or Bolsa,
jumped about 65 percent, the best performance by a major stock
index this year.
</P>
<P>
   Had you been brave enough to buy Mexican stocks in mid-September
last year, while Brazil, Russia, and Long-Term Capital Management
were turning wealth into waste, you would have nearly doubled your
money.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us were so brave, however: The pundits were warning us
that Brazil _ as the next domino after Thailand, Malaysia, and
Indonesia _ would soon topple the rest of Latin America, including
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But economists underestimated the confidence and resilience of
U.S. consumers, who bought more than 85 percent of Mexico's
exports. As long as American families kept shopping, Mexican
factories ought to keep humming to meet our demand for cars,
clothes, and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mexico exports hardly anything to Brazil, a
key point overlooked during the frenzied sell-off last year in
Mexico's market.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Mexicans speak Spanish does not mean their economy
is linked more closely to Latin America than to North America.
Indeed, our 6 percent gain in gross domestic product in the fourth
quarter of 1998, despite tumbles in the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq, was an excellent signal that Mexico would not collapse.
</P>
<P>
   As American consumers swiped their credit cards, Mexican
businessmen wiped their brows with relief. The several thousand
factories just south of the U.S. border _ in an area known as
Maquiladora _ have continued to thrive in 1999, with overall
exports increasing at a 7.7 percent pace in February.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of watching their economy shrink in 1999, as
Brazilians, Argentines, and Venezuelans will, Mexicans will see
their GDP rise by 2 to 3 percent. (In further tribute to the
country's resilience, the jobless rate fell to just 2.7 percent in
March.)
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind the Bolsa's bounce is the rise in the
price of oil. Crude jumped from about $11 per barrel in December to
$18 by mid-April, thanks to an OPEC deal to cut production,
stronger economic prospects in Asia, and the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexico exports oil, higher prices improve Mexico's
expected trade balance and its budget revenue projections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the Bolsa hitting 5430 in the second half of April,
investors in Mexico might want to book some profits now, because
there are a couple of dangers looming.
</P>
<P>
   First, Mexicans will head to the voting booths to elect a new
president in July 2000. Months before the 1994 election, wealthy
Mexicans began sneaking their funds out of the country to the
safety of U.S. banks in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They may get antsy again, recalling that the last presidential
election was marred by the assassination of the leading candidate,
rising inflation, and ultimately a collapse of the peso, which
triggered a deep recession in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the reigning PRI party, which has dominated Mexican
politics for 70 years, has been bloodied in recent years and even
been forced to share power with its rivals on the right (PAN) and
the left (PRD).
</P>
<P>
   President Zedillo's interior minister, Francisco Labastida, is a
candidate, but other cabinet ministers may challenge him for the
PRI's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A second possible trouble spot is the peso. It looked awfully
strong earlier this year, actually rising by more than 5 percent
against the U.S. dollar through mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   If Mexican exporters start bellyaching about how a stronger peso
hurts their ability to compete with other countries, investors
should head for the exits with their profits in tow. &QL;

 THE CITY OF WALKING DANEROUSLY  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than look at San Francisco's driver-pedestrian wars as
horrifying chaos, I prefer to view them as performance art, a
street ballet.
</P>
<P>
   You're not a pedestrian, you're a bullfighter, only without the
skin-tight, embroidered pants.
</P>
<P>
   I have long been fascinated by the bravery of pedestrians,
especially those who exhibit a sleepwalking nonchalance in the face
of imminent death, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Top Gun walkers not only don't look at oncoming traffic
before meandering into the street, they look the  &UR; other way. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dave Grenley has pondered this phenomenon and come up with three
possible explanations:
</P>
<P>
   1. In an effort to stay at the forefront of the human potential
movement, pedestrians use blind trust to connect with total
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   2. The walkers are stripping drivers of the bluff card. You
can't scare a pedestrian out of the street if he won't look at you.
</P>
<P>
   3. These pedestrians are stupid, and this is what
evolution/natural selection looks like in action, except in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ASHES TO ASPHALT: An interesting story came out of a small town
in Colorado, where a woman dumped her dead husband's ashes into a
load of street-paving asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked the smell of asphalt,'' she said, ``so by God, he can
smell it forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Do I detect a bit of an edge in that statement?
</P>
<P>
   But when the road begins to deteriorate, will the man's widow
know his ash from a pothole in the ground?
</P>
<P>
   Here in San Francisco, we skip the cremation middleman and embed
the person into the pavement with the wheels of our cars.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not all the fault of the drivers. Scott McKellar
wonders why it is we send bad drivers to driving school to brush up
on safety and courtesy, but we don't send jaywalkers to walking
school.
</P>
<P>
   If a pedestrian is a three-strikes jaywalker, let's make him or
her wear a pair of Denver boots.
</P>
<P>
   A BILLBOARD in Berkeley reads: ``Just because you survived drugs
doesn't mean your children will.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the message used to be. Audrey Newell
noticed that someone has crossed out ``drugs'' and painted in
``Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably some noncompassionate liberal.
</P>
<P>
   LET'S SAY you're driving around in your Lincoln Navigator and
you get lost. Would you have the guts to stop and ask directions?
</P>
<P>
   Judging from a magazine ad for the Navigator, the
battleship-class SUV, there is potential for geographical &LR; 
 &LR; confusion. In the ad photo, spotted by Jerry Olmsted, a Navigator
is climbing the road into the Marin Headlands, and in the distant
background is the familiar S.F. skyline.
</P>
<P>
   In the foreground is the Bay Bridge, which, if memory serves,
does not connect the city with the Marin Headlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigator is no vehicle for the traditionalist.
</P>
<P>
   IN OTHER car news, a silver BMW cruises the city with the
license plates: CLNUPSF (spotted by Deb Elam).
</P>
<P>
   Cop? Neat freak? FBI agent? Batman? Investigative reporter?
Evangelist? Street sweeper?
</P>
<P>
   WHO WANTS to be a Millionaire? That's the name of the new TV
quiz show hosted by Regis Philbin, and if you haven't seen it, this
won't make much sense.
</P>
<P>
   The show is way overdone; the set looks like the cockpit of a
UFO, and the music is right out of ``Psycho.'' But it's strangely
compelling, like frosted pretzels, maybe because people like you
and me sit down for 10 minutes and rake in tons of money.
</P>
<P>
   But here's my beef: If a contestant is stumped on one of the
multiple-choice questions, he or she can poll the audience, one
time. With alarming frequency, a guy will poll the audience, and 97
percent will say the answer is ``B,'' Cheryl Ladd.
</P>
<P>
   Then the guy will scratch his head and spend two minutes
deciding whether to go with the audience and its obviously correct
answer, or go down in flames with a lame guess.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're a contestant, know that if you pull this particular
stunt, we viewers will pool our individual karmas and you will not
only lose, but as a lovely parting gift, you will face a lifetime
of relentless remorse and ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   EUREKA: Cisco Systems recently bought out Cerent, a Petaluma
high-tech company, for $6.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That's an average killing of $7 million per Cerent employee.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the AP story notes that: ``No layoffs are
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   AT STARBUCKS, a barista told a customer, ``The small is tall,''
which probably makes sense to a hookah-smoking caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only that,'' says Glen Farmer, ``but McDonald's no longer
sells small fries. Did they lose the recipe?''
</P>
<P>
   No, Glen. McDonald's simply wants to encourage people to think
big. To dream the impossible cholesterol count.

 CALIFORNIA'S LATINOS A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE FOR BUSH  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ GOP presidential front-runner Gov. George W.
Bush has had some electrifying success courting Latino voters in
his home state of Texas, winning nearly 40 percent of their vote in
the last election.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush rides into California this week to begin wooing the
state's 2.3 million Latino voters _ and political insiders here say
he'd better get used to a whole different landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latino vote in Texas is very different from the Latino
vote in California,'' said California GOP strategist Michael
Madrid, whose studies show that Latinos here tend to be younger and
newer to the United States and have a different economic profile.
``The question is: Can the magic be transferred?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is betting it can.
</P>
<P>
   With seven months before California's March 7 presidential
primary, Bush's efforts to court the state's fastest-growing _ and
arguably most-courted _ group of voters underscore the fierce fight
looming over Latino loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   Latino voters make up almost 40 percent of all new voters in the
nation's most populous state, and their numbers are expected to
explode to 2.8 million in the next two years, Madrid's studies
show.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why the GOP front-runner arrives in California
tomorrow to make his first major appearance before a Latino
organization as a presidential candidate. Starting Thursday
morning, the Texas governor will visit an Inglewood elementary
school, where he is slated to produce ``the first of a series of
educational policy proposals,'' his campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he will head to the Los Angeles Convention Center to
deliver a luncheon address to 3,000 entrepreneurs of the Latin
Business Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand (it) will be a substantive message directed at
our community and our business owners,'' said the organization's
chairman, Hector Barreto. ``The Bush people are really going to
contest California, and ... they feel they have a really good shot
at enrolling people to their side and getting out their message.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's efforts to reach out to Latinos in California come
with formidable challenges, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, there are the numbers:
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Republican Bush got 39 percent of the Latino vote in
the 1998 gubernatorial election _ less than half that of California
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who reaped a whopping 84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the demographic and political differences:
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is a different country from California,'' said Patricia
Perez, a partner in Valencia, Perez &AMP; Echeveste, a Pasadena-based
public relations agency, and an officer in the Latin Business
Association. ``Here, people consider (Latino voters) to be
Democratic and liberal. In Texas, it's a very established
community, middle-class, educated, affluent and business owners.
And it tends to be Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, California's Latinos encompass waves of new immigrants
each year _ thousands more Spanish speakers working more
entry-level jobs. One of four Latino voters here is under age 30,
and the vast majority have been voting only since 1994, said
Madrid, who has long tracked the demographic, economic and
political patterns of the state's Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   And California's Democratic Party has successfully reached them
with campaigns stressing education, labor issues like the minimum
wage and 40-hour workweeks, health care and child care, said
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   But in Texas, three-quarters of Latino voters were born in the
United States and have third- and fourth-generation American roots.
Fewer speak Spanish as a first language, and they tend to be older,
more upwardly mobile and better educated. The Latino small business
owners and professionals tend to be more receptive to Republican
messages about taxes, less government and family values, said
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   California, far more than Texas, has experienced grave political
fallout from the recent immigration wave. ``It's resentment. It's
`They Keep Coming,' '' said Madrid, referring to an infamous
television ad for Proposition 187, the 1994 anti-illegal
immigration measure, which whipped up support by using clips of
Mexicans scurrying across the border.
</P>
<P>
   That divisive ad, and anger at GOP former Gov. Pete Wilson's
role in the 187 campaign, drove thousands of Latinos to register
Democratic, recalled California's Democratic Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamante, a first-generation Californian and the state's
highest-ranking Latino elected official.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the problems for Republicans in California.
They've missed the opportunity,'' said Bustamante, who won nearly
90 percent of the state's Latino vote last year. ``They've not
thought of Latinos in the same way as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign, sensitive to the criticism, appears to be
distancing itself from Wilson, publicly dismissing reports that a
role for the former governor in the Bush effort is ``a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Wilson, the Spanish-speaking Bush has used
advertising that appeals to Latinos. In his last campaign, Bush's
media director, Lionel Sosa, chose ads heavy on values; one
included Bush sitting on a porch and talking to Latinos
heart-to-heart. ``It was, `mi casa es su casa,' '' said Leslie
Goodman, editor in chief of politicalaccess.com, a leading
political Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Others Bush ads omitted mention of party altogether. ``The
message was, `We have a lot in common. We think alike,''' Sosa has
said. ``It's very subtle. ... We never say: Vote Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante acknowledges that Bush's outreach to Latinos has
shown him as ``a charming and affable man. ... He's appointed a
Latino to the (Texas) Supreme Court, and that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But ... the thin veneer is starting to flake off ... and the
symbolism will fade quickly,'' the Democrat predicts. Bush will
``have to answer some tough questions, like `Why is drug use in
Texas up among teenagers? Why is it that college attendance is down
for Latinos, and even the number of Latinos going to law school is
down (in Texas)?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP strategist for a rival presidential campaign said that
if Bush wants the Latino vote, he'll have to answer the questions _
and work for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latino voters in California have a long memory,'' the
strategist warned. ``And their detectors are acutely tuned for
Republican candidates offering platitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Madrid, the former spokesman for the state GOP, insists that
the appeals of GOP candidates _ like Bush and U.S. Sen. John
McCain, who also has successfully wooed Latinos _ mean ``you will
see a genuine battle for the Latino vote here, which is exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, ``what drove Latinos from the Republican fold is
what will bring them back,'' Madrid said _ ``a candidate that
sells.'' &LR;

DECLINE IN AIDS DEATH RATE SLOWS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Better drugs are not enough to stop the AIDS epidemic, U.S.
health officials said Monday, reporting that after two years of
dramatic improvement, the drop in AIDS deaths is starting to slow
down.
<P>
   At the same time, HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, seems to be
gaining ground again in San Francisco and in minority communities
at highest risk.
</P>
<P>
   Disease trackers at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention counted 17,047 deaths from AIDS last year, down 20
percent from the national AIDS death toll in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although that was, by all accounts, a substantial decline, it
was less than half the 42 percent drop in deaths recorded from 1996
to 1997. It was the smallest improvement since the advent of
protease inhibitors and combination drug therapies in the mid-'90s.
And virtually all of the 20 percent improvement in 1998 came during
the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths from AIDS had plunged from nearly 50,000 in 1995 to
21,000 just two years later. Few were expecting such dramatic gains
to continue beyond the initial rollout of the new treatment
options.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Gayle, director of the CDC's National Center for
Prevention of HIV, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Tuberculosis,
reviewed the latest statistics Monday at the opening of the
National HIV Prevention Conference in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the more modest improvements in the death toll from
AIDS, she noted that new AIDS cases declined only 11 percent in
1998 compared with an 18 percent decline in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now seeing the first signs of the slowing of this
trend,'' Gayle said, adding that in terms of the U.S. population as
a whole, ``most of the benefits of the new treatments have been
realized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten the drugs out to the people that know they're
infected,'' she said. ``I think now we've got to do a better job to
be sure we get access to treatment for people who don't know
they're infected, which means getting more people tested.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC also estimated that new infections with HIV are holding
steady at 40,000 a year in the United States. That marks a huge
drop from the worst years of the 1980s, when up to 150,000 people
were being infected with HIV each year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, studies of the AIDS virus in San Francisco
showed a disturbing possibility that HIV may be on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   William McFarland of the University of California at San
Francisco presented new data showing that HIV was found in only 1
percent of gay men who sought anonymous testing in San Francisco
during the second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By the first half of 1999, the infection rate among gay men
seeking an HIV test in San Francisco had risen to 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the increase on more high-risk sexual activity and the
spread of gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted diseases linked
to HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   As many experts had feared, success on the AIDS treatment front
may be translating into complacency at the leading edge of the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of progress in preventing HIV, transmission may be
increasing in the San Francisco Bay Area,'' McFarland said. ``These
findings are particularly worrisome in light of recent increases in
gonorrhea and high-risk sexual behavior from other studies in the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   The national AIDS/HIV statistics also confirm the changing
demographic nature of the AIDS epidemic. About half the AIDS deaths
last year were among African Americans, who make up just 13 percent
of the total population.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were somewhat surprised to find that heterosexual
activity is now about as significant a factor in the spread of HIV
as is injection-drug use and the sharing of contaminated needles.
</P>
<P>
   Virus trackers said the apparent increase in heterosexual
transmission is most likely due to the virus spreading first from
male injection drug users to their female partners, who then spread
HIV to other sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   Younger gay men and heterosexual women account for a growing
number of new HIV infections in African American populations,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of all new infections in 1998 were in men,
among whom gay or bisexual contact was blamed in about 6 of every
10 cases. Intravenous drug use was cited in 25 percent of the new
infections in men, while 15 percent were due to heterosexual
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Among women newly infected with HIV, 75 percent of the
infections were due to heterosexual contact with an infected male
and 25 percent from intravenous drug use. Among newly infected
women, approximately 64 percent were African American women, 18
percent white and 19 percent Latino. Half of the newly infected men
were African Americans, 30 percent white and 20 percent Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics set a sobering tone Monday for the opening
sessions of the Atlanta conference. About 2,000 scientists and
disease prevention specialists are attending the event, which ends
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the researchers came to discuss ways to stem the
epidemic in minority populations often neglected in the past. Also,
because so many people with HIV and AIDS are living longer, the
total number of those infected is increasing, further complicating
efforts to halt the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are entering a new era in HIV prevention,'' said CDC
director Jeffrey Koplan. ``Prevention efforts must aggressively
target a wider range of communities at risk, as well as an
increasing population of HIV-infected individuals.''

 &HT;    Art that fits my taste
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Stuffy art critics laugh down their snide
sleeves at we plebeians who view art with an unjaundiced eye. They
ridicule our naive honesty when we confess to knowing little more
about art than what we like. But that's OK, they don't hurt my
feelings. Let 'em snicker.
</P>
<P>
   I know enough about painting to know that Wyeth is good; Elvis
on velvet doesn't move me; and my Aunt Bessie should have had her
brush taken away from her. I appreciate Matisse and Renoir, but I
can't afford them. Picasso was a genius, I'm sure, and so was
Warhol, but I just haven't the yen to live with a green-bellied,
orange-nosed woman or a Campbell's soup can in the living room.
Neither match the rug.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not I fall in love with a painting depends strictly
on how it makes me feel when I stand in front of it. If it tries to
educate me, forget it. But if the flower garden beckons me to sit a
spell on the stone bench, or if the cottage nestled beside the
stream invites me for tea in front of the fire, I become involved.
I want to crawl inside the frame and live there.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to me this morning. The day began
innocently enough and things looked pretty smooth until after my
bath. I was rummaging around the bedroom looking for something
baggy to wear when I caught sight of myself in the full-length
mirror _ the one I should have taken down 15 years ago when I
bought the house.
</P>
<P>
   GET THYSELF TO A GYM! I screeched at the saggy mess staring back
at me. Time to shift the fat and make an attempt to move certain
body parts back where they belong _ if I could still remember where
they came from.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's how I happened to be parked on the main street of
a nearby town in front of a body shop for old broads _ right across
the street from an art gallery/cafe.
</P>
<P>
   I climbed the stairs to the second floor of a 100-year-old,
high-ceilinged building (87 steps _ if you make it up there you
obviously have a strong heart so they sign you up automatically)
and confessed to the lady in short pants (my breathing and her gym
clothes) that I needed help. She did not question the validity of
my demands and immediately chained me to a bicycle that goes
nowhere and told me to start pedaling.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway to Ashtabula, the woman with the whip released me and
made me promise
</P>
<P>
   to come back on Thursday for more. I left feeling pretty smug.
Surely I'd burned enough calories to slip in across the street for
a latte and a browse.
</P>
<P>
   And there it was _ a painting I couldn't live without. No matter
I'd have to sell the house and mortgage the cats to pay for it, I
had to have it.
</P>
<P>
   To the casual observer, the scene might look like nothing more
than a simple painting of any evening in an everyday neighborhood
of the '30s. It's drizzling. The street is narrow and the sidewalks
are the stone kind I remember roller skating on. In one yard is a
Dauber Dog (Dalmatian) like the one Mrs. Bartel, the artist on the
corner, had. On the porch next door is a scotty like President
Roosevelt's Fala that I'd seen in the newsreels every Wednesday
night at the Broadview.
</P>
<P>
   There are no dark windows, just lacy-curtained, yellow-lighted
ones, and although I can't see inside, I know there's a father
sitting in an old Morris chair reading the news. Mom's in the
kitchen mashing potatoes, and all is right with the world.
</P>
<P>
   When I look at this painting I know someone in there is waiting
for me to come home. It's the street I used to live on and the
place I'd like to go back to just one more time. It's my kind of
art.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'll hang it where the mirror used to be.

 &HT;    Cast of parts keep cooling system cool
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Your vehicle's cooling system is a working example of
the rule of physics stating that heat will always move toward a
cooler area or object.
</P>
<P>
   The coolant absorbs the intense heat created by the engine. The
water pump's job is to circulate the coolant, up to 7,500 gallons
an hour, throughout the cooling system. It moves the hot coolant
from the passages in the engine out to the radiator, where the
liquid gives up its heat to the air flowing through it. The
``cooled'' coolant is returned to the engine, and the whole cycle
starts over.
</P>
<P>
   As simple as this may sound, the entire production depends on a
cast of supporting parts. If one of them falls down on the job, the
whole system suffers and your car overheats.
</P>
<P>
   Most water pumps are attached to a pulley driven by a belt,
commonly called a fan belt or serpentine belt. Some pumps, however,
are driven by the engine's timing belt. In either case, it is
imperative that the belt has the correct tension and grip.
</P>
<P>
   Serpentine belts with self-adjusting, spring-loaded tensioners
used on most never vehicles have taken the guesswork out of this
area. However older vehicles using narrow ``V'' belts were subject
to problems, many starting from the time new belts were installed.
Just because a fan belt looks right and fits OK and is the right
length doesn't mean it will do the job 100 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   V belts grip the pulley at the sides of the V. If the belt is
too narrow or too wide, the contact area will be wrong, and it will
slip on the pulley under load. Misadjusted belts are a very common
problem. A loose belt will slip (usually accompanied by a
high-pitched squeal), and a belt that has been overtightened will
cause premature water pump failure.
</P>
<P>
   All belts _ serpentine, V and timing _ should be free of cracks
and glaze. This is best accomplished by adhering to the
manufacturer's maintenance schedule on belt replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Often, shops will suggest replacing the water pump when the
timing belt is replaced, even though there is no apparent problem
with the pump. This is not a rip-off sales pitch. A timing belt
replacement is labor-intensive and usually the most expensive part
of that job. Replacing a timing-belt-driven water pump at the same
time actually saves money on labor in the event the pump fails
before the belt is to be replaced again. Although it will add some
cost to timing belt job, it is cheaper than doing it later.
</P>
<P>
   The thermostat does not keep the engine cold. It is responsible
for correct engine-operating temperature. The thermostat is
designed to stay closed until the engine has reached a specific
temperature, when it begins to open. Once fully opened, maximum
coolant circulates between the engine and radiator with efficient
temperature maintained.
</P>
<P>
   A thermostat stuck in the closed position restricts flow,
resulting in engine overheating. Too often, the quick and dirty
repair for this is to install a ``cooler'' thermostat (one with a
lower temperature rating) or to remove it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That's the wrong move. Hotter coolant flowing through the
radiator actually gives up heat faster. In addition, a
``cold''-running engine wastes fuel, contaminates engine oil, plays
havoc with the engine's computer system and will fail an emissions
test in a heartbeat. Although thermostats occasionally fail of
their own accord, lifespan is usually proportional to the amount of
maintenance the cooling system receives.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Your vehicle's cooling system is a working example of
the rule of physics stating that heat will always move toward a
cooler area or object.
</P>
<P>
   The coolant absorbs the intense heat created by the engine. The
water pump's job is to circulate the coolant, up to 7,500 gallons
an hour, throughout the cooling system. It moves the hot coolant
from the passages in the engine out to the radiator, where the
liquid gives up its heat to the air flowing through it. The
``cooled'' coolant is returned to the engine, and the whole cycle
starts over.
</P>
<P>
   As simple as this may sound, the entire production depends on a
cast of supporting parts. If one of them falls down on the job, the
whole system suffers and your car overheats.
</P>
<P>
   Most water pumps are attached to a pulley driven by a belt,
commonly called a fan belt or serpentine belt. Some pumps, however,
are driven by the engine's timing belt. In either case, it is
imperative that the belt has the correct tension and grip.
</P>
<P>
   Serpentine belts with self-adjusting, spring-loaded tensioners
used on most never vehicles have taken the guesswork out of this
area. However older vehicles using narrow ``V'' belts were subject
to problems, many starting from the time new belts were installed.
Just because a fan belt looks right and fits OK and is the right
length doesn't mean it will do the job 100 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   V belts grip the pulley at the sides of the V. If the belt is
too narrow or too wide, the contact area will be wrong, and it will
slip on the pulley under load. Misadjusted belts are a very common
problem. A loose belt will slip (usually accompanied by a
high-pitched squeal), and a belt that has been overtightened will
cause premature water pump failure.
</P>
<P>
   All belts _ serpentine, V and timing _ should be free of cracks
and glaze. This is best accomplished by adhering to the
manufacturer's maintenance schedule on belt replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Often, shops will suggest replacing the water pump when the
timing belt is replaced, even though there is no apparent problem
with the pump. This is not a rip-off sales pitch. A timing belt
replacement is labor-intensive and usually the most expensive part
of that job. Replacing a timing-belt-driven water pump at the same
time actually saves money on labor in the event the pump fails
before the belt is to be replaced again. Although it will add some
cost to timing belt job, it is cheaper than doing it later.
</P>
<P>
   The thermostat does not keep the engine cold. It is responsible
for correct engine-operating temperature. The thermostat is
designed to stay closed until the engine has reached a specific
temperature, when it begins to open. Once fully opened, maximum
coolant circulates between the engine and radiator with efficient
temperature maintained.
</P>
<P>
   A thermostat stuck in the closed position restricts flow,
resulting in engine overheating. Too often, the quick and dirty
repair for this is to install a ``cooler'' thermostat (one with a
lower temperature rating) or to remove it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That's the wrong move. Hotter coolant flowing through the
radiator actually gives up heat faster. In addition, a
``cold''-running engine wastes fuel, contaminates engine oil, plays
havoc with the engine's computer system and will fail an emissions
test in a heartbeat. Although thermostats occasionally fail of
their own accord, lifespan is usually proportional to the amount of
maintenance the cooling system receives.

 &HT;    Applauds to BMW for driver ed program
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a person who has spent more than two decades in the
driver-training business, I know as well as anyone the benefits
that can be gained from proper instruction in the use of a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   It continues to amaze me that automobile accidents remain the
No. 1 preventable cause of death of our youth, but we seem to be
unwilling to do anything significant about it.
</P>
<P>
   People point out that automakers are making cars safer, that air
bags are common and more people are using seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Give me a break. This attitude will never solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers are not the problem. Accidents are only rarely caused
by the car. The majority of the time, they are caused by the person
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   An uneducated driver is almost like an accident waiting to
happen. For years, whenever I can bend the ear of an automaker, I
have tried to interest them in doing driver training, especially
for teenagers. It is a bit disappointing that the new school at the
BMW facility is limited to students 18 years and older.
</P>
<P>
   Any additional driver education opportunity is a plus, but I
wish someone _ especially auto manufacturers _ would be willing to
help address this issue. Not only would the education process
benefit the driving public, fewer accidents could lead to less
litigation against automakers.
</P>
<P>
   BMW should be applauded for its efforts. The adults who attend
the BMW facility can pass along the skills they have learned to
their children.
</P>
<P>
   With any skill, you usually are only as good as the person who
taught you. The BMW program provides serious, quality driver
education with quality, professional instructors. The classes are
not high-speed thrill courses, but provide a quality basis for
driving techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only more automakers were willing to do likewise, we
might just raise the bar for driving skills on our roadways.

 &HT;    Plymouth's refreshing Breeze
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Plymouth is really is headed for the end of its road, then
the 1999 Breeze is a reasonably nice stopping point. But its
rumored demise is likely to alarm only one market segment:
budget-conscious loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Breeze, which was introduced in 1996, is a plucky midsize
sedan, one that has twice made it onto Automobile magazine's 10
best list for obvious reasons. It's roomy, has decent power,
handles well and while not particularly striking, has sensible
styling that won't become offensive over time.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing starts at $15,115, and the Breeze comes with enough
features and so few available options that the ``inferno red''
tester _ fully loaded, so to speak _ totaled $17,625. That included
a $375 Expresso package with cassette player, special interior and
exterior trim and wheel covers.
</P>
<P>
   The big bumps were the four-speed automatic transmission that
added $1,050 and the $710 package that included power windows and
locks and heated mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a mostly comfortable sedan, although the front
seats aren't that pleasing for large people because of the way the
seats are shaped. The rear will seat three adults, but how long
they could travel together is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Three four-cylinder powerplants are available, and the test
Breeze's 2.4-liter version had ratings of 150 horsepower at 5,200
rpm and 167 pounds-feet torque at 4,000 rpm. That's enough power
for the 3,000-pound Breeze, but using all of it is a noisy process.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed manual that accompanies the base four-cylinder
can't be had with the line-topping motor, which would really make
for a peppy combination. But the four-speed automatic functioned
satisfactorily despite being slow to downshift when traffic
dictated speeding up.
</P>
<P>
   The handling, of course, is one of the Breeze's strong points.
The ride is not bump-proof, but the Breeze feels stable, maneuvers
well and doesn't do a lot of rebounding after hitting a bump. The
brakes aren't particularly strong, but work well during the type of
driving for which a Breeze is intended.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentation is basic but very visible, and the view from
behind the tilt steering wheel _ a standard feature _ is open.
There's a lot of plastic, which is hardly unusual for a car in the
Breeze's class, and the special Expresso cloth is hardly designer
level, but it's certainly not offensive.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're looking for upscale appointments and performance,
look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're looking for a reasonably competent midsize sedan
with a fair amount of features and room for a family, the Breeze
can be an economical way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Plymouth Breeze front-drive sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $17,625 (includes discounts not always
available, base price: $15,115)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: optional 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 16
valves ($455), optional four-speed automatic overdrive transmission
($1,050)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, side-impact beams,
height-adjustable front shoulder belts, power brakes with front
discs and rear drums
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: Expresso trim package with
cassette player, bucket seats with patterned cloth, special wheel
covers, $375; package with power windows and locks, power heated
mirrors, floor mats, $710; red tinted clearcoat paint, $200
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 21 mpg regular unleaded city, 30 mpg highway

with heart and senses than with mere thermometers. When we found
our fall touch, Celestine and I would launch into planning our
gardens, talking about what peach trees we were going to plant,
dwarf or full size...Even in later years, when she did not say it
or write it, I still thought it. And thought about her, her
ever-renewing spirit, quest for life's rich and varied offerings,
her exquisite love for words. Ohhh, the words.(May, Atlanta

 &HT;    Applauds to BMW for driver ed program
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a person who has spent more than two decades in the
driver-training business, I know as well as anyone the benefits
that can be gained from proper instruction in the use of a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   It continues to amaze me that automobile accidents remain the
No. 1 preventable cause of death of our youth, but we seem to be
unwilling to do anything significant about it.
</P>
<P>
   People point out that automakers are making cars safer, that air
bags are common and more people are using seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Give me a break. This attitude will never solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers are not the problem. Accidents are only rarely caused
by the car. The majority of the time, they are caused by the person
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   An uneducated driver is almost like an accident waiting to
happen. For years, whenever I can bend the ear of an automaker, I
have tried to interest them in doing driver training, especially
for teenagers. It is a bit disappointing that the new school at the
BMW facility is limited to students 18 years and older.
</P>
<P>
   Any additional driver education opportunity is a plus, but I
wish someone _ especially auto manufacturers _ would be willing to
help address this issue. Not only would the education process
benefit the driving public, fewer accidents could lead to less
litigation against automakers.
</P>
<P>
   BMW should be applauded for its efforts. The adults who attend
the BMW facility can pass along the skills they have learned to
their children.
</P>
<P>
   With any skill, you usually are only as good as the person who
taught you. The BMW program provides serious, quality driver
education with quality, professional instructors. The classes are
not high-speed thrill courses, but provide a quality basis for
driving techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only more automakers were willing to do likewise, we
might just raise the bar for driving skills on our roadways.

 &HT;    Government can be many things, but can't be masses' pulpit
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ As mercury vapors start to bathe Friday nights in
light, as pads start popping and vendors get to hawking, we know
what's on everyone's lips.
</P>
<P>
   Religion, of course.
</P>
<P>
   We'll get to football shortly. But first, can a community employ
its school district and its sound system to impart religion on
assembled saints and sinners? No. A thousand times, no.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many times judges may have to say it before people
will understand it.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that courtroom pageantry will continue as veritable
marching bands assert, usually against a courageous band of one,
that government is a rightful religious mouthpiece for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Three news stories serve as seasonal fodder. At Santa Fe High
School in Galveston County, a student elected to lead prayer before
football games pulled back under orders by the school district. It
has appealed to the Supreme Court a U.S. Fifth Circuit ruling
barring student-led prayer at games.
</P>
<P>
   In Andrews near Odessa, school trustees have decided to continue
student-led prayer at least until a lawsuit forces it to stop.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that this will be happening across Texas. School
districts will be wagering that no one will challenge the legality
of such prayers. Most will win the wager. But that doesn't justify
it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prior to kicking off a Friday night game in
Stephenville, 15 students led an unauthorized prayer over a
smuggled-in loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
   While disavowing any district role in what happened,
Stephenville Superintendent Larry Butler applauded the students
who'd staged the impromptu prayer, ``I think the entire community
of Stephenville believes in school prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Butler is right, presumptuous as it sounds. But as
superintendent of schools he's not hired to be superintendent of
faith and religion, which is what school prayer supporters want.
</P>
<P>
   What would have been the audience reaction to a smuggled-in P.A.
that broadcast readings from the Torah? Would the superintendent
have applauded? What if the students with the smuggled P.A. were to
recite the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard?
</P>
<P>
   Would Stephenville ISD make allowances for dueling barkers
before kick-off?
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to control the expressions of a football crowd,
but that's not what the Fifth Circuit ruling was about. It was
about the government telling everyone in a captive sporting
audience, ``Hush up one moment. It's time to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Such prayer can be defended only as a provincial tradition, not
as a right. And though it is well-meant, it is this kind of
tradition that America's earliest immigrants fled _ of people in
authority presuming to know how ``the community'' feels on matters
as personal as faith, and enforcing it with a nod.
</P>
<P>
   Once ensconced on these shores, history tells us that people
fleeing religious persecution bunched together in near-homogeneous
bodies and found ways to persecute those who bucked the homogeneity
on matters of faith.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt truth is that state-established religion sounds OK
only to those who believe themselves to be homogeneously bunched.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill of Rights for this wide and diverse nation prohibits
it. Religion thrives when government keeps its hands off it, the
founders wagered. Everybody won.
</P>
<P>
   When students or townfolks say that they are deprived of their
right to pray before football games, they are providing false
witness. Someone has called their hand on a communal tradition, a
hold-over from state-established religion of yore, not on the
exercising of their individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, if you want a state religion, sail back to England and
enjoy the scrum. This is America. Play football.

with heart and senses than with mere thermometers. When we found
our fall touch, Celestine and I would launch into planning our
gardens, talking about what peach trees we were going to plant,
dwarf or full size...Even in later years, when she did not say it
or write it, I still thought it. And thought about her, her
ever-renewing spirit, quest for life's rich and varied offerings,
her exquisite love for words. Ohhh, the words.(May, Atlanta

 &HT;    Managing money for 2 is just like for 1, but more involved
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Couples face the same problems as single people when they start
trying to organize their financial lives. But the process is a lot
more complicated _ and often more emotional _ when two people have
to agree on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us don't know our own philosophy of spending, goals
and saving when we hook up,'' observed certified financial planner
Elizabeth Jetton. ``Much less do we have the ability to understand
our partner's.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how common the conflicts are: In a recent survey, 29
percent of couples said they frequently disagree about spending and
saving. Only 9 percent said they argue about their romantic or sex
lives.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be a surprise. A lot of young people haven't
given much thought to financial affairs. ``Most of what we believe
about money we've gathered unconsciously,'' said Jetton. ``We
learned early from experience, as opposed to learning by being
taught.''
</P>
<P>
   We got a lot of conflicting messages, too. Parents told us to be
careful with our money. Friends told us to have a good time now.
The media, including the advertising industry, told us to spend,
spend, spend.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, money is a natural thing to fight about. One reason
is all-but-inevitable personality conflicts. Some people are driven
to focus on financial security; others are motivated by immediate
gratification, or self-esteem, or power. A second reason is that
there's never enough money for everything.
</P>
<P>
   But couples can get their financial act together. Most of them
do, more or less. It takes communication and a willingness to
learn, Jetton believes. It also requires each partner to be
flexible and committed to the process.
</P>
<P>
   Jetton, a planner with Financial Vision Advisors, offers these
tips:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Avoid extremes. You're asking for trouble if you keep all your
accounts and spending decisions separate or if you merge everything
and let one partner make all the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Work out a common vision. ``Everyone struggles with balancing
the wants and demands of today with goals, dreams and needs for the
future,'' Jetton said. ``Financial planning deals with trying to
create that balance, through skills, new tools and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   A warning: You'll have problems if you don't make room for each
partner's goals and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Set aside some happy money for each partner. ``Everyone needs
some money they can spend without being accountable to their
spouse,'' she said. ``This reduces arguments over the trivial, so
you can stay focused on the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't shoot the messenger. ``Whoever is assigned the money
tasks has the unfortunate job of relating the state of affairs to
the other spouse,'' Jetton explained. But the responsibilities of
money management must be shared. ``Until we accept that fact, we
continue to blame others and shape ourselves, which allows us to
stay unaccountable and unfulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't dawdle. ``The truth is that there is never a convenient
time to save,'' Jetton said. ``Our expenses can and will expand to
fit or exceed our paychecks.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't sabotage yourself.
</P>
<P>
   You can do that with credit cards or by rolling along without an
emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses.
</P>
<P>
   You can do it by lack of communication, which means you have no
shared goals, or by succumbing to the blame-and-shame game.
</P>
<P>
   Jetton cites one other common pitfall: believing that more money
is the answer and that money will solve your problems.

   &UR; BOOK EXCERPT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MONEY TALKS: INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. This is the third and final
excerpt from the book ``Money Talks'' by Juliette Fairley (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons Inc.). Fairley, a personal finance writer, has
interviewed prominent black leaders in such areas as banking,
financial planning and investment. In this excerpt, John Rogers,
president of Ariel Capital Management, offers tips on how to grow
your personal portfolio.

   NEW `DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' GUIDELINES: TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.
``To say that the `don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue' policy on
gays in the military is not working is an understatement,'' writes
columnist Chuck Colbert, himself a former naval officer. Colbert
cites the recent murder of Pfc. Barry L. Winchell, a 21-year-old
gay soldier at a Naval base in Fort Campbell, Ky., who was
bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat. What is the president and
defense secretary doing about such abuses to the policy? Colbert
argues that their recently issued policy directives won't end to
the military's anti-gay culture of hostility.
</P>
<P>
   LATINOS UPSET BY PROPOSITION 187 MEDIATION. It was it watershed
issue in California politics, impelling record numbers of Latinos
to register to vote. It also has strained United States-Mexican
relations for five years. But Proposition 187, which sought to deny
public education and health services to undocumented families, is
not dead yet. Gov. Gray Davis of California, who once vilified the
measure, has changed his tune, reports Victor Mejia in this excerpt
from Hispanic magazine. In April, Davis asked a federal appellate
court to mediate the measure and find a solution that will appease
both the opponents and supporters of the 1994 ballot initiative. In
this commentary, Mejia offers all sides in the debate over
Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   A DOUBLE STANDARD ON DRUGS. ``This is a tale of the two ways the
Gainesville (Fla.) Police Department enforces narcotics violations.
Or, at the very least, it is a tale about the perception of dual
enforcement _ one for the city's black residents, the other for
whites,'' writes columnist Bill Maxwell. During a recent Police
Community Committee meeting, angry black residents told members
that they are sick and tired of cops' harassment and physical
abuse. Several young men described being stopped, searched and
detained for no legitimate reasons _ other than ``standing still
while black.'' Why not case the nearby rave clubs _ filled with
mostly white kids? And what would they find? Ecstasy, ketamine,
GHB, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, LSD ... and the
list goes on. ``And what is happening here in Florida's leading
college town happens throughout the nation,'' Maxwell writes.
</P>
<P>
   JUST A LITTLE RED DOT. Long before bindis _ once the traditional
mark of married Hindu women _ began to dot the faces of Hollywood,
a school teacher used them to educate children about culture. Five
years ago, Mitra Sen, a fifth-grade school teacher in Scarborough,
Canada, began to notice how the girls in her class who were wearing
bindis on their foreheads were teased and taunted by their
classmates. She saw this as a learning opportunity, and came up
with a plan to have her students ``educate'' their schoolmates
about other people's cultures. Inspired by her success, she wrote,
directed and produced ``Just a Little Red Dot,'' an award-wining
documentary about her experiences with her class. Writer Sandip
Roy-Chowdhury talks to the Sen and some of her students in this
feature from A. Magazine.

</P>
<P>
   MONEY TALKS: INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. This is the third and final
excerpt from the book ``Money Talks'' by Juliette Fairley (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons Inc.). Fairley, a personal finance writer, has
interviewed prominent black leaders in such areas as banking,
financial planning and investment. In this excerpt, John Rogers,

   NEW `DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' GUIDELINES: TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.
``To say that the `don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue' policy on
gays in the military is not working is an understatement,'' writes
columnist Chuck Colbert, himself a former naval officer. Colbert
cites the recent murder of Pfc. Barry L. Winchell, a 21-year-old
gay soldier at a Naval base in Fort Campbell, Ky., who was
bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat. What is the president and
defense secretary doing about such abuses to the policy? Colbert
argues that their recently issued policy directives won't end to
the military's anti-gay culture of hostility.

   LATINOS UPSET BY PROPOSITION 187 MEDIATION. It was it watershed
issue in California politics, impelling record numbers of Latinos
to register to vote. It also has strained United States-Mexican
relations for five years. But Proposition 187, which sought to deny
public education and health services to undocumented families, is
not dead yet. Gov. Gray Davis of California, who once vilified the
measure, has changed his tune, reports Victor Mejia in this excerpt
from Hispanic magazine. In April, Davis asked a federal appellate
court to mediate the measure and find a solution that will appease
both the opponents and supporters of the 1994 ballot initiative. In
this commentary, Mejia offers all sides in the debate over
Proposition 187.

   A DOUBLE STANDARD ON DRUGS. ``This is a tale of the two ways the
Gainesville (Fla.) Police Department enforces narcotics violations.
Or, at the very least, it is a tale about the perception of dual
enforcement _ one for the city's black residents, the other for
whites,'' writes columnist Bill Maxwell. During a recent Police
Community Committee meeting, angry black residents told members
that they are sick and tired of cops' harassment and physical
abuse. Several young men described being stopped, searched and
detained for no legitimate reasons _ other than ``standing still
while black.'' Why not case the nearby rave clubs _ filled with
mostly white kids? And what would they find? Ecstasy, ketamine,
GHB, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, LSD ... and the
list goes on. ``And what is happening here in Florida's leading
college town happens throughout the nation,'' Maxwell writes.

<P>
   JUST A LITTLE RED DOT. Long before bindis _ once the traditional
mark of married Hindu women _ began to dot the faces of Hollywood,
a school teacher used them to educate children about culture. Five
years ago, Mitra Sen, a fifth-grade school teacher in Scarborough,
Canada, began to notice how the girls in her class who were wearing
bindis on their foreheads were teased and taunted by their
classmates. She saw this as a learning opportunity, and came up
with a plan to have her students ``educate'' their schoolmates
about other people's cultures. Inspired by her success, she wrote,
directed and produced ``Just a Little Red Dot,'' an award-wining
documentary about her experiences with her class. Writer Sandip
Roy-Chowdhury talks to the Sen and some of her students in this
feature from A. Magazine.

CELEBRATE THE GIFTS THE WILDERNESS ACT HAS GIVEN US 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   The
Wilderness Act turns 35 years old on Sept. 3. Secretary of the
Interior Bruce Babbitt calls it ``one of the most important
environmental laws of the past half-century.'' Anyone who loves the
outdoors, wildlife and pristine wilderness must agree.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Wilderness Act created the National Wilderness Preservation
System.
</P>
<P>
   More than 104 million acres of federal public lands have been
classified as wilderness areas under the act, so far. Congress must
approve the designation of any federal land as a wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   The act required the secretary of the interior and the secretary
of agriculture to review, within 10 years of the passage of the
act, every roadless area of 5,000 acres or more in the federal
lands system to determine the suitability of such areas for a
designation and preservation as wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness is defined by the act as ``an area where the earth
and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself
is a visitor who does not remain.'' It is further defined as ``an
area of underdeveloped federal land retaining its primeval
character and influence, without permanent improvements or human
habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its
natural conditions,'' and that ``appears to have been affected
primarily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of man's work
substantially unnoticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Babbitt explained the act further: ``The
fundamental premise of the Wilderness Act is that the process of
building roads is a death sentence for an ecosystem. There are all
kinds of scientific studies which show that roads fragment habitat
in a way that leads to the disintegration of the ecosystem. The
grizzly bear is a great example. The grizzly cannot tolerate a
fragmented habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt continued: ``The results of the act in terms of
wilderness speak for themselves. We have fabulous, fabulous lands
which are now protected in perpetuity for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been very little action to approve wilderness areas in
the last two sessions of Congress. And Babbitt expressed his
chagrin at the politics that has held up wilderness designations:
``Too much of the time, it has become an ideological flash point,
rather than an opportunity to work together. We've made almost no
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal agencies that manage public lands _ the National
Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service _ each manage whatever
lands in their jurisdiction that have been included in the National
Wilderness Preservation System.
</P>
<P>
   The BLM was not authorized to designate wilderness areas by the
Wilderness Act. It had to wait until the Federal Land Policy
Management Act was passed in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   FLPMA required the BLM to identify wilderness areas. At present,
the BLM manages 622 wilderness study areas (17 million acres) and
only 136 designated wilderness areas (5.3 million acres). Study
areas await congressional action to become wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four federal land agencies, the BLM manages the fewest
wilderness areas. Over a third of the USFWS public lands are now
wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming has no wilderfess areas managed by the BLM. The state
has 42 wilderness study areas comprising less than 600,000 acres
out of the 18 million acres managed by the BLM in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The wilderness areas managed by the National Park Service and
the USFWS are subject to greater restrictions than those managed by
the Forest Service or the BLM. But the Wilderness Act mandates that
all these lands ``shall be administered for the use and enjoyment
of the American people in such a manner as will leave them
unimpaired for future use and enjoyment as wilderness, and so as to
provide for the protection of these areas, the preservation of
their wilderness character, and for the gathering and dissemination
of information regarding their use and enjoyment as wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   In wilderness areas managed by the BLM, one may hunt and fish,
hike, ski, snowshoe, ride horses, take river trips and camp. In
general, no motorized vehicles are allowed in wilderness areas.
That means no off-road vehicles, no snowmobiles and no skidoos.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot hunt in a national park; therefore, hunting is
prohibited in wilderness areas managed by the National Park
Service. The same restriction applies to wilderness areas managed
by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   One may hunt on Forest Service lands; therefore, one may hunt in
wilderness areas managed by the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the restrictions applied to public use of wilderness
areas are consistent with the restrictions that the managing agency
applies to federal lands under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness areas are the most protected landscapes in the
federal system. And they are large enough areas to be refuges for
plants and animals. They allow ecological forces to work unimpeded
and allow the natural fluctuation of animal and plant populations.
</P>
<P>
   Clean water in New Mexico, in large measure, comes from
wilderness areas. Clean air in Arizona is protected by that state's
wilderness areas. Clean water for Denver and Seattle, again, thank
the wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness preserved is a gift to each and all of us. Even a
brief visit to a wilderness area can wash away the burdens and
pressures of modern life. Wilderness areas not only protect the
values inside them _ the land, wildlife, air and water -- they also
preserve our connection to all living things and our connection to
the deepest part of ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Wilderness Act, write
your congressional delegation and tell them we need more wilderness
areas and less political partisanship.

   RADIO-TRANSMISSION (San Francisco) _ On a fateful day in August
1899, a three-word message in Morse code printed the first message

   MEDICAL-EXAMINER (San Francisco) _ There are approximately 2,100
police officers and 1,600 firefighters in San Francisco. Serving
the same population are Graham Cowley and 12 other investigators in
the San Francisco medical examiner's office. The portion of their
job the public sees, retrieving the dead, is actually the easy
part. By PETER HARTLAUB.
</P>

   DIXIE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Dixie Chicks are easily the
freshest act to emerge in country music in the last two years. The
group's bluegrass-inflected sound _ born and bred on the Texas club

contemporary country audiences. By RICK MITCHELL.

   CAREERS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ A lot of employers still don't
appreciate how much skill is involved in any job _ if it is done

   FBN-49ERS-STOKES (Santa Clara, Calif.) _ J.J. Stokes of the San
Francisco 49ers hadn't matured into the mesmerizing talent so many
people expected him to be at the end of last season. This season
could offer him a break, a shot at acceptance, something he has
never had with the 49ers. For Stokes, that could be comparable to
paradise. By JEFFRI CHADIHA.

   FBN-RAIDERS-BIEKERT (Alameda, Calif.) _ Greg Biekert is a

the job description. But when he is on the field, Biekert is all
business. By FRANK BLACKMAN.

   The extreme lifestyle, which was once strictly subculture, is
now translating into mainstream acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic growth in the youth participation of inline skating,
snowboarding, roller hockey and off-road mountain biking has made
the X-sports the fastest-growing youth sports of the 1990s,
according to data in the 1998 Sports Participation studies produced
by the National Sporting Goods Association (NSGA).
</P>
<P>
   Further, ``extreme sports have crossed over to MTV, ESPN and NBC
with the upcoming Gravity Games,'' said Scott Kelliher, director of
marketing at Blades, Board &AMP; Skate, a 21-unit extreme sport chain
operation.
</P>
<P>
   And as these sports have garnered more interest, fashion
companies have followed the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the styles of the sports are exposed to more people, more
people want to get on to those looks,'' adds Kelliher. ``The sports
themselves are appealing, daring, new and cutting-edge. The fashion
around them go along the same line. These sports say `I'm cool' and
the fashions have the same image associated to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is taking bits and pieces from particular sports
styles and interpreting that into their mainstream look,'' said
Neil Mossberg, men's merchandiser for www.hipO.com, an e-commerce
site for fashion-forward youth. ``For example, motocross jerseys,
logo T's and even lengths of shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mossberg, the recreational customer ``tries to keep
up on brands and pull off that extreme sports look.'' He added that
they will mix extreme style into their everyday looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``An example of that would be rap artists wearing motocross
jerseys on award shows, which later filters down to the street
level,'' he said. ``For spring 2000, the market can expect to see
the growth of technical fabrics and the emergence of smaller
extreme sports labels reaching a much larger audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Daniel, vice-president of trend merchandising and product
development of Hayward-based Mervyn's California, said extreme
sports have become a big part of Gen Y's lifestyle and it's had a
profound impact on its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen the influence growing but it's been a factor for
the past 18 months,'' he said. ``It's impacted pretty much every
young men's and boys' category, to some degree. The biggest
influences are skateboarding, BMX biking, all of the sports on
wheels. We also include surfing. We've increased our surf-related
products like board shorts. The last time I saw this was in the
'70s when I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mervyn's, brands are secondary to the look. This year within
its back-to-school mix, 35 percent of its assortment has roots in
extreme sports, especially in the skating and BMX biking
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our assortment is inspired and not authentic,'' he
said. ``But staying close to extreme sports is the key to
understanding young men. Longer shorts, which are skate, are a
fast-emerging category and essentially led to the whole length
story, from below the knee to four inches above the ankles. Surf
bottoms have been huge and we think they'll be huge through
back-to-school. In tops, it's mostly a knit story in raglan
sleeves, which has been driven by what's going on in skate as well
as a resurgence of graphics.''
</P>
<P>
   A variety of sportswear brands including 33 Degrees, Lugz, Boss
by I.G. Design and Brittania are taking notice of the popularity of
extreme sports. ``Many manufacturers have finally realized that
there is a whole other consumer lifestyle that, when targeted, will
gravitate toward your product,'' said Maria Roberson, merchandiser
for the Boss by I.G. Design brand. ``When we began to design
(spring), we wanted to take a portion of the line and categorize it
into sports-related apparel. Out of that `NEX' (New Era Extreme)
was born. We target all sports, including extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   While Boss by I.G. Design is not particularly targeting a
specific sport for spring 2000, it is looking to address comfort
and function. Its designs reflect a mix of authentic and inspired
extreme looks in synthetic meshes, cotton rip-stop and nylon
rip-stop fabrications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we've reduced has been the leg length in our
cargo pants,'' said Ray Marquez, vice-president of marketing at 33
Degrees, a three-year-old sportswear company. ``That comes from
bikers and allows baggy pants to not get caught in their spokes.
Our bottoms have three different options _ one with a pull cord,
the other at calf length and we have knee lengths as well.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Marquez, fashion companies are giving importance to
extreme sports because the athletes have become somewhat of role
models for the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being that these athletes are similar to the actual kids
themselves, there's identification through that and their successes
are examples,'' he said. ``The kids that are doing these extreme
sports on a professional basis had set the trends for how they
wanted the gear designed athletically and from a fashion aspect _
baggy pants, big T-shirts and ID work shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, when snowboarding was so big, we, as a lot of
others, found it represented major portions of our line,'' said
Stuart Ullman, vice-president of Lugz apparel. ``For the immediate
future, we're looking at what we call wheeled racing _ which is
apparel inspired by BMX, motocross and even auto racing. The
influence from racing sports could be as simple as graphic
inspiration on a T-shirt or as advanced as nylon and leather
motocross racing jackets.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittania sees some inspirations of extreme sports in its
designs. It currently is involved in sponsorship of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a Team Brittania that consists of athletes that
perform at the X Games in San Francisco,'' said Frans van Zeeland,
director of marketing at Brittania, a division of VF Jeanswear.
``We've been sponsoring bike, in-line and skate athletes for the
past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Extreme sports have become so popular because kids want to be
individuals,'' said Travis Blasingame, director of apparel for
Vans. ``Tony Hawk did a 900 rotation at the X Games and the kids
see the amount of risk involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Blasingame agrees that the demand for the look is on
the rise, he said too many apparel companies are caught up in the
``tech world'' aspect of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't need to be technical as much as it has to be
functional,'' he said. ``The fit and styling are important. It's
got to be cool, but what if you could add zip vents for better
ventilation or side adjustments on the waistband. The consumer is
better educated and knows the difference between a five-ounce and
nine-ounce twill. They want perceived value.''

marketing at Blades, Board &AMP; Skate, a 21-unit extreme sport chain
operation.
</P>
<P>
   And as these sports have garnered more interest, fashion
companies have followed the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the styles of the sports are exposed to more people, more
people want to get on to those looks,'' adds Kelliher. ``The sports
themselves are appealing, daring, new and cutting-edge. The fashion
around them go along the same line. These sports say `I'm cool' and
the fashions have the same image associated to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is taking bits and pieces from particular sports
styles and interpreting that into their mainstream look,'' said
Neil Mossberg, men's merchandiser for www.hipO.com, an e-commerce
site for fashion-forward youth. ``For example, motocross jerseys,
logo T's and even lengths of shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mossberg, the recreational customer ``tries to keep
up on brands and pull off that extreme sports look.'' He added that
they will mix extreme style into their everyday looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``An example of that would be rap artists wearing motocross
jerseys on award shows, which later filters down to the street
level,'' he said. ``For spring 2000, the market can expect to see
the growth of technical fabrics and the emergence of smaller
extreme sports labels reaching a much larger audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Daniel, vice-president of trend merchandising and product
development of Hayward-based Mervyn's California, said extreme
sports have become a big part of Gen Y's lifestyle and it's had a
profound impact on its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen the influence growing but it's been a factor for
the past 18 months,'' he said. ``It's impacted pretty much every
young men's and boys' category, to some degree. The biggest
influences are skateboarding, BMX biking, all of the sports on
wheels. We also include surfing. We've increased our surf-related
products like board shorts. The last time I saw this was in the
'70s when I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mervyn's, brands are secondary to the look. This year within
its back-to-school mix, 35 percent of its assortment has roots in
extreme sports, especially in the skating and BMX biking
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our assortment is inspired and not authentic,'' he
said. ``But staying close to extreme sports is the key to
understanding young men. Longer shorts, which are skate, are a
fast-emerging category and essentially led to the whole length
story, from below the knee to four inches above the ankles. Surf
bottoms have been huge and we think they'll be huge through
back-to-school. In tops, it's mostly a knit story in raglan
sleeves, which has been driven by what's going on in skate as well
as a resurgence of graphics.''
</P>
<P>
   A variety of sportswear brands including 33 Degrees, Lugz, Boss
by I.G. Design and Brittania are taking notice of the popularity of
extreme sports. ``Many manufacturers have finally realized that
there is a whole other consumer lifestyle that, when targeted, will
gravitate toward your product,'' said Maria Roberson, merchandiser
for the Boss by I.G. Design brand. ``When we began to design
(spring), we wanted to take a portion of the line and categorize it
into sports-related apparel. Out of that `NEX' (New Era Extreme)
was born. We target all sports, including extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   While Boss by I.G. Design is not particularly targeting a
specific sport for spring 2000, it is looking to address comfort
and function. Its designs reflect a mix of authentic and inspired
extreme looks in synthetic meshes, cotton rip-stop and nylon
rip-stop fabrications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we've reduced has been the leg length in our
cargo pants,'' said Ray Marquez, vice-president of marketing at 33
Degrees, a three-year-old sportswear company. ``That comes from
bikers and allows baggy pants to not get caught in their spokes.
Our bottoms have three different options _ one with a pull cord,
the other at calf length and we have knee lengths as well.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Marquez, fashion companies are giving importance to
extreme sports because the athletes have become somewhat of role
models for the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being that these athletes are similar to the actual kids
themselves, there's identification through that and their successes
are examples,'' he said. ``The kids that are doing these extreme
sports on a professional basis had set the trends for how they
wanted the gear designed athletically and from a fashion aspect _
baggy pants, big T-shirts and ID work shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, when snowboarding was so big, we, as a lot of
others, found it represented major portions of our line,'' said
Stuart Ullman, vice-president of Lugz apparel. ``For the immediate
future, we're looking at what we call wheeled racing _ which is
apparel inspired by BMX, motocross and even auto racing. The
influence from racing sports could be as simple as graphic
inspiration on a T-shirt or as advanced as nylon and leather
motocross racing jackets.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittania sees some inspirations of extreme sports in its
designs. It currently is involved in sponsorship of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a Team Brittania that consists of athletes that
perform at the X Games in San Francisco,'' said Frans van Zeeland,
director of marketing at Brittania, a division of VF Jeanswear.
``We've been sponsoring bike, in-line and skate athletes for the
past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Extreme sports have become so popular because kids want to be
individuals,'' said Travis Blasingame, director of apparel for
Vans. ``Tony Hawk did a 900 rotation at the X Games and the kids
see the amount of risk involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Blasingame agrees that the demand for the look is on
the rise, he said too many apparel companies are caught up in the
``tech world'' aspect of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't need to be technical as much as it has to be
functional,'' he said. ``The fit and styling are important. It's
got to be cool, but what if you could add zip vents for better
ventilation or side adjustments on the waistband. The consumer is
better educated and knows the difference between a five-ounce and
nine-ounce twill. They want perceived value.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They're too young to rent a car. In some cases,
they're too young to buy a drink. But these kids have good reason
to feel like grown-ups in the literary world. That is, if you call
a six-figure book contract a good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the writers of Generation Y.
</P>
<P>
   Gen-Xers' younger brothers and sisters, who have already
infiltrated Hollywood and the music industry, are now being courted
by book publishers in search of marketable young literary talents.
And when the publishing execs come calling, they don't skimp on the
red-carpet treatment usually reserved for more seasoned celebrity
authors.
</P>
<P>
   Multibook deals, major publicity campaigns and movie-rights
negotiations are all part of the package. (First-time novelists
more typically get between $5,000 to $10,000 per book).
</P>
<P>
   Granted, at least two of these well-hyped literary lion cubs
were born to literary families. Erica Jong's 20-year-old daughter,
Molly Jong-Fast, is completing a novel called ``Girl,'' to be
published by Villard next May, and Anne Rice's son Christopher, 21,
is putting the finishing touches on his ``A Density of Souls,'' to
be released next spring as part of a two-book deal by Miramax's
Talk Books.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the young writers come with no such pedigrees.
</P>
<P>
   The ``it'' boy of the international junior literati right now is
Londoner Richard Mason, a 21-year-old Eton grad and Oxford student
whose novel ``The Drowning People'' caused a fierce bidding war in
the States. Time Warner finally snatched it up in a two-book deal
for $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, published in May, was backed by an advertising
campaign that cost several hundred thousand dollars, including a
15-second television spot aired last month in New York and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign rights were sold in 21 countries, and Mason's agent is
negotiating a film deal in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, with his Hugh Grant looks, has also won high marks for
his fashion style _ he wears custom-made suits from London clothier
Favourbrooke for ``glam occasions'' and slips into a pair of Ralph
Lauren linen trousers for casual book readings.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two-year-old Australia native Suneeta Peres da Costa
wrote a novel called ``Homework'' that is the lead fiction title
for Bloomsbury USA's fall list.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jenn Crowell, then 19, reportedly struck a
two-book deal with G.P. Putnum that was worth $800,000, including
TV and foreign rights. Her first novel, ``Necessary Madness,'' was
published in 15 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in young talent is nothing new. But in the past, only a
few writers have managed to hit it big _ and also win critical
respect _ while still in their early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   John Cheever was 23, Bret Easton Ellis 21 and Joyce Maynard 20
when they published their first works. Today, things may be
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been young writers, but I'm seeing that they
are definitely finding their groove earlier,'' said John Burnham,
president of Miramax's Talk Magazine Books, which plans to put a
lot of muscle into promoting Rice, a babyfaced Billy Idol.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation, according to its promoters, is far different
from former literary brat packers like Bret Easton Ellis, Jay
McInerney and Tama Janowitz, who chronicled the freewheeling '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are definitely taking on greater themes,'' Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's book, for example, is told from the perspective of a
70-year-old who just murdered his wife, while Crowell's is about a
woman whose husband dies of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   But while the material is definitely mature, the inspiration
behind it may not be. Jong-Fast, for instance, turns to Nintendo's
``Gameboy'' to get her creative juices flowing. Rice likes jumping
up and down on his mini trampoline at his parents' house in New
Orleans' Garden District, where his first novel takes place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing it in my bedroom, but the plaster started falling
down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The five are also finding their own voices in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started writing because I wanted to feel like a grown-up,''
said Jong-Fast. ``In my family, you couldn't sit at the kitchen
table unless you were a writer.''''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jong-Fast said she's overwhelmed by her success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I would go on to a lackluster existence,''
she said. ``I saw myself just living on the Upper East Side,
wasting away and shopping at Eileen Fisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she got six figures, including a two-book deal in
England with Hodder &AMP; Stoughton.
</P>
<P>
   Jong-Fast has already written a few magazine articles about her
battle with an eating disorder and she sees herself as mentor for
the ``lost 17-year-old.'' Her novel, ``Girl,'' is about the social
pressures facing a 19-year-old New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a place where everyone was perfect all the
time,'' said Jong-Fast, who went to the Riverdale Country School
and grew up in a townhouse on the Upper East Side. ``If you were
fat, or if you had bad hair or if you had last season's coat, the
question was: `What was going to happen to you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, whose novel examines how a group of high school friends
reacts to one character's emerging homosexuality, hopes to become
part of a pack of young literary gay writers who appeal to a
mainstream audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay fiction is a little too insular,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   His next book will be set on a Northeastern college campus,
inspired by his two semesters at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he's been able to strike a ``perfect balance''
between his mom's ``lush prose'' and the ``succinct style'' of his
dad, poet Stan Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom is into the supernatural,'' Rice said. ``My novel is
more seedy, more morally corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rice, Mason said he doesn't want to be identified with a
particular genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each work is my own enterprise,'' said the writer, who is
getting ready to promote his first novel in Norway, Sweden and
possibly Japan, before heading back to Oxford in October.
</P>
<P>
   Mason admitted that he's a bit nervous about returning to
school. In addition to his courses, he'll be finishing his second
novel, which is about Oxford students ``who play terrible mind
games.''
</P>
<P>
   For Crowell, who's also completing her second book, tailoring
feminism to a younger generation is the chief concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminism is not speaking to young women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Crowell will enter a graduate program in women's
studies at Towson University in Towson, Md. At the moment, she's
working on her second novel, about a 25-year-old woman who burns
out while getting her doctorate and then travels to Iceland to find
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Peres da Costa, whose novel was inspired by the
isolation she felt when her father moved to India, said she wants
to fill what she sees as ``a void in passion for the written
word.''
</P>
<P>
   She was savvy enough to pursue a first publishing contract in
the States _ she didn't want to be pegged as a local Australian
author.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Peres da Costa, who just moved here to start a
Fulbright-financed program in creative writing at Sarah Lawrence
College in Westchester County, admitted she is ndive at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my editor if she would write a permission slip so that
I could miss a couple of days from school,'' she said. ``She
thought it was so cute. She e-mailed all of her friends in the
office.'' &QL;

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ J.J. Stokes claimed there was no
significance to his disappearance shortly after last season. After
all, he leaves the country every off season. A trip to Brazil was
another simple weeklong getaway.
</P>
<P>
   But as Stokes vanished into the cosmic paradise that is Rio de
Janeiro, soaking in the sunshine and street celebrations, at some
point he had to wonder about his future. Stokes was entering free
agency, a period when professional football players discover what
they're worth, and he understood he might never play for the San
Francisco 49ers again.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes hadn't matured into the mesmerizing talent so many people
expected him to be, and the team faced a salary cap burden that
would make even Donald Trump sweat. What else was there to know?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know where my career would begin again,''
Stokes said. ``Wherever it was, I just wanted to go and see what I
could do, get out there and get a chance to play. I was thinking
about getting a new start.''
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing was, while Stokes was looking for something new,
few teams were interested in offering him that. He wound up back
with the 49ers, with a five-year, $16.9 million contract and the
understanding this is where he likely will finish his career. Which
brings up the important question: What kind of career will it be?
</P>
<P>
   Stokes has been swimming upstream since he entered the National
Football League as the 49ers' top pick in the 1995 draft. They,
along with the rest of the football world, tagged him as the
successor to wide receiver Jerry Rice. But that label has since
been snatched away by rising star Terrell Owens, leaving Stokes
with his first opportunity to play under a different microscope.
</P>
<P>
   After four years of disappointing people because of who he
wasn't, Stokes might finally be assessed for who he is. Said Stokes
of the Rice label: ``That's always been a way for other people to
measure me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like there has always been a lot of pressure on him
because everybody felt like he was going to be the next Jerry Rice
and he didn't want to be that,'' Rice said. ``He just wanted to be
J.J. Stokes. Now he's J.J. Stokes. He's making plays, he's happy
and he's only going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stokes works out, people notice. You see the massive hands,
the 6-foot-4-inch, 217-pound frame warding off defenders for passes
like a power forward handling weaker souls in the paint. You think
what most have probably always thought about Stokes _ this guy
could be something special. It is both compliment and curse.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes' career began with problems. Teammates questioned his
work habits. A wrist injury and a broken hand limited him to 56
receptions during his first two years in the league. But then he
flashed his potential as a starting receiver in 1997 and followed
that campaign with 63 receptions last year, eight for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key with J.J.'s success really is that he's stayed
healthy,'' said coach Steve Mariucci of the 49ers. ``There was
always a reason, setback, something to explain why he didn't
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there always have been flaws. Stokes dropped a potential
touchdown pass in a regular-season loss to the Green Bay Packers,
then exploded at a interviewer afterward. He didn't have Owens'
flare for the ``SportsCenter'' highlight moment. The ups and downs
add up to a career he hadn't expected when he came into the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't anticipate any injuries,'' Stokes said. ``I
got off to a slow start with that. But I thought I would have a
Super Bowl ring by now, a Pro Bowl nomination. I felt like I
would've done it all by now if you had asked me back then.''
</P>
<P>
   That desire to do it all made Stokes believe that leaving was
worth his while. The three-receiver system employed by the 49ers
was highly productive, but if Stokes wanted to be an 80-catch,
1,000-yard receiver, he would have no better chance to find a place
where that could happen than this past offseason.
</P>
<P>
   But come February, Stokes was humbled. The Pittsburgh Steelers
invited him for a visit and did little else. The Carolina Panthers
offered a decent deal. After that, Stokes' phone was ringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both teams were playing waiting games,'' Stokes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell they were heavily into their football, but they
sat around. My agent came back and said here's the situation at
both spots. I just made my decision from there. They were good
offers. It just wasn't worth me leaving after that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He could've gone elsewhere, but he will be productive here
because he has Steve Young, Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens around
him,'' said Larry Kirksey, the receivers coach for the 49ers. ``If
he went somewhere else he could get double-teamed and not get the
opportunities he'll get here. He knows that in this offense, he'll
get his chances.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the 49ers saved Stokes. He could have been the next
Alvin Harper for all anybody knows. This season could offer him a
break, a shot at acceptance, something he has never had with the
49ers. For Stokes, that could be comparable to paradise.

RAIDERS' LINEBACKER IS ALL BUSINESS ON THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ Greg Biekert is a linebacker for the Oakland
Raiders. That's a big responsibility. It's almost expected that
Raiders linebackers will be either slightly wacky or totally
unhinged. Craziness used to be part of the job description.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is that tradition and that history,'' Biekert said.
``I've just never been a flashy guy, a guy who likes to celebrate
after plays. I want to just take a business-type approach on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse. Biekert plays middle linebacker. This is _ or
once was _ the glamour position on defense. Many of the men who
played it became famous. Dick Butkus. Sam Huff. Mike Singletary.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Biekert?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the linebacker for the Oakland Raiders. If the only people
who know I'm doing well are the guys on this team, then that's fine
with me. I could care less about any national recognition,''
Biekert said.
</P>
<P>
   In one way at least, Biekert is a throwback to an earlier,
tougher, era in this sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's the only middle linebacker in all of football
who stayed on the field for every single defensive play (last
season),'' coach Jon Gruden said. ``He's a complete football player
and a great leader. He's the heart and soul of our defensive
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Some guys allow this job to become their life. They walk the
middle linebacker walk and talk the middle linebacker talk.
</P>
<P>
   Biekert has made an effort to separate his job from the rest of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to be a middle linebacker when you're not on
the field,'' he said. ``And that's kinda the way I am. I'm not real
outspoken and talkative. You'd be in jail in five minutes if you
took an on-field attitude off the field. You have to, as best you
can, separate the two.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once Biekert suits up, he is a ferocious competitor. It is not
wise to irritate him.
</P>
<P>
   Biekert was a seventh-round draft choice out of Colorado in
1993. He spent his rookie season as a reserve linebacker and
special teams player.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he became the Raiders' starting middle
linebacker. And in practice one day, he was in a grumpy mood. The
team had lost its previous game, and Biekert is not a gracious
loser.
</P>
<P>
   So this was not a good time to annoy him. Only no one warned
defensive end Scott Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The former No. 1 pick decided to mess with Biekert. The
linebacker told his teammate to stop. Davis persisted. Biekert told
him again. But the warnings went unheeded. So the linebacker lost
his patience. He whirled and knocked out Davis with one punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got that side,'' Biekert said, laughing. ``I don't
like to lose. I don't like really annoying things. They tend to get
on my nerves fairly quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated at being cold-cocked by a guy about 50 pounds
lighter, Davis left the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back three weeks later,'' Biekert said. ``But he spent
the majority of the year not playing. Then he stopped after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders had to be just a tiny bit irritated, too. They'd
invested a lot of money in Davis, and Biekert had literally knocked
him out of the game. Since Biekert had not yet established himself
as an irreplaceable part of the team's defense, losing his temper
could have cost him big time. He admits he was concerned about his
job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my second year, and I really didn't know what was
going to happen,'' he said. ``But I think it gained a little
respect for me from the other players, knowing that here's someone
who's not going to take anything from other guys. And that's what I
try to do on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   And his approach works. He was the Raiders' leading tackler in
1994 and has led them in that category twice since, including last
season when he finished with a career-high 146 tackles.

FOND MEMORIES ARE GOOD FOR BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The person I've thought about most in recent
days is somebody I met only once, six years ago, a nameless but
certainly not faceless shoeshine boy who never shined my shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has a name, of course, but I don't know it. Getting your
shoes shined doesn't qualify as a deep personal relationship,
especially when the person doing the shining never exactly does any
shining. But the mental picture of Shoeshine Boy keeps popping up
because we met in Turkey, a place struggling to recover from the
devastation of an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Simple mathematics tells me that he is likely among the tens of
millions who survived rather than the tens of thousands who died,
but I'll never know. The only thing I really do know is that he is
at least as immortal as my memory.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Cathy, and I were about to enter the Grand Bazaar in
Istanbul when we were approached by Shoeshine Boy, who couldn't
have been more than 8 or 9, looking every bit the young
entrepreneur. As we wandered along the bazaar's outer shops, he
asked me again and again and again if I wanted a shine, and I told
him again and again and again: ``No!'' I thought I had a good
excuse: I was wearing tennis shoes at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As he kept coming back, my ``no'' kept losing its exclamation
points. Besides, Cathy is an elementary-school teacher, and
Shoeshine Boy was too much like one of those kids you just can't
stay mad at. Unlike the shopkeepers, his charm made up for his
pushiness.
</P>
<P>
   We still remember Turkish places like the Blue Mosque and
Topkapi and Ephesus. Those were only sites we saw in Turkey;
Shoeshine Boy WAS Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Once when we were in Paris, someone at our hotel put one of our
suitcases in the wrong taxi. The bag was headed to the airport and
so were we, but it had a 15-minute head start.
</P>
<P>
   As our driver tracked down the bag, another driver _ whose cab
had the errant suitcase _ waited at the airport for a good 15
minutes to help us explain to the airlines what had happened so we
could retrieve the bag. So much for rude Parisians.
</P>
<P>
   We went to a restaurant in the San Francisco area once and the
waiter suggested we try its signature dessert, saying he wouldn't
charge us if we didn't like it. We did. We have returned many
times, often having the dessert.
</P>
<P>
   A friend went to a coffeehouse, then realized that the change he
had in his pocket wasn't enough to pay for his drink. The barista
reached into the tip jar and grabbed enough change to make up the
difference. My friend is now a regular there, and a good tipper.
</P>
<P>
   None of these stories is exactly shocking, yet a lot of
employers still don't appreciate how much skill is involved in any
job _ if it is done well. You don't need a college degree to shine
shoes or drive a cab or serve coffee, but you need a lot of skills
if you want to do the job well.
</P>
<P>
   Waiters are often the difference between whether customers
return to a restaurant or eat elsewhere. Even a fast-food
restaurant with a slow-footed staff will lose customers.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of small businesses can be blind to this. They have a
great store or service or restaurant, but they try to run it on
such a shoestring that they can attract only mediocre employees.
Then the business fails and they have no idea what hit them.
</P>
<P>
   Large companies make the same mistake in customer service,
especially as they rely more on electronic commerce. All customer
service people do is take calls, right? Sure. And all waiters do is
bring you food.
</P>
<P>
   I've tried four Internet service providers in my life: my
current one, another that wasn't quite as good, and two others that
fit into that consumer category known as When Hell Freezes Over.
They are forever banished from my Rolodex because of sloppy
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   With one, I e-mailed a simple question. The company replied with
15 pages of boilerplate technical support, none of which came close
to answering that simple question.
</P>
<P>
   The other freeze-dried provider wouldn't let you cancel your
subscription by e-mail, and callers to customer service always
seemed to have to wait in the telephone queue for at least 25
minutes, no matter what time of day you called. Even if the service
sounds wonderful in the future, the company will never have the
chance to waste 25 minutes of my life again.
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather spend it getting my tennis shoes shined.
</P>
<P>
   When Shoeshine Boy visited us for what seemed like the 1,000th
rejection, Cathy asked if she could take his picture. He picked up
his stand and posed for her.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, I gave him his dollar.

FISHING PRESIDENTS: FISH STORIES FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON TO BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES J. LEWIS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's difficult to visualize President Clinton with a fishing
rod. The gregarious, somatic president is not known to seek
solitude (and its invitation to introspection) or to become
enraptured by natural beauty; his recreation and renewal come from
the high-fives fellowship of Vernon Jordan and other male golf
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Of the presidents since FDR, Clinton has been the least frequent
user of Camp David _ the official presidential retreat in the
Catoctin Mountains of northern Maryland, with nearby streams
stocked with trout and bass.
</P>
<P>
   For many other presidents, fishing has provided a quick
refreshment from official duties. For George Bush, to pick a recent
example, fishing ``totally, totally clears your mind. ... It's not
just catching the fish; it's the background, the environment, the
beauty of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of presidents with lures, flies and bait is the
topic of an intriguing book, ``Fishing with the Presidents,'' by
Bill Mares. ($14.95, Stackpole Books.) The book's charming
collection of editorial cartoons and photographs supplement the
author's witty style to produce a history of presidential angling
that fishing fans and presidential history buffs will enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing has never been a partisan spot, according to Mares.
Democrats Grover Cleveland and Jimmy Carter loved to fly fish and
Republicans Calvin Coolidge and Bush were happy with bait.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington relied on commercial fishing for his personal
economy to supplement the crops. Mount Vernon wasn't just a
plantation _ it also was a fishery center for Washington's harvest
of the Potomac River, where seine nets collected shad and herring.
The slave fishermen were rewarded with a pint of rum a day and the
catch was sold as far away as the West Indies and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Down through the years, presidential candidates found ways to be
photographed with fishing poles in their hands as a way of
conveying their wholesome common touch. Herbert Hoover summed it
up: ``Lots of people committed crimes during the year who would not
have done so if they had been fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover, a dedicated fisherman who habitually wore a jacket and
tie in his outings, wryly commented that ``no political aspirant
can qualify for election unless he demonstrates he is a fisherman,
there being 25 million persons who pay annually for a license to
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover built his own private fishing camp on the Rapidan River
in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. He
ultimately deeded the property to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Humorist Will Rogers summed up the 1932 presidential election in
fishing terms. ``This campaign will be settled on fish,'' Rogers
wrote. ``Do you want a deep-sea fisherman (FDR) in the White House
_ flounders and cod _ or a big trout and perch man (Hoover)?''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1990, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Bush
insisted on keeping his scheduled fishing vacation at
Kennebunkport, Maine, despite criticism that he should be back in
Washington to manage Operation Desert Shield. Bush ignored the news
photographers who captured him fishing daily. He later said he was
trying to avoid scaring the American public by ``creating a crisis
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Mares, a Burlington, Vt.-based writer with eight earlier books
to his credit, occasionally over-analyzes his topic. He provides
separate chapters devoted to ``Fishing and Swearing'' (six pages),
fishing and lying and fishing and Cabinets. The author's 18 pages
of footnotes testify to his scholarship on a sporting theme. Mares
reports that Dwight Eisenhower went fly fishing more than 40 times
but played almost 800 rounds of golf during his eight years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   After a suitable drumroll, Mares announces that his favorite
fishing president is ... Grover Cleveland. Among the reasons Mares
selects him is that Cleveland was a Democrat, proof that while
fishing may be a non-partisan activity, writing about it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, who even went fishing on his honeymoon in Western
Maryland, was a ``psychologist of fishing,'' according to Mares. He
had something to say about every fishing circumstance: getting
skunked, lying, pretensions, bad manners, patience.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his first term, Cleveland and some friends from Albany
hired four experienced guides for a combination fishing and hunting
trip on Saranac Lake in the Adirondack woods of New York. The
president left behind his entourage of aides and Secret Service
agents and it took a two-day hike through the woods for a reporter
to find them.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland later bought a cottage near Buzzards Bay, Mass.,
picking the spot because there were bluefish and sea bass in the
bay and trout in nearby streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``With warmth and wit, Cleveland summed up all that is good and
true in fishing,'' Mares concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland denounced fishing pretensions of those who would
substitute equipment for skill or prefer flies over bait; he
defended the black bass over the trout and salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland also made a fisherman's lies respectable with his
one-liner, ``Our maxim is: In the essentials, truthfulness, in the
non-essentials, reciprocal latitude.''

 &HT;    CHINA'S ANNIVERSARY FACELIFT INVOKES PRIDE, GRIPES IN BEIJING
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Sept. 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The late Chairman Mao Tse-tung must be weeping in his
mausoleum: a glitzy shopping district is a showstopping centerpiece
for the 50th anniversary of China's Communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The district is one of 67 projects, including a new subway line
and airport terminal, under construction around the clock to be
finished in time for the Oct. 1 festivities here. But among the
more than $13 billion in capital improvements, the Wangfujing
Street renovation most audaciously flaunts just how dramatically
New China has altered its course in five decades.
</P>
<P>
   Rolex watches and Burberry coats are for sale there, and parts
of the street are paved in pink marble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the prosperity of the country,'' said Zhong Di, 73,
contentedly surveying the scene with her husband from one of the
street's new wooden benches. ``Without money, we couldn't make so
many changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet an undercurrent of discontent also can be found in Beijing
among people who question the lavish expenditures and disruption
radiating from messy construction sites for more than a year,
people who wonder if things are moving in quite the right direction
as New China completes its first half century with a continuing
charge into capitalist-style reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had money I could get cosmetics and surgery and I'd look
like I was 30 years old, too,'' scoffed a 56-year-old pedicab
driver who identified himself only as Mr. Wu. ``How you look isn't
as important as what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Money would be better spent helping Chinese who are laid off,
live in substandard housing, or don't have enough to eat, he said,
as three fellow drivers murmured assent.
</P>
<P>
   Big construction projects have multiple aims _ to improve life
here, to make Chinese feel proud, and to show a modern, sleek face
to the rest of the world as it tunes into the milestone
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Negative commentary isn't rare, but seldom is openly mouthed as
the anniversary nears and the volume of patriotic boosterism blares
ever louder in the media, schools and work units.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of Beijingers do sound happy to see the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we don't spend this money now, we will have to spend
it later. If we want Beijing to be an international city we have to
spend a lot of money,'' said Qiao Wei, a 20-year-old law student.
</P>
<P>
   Among improvements, the new subway line is her personal
favorite. Cleaning the foul canals and dotting green space all over
town also enhance the quality of living in China's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Wangfujing Street for massive renovation is a
more intriguing decision to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   The name derives from Ming dynasty days, when an emperor
reputedly demanded that his 10 brothers live together near the
Forbidden City for easy surveillance. The street became known as
Shiwangfu, or street of mansions for 10 brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In the century before the revolution it was called Morrison
Street and was a premier shopping district. Post-revolution, it
re-acquired the Chinese name _ adding ``jing'' for an ancient well
there _ and got a new attitude. Shops became state-owned and the
half-mile-long street was anchored with the first peoples'
department store, where plain and basic were orders of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Now shabbier stores are being replaced and storefronts are
getting spiffy new facades and signs. Jewelry stores, camera shops,
and a new fur and leather emporium will compete with more modest
dress and underwear stores.
</P>
<P>
   The street itself has been reconfigured into mainly a pedestrian
mall, with only buses and a few permitted vehicles allowed to drive
through.
</P>
<P>
   Flowering planters made from wooden barrels and carts enliven
the tree-lined walkway, and plazas with irregularly-timed water
jets draw giggling children trying to dodge the sprays.
</P>
<P>
   The change is remarkable to people like the elderly Zhong.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days Beijing had only a lot of single-story houses.
People's clothes were only in three colors--black, gray and
blue--nothing else,'' she said. ``It was a very simple life.''
</P>
<P>
   This focus on consumption is polar opposite the principles that
undergirded Chairman Mao's revolution. And consumption isn't so
popular today, either.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong and her husband are an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come downtown to shop today, just to see the
changes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The reopening of the refurbished Beijing Department Store drew
400,000 people last weekend, but many came just to gawk or to buy
tea or trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   Most people strolling down Wangfujing aren't burdened with
packages, a sign of the nationwide angst brought on by dislocations
from economic reform policies. An estimated 8 percent to 10 percent
of the urban work force is unemployed, and layoffs ripple
throughout the country as unprofitable, inefficient state
enterprises fold under competitive pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The state has scaled back long-time communist benefits like
heavily subsidized housing as it moves to free the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Demand has been so slack that retail prices have gone down for
22 months in a row, leaving stores and factories with bulging
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Pedicab driver Wu said Chinese won't even buy rides in his buggy
these days. Himself forced into early retirement from a clothing
factory a few years ago, Wu pedals Beijing's streets to make enough
money for his family.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand his bitterness at the expensive, gala
festivities planned for October.
</P>
<P>
   But the fireworks and parades and newly-finished public works
will likely stir pride and optimism deep in the souls of many
Chinese, especially if they consider the long, austere and often
torturous road they have been forced to negotiate over the past 50
years. That, at least, appears be the hope of Chinese leaders
stage-managing the party.

   DRESDEN _ On a plain a few miles north of this old and storied
city, the futures of two unlikely partners are joined in an
ambitious and expensive gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from transformed farmland is an expansive new factory
with a simple contemporary design that would fit in nicely at any
American industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Fab 30, the plant was built by Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. (AMD) for about $1.9 billion and bears a distinct resemblance
to its Austin, Texas sister, Fab 25.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, Fab 30 by the end of the year will begin
yielding its primary and perhaps only product: the cutting edge,
copper-based Athlon microprocessor chip, formerly known as K-7.
</P>
<P>
   Athlon is AMD's rock in the sling for its challenge of
Austin-based Intel Corp., the Goliath of chip makers.
</P>
<P>
   As important as Athlon's success is to California-based AMD, it
means as much or more to government and business leaders in this
region as they strive to find a future after spending 50 of its
last 60 years ruled by either the Nazis or Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the fall of the Berlin wall, Dresden, which was left
in ruins after World War II, began to aggressively pursue high-tech
companies such as AMD to build what leaders here like to call the
``Silicon Valley of Saxony.''
</P>
<P>
   To entice AMD, the state of Saxony offered about $500 million _
an offering AMD executives agree was essential to their decision to
locate in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the city of Dresden assembled the 110-acre parcel
near the city's international airport and provided infrastructure _
including a direct link to the Autobahn that connects Dresden to
Berlin and Leipzig. The city sold the land to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We helped AMD do everything,'' said Helmut Ennen, the state
official who in 1993 approached the company's chief executive Jerry
Sanders about coming to Dresden. ``But the decision was theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Landing AMD was a stunning victory for Dresden, keeping the
momentum going and contributing to the critical mass needed to
attract other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 5,000 people are directly employed in the high-tech
businesses here, and we estimate that that produces jobs for
another 15,000 people,'' Ennen said. ``This has been very important
and gratifying for us.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD intends to hire 1,800 people, about half of whom already
work at Fab 30. All but about 30 are expected to be German, mostly
from Saxony.
</P>
<P>
   AMD was the second large technology firm to select Dresden,
following Siemens _ now Infineon Technolgies _ by a year. Last
year, the company announced a joint venture with Motorola to build
a plant in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   In April Mattson Technology, a fast-growing California firm,
chose Dresden as its research and development hub for Europe. In
all, 420 technology companies and 2,000 suppliers have set up in
and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, AMD has been impressed by its experience here, said
Gary Heerssen, group vice president of AMD's Wafer Fab Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is an experiment then you would have to label it a
successful experiment to date,'' Heerssen said during an interview
with Cox Newspapers in a sparsely outfitted office at Fab 30.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen is minding the store until James Doran, Fab 30's new
general manager, arrives later this year. Doran, who managed
Austin's Fab 25, replaced Jack Saltich, who resigned in July to
work for another company.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said he has been impressed by the early tests of Fab
30's precision equipment _ some of its components are so new that
they are in use for the first time. On July 7, the Fab 30 plant
successfully created its first copper-based chips, the first to be
produced in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell, but so far I think the indications are
quite good'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $500 million gift from the state, AMD was
attracted to Saxony because of its supply of well-educated and
under-employed workers. About a quarter of AMD's new hires here
were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though labor costs are higher than in Austin, the quality
of the workers make up the difference, Heerssen said. ``In general,
the overall educational level here on the part of the employee base
is higher than it is in central Texas, and probably everywhere
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it has proved to be an unusually flexible
workforce for Europe, where governments tend to limit the hours
people can be on the job. At AMD, many employees work 12-hour
shifts and the plant is staffed 24 hours a day _ unheard of
elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The company and local officials speculate that this could be
explained by Saxony's being fairly new to the free-market system.
This means that structures such as trade unions and bureaucracies
that are prevalent in much of Europe have not yet taken hold in
this somewhat isolated region. Union membership in the former East
Germany has fallen by 50 percent since 1991, and only about 25
percent of workers in the region are under collective-bargaining
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Also remarkable for Europe, local politicians have shown little
fondness for red tape that has stymied investment in other eastern
regions, such as Berlin. ``We haven't lost one day of this project
to bureaucratic obstructions,'' said Jens Drews, AMD's spokesman in
Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, local officials two years ago came up with about
$1.5 million to establish an English-speaking international school
for the ``chip kids'' who came with AMD's 30 American employees.
The school has grown with the demand from other expatriate
families.
</P>
<P>
   For the Americans here, moving to Dresden has been an enriching
experience. Michael Ashley, a Californian who also maintains an
office in Austin, said he tries to visit one country a month.
``It's been a great experience for me,'' he said, noting that his
first visit to Europe was a house-hunting expedition to Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans at the Fab, many of whom have been to Texas for
training, have been exposed to a strange new culture. They address
fellow workers and superiors by their first names _ a rare
informality in Germany _ and have become accustomed to casual
Fridays when they wear jeans to the office. On a few desks are
Texas flags and in the hallways are framed photographs of their
favorite watering holes in Texas and scenes of hill country vistas.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said the company thought briefly about expanding in
Texas before deciding on Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the company needed a second Fab, but to remain
in Austin would have required the acquisition of a new site and a
willingness to cope with a very tight labor market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the incentives offered in Dresden proved decisive.
``It goes back to the financial arrangement that was available here
that would not have been available in Austin,'' he said. ``That was
the enabling factor but not the only reason.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Austin is expected to continue producing
aluminum-based microprocessors for the mid- and low-end of the
market _ where the volumes are higher _ while Dresden will produce
the high-performance products.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dresden experiment continues to be successful and
business is good, AMD is prepared to expand here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is actually large enough for two, maybe three fabs,''
Heerssen said. ``But we have not made any plans at this point _
hard plans _ to expand beyond the existing facility.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dresden leaders, who are hot after other prospects, the AMD
experiment confirmed their belief in a way of thinking that runs
deeper in the city than its calamitous 20th Century experiences.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 years ago, Augustus the Strong _ perhaps the greatest
Saxon King _ explained his theory of public finance to his fellow
king, Friedrich of Prussia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your majesty receives a ducat, you place it in your
coffers,'' Augustus explained. ``Myself, however, I spend it so it
can return to me three times over.''

IN THE AGE OF INTERNET, GROUP MARKS MILESTONE IN RADIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cellular phones, television, pagers and the
Internet were unimagined wonders 100 years ago when San Franciscans
in a basement by the Pacific shore waited for a mysterious-looking
gadget to print a message on a spool of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the device began beeping and barking. It printed a
series of dots and dashes on the paper.
</P>
<P>
   When translated from Morse code into English, the message, from
a ship nine miles at sea, read: ``Sherman is sighted.'' The Sherman
was a troop carrier bringing American soldiers back from the
Philippines, where they had served during the Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began, on Aug. 23, 1899, what radio historians say was the
first practical use of radio in America.
</P>
<P>
   It was the opening act of a century when wireless
electromagnetic waves would begin to seriously threaten paper and
print as the leading communications medium, and when invisible
signals moving at the speed of light would enable humans to listen
to symphony orchestras on distant continents, to watch astronauts
walk on the Moon and to phone anyone anywhere between the North and
South poles.
</P>
<P>
   Radio buffs, with help from agencies such as the Coast Guard and
National Park Service, on Saturday commemorated the 100th
anniversary of the ``Sherman is sighted'' transmission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899, the Sherman message ``wasn't a big deal _ just a couple
of words (sent) by a ship,'' said Steve Kushman, president of the
California Historical Radio Society. ``But it opened the floodgates
for a whole century of radio and communications technology.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, radio was mostly a laboratory curiosity. It was
invented and tested in experimental forms in the 1890s by
researchers such as Guglielmo Marconi in Italy and Oliver Lodge in
Britain, but by 1899 the age of routine long-distance signaling and
mass broadcasting was still far off.
</P>
<P>
   As National Park Service official Steve Haller observed, the
United States was just beginning to flex its muscles as an
international power, as dramatized by its actions in the
Spanish-American War. The war was merited ``to conquer a new empire
for Uncle Sam,'' he quoted one San Francisco newspaper as stating.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Coast Guard Capt. Charles Williams stood by as a
radio receiver picked up a dot-and-dash repeat of the 1899 message
_ ``Sherman is here'' _ transmitted from a Coast Guard vessel. The
message was sent by Chief Warrant Officer Matt Skahill aboard the
Point Broward, five miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Then, unconsciously demonstrating how radically the world has
changed since 1899, Williams responded to a message on his pager by
pulling a cellular telephone from his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Lee, a San Francisco lawyer who is general counsel to the
historical society, observed: ``I imagine that a century from now,
people will be commemorating the Net and the World Wide Web just as
we're commemorating radio.''

 &HT;    FOR DIVIDED PUERTO RICANS, QUESTION OF STATEHOOD IS NOT A SIMPLE
ONE
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Sept. 5 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ The question dominates every political
conversation here, peppering the talk of old men sitting on shady
street corners, filling the radio airwaves, cropping up in news
articles on everything from politics to business and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland Americans call it the ``statehood'' issue because they
think it's a simple question of whether Puerto Rico should become
the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   For Puerto Ricans, boiling things down to a simple up-or-down
vote on statehood doesn't do justice to the complex mix of history,
culture, principles and emotions that most of this vibrant island's
residents bring to the discussion of what they call ``status.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know what we want and what we want to be,'' said
Margie Morales, a veteran of the capital's political scene and
press secretary to San Juan's pro-commonwealth Mayor Sila Calderon,
who will carry her Popular Democratic Party's banner in the 2000
gubernatorial election. ``For us it's a major question that we face
every four years. It's a matter of identity. It's like whether or
not to get married.''
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of the issue was demonstrated recently when
two-term Gov. Pedro Rossello _ perhaps the most ardent statehood
advocate ever elected here _ appealed to a United Nations committee
to list Puerto Rico as one of the world's nonself-governing
territories whose status is to be determined by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The move caused a stir here, as Rossello flatly admitted he was
frustrated that the U.S. Congress seems unwilling to deal with the
Puerto Rican question. The U.N. panel passed a resolution urging
the United States to speed up its deliberations on the issue,
although the measure has no power to force the American Congress to
act.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1992, Rossello has made the statehood campaign
the centerpiece of his administration, pushing through island-wide
votes on the issue in 1993 and 1998. Neither vote, however,
produced the results he hoped for: in both cases, voters failed to
give a majority to the statehood option.
</P>
<P>
   But the tallies came tantalizingly close. In both plebiscites,
statehood garnered just over 46 percent of the total. More than 70
percent of the island's registered voters turned out in both
elections, a clear sign of just how intensely Puerto Rico's 3.8
million residents feel about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision, of course, rests with the U.S. Congress,
which must officially sanction a plebiscite in order for the vote
to be binding. Despite determined lobbying by Rossello, Congress
has failed to schedule such a vote, saying it is waiting for a more
clear-cut consensus to emerge on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans seem to be struggling toward that consensus, but
it may take years.
</P>
<P>
   With a gubernatorial election looming next November, statehood
will lose its most visible advocate as Rossello steps down. But his
New Progressive Party will continue to press the issue. A Rossello
deputy, former transportation secretary Carlos Pesquera, has been
christened the party's candidate for governor, and is already
dueling with Calderon on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Calderon proposes tweaking the commonwealth
relationship, guaranteeing irrevocable U.S. citizenship for Puerto
Ricans, while at the same time giving them more autonomy over
issues like trade.
</P>
<P>
   Observers discount the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which
has never attracted more than single digits at the polls. As for
the two major party candidates, they say it's too early to pick a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Rico is very interesting politically right now because
neither of the two major parties has more than 50 percent of the
electorate,'' said Maximo Cerame Vivas, a pro-statehood columnist
for the San Juan Star newspaper. ``One is 48 percent, one is 46
percent. There is a floating swing vote that decides the issues,
but it isn't solidly in one column or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello's New Progressives have made steady gains in the past
two decades, rising from obscurity to the 46 percent support they
received in the most recent statehood plebiscite. They are now a
formidable opponent for the once-dominant Popular Democrat Party,
or PDP, which controlled 48 percent in the recent statehood votes.
</P>
<P>
   The PDP is the party of legendary Gov. Luis Munoz Marin, who in
1948 became Puerto Rico's first elected governor. He was the
architect of the plan which led to Puerto Rico's current status
with the U.S. _ a commonwealth territory or ``associated free
state'' in which islanders are governed by their own legislature,
but cede ultimate authority to the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Marin is credited with bringing Puerto Rico into the 20th
Century, pushing for tax breaks that attracted U.S. manufacturers,
while helping develop the island's prosperous tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   But there are curious wrinkles to Puerto Rico's status that may
account for the island's deep divisions on the issue. Residents
receive most federal entitlement programs, including welfare, as
part of an estimated $10 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars that
support Puerto Rico each year _ yet they aren't required to pay
U.S. income tax.
</P>
<P>
   They are U.S. citizens, but they cannot vote in mainland
elections. They have an elected representative in Congress, but he
has no vote.
</P>
<P>
   They fight and die in the U.S. military, but they have their own
national flag, their own contestants in beauty contests, and their
own Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   But while they enjoy many benefits from their association with
the United States, it is clear that most Puerto Ricans still feel
some ambivalence about the relationship. Intensely loyal to their
island's history and culture, they cannot forget the U.S. invasion
during the Spanish-American War of 1898 that relegated them to the
humiliating status of a colony.
</P>
<P>
   Along with that resentment is a lingering suspicion over a
particularly persistent Yankee problem: racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been 100 years since the U.S. invaded us,'' said Rafael
Roman, 51, a soft-spoken worker in a frame shop in historic Old San
Juan. ``Why haven't they given us statehood in all that time? I
believe they don't want us as a state because of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his fellow islanders, Roman shrugs when asked about
the status question. The population is split on the matter, he
said, because so many receive benefits from the United States and
have traveled there and like the opportunities they found.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are still Puerto Rican,'' he said, holding a fist
near his heart. ``I am Puerto Rican. I want to be independent. This
is a nation, and the U.S. cannot take another nation within itself
as a state.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the young _ who switch effortlessly between English and
Spanish, dress in Tommy Hilfiger jeans and watch lots of MTV _
opinions seem more ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you took a vote today, most people would choose
statehood,'' said Jose Ivan Girona, 22, an art student from San
Juan who was raised in the United States by a father in the
military. ``I love the States. There is so much opportunity
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Girona sees the value in maintaining his Puerto Rican
identity. He just isn't sure how to balance that with his love for
things American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we do become a state, we don't want to lose our
identity,'' he said. ``We are very different from the U.S. Our
culture and values are much more traditional. We know who we are.
We're Puerto Rican. But how that fits with being a state, that's
what we don't know.''

all, 420 technology companies and 2,000 suppliers have set up in
and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, AMD has been impressed by its experience here, said
Gary Heerssen, group vice president of AMD's Wafer Fab Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is an experiment then you would have to label it a
successful experiment to date,'' Heerssen said during an interview
with Cox Newspapers in a sparsely outfitted office at Fab 30.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen is minding the store until James Doran, Fab 30's new
general manager, arrives later this year. Doran, who managed
Austin's Fab 25, replaced Jack Saltich, who resigned in July to
work for another company.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said he has been impressed by the early tests of Fab
30's precision equipment _ some of its components are so new that
they are in use for the first time. On July 7, the Fab 30 plant
successfully created its first copper-based chips, the first to be
produced in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell, but so far I think the indications are
quite good'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $500 million gift from the state, AMD was
attracted to Saxony because of its supply of well-educated and
under-employed workers. About a quarter of AMD's new hires here
were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though labor costs are higher than in Austin, the quality
of the workers make up the difference, Heerssen said. ``In general,
the overall educational level here on the part of the employee base
is higher than it is in central Texas, and probably everywhere
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it has proved to be an unusually flexible
workforce for Europe, where governments tend to limit the hours
people can be on the job. At AMD, many employees work 12-hour
shifts and the plant is staffed 24 hours a day _ unheard of
elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The company and local officials speculate that this could be
explained by Saxony's being fairly new to the free-market system.
This means that structures such as trade unions and bureaucracies
that are prevalent in much of Europe have not yet taken hold in
this somewhat isolated region. Union membership in the former East
Germany has fallen by 50 percent since 1991, and only about 25
percent of workers in the region are under collective-bargaining
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Also remarkable for Europe, local politicians have shown little
fondness for red tape that has stymied investment in other eastern
regions, such as Berlin. ``We haven't lost one day of this project
to bureaucratic obstructions,'' said Jens Drews, AMD's spokesman in
Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, local officials two years ago came up with about
$1.5 million to establish an English-speaking international school
for the ``chip kids'' who came with AMD's 30 American employees.
The school has grown with the demand from other expatriate
families.
</P>
<P>
   For the Americans here, moving to Dresden has been an enriching
experience. Michael Ashley, a Californian who also maintains an
office in Austin, said he tries to visit one country a month.
``It's been a great experience for me,'' he said, noting that his
first visit to Europe was a house-hunting expedition to Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans at the Fab, many of whom have been to Texas for
training, have been exposed to a strange new culture. They address
fellow workers and superiors by their first names _ a rare
informality in Germany _ and have become accustomed to casual
Fridays when they wear jeans to the office. On a few desks are
Texas flags and in the hallways are framed photographs of their
favorite watering holes in Texas and scenes of hill country vistas.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said the company thought briefly about expanding in
Texas before deciding on Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the company needed a second Fab, but to remain
in Austin would have required the acquisition of a new site and a
willingness to cope with a very tight labor market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the incentives offered in Dresden proved decisive.
``It goes back to the financial arrangement that was available here
that would not have been available in Austin,'' he said. ``That was
the enabling factor but not the only reason.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Austin is expected to continue producing
aluminum-based microprocessors for the mid- and low-end of the
market _ where the volumes are higher _ while Dresden will produce
the high-performance products.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dresden experiment continues to be successful and
business is good, AMD is prepared to expand here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is actually large enough for two, maybe three fabs,''
Heerssen said. ``But we have not made any plans at this point _
hard plans _ to expand beyond the existing facility.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dresden leaders, who are hot after other prospects, the AMD
experiment confirmed their belief in a way of thinking that runs
deeper in the city than its calamitous 20th Century experiences.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 years ago, Augustus the Strong _ perhaps the greatest
Saxon King _ explained his theory of public finance to his fellow
king, Friedrich of Prussia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your majesty receives a ducat, you place it in your
coffers,'' Augustus explained. ``Myself, however, I spend it so it
can return to me three times over.''

FISHING PRESIDENTS: FISH STORIES FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON TO BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES J. LEWIS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's difficult to visualize President Clinton with a fishing
rod. The gregarious, somatic president is not known to seek
solitude (and its invitation to introspection) or to become
enraptured by natural beauty; his recreation and renewal come from
the high-fives fellowship of Vernon Jordan and other male golf
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Of the presidents since FDR, Clinton has been the least frequent
user of Camp David _ the official presidential retreat in the
Catoctin Mountains of northern Maryland, with nearby streams
stocked with trout and bass.
</P>
<P>
   For many other presidents, fishing has provided a quick
refreshment from official duties. For George Bush, to pick a recent
example, fishing ``totally, totally clears your mind. ... It's not
just catching the fish; it's the background, the environment, the
beauty of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of presidents with lures, flies and bait is the
topic of an intriguing book, ``Fishing with the Presidents,'' by
Bill Mares. ($14.95, Stackpole Books.) The book's charming
collection of editorial cartoons and photographs supplement the
author's witty style to produce a history of presidential angling
that fishing fans and presidential history buffs will enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing has never been a partisan spot, according to Mares.
Democrats Grover Cleveland and Jimmy Carter loved to fly fish and
Republicans Calvin Coolidge and Bush were happy with bait.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington relied on commercial fishing for his personal
economy to supplement the crops. Mount Vernon wasn't just a
plantation _ it also was a fishery center for Washington's harvest
of the Potomac River, where seine nets collected shad and herring.
The slave fishermen were rewarded with a pint of rum a day and the
catch was sold as far away as the West Indies and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Down through the years, presidential candidates found ways to be
photographed with fishing poles in their hands as a way of
conveying their wholesome common touch. Herbert Hoover summed it
up: ``Lots of people committed crimes during the year who would not
have done so if they had been fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover, a dedicated fisherman who habitually wore a jacket and
tie in his outings, wryly commented that ``no political aspirant
can qualify for election unless he demonstrates he is a fisherman,
there being 25 million persons who pay annually for a license to
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover built his own private fishing camp on the Rapidan River
in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. He
ultimately deeded the property to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Humorist Will Rogers summed up the 1932 presidential election in
fishing terms. ``This campaign will be settled on fish,'' Rogers
wrote. ``Do you want a deep-sea fisherman (FDR) in the White House
_ flounders and cod _ or a big trout and perch man (Hoover)?''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1990, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Bush
insisted on keeping his scheduled fishing vacation at
Kennebunkport, Maine, despite criticism that he should be back in
Washington to manage Operation Desert Shield. Bush ignored the news
photographers who captured him fishing daily. He later said he was
trying to avoid scaring the American public by ``creating a crisis
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Mares, a Burlington, Vt.-based writer with eight earlier books
to his credit, occasionally over-analyzes his topic. He provides
separate chapters devoted to ``Fishing and Swearing'' (six pages),
fishing and lying and fishing and Cabinets. The author's 18 pages
of footnotes testify to his scholarship on a sporting theme. Mares
reports that Dwight Eisenhower went fly fishing more than 40 times
but played almost 800 rounds of golf during his eight years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   After a suitable drumroll, Mares announces that his favorite
fishing president is ... Grover Cleveland. Among the reasons Mares
selects him is that Cleveland was a Democrat, proof that while
fishing may be a non-partisan activity, writing about it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, who even went fishing on his honeymoon in Western
Maryland, was a ``psychologist of fishing,'' according to Mares. He
had something to say about every fishing circumstance: getting
skunked, lying, pretensions, bad manners, patience.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his first term, Cleveland and some friends from Albany
hired four experienced guides for a combination fishing and hunting
trip on Saranac Lake in the Adirondack woods of New York. The
president left behind his entourage of aides and Secret Service
agents and it took a two-day hike through the woods for a reporter
to find them.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland later bought a cottage near Buzzards Bay, Mass.,
picking the spot because there were bluefish and sea bass in the
bay and trout in nearby streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``With warmth and wit, Cleveland summed up all that is good and
true in fishing,'' Mares concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland denounced fishing pretensions of those who would
substitute equipment for skill or prefer flies over bait; he
defended the black bass over the trout and salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland also made a fisherman's lies respectable with his
one-liner, ``Our maxim is: In the essentials, truthfulness, in the
non-essentials, reciprocal latitude.''

 &HT;    BEIJING REVEALS ITS SECRET POWER TO BANISH SMOG: Shut down the
factories
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Authorities on Tuesday revealed a sooty secret long
suspected by residents of this heavily polluted capital: that for
vital state occasions, the Beijing government can switch off the
smog.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing officials promised to use that power to the hilt next
month ``to insure a successful celebration'' of the 50th
anniversary of the communist takeover of China on Oct. 1, state
media reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 25 large enterprises in Beijing that produce a lot of
pollution every day ... have been ordered to reduce production and
stop using equipment burning fuel and coal from Sept. 21 to Oct.
1,'' disclosed the official state-run China Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Among the enterprises instructed to cease burning coal before
the revolutionary celebration was Beijing's most notorious
polluter, Capital Iron and Steel Corp., which has been blamed for
generating about 20 percent of the eye-stinging fumes that turned
Beijing's sky into a gray curtain of smog on 256 days in 1997.
Comparable figures since then are not available.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time anyone can remember that Chinese
authorities openly acknowledged that they can close down the
sources of pollution for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Beijing in June 1998,
China's environment minister Xie Zhenhua dismissed talk that
Beijing would order a shutdown of smoke-spewing factories for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Xie told a press conference that a factory shutdown would do
little good. Then, no doubt by coincidence, Beijing was blessed
with a rare run of sky-blue weather during the Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
   Five years earlier, some factories and hospitals were ordered to
turn off their coal-burning heating plants to reduce smog at nearby
sports complexes during a visit to Beijing by a 12-member
inspection team from the International Olympic Committee. At the
time, Chinese authorities denied trying to influence the smog level
in their unsuccessful pitch to win the
</P>
<P>
   2000 summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the Beijing Public Security and Traffic
Administration left no doubt about its determination to control the
smog for the Oct. 1 celebration. ``These measures are expected to
improve the quality and visibility of the air above Beijing in a
short period of time,'' China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to shuttering big coal-burning factories, the
municipal authorities also prohibited all ``large freight trucks,
diesel locomotives and motorcycles using mixed fuels'' from
entering the city for 10 days before the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   China Daily cited a painful episode five years ago: ``In the
last military review on the 45th anniversary of the People's
Republic of China, Beijingers were unable to view the fighter
planes flying in the sky because of low visibility of the heavily
polluted air.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Beijing newspaper, Shopping Guide, reported that most
radio transmitters supporting telephone pagers will be closed on
Oct. 1 ``to guarantee an absolutely unblocked radio system in the
air above Beijing for the flight formation of the Air Force, which
will fly over Tiananmen Square that day.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ Out the window of a bumpy, cramped
commuter plane, this small island off Puerto Rico's eastern coast
sparkles like a Caribbean gem, verdant green hills rising from a
white ribbon of beach.
</P>
<P>
   San Juan's riot of all things American _ Burger King, Outback,
7-Eleven and Pizza Hut on every corner, at least outside the
historic district _ disappears with the prop wash. Through the
windshield, a landscape from a slower, simpler time looms on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Not a condominium or casino in sight, just quaint single-lane
roads winding through lush tropical greenery. Small farms and
modest homes dot the uplands, a line of jagged hills that mark the
island's spine. Taxi drivers beep their horns as they approach
sharp curves, warning on-coming drivers not to hog the narrow road.
</P>
<P>
   In the sleepy coastal village of Esperanza, leather-skinned
fishermen sit beneath a shade tree, swapping tales of the big ones
that got away. A row of dusty, open-air bars beckons the small
tourist crowd, offering tropical drinks, cold beers and barstool
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   But Vieques' fetching appearance belies its status as a
battleground. For decades, U.S. Navy pilots have practiced war on
the island's northern tip, dropping tons of munitions on a deserted
zone that in places resembles a moonscape.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders _ whose grandfathers saw their land condemned by the
Navy and were forced to move with just a pittance in compensation _
want the Navy out. They want their island back, and they want the
military to clean up the bomb damage and pay to help them bring
their economy into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Protestors occupying the bombing range for the past three months
vow they won't leave until the Navy relents.
</P>
<P>
   If they prevail, the island will be free of the constant
bombardment that has cracked the walls of houses and shaken
residents. No more dust from bomb craters will darken the sky
overhead; no more wayward bombs will threaten residents or harm the
fishing grounds just offshore.
</P>
<P>
   But what will Vieques' future hold without the Navy?
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that the sugarcane plantations that once thrived
on the 22,000 acres taken over by the military will return. It
isn't even clear whether the original owners of the land would get
their property back. More likely the government would take
possession, perhaps preserving some of the land as parks and
opening other areas _ including several pristine beaches _ to
development.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders and the tourists drawn to Vieques because it is so
undeveloped seem split on what they want the future to bring.
</P>
<P>
   Many natives have lived in the United States, but returned to
Vieques because the slow, simple life kept a hold on them they
couldn't shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in Brooklyn for 13 years, but I came back because this
is my birth island,'' said Jose Anibal Guerra, a 54-year-old
fisherman. ``I decided Vieques is peaceful and nice, not like
Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, having seen the bright lights and opportunities of the
mainland, they realize what they have given up by coming home:
modern conveniences, big-money jobs, opportunities for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, many hope the tourism industry that has brought
prosperity to their neighbors on Puerto Rico's main island might do
the same for Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of the tourists drawn to Vieques because it is so
laid-back shudder at the thought of high-rise, mega-developments
replacing the quaint guesthouses, unspoiled vistas and easy-going
pace that gives the place its charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here from the Virgin Islands because the crime and
attitude there just wasn't very pleasant anymore,'' said one
American owner of a Vieques guesthouse, who didn't want his name
used. ``The same thing will happen here. Now it's this sleepy,
forgotten place, but it will change. It's a Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Vieques will find a happy middle ground. Perhaps Puerto
Rican authorities will learn from some of the mistakes of San
Juan's crowded tourist districts, where poor zoning controls have
led to garish commercial strips with little appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For now _ with the Navy bombing halted because of the protests _
Vieques retains its lost-in-time feel, a secluded hideaway for
snorkelers, fishermen and tourists looking for deserted beaches
lapped by gentle waves.
</P>
<P>
   What the coming years will bring, nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in California, but I came back here,'' said Jorge
Adams, another Vieques fisherman who also works as a lifeguard. ``I
want my children to grow up here, where it's safer and they know
their Puerto Rican heritage. But they must have jobs if they are
going to stay.''

DEATH IS ALL IN A DAY'S WORK FOR MEDICAL EXAMINER'S STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Graham Cowley is haunted by his work.
</P>
<P>
   The faces of death spring up everywhere, from busy intersections
to ballpark bathrooms. The sights and smells of the job still send
him into dry heaves. The few thank you notes he gets are stained
with tears.
</P>
<P>
   Those who recognize Cowley in bookstores or bars almost never
want to shake his hand. They are more likely to turn away in a
flood of horrifying memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will never forget you _ they'll even remember your
face,'' Cowley said recently. ``You'll get a kid looking up at you
like you're the Big Bad Wolf, coming to take another one of their
loved ones away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowley is one of 13 investigators in the San Francisco medical
examiner's office. The portion of their job the public sees,
retrieving the dead, is actually the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators feed orphaned pets, track down long-lost
relatives and guide family members into the autopsy viewing room so
they can confirm the identity of a mangled loved one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have literally given last rites,'' said Cowley, who could be
mistaken for an Eric Clapton roadie with his English accent and
just-short-of-grizzled beard. ``The family's around; there's no
priest there. What are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Working two to a shift, Cowley and his colleagues keep track of
the 7,000 or so San Franciscans who die each year, investigating
between 1,500 and 2,000 of the most stomach-churning cases.
</P>
<P>
   They have hauled dead bodies out of every corner of the city,
returning to some hotels and apartment buildings more than once in
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The grisly job has a starting salary of around $49,000 per year.
Asked why they don't just up and quit, and the investigators rarely
give a smooth reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's hundreds of reasons, but I can't explain a single one
of them,'' said Charlie Newman, the administrator of the medical
examiner's office. ``You'd have to walk in their shoes to
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The first call one recent morning turned out to be investigation
No. 917 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like protagonists in the Quentin Tarantino film ``Pulp
Fiction,'' Cowley and investigator Bill Tolliver pulled on their
black jackets and jumped into a white van, which can hold four
bodies on a two-tiered rack in back.
</P>
<P>
   With uniforms unchanged since at least the 1930s, the
investigator's attire is pure film noir. Black boots. Black pants.
Black belt. Thin black tie. White shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The only protection they wear are loose, wrist-high rubber
gloves. Even with the most decomposed bodies, the investigators
don't put anything under their noses to dull the senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only do that in the movies,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   As Cowley and Tolliver approached the destination _ a flophouse
hotel on the boundary of the Mission District and Upper Market _
they nod solemnly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here before,'' said Tolliver, 61, the senior
investigator. ``I've been here a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the building is a middle-aged man with thinning
long hair in a ponytail and a sleepy look. He met Tolliver and
Cowley at the entrance, then led them up three flights to two
uniformed police officers.
</P>
<P>
   There was no need for introductions.
</P>
<P>
   The body was across the room, slumped forward on a chair facing
a window with torn curtains. The 40-year-old's arms and legs was
frozen into rigor. His face, wedged between his knees, was nearly
black from the post-mortem flow of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Near his right boot was a pencil-thin syringe; the plunger was
fully depressed.
</P>
<P>
   There are no open-and-shut cases, so Cowley and Tolliver stepped
into the room with caution, making quick detailed notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at what it isn't, not what it is,'' Cowley said.
``Process of elimination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I start every case as a homicide and work down from there,''
Tolliver said.
</P>
<P>
   He took notes: The door was locked, and the key was in the man's
pocket, so it was unlikely anyone killed him and fled.
</P>
<P>
   The spider web of red lines on his body, called the ligature,
was consistent with the way he was found, so he probably wasn't
moved.
</P>
<P>
   A small sink holds a bottle of vodka, two liters of soda and a
few cups of fat-free yogurt. All were recently purchased and full,
indicating he probably didn't commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The body remained rigid in a sitting position, even as the
investigators lifted the armpits and set it gently on the ground.
Cowley worked the muscles in the arms and legs like a physical
therapist, limbering the joints enough to stretch it into the body
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a shower this morning. What's the point?'' Cowley said.
</P>
<P>
   The body weighed more than 250 pounds, and there were stairs to
negotiate, but the investigators considered themselves lucky: there
was a clear path to the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually walked in rooms that are so deep with garbage
that I have to bend down so I don't hit my head on the ceiling,''
Cowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowley and Tolliver zipped the body bag and secured the corpse
to a gurney with cloth straps, covering it with two sheets.
</P>
<P>
   There was a crowd outside, staring and whispering. A mother
grabbed a young girl's wrist and yanked her away as the men lug the
body off the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   After placing the corpse in the van, Cowley pulled out some
anti-bacterial lotion, scrubbed it high on his wrists and passed
the bottle to Tolliver. He'll wash his hands three more times in
the next hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important question for me: Did he have family?''
chief investigator Alan Pringle said when the two investigators
returned to the office. ``We want to get to family as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators recognize the importance of the few moments they
spend breaking the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I say the wrong word, if I have the wrong inclination with
a phrase, they are going to remember it for the rest of their
lives,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get a John Doe, it's all we want to do to get them
identified and let the family know,'' investigator Chuck Cecil
said. ``Because someone, somewhere loved that person.''
</P>
<P>
   The first phone number on a small blue scrap of paper belongs to
the man's father in New York. Tolliver rested his arm against a
desk and braced himself as he told the elderly man that his son
died of a ``possible drug overdose.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolliver has done this hundreds of times, but the words still
come out slowly, and are chosen carefully. Cowley and another young
investigator stepped to the other side of the room and gave
Tolliver some space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is terrible news, and I'm sorry to be the bearer
of this news. ...''

COLTART FLAGGED DOWN A SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ He had a passion for golf, which anyone could see.
He had a flag in his golf bag, hidden from view.
</P>
<P>
   After Andrew Coltart put the finishing touches on a round of 67
to win his match on a cold, raw October day at The Old Course four
years ago, he thought again about the &UR;  &LR; flag. Not quite yet, he
whispered to himself as he stood to the side of the 18th green at
St. Andrews. His countrymen were all around him, celebrating what
would be Scotland's first Dunhill Cup in 11 years, but it was not
quite official.
</P>
<P>
   At least it wasn't until Sam Torrance safely negotiated two
putts for par. And then . . . Coltart had his hands inside the bag.
He pulled out the flag of Scotland, ``draped it on my shoulders,''
and kept it there for quite some time as he celebrated a victory
that validated all the faith he had in himself and all the pride he
had in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to end the celebrating and get on with the
next golf challenge, Coltart did so without the flag. He kept the
passion, however. That's with him always.
</P>
<P>
   It was with him at the NEC Invitational, though it is mixed with
a healthy dose of pride. And why not? Last Sunday, the European
Ryder Cup team was completed when Mark James named his captain's
picks. One was Jesper Parnevik. (itals)Tell us something we didn't
know.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   The other was Andrew Coltart. (itals)Tell us that again,
slowly.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said the captain, Coltart, with one career victory, was
his second pick. There would be a seventh rookie on the European
Ryder Cup team, a fact that sent reporters off in a rush to find
out not if, but how much, these lads were shaking in their
Foot-joys. Coltart has been the easiest target here, an unlikely
captain's pick who no doubt would be more nervous than a skydiver
whose chute doesn't open.
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream come true,'' said the 29-year-old Coltart. ``When
you get the chance to play something that is a dream there is no
point in being scared about it. You just can't wait to get out
there and peg it up.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coltart understands the attraction to his story and he has been
impeccably polite all week at the NEC Invitational. He had, after
all, finished 12th in the Ryder Cup standings and the team already
had six rookies to challenge what is a very strong group of
Americans; surely, James would turn to veteran Bernhard Langer,
14th in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Even Coltart concedes he had not expected the nod, which is why
he headed to the airport in Munich. He was about to board a
connecting flight in London when James tracked him down. ``I was
surprised because I had slipped to 12th,'' said Coltart. ``If I had
finished 11th, I wouldn't have been surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not share the sentiment that a veteran such as Langer
(or perhaps Nick Faldo) should have been picked. ``They haven't
played up to their expectations this year. Nick hasn't played well
for the last couple of years.'' It is Sweden's Robert Karlsson he
feels for. Karlsson had finished 11th in the standings, knocked out
of the Top 10 by Ireland's Padriag Harrington at the BMW.
</P>
<P>
   But don't interpret this surprise as a lack of confidence. To
the contrary, Coltart believes he belongs. ``I thought it was
fantastic to be picked. I'm honored. I worked hard for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been under an awful lot of pressure, because I was always
the one sort of at the bottom (of the standings). I was the one
everyone was sort of able to have a pop at. But even when I dropped
out, I continued to play solid all the way through.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it counted most, he was at his best. A final-round 66
at the BMW vaulted him from 19th place to tied for fifth. It earned
enough money to nail down 12th in the standings. It made James take
notice. And it sent reporters his way with the same questions: Are
you afraid? Do you feel too much pressure?
</P>
<P>
   You'll excuse Coltart if he doesn't see this as that big a deal.
(itals)``Why would you be scared about something you've wanted all
your life to be doing?''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was 4 when he started playing golf in the land that claims
the sport as its own. His great uncle helped found Thornhill, the
club at which he first learned to play. His grandfather was a
scratch. His father carried a 1-handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's a scratch watcher now,'' said Andrew Chandler,
laughing. He explains that Robert Coltart is a fixture at European
events, and his interest in his son's career is as loyal as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler played the European Tour from 1974-89, but now he runs
a management company and included in his stable of golfers are
three members of the European Ryder Cup team _ Lee Westwood, Darren
Clarke, and Coltart. The former two need no introduction when they
enter the golf stage; the latter one should be taken seriously,
said Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know how badly he wanted to make the team. He has
represented his country in everything possible _ Scottish Boys,
Scottish Youths, Great Britain &AMP; Ireland team, Eisenhower Cup,
Walker Cup, Dunhill Cup, World Cup. Now the Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Coltart was a junior golf champion and through the years his
growth in the game has been followed closely by countrymen who
cherish the sport. But Europeans are more forgiving with their
youth, said Chandler, as opposed to Americans who hold them to
higher expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home,'' said Chandler, ``being a good junior doesn't mean
you go all the way. There are an awful lot who don't.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Coltart turned pro at 21 and proceeded to struggle, he
didn't feel a nation's wrath. The patience was paid off, as Coltart
was seventh in the Order of Merit in 1996, ninth last year when he
earned his first victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I felt pressure, it wasn't because of anyone else. It was
because of myself. I thought I was a good junior and I felt seeing
as how I was at the stage, perhaps I could make it onto the next
stage. But I put pressure on myself. There was never pressure from
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even from the people who mattered most to him _ his parents.
</P>
<P>
   His father was self-employed and his mother worked in a
geriatric hospital. ``Dad was closing the shop to run me all over
Britain to play in boys events and things like that. They
sacrificed a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Laurae, is married to Westwood, and it makes for
great laughs and mixups. ``Thanks for getting it right. Everyone
thinks I'm married to his sister,'' said Coltart, ``but there are
lot of wind-ups, you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a relationship that solidifies an intangible that the
Europeans bring to Ryder Cup competition _ one that the Americans
sorely lack. Camaraderie. They are friends, travel mates, and
conscious of one another's personal lives. Coltart's wife, Emma, is
pregnant with their first child (due date: Sept.13), yet something
else that will draw the team closer. Coltart's joy is their joy.
</P>
<P>
   So the Europeans are underdogs again. But aren't they always?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an attitude that we don't even think about being
rookies,'' said Coltart, ``because at the end of the day it is 18
holes of golf which every man on that team is capable of playing at
the highest level. I would say they are the favorites, but I
wouldn't say they are the overwhelming favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   Coltart is on target, said American Tom Lehman, who was paired
in the Irish Open a few years ago with the young Scot. ``I thought
it was a good pick,'' said Lehman. ``Andrew is a good player, a
very good player.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a pretty good grasp of history, which one would
expect of a Scot. Even if said history was just two years ago.
Weren't there five rookies on the European team at Valderrama, he
was reminded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' said Coltart, a wide smile breaking through. ``So
what's the big deal?''

BROKEN RECORDS WARPED 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A game of 20 Questions with baseball's talking record book:
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your most misunderstood single-season record?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's easy. Mark McGwire's 70 home runs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How about your most overrated record?
</P>
<P>
   A. Hmmm. Probably McGwire's 70 homers in '98. Besides ``The
Blair Witch Project,'' it's the most overrated event I've witnessed
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What record has puzzled you most?
</P>
<P>
   A. I know what human has puzzled me most. You. What's your
point? Look, I'm baffled that true baseball historians consider the
record held by McGwire sacred. This year he will lease the record
to Sammy Sosa, who already has 54 homers. Sosa will sublease to
someone else in a few years. Big deal. Next question.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So you're bitter?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm more disappointed than bitter. Baseball may be a timeless
game, but all of its records are not. All I ask is that people put
my contents in context.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. I mean you should have seen this day coming as early as '67,
supposedly the Dead Ball Era.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Um, Mr. Book? I wasn't born then.
</P>
<P>
   A. No excuse. Read more, kid. In '67, Tigers pitchers Denny
McLain and Earl Wilson allowed 69 homers between them. That was one
more than the four worst home run pitchers allowed _ combined _ in
'27.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Significance of '27?
</P>
<P>
   A. Babe Ruth hit 60 homers. Lou Gehrig was second in the
American League with 47. Tell me how many the third-place guy had.
</P>
<P>
   Q. 41?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nope. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you saying anyone can hit homers today?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not at all, son. They were hard to hit in '27, when the worst
pitcher gave up 18 homers. By '96, when two AL pitchers allowed 40
and one NL guy gave up 37, the long ball had changed. Hitting one
out still wasn't easy, but home run artistry became a more
accessible exercise. My God, son, even Brady Anderson popped 50
that year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You don't like McGwire and Sosa?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's not the issue. What I'm trying to tell you is that I
pushed this record out of my exclusive Mount Rushmore section many
years ago. It is a nice accomplishment, but its touchstone has
diminished. Last year, six pitchers gave up 34 homers or more.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you ever love homers?
</P>
<P>
   A. I cherished them in '27, when Americans liked big home run
hitters, big bands, and a New England president, Calvin Coolidge,
who spoke in small sentences. (Coolidge's entire dialogue during a
game in '27: ``What time is it?'')
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were you intrigued by homers in '61?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure. Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle in the Bronx. A
20-year-old Bob Dylan hanging out in the Village. Great era.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Hey, I know this is a baseball chat. But real quick: What's
your favorite Dylan CD?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Blonde on Blonde.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Yo, what about ``Time Out of Mind''?
</P>
<P>
   A. Stick to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You didn't support an asterisk next to Maris's 61?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nah. If you're going to give an asterisk to Roger, you also
have to give one to the Babe. He played his entire career before
integration. People in the majors called Josh Gibson the black Babe
Ruth; people in the Negro Leagues called Ruth the white Gibson. Who
knows what would have happened if there had been one inclusive
league? So enough of this asterisk madness.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When did the home run lose its value?
</P>
<P>
   A. It was a gradual decline. It used to be that 25-homer guys
were special. Now a guy hits 25 and people say, ``So?'' Or maybe it
was the constant ``This is going to be the year'' chatter. I didn't
hear people saying that about Joltin' Joe's 56-game hitting streak.
They don't say that about Bob Gibson's 1.12 earned run average,
Grover Alexander's 16 shoutouts, or Ted's .406.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Respectfully, sir, I think you are generalizing. Can you give
an example?
</P>
<P>
   A. You work for the Globe, right? Only three Augusts ago, one of
your reporters, a man nicknamed Sides _ Larry Nostradamus Whiteside
_ wrote the following about McGwire: ``He will cross the threshold
that separates the above-average slugger from the
honest-to-goodness baseball legend. Don't bet against him.'' And
then McGwire said this to Sides: ``Until somebody gets to 50 home
runs in September, (chasing Maris) is not a legitimate question.''
</P>
<P>
   We had it last season. We have it now. No surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who is to blame for this home run obsession?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know many magic tricks, but try to follow me on this
one. Go to a nearby mirror and you'll see what's wrong with your
game.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Me?
</P>
<P>
   A. You and people like you. You have refused to see the game's
dramatic changes. You become excited when baseballs leave parks at
video-game frequency. You talk about awful pitching and awful
umpires. You talk about tightly wound baseballs. You frown at
batters who hog the plate as if they were your spouse at bedtime,
hogging all the pillows and blankets. But then you celebrate a home
run explosion?
</P>
<P>
   You have bought the propaganda. Baseball pulled a ``Wag The
Dog'' on you, telling you that homers are supreme when they are
truly Depression and Free Love measurements of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   You, newsboy, are a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What can I do to change?
</P>
<P>
   A. Simply mark Sosa's new record _ 71? _ on one of my pages. And
stop overstating the significance of home runs. You should have
done that years ago.
</P>

TOTAL STOCK MARKET GAINS ON DIVERSIFICATION WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you say you own an index fund, people automatically assume
you mean a Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fund.
</P>
<P>
   But these days another type of index fund is gaining popularity
with investors. It's called a total stock market index fund and it
provides just what the name implies: exposure to the entire
American stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In July such funds attracted nearly $1 billion in new money,
roughly half the amount that flowed into S&AMP;P 500 index funds,
according to Financial Research Corp. of Boston. Last July
total-market index funds attracted $401 million; in July 1997 they
received only $68 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, much of the money flowing into the
total-market funds is going to the Vanguard Group, king of the
index funds. Gus Sauter is happy to see it. ``We've been promoting
these funds for a long time, but for most of that time our words
were falling on deaf ears,'' says Sauter, a managing director at
Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Sauter isn't complaining about the $90 billion Vanguard has in
its S&AMP;P 500 fund. But the fund, popular as it is, essentially
represents an investment in large-company stocks. Those stocks have
done spectacularly over the last five years, which explains why the
500 funds have become all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   To purists like Sauter, however, indexing means something
broader. It is based on the philosophy that since you can't
possibly know what kind of stocks are going to do well tomorrow it
makes sense to own all kinds of stocks _ big, mid-sized, and small.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a total-market fund you don't have to make any
decisions,'' says Kristen Culp, who runs T. Rowe Price's version of
the fund. ``You don't have to make a bet on style, market
capitalization or a portfolio manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Total-market funds are based on the Wilshire 5000 _ a universe
that actually has 7,200 stocks in it. Go figure. The Wilshire list
includes all the stocks that are in the S&AMP;P 500 plus all those that
aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Because it isn't practical to own so many names, the typical
total stock market fund buys only a representative sampling of the
7,200 stocks. T. Rowe Price owns 1,100 stocks; Vanguard owns 3,100.
Both funds closely mimic the performance of the index. Like all
index funds, the total-market funds are low- cost and
tax-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   What explains why the funds are catching on? In a word,
diversification. By moving deeper into the market, investors spread
their bets around and in theory at least, reduce the risks they
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing risk is what investing is all about,'' says William
Dougherty of Kanon Bloch Carre, a consultant and money manager.
Last December Dougherty moved some of his money into total-market
funds because he was concerned about the growing concentration in
the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P index has 500 stocks, but its performance has been
driven by a small number of giant stocks such as Microsoft, General
Electric, and Cisco Systems. Those stocks have carried the 500
index to great heights, but should they reverse course, worries
Dougherty, they would exert a powerful pull on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Total-market funds would provide some protection in the event
the big caps fall, but not as much as you might think. The S&AMP;P 500
stocks account for 77 percent of the market capitalization of the
Wilshire 5000. The same big stocks that dominate the S&AMP;P dominate
the Wilshire.
</P>
<P>
   With a market value of $470 billion, Microsoft throws its weight
around wherever it goes. The little stocks, on the other hand, are
great in number but modest in value. The smallest 3,000 stocks in
the Wilshire universe account for less than 1 percent of the
group's market value.
</P>
<P>
   The total-market funds have another drawback: they haven't done
as well as S&AMP;P 500 funds lately. They are trailing the S&AMP;P modestly
this year, as they have every year since 1993. Over the past 10
years the S&AMP;P index has returned an average of 17.38 percent a
year, compared to 16.36 percent for the Wilshire.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to a growing number of investors, the total-market funds
are a logical choice. ``These funds should help you smooth out the
peaks and valleys,'' says Sauter of Vanguard. For traditionalists
who still believe in the old-fashioned virtues of diversification,
that sense of security is a powerful selling point.

TEXAS' OTHER ALAMO PREPARES TO CELEBRATE AN ANNIVERSARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two official Alamos in Texas. There is the one that's
in the heart of San Antonio, with the traffic congestion and street
noise that fill most major downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the one in Bracketville, 150 miles away on the
Southwest Texas prairie where longhorns lie in sparse shade,
rattlesnakes curl up under rocks, and cactuses spring from hard-pan
soil.
</P>
<P>
   It is quiet there. The way it should be at a Spanish mission.
Also, it was there that John Wayne, dressed like Davy Crockett,
whopped the advancing troops of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna over
the head with the butt of his muzzleloader.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder people get the authenticity of the two Alamos
confused.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio's is real; Bracketville's is realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne filmed his ``Alamo'' in Bracketville 40 years ago, and on
Labor Day, Alamo Village will celebrate that anniversary with lots
of country music, poetry and talk of the Alamo heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Five authors will be on hand to discuss the Alamo. The authors
and their books are: Wally Chariton, ``Exploring American
Legends''; Alan Huffines, ``Blood And Noble Men''; Steve Hardin,
``Texian Iliad''; George Nelson, ``The Alamo _ An Illustrated
History''; and Kevin Young, ``To the Tyrants Never Yield.''
</P>
<P>
   Alamo Village is the tourist park that has grown up along with
the Alamo near Bracketville. Visitors can walk the streets of the
movie set, eat in the same cantina they've seen on the large screen
and, of course, buy a few souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   If there happens to be a film being shot, the visitors get to
watch that, too. Alamo Village has a policy that insists it always
be open to visitors. It is never a closed movie set.
</P>
<P>
   James T. ``Happy'' Shahan built the movie set on his ranch
according to Wayne's specifications, but it took years for Shahan
to convince Wayne that it was the right place to film his Alamo
saga.

<P>
   Finally, as the story goes, Shahan told Wayne that the Daughters
of the Republic of Texas would boycott his movie if it were filmed
anywhere but Texas. Wayne took the threat seriously.
</P>
<P>
   It was Shahan who also declared that the set was always open. It
was open during filming of ``The Alamo.'' It stayed open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to open it to tourists,'' said Shahan's widow,
Virginia. ``In one week, we had our fence cut three times by people
wanting to see where John Wayne filmed `The Alamo.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Alamo'' sets took two years to build. It took more than 1
1/4 million adobe bricks to construct the full-scale mission and
the town of San Antonio de Bexar. The set was the largest and most
complete in the world up to that time, with a cost of more than
$1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo Village gates will open at 9 a.m. on Labor Day. Aside
from the musical entertainment, there will be a Western horse race
open to everyone with a horse (no stud horses, though).
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $7 plus tax for adults and $3.50 for children 6-11,
and children under 5 get in free.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call Alamo Village, (830) 563-2580.

THE POLITICS OF SELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Warren Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   Gotcha.
</P>
<P>
   Would you have tarried over the name if I'd written Bob Smith,
or Ross Perot, or Lowell Weicker, or even Pat Buchanan? At the end
of August? Gimme a break.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Gotcha again.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems facing people who are fed up with politics
as usual is that they have begun to ape the worst elements of
politics as usual. That includes the manipulation of celebrity, the
resort to gimmicks as strategy, and even the pursuit of money.
</P>
<P>
   It works short term, but among the more disgusting attributes of
celebrity politics _ and celebrity media _ is the tendency to
obscure serious reform efforts based on deep thinking and hard
political work.
</P>
<P>
   I limped into town last week intent on watching Senator John
McCain's game attempt to advance his presidential candidacy _ in
part by challenging large chunks of his party's conventional
wisdom, especially its addiction to moneyed interests. I also
wanted to see if a somewhat similar attempt among Democrats by
former Senator Bill Bradley was beginning to sink roots in a state
that will be ground zero for the mega-primary next March 7.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, I found McCain making steady progress and Bradley
making none, but what surprised me was the extent of the
distraction coming from the Fed-up Movement. Down the road, the
danger is that the glitz and gimmicks may obscure the cause of
serious reform.
</P>
<P>
   Take Warren Beatty _ please.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who dare to be boring, September is the month
when Bradley officially declares his candidacy and more important
begins spelling out the details of his thinking, above all on
health insurance and poverty, that will make or break his campaign.
But in bigtime media politics, September is the month for the
Beatty rollout. Network producers here are grateful that the actor
confined his August activity to The Big Tease. They want him in
September, when the ratings stakes are higher. So the big question
here is whether ``Warren'' can land a big kahuna like ``60
minutes'' or Diane Sawyer, and to what extent he can sell in the
early morning with Katie and Matt, or perhaps as part of the latest
reincarnation of Bryant Gumbel. The pitches are being made as I
write.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is a ``thing'' that exists as a result of a
midsummer night's dream of a dinner party at the home of a
columnist (Arianna Huffington), who in five years has gone from the
spouse of a money-created, almost winning Senate candidate (Michael
Huffington), to leading acolyte of Speaker Newt Gingrich, to
estranged spouse and estranged acolyte, to whatever. But the trial
balloon remains aloft. Officially, Beatty is ``thinking'' about it
and has a speech date here in a few weeks at which he might say
more.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, there's more. The fringe around him includes Pat
Caddell, the Democrats' apostle of alienation and disciple of doom
(a friend from George McGovern days). It also in recent days has
included Bill Hillsman, a pro who has handled two quite distinct
breeds of outsider winners in Minnesota _ Senator Paul Wellstone
and Governor Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   For conspiracy freaks, the ``thing'' has also attracted
neutral-to-friendly comments from none other than the former Gary
Hart, another pal dating to the 1972 crusade.
</P>
<P>
   And that is part of what bothers the Bradley people. Earlier
this year, Hart contributed a serious memo to them about the
process of mounting an insurgency campaign (Hart wrote the original
book and his own 1984 sequel) in the primaries, and has been
supportive since _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   The other part of what bothers the Bradley people is the
journalism business, which can be counted on to inflate Beatty
beyond his worth for the entertainment value. Bradley faces a tough
enough challenge as it is. Al Gore's people think all this is
funny-pathetic, but Bradley's are right to worry.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Hillsman for now in the Beatty entourage has led
some to wonder if a Reform Party crusade might be a possibility.
But all the signs for the moment point to the Democratic race. In
part, that reflects recent life in Ross Perot's baby.
</P>
<P>
   Take Jesse Ventura _ please.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from his World Wrestling Federation refereeing gig, the
guy sure soaks up national ink a lot for someone who isn't running.
The fact is that he still might, if the alternative is losing his
hold on the reformers he just won from the Perot remnants. A Beatty
bid would be one challenge to Ventura's hegemony, but a more
credible threat could come if Pat Buchanan returns from vacation
bent on leading his pitchfork brigades onto Jesse's turf.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Beatty appears to be more attractive as a
third party figure than as a Democrat. Last week's Field Poll gave
him 1 percent in next March's primary, but nearly 10 percent in
general as a reformer. Go figure. This is all nuts. But watch my
business, especially the TV end. Beatty and Ventura sell, and
reality has nothing to do with it. Call it ``Wag the Dog'' meets
``Bullworth.''

LEGOLAND, A MODEL THEME PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ ``Look at the plane!'' a father standing near
us exclaims, pointing out a black dot in the blue southern
California sky to his young daughter. ``Is it real, or is it
LEGOS?''
</P>
<P>
   You never know. Not here anyway, not at LEGOLAND California,
where we wouldn't be surprised if the pizza we were eating for
lunch turned out to be made from the plastic stud-and-tube bricks.
The Denmark-based LEGO Group says there are about 30 million LEGOS
in its 128-acre theme park that opened in March, which is just one
example of the trivia that continually washes over us here.
Question: What's involved in making a detailed Lego model of Grand
Central Station? Answer: 600,000 bricks, four model makers, and six
months.
</P>
<P>
   LEGOLAND California is the third LEGO park, the first two being
in Billund, Denmark, and Windsor, Great Britain. (A fourth is
planned for a 2002 opening, most likely in Germany.) It is the
latest addition to the southern California ``family attraction''
loop that includes Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, the San Diego
Zoo, and Sea World. You may recall that during the early 1990s,
then-Massachusetts governor William Weld tried to pitch a plot of
land in Mansfield and Norton as the site for this first US
LEGOLAND. But LEGO executives were too smart for him: They knew
about New England's weather.
</P>
<P>
   Here, 97 percent of LEGOLAND is outdoors, and the park is open
year-round. Fifty percent larger than Disneyland and perched atop
rolling hills that were formerly tomato fields, it is aimed at
2-to-12-year-olds _ not to mention their bleary-eyed and
camcorder-toting parents. It cost $130 million to build and
features some 40 rides and attractions. But from the moment we
entered its portals and walked past a 23-foot-tall LEGO-built
tyrannosaurus rex, we learned it's really about the 5,000 or so
models that are made of those 30 million acrylnitrile butadiene
styrene bricks. That's plastic to you and me.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The model of the US Capitol is made from 1,641,000 bricks,
weighs 717 pounds, and took 1,200 hours to build!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``LEGOS are so-o-o-o boring,'' laments a teenage girl walking in
front of us, and it's true that anyone between the ages of 13 and
19 will find this place a tad subdued. Its six major themed areas
are colorful but not flashy. There's no neon, no loud music. Our
12-year-old son discovers he's too old for many activities, even
when motoring a small blue electric car through Driver's School
with other stoplight-running children. (``My dignity is being
tested,'' he says.) Still, he's happy enough peddling around a tall
ridge in a goofy three-passenger Sky Cycle, rolling along in a
small and low-key roller coaster called The Dragon, or working his
way through an elaborate wood and plastic climbing structure known
as The Hideaways. And he particularly likes the LEGO stuff he can
do with his hands, such as building and testing a race car and
using a desktop computer to program and operate a small robot.
(``My dignity is restored.'')
</P>
<P>
   But, like his parents _ who have spent more money on LEGOS than
they probably will on his college education _ Ethan is fascinated
by the staff-created LEGO models. OK, the San Diego Zoo, located 34
miles down the freeway, has a pair of pandas. But are they made of
acrylnitrile butadiene styrene?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bust of Albert Einstein is made of 1,120,000 bricks and is
15 1/2 feet high! It was built in Denmark and had to be transported
to California in sections because it was too big to fit through the
doors of the building in which it was contructed!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The heart and soul of LEGOLAND _ this one and the other two _ is
Miniland. The first LEGOLAND opened in Billund in 1968 because LEGO
realized that folks wanted to see LEGO models. Today that park
primarily displays European buildings made of about 45 million
bricks. The Miniland here in California is constructed of about 20
million bricks and is strictly a US phenomenon that features
painstakingly-constructed models of New York City; Washington,
D.C.; New Orleans; the California coast; and even the very same New
England that was eschewed as a LEGOLAND site. It is incredibly
detailed, down to the limos waiting outside Mann's Chinese Theatre
in Hollywood, the cop chasing a burglar across the roof of a Los
Angeles manse, and the break dancers slithering on a Manhattan
sidewalk. Built in Denmark and England before being shipped here,
it took three years and about 100 designers and builders to
construct, is controlled by 12 computers, and uses 175 miles of
underground electrical wire.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a great promoter of LEGOS, so much so that you wonder
how in the world the LEGO Group managed to lose nearly $40 million
last year, its worst annual loss ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan likes Miniland so much that he asks to return after dark
so he can see it when its lights came on. ``I think I've discovered
what I want to do when I grow up,'' he announces as he watches the
Manhattan skyline twinkle in 1-20 scale.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gate Bridge is made of 75,000 bricks and has 100
lights! It is made of a special shade of orange brick to match the
original bridge!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making LEGO models is just what 34-year-old Henrik Lykke has
been doing for eight years, although he never did it in Denmark as
a child and is an automobile spray painter by training. (``A Danish
kid without Legos? Impossible!'' chirps his fellow builder, Darren
Ward, who's from England.) We meet Lykke backstage at the Model
Shop, a building where LEGOLAND visitors can watch new models being
produced. Surrounded by hundreds of plastic boxes containing many
of the 6,500 bricks available to them, the five model makers
currently working at LEGOLAND California _ not to be confused with
the four ``animatronics'' people who build the electronics and
animate many new models _ are creating a 16-foot-long octopus that
will grace a water ride that is under construction. Like many LEGO
models, it was built first in miniature. Modelers then constructed
it in half-size before starting the full-size figure, a process
called ``doubling up.'' They use a liquid that slightly softens
individual bricks and allows them to be tightly fused.
</P>
<P>
   Lykke is one of two builders who designed and constructed the US
Capitol here, a feat that took about seven months. ``Because the
real building is so large, ours is 1-60 scale, not 1-20,'' he says.
He explains that he works from photos, drawings, and sometimes even
original blueprints. But there are no computer renderings involved.
Indeed, Lykke often doesn't even follow a photograph or drawing,
especially when he's concocting, say, a fish or a fox. ``It would
be like Picasso starting with a photo or a computer printout,'' he
says. ``Sometimes it's easier to just paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance of existing models is part of the job, too. ``We get
birds pecking on them all the time,'' Lykke explains.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new red octopus will be made of 300,000 bricks weighing
about 600 pounds! It would take one person about six months to
build!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEGOLAND has all the accoutrements you'd expect to find at any
theme park. A family of four should plan to spend $100 or so for
meals that go beyond fast food but have often lost their freshness
by the end of the day. LEGO gear of all sorts can be had, too, from
75-cent pencils to $85 windbreakers. And, of course, LEGO building
kits are for sale at every turn. After all, LEGOLAND does nothing
if not further promote the well-known name of a company that began
in the 1930s making handmade wooden toys and now sells its
ubiquitous bricks _ billions of which are made in Enfield, Conn. _
in 138 countries. (LEGO, incidentally, combines the two Danish
words, ``leg godt'' for play well.) ``A new park every three years
around the world,'' proclaims the company.
</P>
<P>
   We've spent nine hours at LEGOLAND California, ending our long
day with a Coast Cruise through the park's S-shaped lagoon. As our
32-passenger boat is about to glide beneath a small bridge, our
captain, whose name is Chris, makes a startling announcement. ``The
bridge is made of zero LEGO bricks,'' he says. ``That's zero LEGO
bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't believe him for a minute.

CUP CULMINATES SUTTON COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Hal Sutton stood in the background alongside
the clubhouse veranda at The Country Club Monday and listened to
his fellow US Ryder Cuppers share their impressions of the course
with the media _ its blind spots, its nooks and crannies, its
crystalline condition.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came for him to assess his practice round in
preparation for the matches against Europe Sept. 24-26, Sutton
stepped to the podium and said, ``I'll let go what they said, with
one exception. I think this place is dripping with history.''
</P>
<P>
   He just as easily could have been offering a self-analysis.
There was a time not long ago when Sutton fairly oozed history.
</P>
<P>
   He was considered a has-been.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Shreveport, La., oil company owners burst upon the
PGA Tour scene fresh from winning the 1980 US Amateur and
established himself as one of the game's most formidable young
stars. In his first six full years on the Tour, he won seven events
_ including the 1983 Tournament Players Championship and PGA
Championship at the age of 25 _ and qualified for the Ryder Cup in
1985 and '87.
</P>
<P>
   Success became routine; a platinum future seemed a given. And
then he vanished, if not from the scene, at least from the
leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage disintegrated; his attention was diverted. He
became more concerned about his hobby _ riding and selling cutting
horses _ than about making cuts. Still, his downfall was so
precipitous that it defied logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to speculate on what's responsible other than lack of
focus, I don't really have any idea,'' he said. ``I was interested
in other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf seemingly was forgotten, and it returned the favor. Sutton
did not win for the next eight years and only once in the next 11.
In 1992, he rang up exactly $39,2345 in earnings _ the equivalent
of a mediocre week for a true contender _ and he bottomed out after
the 1993 season, when his 10-year TPC champion's exemption expired.
The following year, he was reduced to using his one-time exemption
as one of the top 50 career money earners to gain automatic
entrance into tournaments and avoid the humiliation of returning to
the PGA Tour Qualifying School to regain his card.
</P>
<P>
   But on the precipice, he found redemption. He had remarried,
happily; he had children. And he dearly wanted them to know Hal
Sutton the golfer as something other than a historical footnote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a precious little family back at the house,'' he
said, ``and I didn't want my little girls not to know what Daddy
could do. So I tried to rejuvenate.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more to this rededication than whimsy. Sutton's talent
hadn't deserted him, merely his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, I thought I could still get it back,'' he said. ``I
thought I still had some game down inside. I knew I had the desire
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Desire translated into dollars as Sutton started his climb back
up the money list. He capitalized on his free pass in 1994 to win
$540,162, 29th among the leaders, and thus qualified for legitimate
exempt status for 1995. That year, he revisited a place that had
disappeared from his itinerary _ the winner's circle _ as he
captured the B.C. Open.
</P>
<P>
   After two middling seasons, which would have been considered
exemplary by the standards of his lost decade, Sutton hit the
jackpot last year. He won both the Texas Open and the prestigious
Tour Championship, raking in $1,838,740.
</P>
<P>
   That virtually cemented his status as a reborn Ryder Cupper, but
just to be sure, Sutton has remained on the upswing this year.
Though he hasn't won, he has racked up 11 top 10 finishes, cashing
checks worth $1,456,510.89.
</P>
<P>
   At 41, he is back near the top, and his appreciation is
magnified because of his extended stay in golf's netherworld.
</P>
<P>
   His Ryder Cup berth was just about secured before he teed off in
the final qualifying event, the PGA Championship two weeks ago at
Medinah, Ill. Still, when he stepped off the 18th green after
completing his fourth round, tying for 26th in the tournament and
easily clinching his Ryder return, Sutton seemed duly humbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels really good,'' he said. ``I didn't know if I'd ever
make another Ryder Cup team. It's important because it's one of the
criteria y'all use to judge whether someone is back.''
</P>
<P>
   So there he was Monday, officially back, savoring the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on this Ryder Cup team is exciting for me,'' said
Sutton, ``because it's been 12 years since I've made one.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been so long, in fact, that he might not recognize the
competition now. Thanks largely to the unwilling contributions of
Sutton and his 1985 and '87 teammates _ both of whom lost the Cup
to Europe, the latter for the first time on US soil _ the Ryder has
been transformed from a biennial exhibition of American superiority
to a truly competitive event and a commercial goliath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been viewing it from the sofa in my living room,'' said
Sutton. ``I'm going to have a different prespective than I had, but
from everything I can tell, there's a large difference in the
magnitude of the Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton greatly prefers this view to that of the past dozen
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to be glad,'' he said, ``to be a part of this
next little history.''
</P>
<P>
   History, he knows, is much nicer when you're dealing with it in
the present tense.

SIGNS POINT TO SOLID CAREER FOR ROOKIE WOODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It has been 23 years since Pete Brock went
through this, but he's especially aware of center Damien Woody's
presence on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Brock, an entrepreneur who also follows the Patriots for Boston
radio station WBCN, was the 12th pick overall in the 1976 NFL draft
out of Colorado. The Patriots took him seven spots behind Hall of
Famer Mike Haynes and nine spots ahead of Tim Fox in what turned
out to be a bonanza first round. (They received the extra picks as
a result of trading Jim Plunkett to San Francisco.)
</P>
<P>
   Brock never made a Pro Bowl, but he played 12 years of steady,
hard-nosed football on one of the best offensive lines the Patriots
ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Woody, the 17th overall pick this year out of Boston College,
has been thrown into the fire, with competition only from
second-year center Jason Andersen, but Brock was able to break in
gradually and learn from veteran Bill Lenkaitis. Red Miller, then
the offensive line coach, had Brock play every line position before
he eventually took over for Lenkaitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red wanted me to know what everybody's job was on the
offensive line,'' said Brock. ``He felt I'd be better prepared to
make the calls on the line if I understood what everyone's role
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock remembers one drive against the Chicago Bears on which he
played all six line positions, including tight end.
</P>
<P>
   That is something Woody will never experience. The Patriots want
him to be their center for some time. After three exhibition games,
he appears to be headed in that direction. Woody was one of the few
positives in a 45-14 thrashing at the hands of the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are really coming together now,'' said Woody. ``I think
I'm playing pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   What impressed the coaching staff was Woody's ability to keep up
with a very active Tampa Bay defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a lot of movement things, stunting and stuff that
caused us to freeze a little bit,'' said Woody. ``We couldn't come
off the ball like we wanted because all of the angling they were
doing. But I feel a lot of progress in every game I've played. Just
getting the reps and playing in game situations has really helped
to build my confidence up.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia doesn't speak to the
media about his players, but Brock is qualified to assess Woody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks to me to be a great athlete,'' said Brock. ``He has
great feet and tremendous strength. The one thing I've noticed
about him, and most young players, is they don't have a lot of
technique. He tends to rely a lot on his athletic ability and
strength. The technique and the fundamentals will come with it, and
the quicker he learns that the better off he'll be.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times he'll get out of position because of his lack of
technique, but his athleticism allows him to get back into position
very quickly. Trouble is, in this league, you're going to meet Dana
Stubblefields, Brad Culpeppers, and Warren Sapps week in and week
out. They'll be as athletic and strong as you are, and technique is
what will make or break him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock noticed that, against Tampa Bay, Woody ``got some good
push when he needed to really shore it up front, when he needed to
keep the continuity of the pocket together. You could see he could
drop anchor and play that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody got off to a rough start in camp, missing a couple of
workouts that angered the coaching staff and made them wonder about
his work ethic. Those concerns are quickly subsiding.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 picks are constantly under a microscope. He plays a
position that few fans watch intently, but when an opponent bowls
him over, he'll be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel (the pressure) easing right now,'' said Woody. ``When I
first came in they were hard on me _ not to say they're not hard on
me now _ but I'm getting used to the system and things are coming a
lot easier then they were in training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock said the toughest part of the position is the mental part.
There's no doubt in his mind that Woody can handle that, and he
called his physical presence ``astounding.'' But Brock remembers
very well all of the calls he used to make, all the blitz pickups.
He remembers getting to the point where he'd call decoys just to
get the opposition thinking one way so he could do the opposite.
One thing he doesn't understand is offensive linemen like Woody
pointing to their opponents at the line of scrimmage, almost
tipping off the blocking scheme. These are things that Woody will
learn in time.

USOC'S SCHULTZ WILL RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   United States Olympic Committee executive director Dick Schultz
will step down next year, since the committee's proposed overhaul
would transform his job dramatically. A report from a public-sector
task force and an independent consulting firm, which was announced
Monday, recommended that Schultz's duties be changed to those of a
corporate-style president/CEO who would serve 3-5 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to commit that kind of time,'' said the
69-year-old Schultz, who will stay on until a successor is named,
which would not be until after the USOC board formally approves the
restructuring next spring. ``We're probably looking at 5-6 months
minimum, but hopefully it will be quicker than that.'' Schultz then
would focus on fund-raising, which has lagged since the Salt Lake
payoff scandal broke last December.
</P>
<P>
   Though Schultz reportedly has been at odds with USOC president
Bill Hybl and some board members over his management style, Hybl
had denied earlier reports that Schultz might be pressured out.
``The decision was Dick's,'' Hybl said Monday.

   It's been a hellish summer for the Cubans. Eleven of their
athletes defected at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, where high
jump hero Javier Sotomayor had his gold medal stripped for doping.
Then their boxers walked out of last week's world championships in
Houston after welterweight Juan Hernandez got robbed of a
gold-medal victory over a Russian. Though the international
federation reversed the decision and banned four of the five judges
for at least four years (and possibly life), the Cubans kept
walking with the six medals (only two gold) they'd already won.
Meanwhile, the Cuban boxing president and eternal coach Alcides
Sagarra, who charged that a ``refereeing mafia'' sabotaged the
Cubans, were both suspended. ``It bothers them that we have the
best team in the world,'' said Sagarra.
</P>
<P>
   Or do they? Fact is, the Cubans had been losing decisions all
week, two of them to the hated Yanquis (light flyweight Brian
Viloria and light heavy Michael Simms). And Alexis Rubalcaba, their
monstrous superheavy, was outboxed by an Italian and didn't even
make the medal round. Beneficiaries of the walkout were the
Romanians, who topped the medal table, and the Americans, who ended
up with a record four golds after last time not advancing anyone
past the second round.

   Next year's World Figure Skating Championships won't be going
down under after all. The International Skating Union summarily
yanked them from Brisbane last week because it couldn't cut a deal
with Australian TV to serve as world broadcast feeder. So the event
will be held in Nice (yes, the Riviera) at the end of March . . .
Scratch South Florida from the US bidders for the 2007 Pan American
Games, reportedly for lack of government and community support. So
the USOC will choose between San Antonio and Raleigh-Durham, N.C.,
in October. No American city has played host to the Pan Ams since
Indianapolis in 1987 . . . That Sept. 15 deadline for the NHL to
say go or no-go for the 2002 Winter Games, already extended from
last winter, has been pushed into mid-November. Though the
International Ice Hockey Federation wanted the issue settled before
its Florida congress next month, the NHL and its players haven't
agreed on anything yet. Though most of the owners favor playing in
the Games (or at least don't oppose it) and would be willing to
break up the season for a dozen days, the idea of finishing the
playoffs at the end of June leaves them cold . . . When the men's
four failed to even make the semifinals at last week's World Rowing
Championships in St. Catharines, Ontario, it threw US Rowing's
Olympic trials schedule for next year into a jumble. Sweep coach
Mike Teti had hoped to pick both his four and eight as late as
possible (i.e. August) before the Games. Now he might have to do it
as early as April, so the boat can have time to jell before the
special Olympic qualifying regatta at Lucerne in July. ``We put
ourselves in this position,'' shrugged Teti. ``Now we'll have to
fight our way out of it.'' In all, five US boats will have to
qualify because they did so poorly at St. Kit's _ the men's pair,
four, and quad and the women's single and double. The berths that
were earned at worlds don't necessarily go to the people who earned
them, but to their country. Next year's trials victors get them . .
. Jenny Thompson of Dover, N.H., won six gold medals (three
individual and three relay), at last week's Pan Pacific swim meet,
broke Mary T. Meagher's 18-year-old record in the 100 butterfly,
and didn't even get named female swimmer of the meet. South
Africa's Penny Heyns, who set world records in both breaststrokes,
did. Thompson, who has performed brilliantly since she failed to
qualify in an individual event for the last Olympics, could be the
Mark Spitz/Matt Biondi of the Sydney Games.

MIRAMAX FINDS `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL' IN ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in the delightful 1996 film, ``Big Night,'' a thriving
restaurateur explains to his struggling competitor his key to
success. Both are owners of Italian restaurants, both trying to
curry favor with the pedestrian palates of 1950s New Jersey. While
one wants to offer every delectable dish of his homeland, the other
knows such efforts are a waste during these bland, unadventurous
I-Like-Ike years. So he tells his rival that no matter how absurd
or lowbrow it might seem, you've got to give the people what they
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy works all day, he don't want to look at his plate and
ask, `What the (expletive) is this?' '' he says. ``He wants to look
at his plate, see a steak, and say, `I like steak!' ''
</P>
<P>
   That scene came to mind last week after Miramax released an
English-dubbed version of its Oscar-winning film, ``Life is
Beautiful.'' Released in its original Italian last year, ``Life is
Beautiful'' earned $57 million, and won three Academy Awards.
Roberto Benigni directed, wrote, and starred in the comic drama as
a father trying to shield his young son from the horrors of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, only about 13 percent of American moviegoers saw the film,
and Miramax believes it's because the film was in Italian with
English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   See, a guy works all day, he don't want to go to movies he has
to read and ask, ``What the (expletive) is this?'' He wants to look
at the screen, hear English, and say, ``I like English!''
</P>
<P>
   We Americans are a funny lot, bless our little xenophobic
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is the biggest sport on the planet, but baseball is
America's pasttime. The rest of the world operates on the metric
system, while we're still measuring our lives in inches, pounds,
and miles. We're suddenly loco for Latin pop, so long as it's more
pop than Latin, and sung in English; Iceland's Bjork just plain
frightens us, and we don't know what to make of Brit comedian Eddie
Izzard, who is funnier than Jim Carrey, Chris Tucker, and Adam
Sandler combined.
</P>
<P>
   And we've always had problems with foreign films _ from the
films of Italy's Federico Fellini and Germany's Rainer Werner
Fassbinder, to the more recent works of Spain's Pedro Aldomovar.
There's often an ``If I wanted to read, I would have stayed home''
mentality when it comes to foreign films. Many folks _ and you know
who you are _ grimace and groan the minute they realize a film has
subtitles, if they bother to go at all. And that's a shame because
some of the best films of recent years, including Brazil's
``Central Station,'' Germany's ``Run Lola Run,'' and Mexico's
``Like Water for Chocolate'' are all foreign product.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that dubbing has progressed since the unintentionally
campy words-first, lip-movement-later days of Japan's old
``Godzilla'' films, perhaps this is the best way to get American
filmmakers to forgo the meatballs and spaghetti for the seafood
risotto. As Martin Grove, CNN's movie analyst, said last week,
``Those who do like (subtitled films) are such a small percentage
of the audience that you can't make a lot of money from that. But
dubbed in English, the movie will play just like any other movie.''
Benigni supervised all the dubbing, and had his own part dubbed by
an American actor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, can an argument be made that Miramax is just being greedy?
Oh sure _ ``Life is Beautiful'' is North America's highest-grossing
foreign-language film ever, but never let it be said that studio
honcho Harvey Weinstein would turn his back on potential dollar
signs. (By the way, someone please remind Harvey that a dubbed
version does not make the film again eligible for Oscar
consideration.) Yet, Miramax is simply doing what most other
countries have been doing for decades. Overseas, Leonardo DiCaprio
rescues Kate Winslet in Italian, Will Smith saves the world in
French, and Jar Jar Binks is just as annoying in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, despite what dispute some might have
with dubbing, it presents an opportunity for subtitle-shy Americans
to see films they might have otherwise avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only someone could dub Adam Sandler films for those of
us over 14 years old.

MARGOLYES STAYS AT THE TOP OF HER VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day two years ago, actress Miriam Margolyes returned home
from work and found a letter on her kitchen table that had been
delivered by limousine from Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to think,'' said Margolyes from her London
home by telephone last week, sounding as if she seldom fails to
know what to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a four-page handwritten fan letter from Prince
Charles,'' she says. ``He wrote to thank me for the recording I
made for the Cover-to-Cover (audio book) of Dickens's `Oliver
Twist,' unabridged. The letter was a paean of praise, and he told
me he loved listening to tapes of books when he is driving, and how
he found my reading very affecting. I was very touched. The funny
thing is that in Britain I had recorded a book called `The Queen
and I,' a satirical book about the queen being forced to move into
a housing project, and in it I played every member of the royal
family, including him. I was rather nervous that he would be
insulted, but it doesn't seem to have affected his opinion of my
work. I was invited to his birthday party at Hampton Court Palace,
and it was a very proud moment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolyes's recording of ``Oliver Twist'' was issued earlier
this year in America, and it recently won the ``Audie'' award for
the best performance of a book by a female reader. Indeed, her
reading is just about the most astonishing display of sustained
vocal virtuosity this listener has ever heard _ the only possible
comparison is to the female p'ansori singers of Korean epic. Her
energy is unflagging over an 18-hour span of 12 cassettes, and she
finds a different timbre, accent, and rhythm for every character,
changing instantaneously during the dialogue. Her reading crowds
the mind with personalities, drama, and powerful emotions.
Margolyes admits that during the eight days of recording sessions,
she had to stop and pull herself together as she read the climactic
scene between Nancy and Rose Maylie on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in tears,'' she says, ``and I couldn't go on. When I'm
recording an audio book, I throw myself into it; I am not acting
less because it's for the ear alone. In fact, it's quite the
opposite _ everything has got to be in the voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolyes boasts one of the most remarkable voices in her
profession today. ``I like it when I can sometimes surprise people
with a different voice,'' she admits quietly, and she will do it
repeatedly even during a short phone conversation. She can say,
``You're not wrong about that, sweetheart,'' and sound just like
Humphrey Bogart.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' she says, ``the voice is a way into a character.
Other actors may start from the shoes or the walk. I love listening
to people talk, and I particularly like combination accents _ a
Jewish Scots accent, for example.'' As she speaks, Margolyes falls
into one. ``Maybe that is a voice from my grandparents, who were
Russian, Polish, and German. I grew up in Oxford, in an academic
environment; my father was a doctor. But nothing was more valuable
to me in my work than listening to the voices of European Jews and
rejoicing in that heritage. I've just been to a Jewish genealogical
conference in New York, which was very thrilling.''

   Likes American roles &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Margolyes started off in the theater nearly 40 years ago, but
her onstage appearances are infrequent these days because she has
become so active in movies and television. ``In the theater they
tend to think I should play English roles, but I like doing
American stuff. I live in Santa Monica now, and most of the time I
play Americans in the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   American audiences probably know Margolyes best for her
supporting roles in Baz Luhrmann's ``Romeo and Juliet'' with
Leonardo DiCaprio and in the film of Edith Wharton's ``The Age of
Innocence.'' In Britain, she won an award for best supporting
actress for her performance in ``Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Her film roles certainly have been diverse. In addition to her
work in highbrow movies like ``Little Dorrit,'' ``Immortal
Beloved,'' and ``Orpheus Descending,'' she also appeared in ``Cold
Comfort Farm,'' ``Ed and His Dead Mother,'' and ``James and the
Giant Peach.'' One of her many voices is featured on the soundtrack
of ``Babe,'' and another appears as the matchmaker on the
soundtrack to Disney's ``Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, Margolyes also starred in her own short-lived
television sitcom, ``Frannie's Turn.'' ``I played a Staten Island
housewife trying to educate her husband into being a new man. I had
a very good time, not least because I made rather a lot of money in
a very short time!'' In England, Margolyes is a beloved household
figure because of her presence on a long-running series of British
Telecom television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Her newest film, just finished, is an Arnold Schwarzenegger epic
that will open at Thanksgiving. ``I am one of the baddies, and I
get to pick him up and hurl him against the wall. I must say he was
very sportsmanlike about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolyes says she has had no formal training in acting. ``It's
a gift, which I enjoy. At the beginning, I had a very traditional
career. It all started when I was a student back in the '60s at
Cambridge (University). I did a lot of comedies back then, and I
was in a group called the Footlights with people like John Cleese.
Then I went into repertory theater, and I played lots of different
things, and took on a new part every two weeks. Since I went into
television and the movies, I don't do theater as much as I would
like, although I enjoyed doing `The Killing of Sister George'
recently and Mrs. Hardcastle in a revival of `She Stoops to
Conquer.' I was also in the original production of `Cloud 9.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in Williamstown (Mass.) for two summers, in Moliere's
`The Learned Ladies' with Kate Burton, and I had the most fun in
the world, and I came back to do my one-woman show, `Charles
Dickens' Women.' I would love to return to Williamstown because the
spirit is so wonderful there _ it's summer camp for actors.
Tomorrow I'm off to the Theater Royal in York, where I'm going to
play Madame Ranevskaya in `The Cherry Orchard.' I find the prospect
very frightening, because I've never played Chekhov before,
although I've wanted to all my life. Gradually I got too old for
most of his parts. But you're never too old for Ranevskaya!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Preserving the classics &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Margolyes hasn't recorded many audio books, but she appears on a
recording of Oscar Wilde's ``Lady Windermere's Fan'' and she reads
``A Christmas Carol'' by Dickens for Cover-to-Cover. ``I keep
hoping I'll be asked to do more because I love it so much. I
particularly love Edith Wharton; I did a reading from `Summer' at
the Mount in Lenox a week ago in preparation for the play and the
opera, and to support the restoration fund for her old home. I know
there's already a recording of `The Age of Innocence,' but it was
not recorded by me _ which was a grave oversight on someone's part.
I don't even really care about the money, I love doing it so much _
this is a way the classics can still be within reach of so many
people. So much crap gets recorded, the good stuff should be
recorded, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of audio books, for Margolyes, is the appeal of
storytelling. ``I strongly believe,'' she says, ``there is a need
in all of us to have a story told, a primal need. When you hear the
words `Once upon a time,' your whole being thrills to the
expectation. People often aren't interested in the idea of audio
books, until they hear one, and then they really love it. Nobody is
telling stories anymore, and this basic human need is something
that's been forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolyes says that she doesn't make any special adjustments
when she performs for the microphone. ``You are creating a world
and the people in it. You have to have a flexible voice and an
imagination _ when I sit down to record, I'm doing all the
movements and facial expressions I would do if I were acting
standing up. I don't make any concessions to the microphone. I put
my whole heart and soul and body _ which is rather large _ into it,
and I think you have to. The mike is really someone's ear, and what
you're doing is speaking directly to someone, just one person.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dickens a favorite &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dickens has been a particular favorite of Margolyes's since
childhood. `` `Oliver Twist' was the first novel by Dickens that I
read. It creates a world into which you are pushed, and it envelops
you _ a process I find delightful. You can't rehearse a reading
that lasts that long. You just read the book, and if you make a
mistake, you go over it again. But you do have to have in your head
a very clear picture of the characters, and Dickens is a godsend to
a reader, because he writes very sharply defined characters. It
isn't difficult to do the characters. What is hard is the strong
energy line you have to have to get through the long sentences. You
need a good breath and you need to know how to control it. The
voice is made by the breath; breath is the material from which the
voice is made.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolyes says her one-woman show tells the story of Dickens's
life and of the women in it, using the women he portrayed in his
books. ``Most of them were based on actual people,'' she says. ``I
picked 11 episodes, and between the scenes, I talk directly to the
audience. In the second half, I concentrate on the desperately sad
story of the breakup of his marriage. When a one-person show works,
it's thrilling. But doing one is a very dangerous exercise. The
audience is sequestered with just one person, and they get very
scared _ you have to reassure them that it's going to be all right.
This one-woman show is very precious to me because Dickens is, and
because it offers one of my relatively rare opportunities to be
onstage again. Yes, of course, I would love to perform the piece in
Boston, but the problem is that doing theater doesn't pay very
much, and the repertory theaters want you to commit a year in
advance. I can't afford to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``An actress's greatest asset,'' Margolyes adds, pausing lightly
and just long enough to make the exact effect she intends, ``is her
availability.'' In her voice, over the telephone, you can clearly
hear the twinkle in her eye.

BIOGRAPHER SAYS DIANA'S MENTAL STATE WAS IGNORED

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DIANA IN SEARCH OF HERSELF 
Portrait of a Troubled Princess 
By Sally Bedell Smith 
Times Books, 451 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One irony attending the car crash that killed Diana, princess of
Wales, at age 36 two years ago is that the driver, Henri Paul, had
traces of Prozac in his system, an antidepressant that may have
impaired his judgment. Diana, who was drug-free that night,
probably should have been on Prozac; had she been on it, she might
never have been dating a spoiled, paranoid lunkhead like Dodi
Fayed.
</P>
<P>
   A reach? Not if one is to believe biographer Sally Bedell Smith,
who has previously chronicled the lives of CBS founder William S.
Paley and diplomat-courtesan Pamela Churchill Harriman. This time
Smith sets out to explore what she calls ``the interplay of Diana's
character and temperament,'' in a book that is at once morbidly
fascinating and profoundly sad.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing upon thick files of newspaper clippings and nearly 150
interviews with Diana's intimates _ including members of Britain's
tabloid press corps, whom the princess alternately seduced and
abandoned, depending on her agenda _ Smith marshals evidence to
suggest that Diana suffered from a serious, and largely untreated,
mental illness. It was an illness, suggests Smith, that affected
everything from Diana's choice in men (discreet, subservient,
career-enhancing) to her choice in therapists (new age types who
mostly told her what she wanted to hear), imprisoning her in a kind
of lethal, albeit gilded, cage.
</P>
<P>
   The illness was borderline personality disorder, so named
because its symptoms fall between neurosis (milder) and psychosis
(more severe). Among its common symptoms are chronic depression,
low self-esteem, violent mood swings, emotional dependency, fear of
abandonment, eating disorders, and self-mutilation. One underlying
cause of the disorder is thought to be the early and traumatic loss
of a parent.
</P>
<P>
   As documented by Smith, Diana, whose parents nastily divorced
when she was 6, and whom even close friends seldom regarded as an
intellectual overachiever, suffered from all these ills long before
her failed marriage to Prince Charles in 1980. An older sister
waged war with anorexia. Diana's mother all but disappeared from
Diana's life after the divorce. Other close relatives battled
depression and suicidal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Diana, meanwhile, went from obscurity to celebrity virtually
overnight and was soon crowned the world's most glamorous woman.
It's hard to conceive of a more stress-inducing situation for a
woman in her teens, much less one about to marry the world's most
eligible (and emotionally clueless) bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Juxtapose that diagnosis with much of what was said about the
princess before and after her death. To the British press she was
``Divine Di'' or ``Disaffected Di,'' not ``Dysfunctional Di.'' Her
struggles with bulimia and depression were duly noted, even
publicly discussed by Diana herself after her separation from
Charles. So were her battles with the royal family over who
controlled her life.
</P>
<P>
   Diana's commitment to various causes _ nearly 120 at one point _
was also praised by her eulogists, yet the causes themselves were
seldom selected for purely altruistic reasons, notes Smith. Many
were later discarded with brutal impersonality. Friends and lovers
got the same treatment: hour upon hour of teary phone calls
followed by icy silences and crossed-out invitations. Her one great
consistency may have been as a mother, and for that the world holds
out hope for her two sons. But the dominating image is of Diana the
cunning eavesdropper, the jealous envelope-steamer, the habitual
liar and media manipulator who served as her own worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Charles, for his part, was cast in one of two roles: as an
uncaring, unfaithful twit, or as a hapless victim of his wife's
obsession with celebrity. Neither was close to the complete truth,
according to Smith, who did not interview Charles for this book but
who did gain access to his private correspondence, much of it
concerning Diana. What seems true is that, notwithstanding
Charles's efforts to get his wife the proper psychiatric care, the
royal family in general regards mental illness about as seriously
as it does a nagging head cold. Diana was indulged _ or ostracized
_ when she should have been treated not as a problem but as a
patient. Charles may come across sympathetically in Smith's
narrative, but there are few heroes to be found here.
</P>
<P>
   In another epoch, Diana's troubled psyche might have landed her
in exile. Or worse, the Tower of London. We live in more
enlightened times, fortunately. Reading Smith's biography, however,
one wonders how far we've really come. Given the odds against her,
Princess Diana's life seems less a candle in the wind than an
accident waiting to happen.

INTERFAITH GROUP ASSAILS `INFLAMMATORY' VIEW OF HOMOSEXUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of religious leaders that supports gays and lesbians has
accused James Dobson, president of the conservative Focus on the
Family, of disseminating ``false and inflammatory rhetoric'' about
homosexuals through his print ministry and worldwide broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The National Religious Leadership Roundtable made the charges in
a letter delivered last week to the powerful evangelical Christian
ministry based in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   An interfaith organization of about 40 people that formed last
year, the roundtable drafted the letter during a two-day conference
held in Colorado Springs. The group chose the city, which is home
to several conservative Christian organizations, because it wanted
to present a different view of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality and the role of gays and lesbians in different
faiths has emerged as one of the most contentious issues on
America's religious landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The roundtable's letter states Focus on the Family's
``anti-homosexual campaign leads directly and indirectly to broken
families, to divided churches, and to sufferring and death to God's
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people.''
</P>
<P>
   The group sought a meeting with Dobson so he could ``hear our
case, and together begin a process of seeking truth about
homosexuality and homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobson was on vacation and unavailable for comment. But Amy
Tracy, a spokeswoman for Focus on the Family, said it was unlikely
he would meet with the group because the letter's authors ``have
bashed him all over'' in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say homosexuality is a sin . . . that's not Dr. Dobson _
that's God,'' Tracy told reporters. ``They should take it up with
God because the Bible is very clear that homosexuality is a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Roundtable leaders said they would not try to persuade Dobson to
change his views on homosexuality, but simply wanted to start a
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we really want is to have a dialogue about this,'' said
the Rev. Nori Rost of Pikes Peak Metropolitan Community Church in
Colorado Springs. ``It's OK if they disagree. No one's asking them
to embrace gays and lesbians or advocate for same-sex marriages.
What we want to see stopped is the dangerous rhetoric that portrays
gays and lesbians as monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Paulk, who says he is a former homosexual and who works
on gay issues for Focus on the Family, challenged Rost's view,
saying the ministry's beliefs are neither incendiary nor false. The
ministry is just trying to counter what Paulk described as an
``aggressive homosexual agenda'' being promoted across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not assaulting the gay community,'' he said. ``We don't
have a campaign against anybody.''

<P>
   --Seeking to calm fears about possible Year 2000 computer
disasters, the American Bankers Association is distributing sample
sermons to ministers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers are trying to urge clergy to allay fears that Y2K
computer glitches will cripple the country's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to reach out to the religious community,'' said John
Hall, a spokesman for the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   So the group is distributing the four-page sermon to bankers
who, in turn, can give them to their ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go into the new millennium with hope, eagerness and
faith in this new century of promise,'' the sermon states. ``We
don't want to be crouched in our basements with candles, matches
and guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one minister said he has no plans on using the
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're treading where angels fear to tread,'' the Rev. Paul
Goodland, an Episcopal priest in Arizona, told reporters. ``Faith
and trust in God is really where it belongs, not in banks.''
</P>
<P>
   --Raising fears of tourist gridlock, Israeli officials say it's
not likely that a second entrance and exit to the crowded Church of
the Holy Sepulcher can be built in time to accommodate the millions
of pilgrims expected to flood Jerusalem to mark the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   While the government wants a second exit for safety reasons, the
Christian denominations that control the church's interior have not
been able to agree on where that exit should be.
</P>
<P>
   Located in Jerusalem's Old City, the church is believed to cover
the sites of Jesus's crucifixion, burial, and resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   --Archbishop Demetrios, who was named this month to replace
Archbishop Spyridon as leader of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of
America, will be installed Sept. 18 at Holy Trinity Cathedral in
New York City. Spyridon was forced to resign following a two-year
campaign by dissidents who criticized what they described as
Spyridon's authoritarian management style.
</P>
<P>
   --Robert Waldron, who has taught English at Boston Latin School
for 30 years, has recently published two books: ``The Hound of
Heaven at My Heels'' and ``Poetry as Prayer: The Hound of Heaven.''
The first is a reconstruction in diary form of the life of Francis
Thompson, the Victorian poet famous for his poem, ``The Hound of
Heaven.'' The second book explores the relationship between poetry
and prayer.

THE STRANGLER AND HIS FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is considered to be among the most dangerous men in
modern-day Massachusetts, a matter-of-fact killer with a
stratospheric IQ who has been locked in prison for 50 of his 67
years on earth.
</P>
<P>
   And many knowledgeable people consider George Nassar to be
something even more chilling than the diabolical genius he is often
said to be. They insist he's the real Boston Strangler.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary telephone interview from MCI-Cedar Junction
in Walpole, Nassar rejected the persistent suspicion that he, not
Albert DeSalvo, his long-ago friend, was the serial killer of 13
women from 1962 to early 1964. And he offered to provide police a
sample of his DNA.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Nassar acknowledged his plight with a laugh of
tired resignation, saying that as long as people believe he's the
strangler, he will never see the light of freedom again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to do with it,'' he said. ``I'm convicted under
the table, behind the scenes.'' He will never be granted parole, he
added, because ``it would be: The person accused of being the
Boston Strangler is released from prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion against Nassar is striking; the vehemence with
which many people hold it, jarring. The long-held suspicions become
noteworthy as Boston police use their new DNA laboratory to answer
one of the most enduring questions in the annals of American crime:
Is DeSalvo, murdered in prison in 1973, the Boston Strangler?
</P>
<P>
   In asking the question, just the name Nassar still raises blood
pressure. A 1995 book broadly hinted that Nassar was a better
suspect than DeSalvo, and the former Essex district attorney was
said to believe Nassar was the killer of at least some of the
women. ``The real Boston Strangler,'' George Higgins, the novelist
and former state prosecutor, says of Nassar.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Ames Robey, the former prison psychiatrist who analyzed
DeSalvo and Nassar in 1965: ``With his psychological profile, he
fit, right down the line. I suspect he was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Nassar was 15 when he first committed murder, the shooting of a
Lawrence, Mass. store clerk in 1948. He was paroled in 1961,
remained free for the reign of the Boston Strangler, and was
charged in October 1964 with shooting an Andover, Mass. gas station
attendant to death as the man begged on his knees for mercy. After
killing the attendant, Nassar approached a woman and her daughter
parked at the filling pumps, stuck his pistol in their car window,
and fired. The gun, though, was empty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, the last of the stranglings already committed and the
murders having mysteriously stopped, DeSalvo and Nassar formed a
bizarre bond at MCI-Bridgewater, Massachusetts' prison for the
criminally insane, inseparable even when DeSalvo met with his
lawyers. Soon enough, Nassar said, DeSalvo confessed to the
stranglings.
</P>
<P>
   Nassar said they would pace along a cement recreation room
hallway known as ``the flats.'' Television sets blared, inmates
screamed, and noise from a bowling alley echoed off the walls, all
as DeSalvo sniffed nervously at the air and became visibly excited
telling his morbid tales of murder and mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He began describing a crime and watching my reaction to see if
it was too abhorrent to listen to,'' Nassar said. ``Some of it was
horrible, particularly the crimes of stabbing a woman under her
breasts in Cambridge. But I wasn't there to condemn.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Nassar introduced DeSalvo to his lawyer, F. Lee
Bailey. Bailey summoned authorities to MCI-Bridgewater with word
that he had found the Boston Strangler. DeSalvo was convicted of an
unrelated armed robbery and sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   DeSalvo confessed to 13 killings in mind-numbing detail, even
recalling room dimensions at the crime scenes. But many detectives
were dubious, having regarded him as a rapist incapable of murder.
Some said he had too much sexual desire to kill women before
violating them, as the strangler often did.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, at least two women who had escaped the Boston Strangler
were brought to MCI-Bridgewater to identify DeSalvo, but instead
pointed to Nassar as their assailant.
</P>
<P>
   What many skeptics believed was that DeSalvo, resigned to jail,
desirous of glory, and desperate for money, confessed to crimes
more likely to have been committed by two or more murderers, in
hopes of earning a book deal to support his family. The skeptics
said he had a photographic memory and parroted details of crimes
that he gleaned from newspapers or learned from Nassar.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare client meeting in which Nassar was absent with the
flu, ``Albert said he wasn't the strangler,'' said Tom Troy, a
DeSalvo lawyer. ``He said I knew the strangler well.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Nassar: ``In my case, everything became fictionalized.
That's the single term that described this whole business.''

<P>
   BOSTON -- The mornings when her mother is getting ready for her
job as an assistant teacher in a preschool, 11-year-old Salena
Abu-Eid prepares breakfast for herself and her 6-year-old brother,
Samir. She'll make eggs and toast and orange juice and, sometimes,
bacon, all of which, she says, is ``really fun'' because it's
``doing someone a favor and I enjoy making my mom happy and proud
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine DeFlorio, 45, a registered nurse, takes a break from
cooking every Tuesday, when her husband, a glass blower, works
late. Her daughter and step-daughter, Emily Kenfield and Barbara
DeFlorio, both 12, microwave supper for themselves and their
6-year-old brother, William. ``The other nights we have a family
night,'' says DeFlorio. ``That particular night we watch `Nova.' We
all make our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   This is mealtime '99, and kids are cooking _ or, at least,
heating and eating. Call it the convergence of time crunch and
convenience. In an era of microwave magic, dual-earner homes, and
single-parent families, surveys show an increasing number of
children and teenagers fixing meals not only for themselves but
also for their families. People spend less time these days eating
together, and, when they do, mom _ or dad _ has often come home at
the last minute so more and more young people are pitching in.
</P>
<P>
   Among children ages 9 to 17, almost half regularly prepare meals
for themselves, up from 15 percent in 1988, according to the
Connecticut-based Yankelovich Partners. More than a quarter
regularly prepare meals for their families, up from 8 percent in
1988. The Illinois-based Teenage Research Unlimited finds that
two-thirds of teens ages 12-19 spent time fixing one or more meals
in the week surveyed, up from half in 1991. For almost half in this
year's poll, the meal prepared was dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a consistently growing phenomenon since we started doing
this research in 1988,'' says Yankelovich managing partner J.
Walker Smith. ``Family structures are increasingly diverse,
requiring kids to take more responsibility. The shortage of time
people feel in their lives requires them to look around for help.
All of that is facilitated by the fact that food manufacturers have
made food ever easier to prepare. The other thing to be said is
that kids nowadays feel themselves to be more independent operators
than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Families may be spending half of their food dollar in
restaurants or on take-out, says Linda Cullen, vice president of
consumer knowledge at the Minneapolis-based Pillsbury Co., but
they're still making 95 percent of their meals at home, which
leaves plenty of time for kids in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we find is kids are doing this `quick fuel' stuff, things
that are ready to eat,'' Cullen says. ``They're participating in
meal preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jude Jean Baptiste, 11, finds quick fuel in the macaroni and
cheese or pancakes he likes to make himself when he's hungry.
Marianne Maguire, 13, helps out the nights her mother, Joanne, an
accountant, works in a bank's 24-hour international unit. If her
mom leaves a meatloaf for the family baking in the oven, Marianne
fixes mashed potatoes from a box and vegetables from a can. Jeremy
Marcus, 17, is on his own for dinner once or twice a week, so he
reheats leftovers or microwaves a frozen pizza or makes macaroni.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Marcus's mother, Barbara, co-owner of Parents in a
Pinch, tried to enlist more help in the kitchen from her son and
her husband. They each cooked dinner two nights a week and she took
the other three nights. The experiment fizzled, however, after a
few months of pasta and sauce from a jar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded pretty fair so I went along with it,'' Jeremy says.
``I didn't love it. I'm very busy at night. Homework and stuff. I
didn't want to spend the time, and I'd much rather eat my mother's
cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the culinary capabilities of adults varies, so does the
kitchen prowess of children and teens. For Lynn Fredericks, author
of the newly published ``Cooking Time is Family Time,'' the kitchen
is a perfect place for multi-tasking with a purpose: Get help
preparing meals, stay in touch with your children, and build a
sense of family teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meal today should not be the mother or the father being
the slave,'' she says. ``I love the idea that kids prep for the
meal _ chop the vegetables or get out the ingredients _ and then
when mom or dad comes home they've made it easier. They can
assemble the meal more quickly and together. Kids love being part
of the process. They feel this great sense of responsibility and
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Polimer, 16, has been helping his mother, Jane, in the
kitchen ever since he was a young boy, cutting vegetables beside
her, learning how to curl his fingers the way he saw TV chefs chop.
Now he cooks three or four times a week, often from his mother's
recipes that he's memorized. When Jane Polimer is not home, it's
Ben who cooks dinner for himself and his dad.
</P>
<P>
   He grills himself a hot dog for lunch or barbecues pork chops
rubbed with spices for his family, or makes his signature
three-bean chili with sauteed onion and garlic, ground beef and soy
burger, chili powder and cumin, and chopped tomatoes from a can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can actually see what goes in and see the final product
and say I made it,'' Ben says. ``Instead of just throwing something
in the microwave you can actually make something that looks and
tastes pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Martell, 11, has been watching her grandmother cook for
as long as she can remember. She rolls meatballs with ``Nana'' and
helps bake. She looks through cookbooks and watches cooking shows
on television and dreams of becoming a chef. Often, before her
mother, Kathleen, comes home from her job as a municipal clerk,
Ashley makes a salad. She chops tomatoes and cucumbers and tosses
them with the pre-cut, pre-washed lettuce her mom buys to make the
task easier for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She comes home from a hard day at work,'' Ashley says, ``and I
just feel bad sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she helps her mother prepare the rest of dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a single parent, so she's a big help,'' says Kathleen
Martell, 39. ``It's a time where it's teaching her responsibility
for later life. And it's quality time, you know. Just that we're
together like that, mother and daughter. We can talk about the day
while we're doing this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people are also finding their way around the food aisles.
Teen Research finds 52 percent of teens help with the family
grocery shopping, up from 39 percent in 1995. Yankelovich finds 22
percent of youths ages 9-17 shop for groceries, up from 8 percent
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making brand decisions for products that aren't
necessarily teen specific,'' says Teen Research vice president
Michael Wood. ``Mom makes a list. She writes down mayonnaise. She
doesn't write Hellman's. Do they go with what Mom usually buys? Do
they go with what they see in the store? What they see in their
friends' homes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the main trip, teens are not doing that,''
says Pillsbury's Cullen. ``They're helping with a lot of fill-ins.
They are becoming more involved.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marianne Maguire, the 13-year-old, accompanies her mother
to the supermarket, she'll hit one aisle and her mom another.
``Sometimes,'' says Marianne, ``I can get stuff that I want. Stuff
she wouldn't usually buy, like Doritos.''
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Manon, 16, has taken over much of her family's grocery
shopping. The reason? She's been a vegan for almost a year and her
mother tired of reading labels to make sure food had no meat, egg,
or dairy ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   And once every week or two, Miriam cooks dinner, often a
stir-fry of tofu and vegetables, for her mother and, if she's home
from college, her older sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like cooking a lot,'' Miriam says. ``It's fun to
experiment with different things. It's satisfying.''

UNTAMED WYOMING PACKS KAYAKING THRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD KINDLEBERGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGER TETON NATIONAL FOREST, Wyo. _ Swollen by a late-spring
thaw, the Upper New Fork River roared past us as my companions
prepared to launch their kayaks on what they said would be the
first descent ever of the cascading waterway.
</P>
<P>
   They rated the run a Class 6, as challenging as they come, and
it was easy to see why. Water crashed through the narrow gaps in
the steep, rocky gorge with an awesome ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   When we came on a 12-foot waterfall 5 miles from the trail head,
it appeared to this nonkayaker virtually to rule out the attempt.
But a particularly tricky patch closer to the start of the descent,
farther up river, presented an even bigger challenge, a member of
the group told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's objectively more dangerous,'' said photographer Greg Von
Doersten. ``It's an undercut rock. They call it the squeeze box.
There's a snag (a stuck log) in front of it that makes it more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days in the untamed state of Wyoming gave this greenhorn a
pack of thrills. My encounter with extreme kayaking _ strictly as a
witness, to be sure _ was only the most dramatic of them. Besides
high adventure, I enjoyed beautiful scenery, a glimpse into the
history of the westward expansion, and a visit to an old-fashioned
cattle ranch.
</P>
<P>
   From Rock Springs, in the southwest corner of the state, I drove
with my hosts into the desert late one fine summer day. Our
directions sounded too cute to be useful: Make a right at the
Continental Divide and turn left on the Oregon Trail.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what we did. We went right at a sign marking
the imaginary line separating the eastern and western slopes of the
Rocky Mountains. Following a dirt road, with the snow-capped Wind
River Range ahead, we then made a left at a marker for the Oregon
Trail. The pioneers, pointing toward 7,550-foot South Pass over the
Rockies a few miles west, had trudged through a century and a half
before on their way west.
</P>
<P>
   With the sun sinking in the western sky, we arrived at a
one-room cabin where Mary Hay, a rare woman in a mostly male field,
has her ranch. Her 1,000 head of cows and calves graze freely on
400 square miles of public and private land during the summer. In
the fall, she and a few hired hands mount their horses to drive the
herd 50 miles south to a winter feeding station.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 percent of the nation's beef is still raised on public
land, according to Hay, and pressure is growing to end the practice
because of concerns about overgrazing. If cattle drives fade away,
so too will a big part of the romance of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Hay's cabin, which recently got telephone service but
still lacks electricity, the scene was idyllic. The Sweetwater
River flowed lazily by, snow-covered mountains loomed on the
horizon, and a herd of sheep, apparently escaped from another
ranch, grazed nearby. Two sage chickens, similar to pheasants, took
flight with a swoosh. As we drove back to Rock Springs after
dinner, with darkness creeping in, an antelope with twin fawns
close behind darted away off the edge of the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming markets itself as ``like no place on earth,'' and the
slogan seems apt. Its population of 480,000, the nation's smallest,
occupies a vast area. Sweetwater County, the home of Rock Springs,
is larger than all of Massachusetts. Driving across the bottom of
Wyoming on Interstate 80 takes you through high desert that is
eerily desolate and beautiful, if less dramatic than the Colorado
mountain resorts like Breckenridge and Steamboat Springs I had
passed through on my way.
</P>
<P>
   One day on a less traveled, two-lane road, with hardly a car in
view as I drove down a long hill, the horizon seemed to dip in
front of me. It seemed that if the landscape were to tilt just a
bit further I might slide off the edge of the earth. I could almost
imagine I were the last creature alive.
</P>
<P>
   I did not get as far north as Jackson Hole and Yellowstone
National Park. Some in Wyoming would say that was just as well,
since those well-known destinations, with their dramatic and
compelling attractions, draw much heavier crowds. The glitzy scene
in Jackson Hole, with its ever higher real estate prices, is not
the image of their solitary state most prized by Wyoming residents.
</P>
<P>
   My generous hosts in Rock Springs, John and Katharine Collins,
made possible my visit to Mary Hay's ranch and enabled me to
witness the hair-raising white-water river run undertaken by their
son Dave and his buddies, all professional kayakers. That descent
was successful, by the way, even if one kayaker had to right his
boat quickly after rolling over in churning waters, and Dave's
kayak crashed into a rock and he sprained an ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Personal contacts are not needed to enjoy the sky and the
mountains, or the national parks and wilderness areas. Approaching
the Wind River Range from the south takes you through Pinedale,
population 1,181, where there are motels and outfitters to serve
people heading into the mountains. Cabins, campgrounds, and dude
ranches are available closer in.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Colorado, with 56 peaks over 14,000 feet, Wyoming is
altitudinally challenged. Its highest mountain, 13,804-foot Gannett
Peak, can't match Colorado for elevation.
</P>
<P>
   But Gannett, 30 miles north of Pinedale in the Bridger Teton
National Forest, puts Wyoming in the thick of things when it comes
to bragging rights. Colorado's tallest, 14,433-foot Mount Elbert,
can be scaled with a relatively undemanding six-hour hike. To
conquer Gannett, Dave Collins told me, you start by backpacking
through 15 miles of wilderness. After camping, you still have to
climb 6,000 vertical feet, mostly over glacier, the next day.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer my adventures light. Like the day I hiked around the
lower Green River Lake. Beautiful mountain views alternated with
shimmering lake vistas. But even this tame outing carried a hint of
danger. A sign said I was entering a grizzly bear area and
``special rules apply.'' Had the need arisen, I was ready with my
own, maybe not-so-special rule: Run like hell.

IN SANTA FE, MIXING FIRE AND LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE _ She's got to have it.
</P>
<P>
   Hot! Hot! Hot!
</P>
<P>
   My friend, Aurelio, can't help herself. She lusts for hot,
hotter, hottest chili peppers, a habit she picked up as a child and
cannot shake. Not that she'd want to, as long as she can sneak into
Mudville (a.k.a. Santa Fe) for an annual weeklong fix. Addiction
amid the adobes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she's lived in Boston a couple of decades or so,
Aurelio is a shameless New Mexican defector. Raised on the dusty
rose soil of a hardscrabble ranch in outskirting Tesuque, riding
bareback and bathing in the creek, she was nurtured on
home-squeezed goat's milk and torrid chili.
</P>
<P>
   When the estimable Leo Romero, out of Guadalajara, introduced
fine Mexican cuisine to Boston at Casa Romero some time ago,
Aurelio tried to nominate him for a presidential medal.
</P>
<P>
   But mention TexMex, MexMex, or NewMex to me, a guy wary of such
gastrointestinal depth bombs, and the medal I think of is the
Purple Heart. I always thought that chili was a temperature below
32, a South American country, or a Yankee outfielder last-named
Davis. Until I met Aurelio. Now I know about red chili and green
chili. Maybe even black and blue, gray, orange, rainbow and plaid
varieties exist for the afflicted, the chili abusers.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably there is something to do in Santa Fe besides eat at
the Guadalupe Cafe, where the congenial boss lady-chef Isabelle
Moomea caters to salivating junkies like Aurelio and her brother,
Ford, with blue corn cheese enchiladas splattered in red and green
chili (Christmas, as the natives call it), a fried egg over easy,
and ``posole'' (hominy stew).
</P>
<P>
   I will say this for Isabelle: She is the sorceress of
sopapillas, delicately deep-fried and hollow minicushions of dough,
generally eaten with honey. Not, thankfully, chili. Yum. Although,
gulp, they can be filled with chili.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there are other attractions,'' frowns Aurelio,
meanwhile burrowing into pork tamales, chili rellenos and carne
asada, and trying to think of a couple. ``Santa Fe has more
splendid museums and art galleries per capita than anywhere else.
Even the state Capitol building is a repository of art _ New
Mexican paintings, sculpture, and Indian weaving. There's
world-class shopping, and . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   I don't wear Indian jewelry, I remind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the only item. And there's ballet, dude ranches,
skiing, spas, theater, a chamber music festival, and probably the
most renowned attraction internationally, the Santa Fe Opera . . .
.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the best of all _ and it's free _ is the daily cloud
show.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right about that. New Mexico may lead the planet in
celestial art. Billowing, pillowing, jutting, scudding across the
endless overhead stage these continuously distinctive clouds are
magnificent showoffs. They are splashed and sculpted, monsters and
miniatures, soothing and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Ever captivating, constantly changing are formations that run
from simple to phantasmagorical. Since this sky is a 360-degree
vision, you're scanning heavenly blue here, a thunderstorm over
there, a mysterious shroud somewhere else, hills balancing walled
towns in another place. This is a full-service ceiling, a
channel-switch every time you look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the reason so many painters have come here. The light,''
Aurelio says. ``Ah, the light. The clarity. No pollution. You can
see the layers and layers of mountains. It reminds me of Tibet _
but that was a long time ago. Who knows what the Chinese have done
to mess up that sky?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the adoptive painters who felt, ``New Mexico is my
place,'' was the determined, willful Georgia O'Keeffe. Although her
mother had said, disapprovingly, ``Painting is one of Georgia's
crazy notions,'' she worked and produced her fascinating canvases
almost to the end of her 99 years.
</P>
<P>
   Her output, so tremendous and compelling, called for a public
building devoted to the hanging of it. And it materialized, the
outgrowth of an idea of Ann Marion, seconded by her husband, John.
Bulwarked by the donation of the Marions' sizable O'Keeffe
collection, the handsome Georgia O'Keeffe Museum opened in downtown
Santa Fe two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe, of course. ``Here's more mud in your eyes!'' was probably
the architectural cry, and it came out just splendidly with
comfortable, airy galleries, and a sculpture courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it would be a success,'' says George King, the
director of the world's only museum devoted to the creations of one
woman. ``O'Keeffe really grabs people. But we've been overwhelmed
by the response.'' Best time to avoid lines is late afternoon, says
a townie.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio remembers that, as a child, she met O'Keeffe, an
acquaintance of her parents, and they dug for dinosaur bones
together at Ghost Ranch near the painter's place in Abiquiu,
northwest of Santa Fe in an area where such fossils have been
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was strong and striking, like her work.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronger than chili?
</P>
<P>
   ``A dead heat with jalapeno.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of those huge, powerful O'Keeffe flowers have been
assembled for the current show, ``The Poetry of Things,'' that runs
into October.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe explained, ``I painted a flower big so you'd have to
look at it. Nobody looks at a life-sized painting.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm magnetized by them. But as I wander through the rooms I
can't help feeling that those gargantuan black and purple petunias,
black larkspur, reddish-orange poppies, black iris, blood-red
canna, blue jacks-in-the-pulpit, and creamy jimson weeds are
looking at me. Hungrily?
</P>
<P>
   I stay near the center of the room, warily, not getting too
close. Could they devour a passerby in their sensual but ominous
swirls and whorls? On another wall is the ethereal ``Ladder to the
Moon.'' Maybe it's there to climb, to escape O'Keeffe's
dangerous-looking garden?
</P>
<P>
   Adjoining the new, stunning Gerald Peters Gallery is a restful
garden with rocky waterfall and fish pond. Its occupants at the
moment are the amusing animals sculpted by the French couple,
Claude and Francois-Xavier Lalanne, that we last saw at the
Bagatelle Garden in Paris. Massive ducks, a tyrannosaurus with
ivy-clad body, a see-through fish, and a herd of
black-faced-and-horned sheep are among their creations holidaying
in a foreign land.
</P>
<P>
   The Lalannes are more fun but not as well known as Alexander
Calder, the man of hanging knicknacks called mobiles. One such
droops from a Peters ceiling, and if you have to ask the price, you
can't afford it. I ask anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six-hundred-fifty thousand dollars,'' responds a cordial
galleryman, Brady Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A steal,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way we'd get it,'' says Aurelio.
</P>
<P>
   Small and choice is the Wheelwright Museum of the American
Indian, founded by Bostonian Mary Cabot Wheelwright in 1937, a
response to her friendship with Navajo medicine man Hosteen Klah. A
wonderful eyeful therein, the show ``Clay People'' that stays until
November, is a cast of whimsical, satirical, and bizarre figures by
unknown potters from nearby Cochiti and Tesuque pueblos.
</P>
<P>
   These characters _ Anglos, Indians, and Mexicans _ are out of
the last decades of the 19th century. Gone with them is this style,
but contemporary pueblo dwellers Virgil Ortiz, Roxanne Swentzell,
and Nora Naranjo-Morse (also in the show) are reviving it with
their own updating.
</P>
<P>
   As iron-willed as O'Keeffe, the paint brush lady, is a timeless
Spanish lass-about-town named ``Carmen'' whose art is the brush-off
of admiring males. In fine, flirtatious voice as this year's
flaming ``Carmen'' at the Santa Fe Opera is a young Englishwoman
making her US debut, Sara Fulgoni. She's a wow (wildly,
obstreperously winning) in this, one of five operas of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Also winning, as always, is the setting for this
sort-of-ampitheater that dates back to 1957. It used to be that
your parade of Traviatas, Aidas, Fausts, Manons et al. could get
you rained on. Now the audience is entirely roofed, but the
panorama of the Jemez Mountains fading into dusk to the
accompaniment of stars is intact because the building remains open
on either side.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Dipper moves into view just as Don Jose dips his knife
into Carmen, a jalapeno-tempered honey if there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did he have to do that?'' I groan, knowing it means the
end of a marvelous evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' says Aurelio, ``because she wouldn't share her
chili peppers.''
</P>

BROKER `DEALS' NOT ALWAYS DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet may not always be the place to go for good deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discount buyer, beware'' _ that's the rousing cry from the
August issue of Consumer Reports Travel Letter on finding a great
buy on a hotel room on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel brokers, the increasingly popular discount outlets for
finding lodging, aren't consistently producing the bargains on the
Internet they're advertising or promoting, said Consumer Reports.
In a survey of room rates, the newsletter called brokers and hotels
directly to obtain more than 100 room quotes. They discovered that
nearly one out of three ``discount'' quotes were as much as 40
percent higher than the price quoted from the hotel's reservation
office.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers that fared well included 1-800-USA-Hotels, which
matched, exceeded, or improved on hotel rates. Central Reservation
Service offered savings or matched a hotel's quotes, while Quikbook
was the only one of the five surveyed that yielded savings in
virtually every case.
</P>
<P>
   The travel letter noted that unwary consumers could also get hit
with cancellation and booking fees, and should know that hotels
dictate the rates. They are at liberty to swiftly lower rates for
certain nights, and often make these changes without notification
to brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter advises travelers to avoid brokers that charge
fees, to check out a hotel's accommodations and offerings before
booking, ask about local taxes and surcharges, double-check
availability with a hotel to be sure a broker's ``nothing
available'' words are legitimate, find out if you need to pay in
advance or at checkout, and ask about cancellation fees.
</P>
<P>
   Every month Consumer Reports Travel Letter is filled with
information, from finding good deals to surveys such as the hotel
report. Subscriptions are $39 for one year; single copies of back
issues are $5. To subscribe, call 800-234-1970.

   The New World Festival, held for the last seven years in
Randolph, Vt., on Labor Day, celebrates village life as much as it
does the spirited Celtic and French-American music and dance that
are the musical focus. Seven years ago, Randolph was hit with three
fires in its downtown. The festival became part of a remarkable
rebirth for the downtown, which is listed on the National Register
of Historic Sites. There will be music, food and drink, crafts, and
a lot more. The festival runs from noon to 11 p.m.

   The first exhibition to explore the transformative power of air
conditioning, ``Stay Cool! Air Conditioning in America,'' is on
view through Jan. 2 at the National Building Museum in Washington.
Through photos, artifacts, television commercials, and interactive
displays, the exhibit will explore the history of ``air
conditioning,'' beginning with pioneering experiments in the late
1800s. Manufacturers at the turn of the century were learning that
by filtering air and stabilizing temperature, mechanical systems
improved the environment for products . . . and people.

ADDICTS GIVE UP FERTILITY FOR $200 EACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Signaling an expansion into New England, three New Hampshire
women have participated in a controversial California-based
cash-for-sterlization program for drug-addicted women which has
already set up shop in California and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity, also known as CRACK,
attempts to curb the births of impaired or damaged babies by
offering female addicts $200 cash if they are willing to have a
tubal ligation, or submit to long-term contraceptives such as
Norplant.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Harris, the founder of CRACK, said her nonprofit program
is the key to ending the cycle of drug-addicted women bearing
damaged children they are not able to care for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe birth control is a solution to the problem of
drug-addicted babies,'' said Harris. The controversy over her
method, she said, misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to make it an issue about women'' while ignoring
the thousands of children born with emotional and physical problems
stemming from their mother's drug use, Harris said. The battle over
reproductive rights, she added, ``has already been fought at the
cost of billions of dollars. Nobody seems to be doing anything
about the children.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics contend CRACK is a thinly veiled way of coercing
women they see as unfit to give up their personal right to bear
children. And they note that some of her funding has come from
high-profile social conservatives, including radio psychiatrist Dr.
Laura Schlessinger.
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, chairman of health law at Boston University School
of Public Health, said the program echoes a dark period in American
history when the government passed laws to sterilize mentally ill
patients, sometimes forcibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state of California was doing this then people would be
beside themselves,'' Annas said. ``But because a private nonprofit
organization is doing this, then it doesn't seem quite as scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see Harris' large number of supporters as a reflection of
the nation's desperate effort to punish or at least stem, by
whatever means available, the number of pregnant women who use
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, the medical community estimates that 1 percent of the
children born in the country are exposed to cocaine. At least 21
states have used specific court cases to try and punish women for
using drugs while pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly every case, those efforts have failed, but South
Carolina is a notable exception. In 1997, the state's Supreme Court
ruled that a woman who uses drugs while pregnant is guilty of child
abuse under state law.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to starting CRACK, Harris tried, but failed, to get the
California Legislature to pass a law that would send a woman to
prison for bearing a cocaine or drug-addicted child.
</P>
<P>
   A Stanton, Calif., resident, Harris' crusade began after she
adopted four children from the same crack-addicted mother a decade
ago. She was touched by the chance to nurture the children who had
already been through so much but was angered that the mother was
allowed to continue having children.
</P>
<P>
   After losing a yearlong battle that would make it illegal to
give birth to a drug-addicted baby, she started a program that paid
women to choose birth control instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money has always enticed people to do things,'' said Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, women call in, then make an appointment to
have the birth control or sterilization procedure. For most women,
the procedure is covered by either health insurance or Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   CRACK participants must present a doctor's letter confirming
they've had the procedure before they can receive the cash.
Sterilization and long-term birth control are the only options for
participating women; Harris said CRACK won't pay for birth-control
pills.
</P>
<P>
   Since the program begin nearly two years ago in Anaheim, Calif.,
Harris said, 61 women have participated. Of that number, 41 opted
for tubal ligation. Those women in the program, she added, have had
a total of 400 pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who is white, has been criticized for setting up large,
eye-popping billboards advertising the program in minority
neighborhoods in St. Paul, Chicago and Florida. She has said that
the publicity makes the donations go up _ but so does the criticism
from women's rights groups and social libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have to say we have some concerns about it,'' said Pam
Nourse, spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood League of
Massachusetts. ``We certainly stand for a woman's right to chose
her own course of reproductive future but when offering a financial
inducement it crosses that line of being a little coercive, and
that is something that we do have many concerns about.''
</P>
<P>
   Annas said critics say the campaign raises an ethical conflict:
women are being enticed by a short-term reward and blinded by the
longer-term effects of sterilization or even Norplants which can be
surgically removed.
</P>
<P>
   But since her program began, Harris said, she has received
hundreds of calls and e-mails from people interested in starting
their own local programs, such as a group of nurses from Rhode
Island, or drug-addicted women who want to participate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lakes Region of New Hampshire, a mother of four joined
the program and was paid $200 for a tubal ligation, Harris said.
But she also got an extra $50 for referring other women to the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the referral fee as a form of advertisement since drug
addicts know other drug addicts,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Though she has already opened a chapter in Chicago and plans to
open one in Seattle and Florida, Harris said she has no immediate
plans to further expand the campaign into Massachusetts and the
rest of New England _ unless enough people request it.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no shortage of callers or donors, she said. The
campaign has received $150,000, from liberals as well as
conservatives, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Brianne Fitzgerald, a Boston substance abuse treatment nurse,
said that Harris' campaign has problems, but should be examined
with an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   Communities as well as the health and criminal justice systems
should come together and investigate whether alternative measures
such as CRACK can replace foster care and social service programs,
which can't seem to curb the rising problem of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crack is a very very bad drug,'' said Fitzgerald. ``Women
addicted to crack are almost incapable of taking care of anything
but the need to smoke crack.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she questions if dangling $200 before an addicted woman
induces a mother rather than allows her to chose her own fate.
``There are no easy answers,'' she said.

GOURMANDS OUT IN THE COLD AS INN OWNERS, CHEF SPAT

<P>
   OLD CHATHAM, N.Y. _ Among the hundreds of upscale inns in the
hills of Western Massachusetts and New York, the Old Chatham
Sheepherding Company Inn glimmered.
</P>
<P>
   There was harmony at the four-year-old inn, guests like to say,
and there was success, including raves about the inn's ambiance.
Chef Melissa Kelly, who was named best chef in the Northeast last
year by the prestigious James Beard Foundation, appeared in
magazines from Food &AMP; Wine to Conde Nast Traveler. Martha Stewart
came to learn how to make sheep cheese, and Europeans began booking
rooms when the inn gained membership in the luxury hotel
association Relais &AMP; Chateaux.
</P>
<P>
   For wealthy New Yorkers and Bostonians for whom even a
$550-per-night suite rate mattered less than the satisfaction of
having a meal that could be considered the finest in the country,
the Old Chatham Sheepherding Company Inn was a treat to reserve
months in advance, a name to drop at important dinner parties, and
a secret to share with trusted friends and business colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a week ago, at the height of the summer season, the
inn closed.
</P>
<P>
   Owners Tom and Nancy Clark issued a brief press release
apologizing to staff and guests, some of whom had waited four
months for a dinner reservation. While the farm will continue
making cheese and yogurt to sell to upscale groceries, the future
of the 14-room inn is unknown. Tables are set in the dining room,
cobalt-blue goblets glistening on white table clothes. Neutrogena
soaps rest in claw-footed bathtubs, awaiting guests who may never
check in.
</P>
<P>
   A simmering battle for control of the kitchen between the Clarks
and the chef and her fiance, pastry chef Price Kushner, apparently
reached crisis in a dispute over a cook's resignation last week.
Kelly had given notice in July that she and Kushner would be
leaving in mid-September to open their own restaurant. Both parties
give different accounts of whether Kelly quit or the restaurant was
closed by the Clarks. Regardless, Kelly and Kushner's departure was
hastened.
</P>
<P>
   Among stunned residents of Old Chatham, where the inn's
international reputation was a source of local pride, the
relationship between the two couples immediately became a source of
gossip and confusion. In the growing world of luxury-dining
enthusiasts, there were only questions: Will the Clarks ever be
able to reclaim their inn's reputation? Will Kelly and Kushner's
new restaurant in Maine supplant the Old Chatham Inn as a
destination?
</P>
<P>
   Some would-be gourmands are disappointed, others are angry, and
all are perplexed. Owning and managing a country inn is everyman's
dream, many locals and visitors say. The Clarks had no money
worries. The couple had just finished two new guest rooms last
spring. People magazine had a feature planned.
</P>
<P>
   So why couldn't the Clarks and Kelly put aside their differences
for the larger purpose of creating the finest food and inn in the
region?
</P>
<P>
   Neither couple would speak about the final dispute that ruptured
their relationship, but both used mournful tones when speaking of
the inn.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Clark said she ``put her heart and soul into'' making the
OldChatham Inn the finest in the country and was ``devasated.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Kelly declared: ``It was a magical time, and we had a
lot of good ingredients. But it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   But to those who are most familiar with the world of
ultra-expensive bed-and-breakfasts, a market that has grown almost
at the pace of the stock market, the demise of the Chatham is less
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason may lie in the increasingly stressful job of
managing and maintaining a top luxury inn, say analysts and those
in the industry. Sophisticated guests expect top-notch service,
decor and food like never before. If an attraction like Kelly is
missing from a stellar inn, many say there is only one way to go:
down. Close when your reputation is still intact, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are only as good as the last meal you served or the last
guest that stayed; your reputation is on the line every night,''
said Laurence Bongiorno, owner of the White Barn Inn in
Kennebunkport, one of only 40 Relais &AMP; Chateaux members in the
United States. ``People come to a luxury inn, and they expect to be
pampered. It's the small details that get noticed. It takes great
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The Old Chatham Inn's success may also have been tied too
closely to Kelly. Kelly's meals became the inn's signature, some
industry analysts say. When she left, the inn was bound to lose a
piece of prestige, those analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems they built the concept around an individual,'' said
Thomas Wright, vice president of culinary education and former dean
of the school of culinary arts at Johnson &AMP; Wales University in
Rhode Island. ``But there are ways to ensure your ability to
outlive a chef.''
</P>
<P>
   It was never Tom and Nancy Clark's plan to open an inn. After
making a fortune with his Greenwich, Conn., investment firm, Tom
Clark wanted to start a sheep farm, a throwback to his childhood
when he took care of a few sheep on his grandfather's farm near
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. The couple bought the farm of John S. Williams,
a well-known Shaker collector, and began sheepherding operations,
now the largest sheep dairy farm in the country, with some 1,000
animals.
</P>
<P>
   A trustee at Cornell University, Tom Clark commissioned students
there to conduct a study of whether a luxury inn would be viable in
Old Chatham, a rural town some 15 miles from the Massachusetts
border filled with second homeowners from New York. The answer was
yes.
</P>
<P>
   An interior decorator, Nancy Clark scoured upstate New York
antique shops for furnishings. Rooms were decorated with
watercolors she had painted and whimsical touches like a red
clawfoot bathtub. Meanwhile, the Clarks found Kelly, who had
graduated at the top of her class from the Culinary Institute of
America and worked with some of the best-known chefs in the
Northeast. The farm prospered; 94 staff members took care of the
farm and 14 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was perfect,'' exulted Gayle Angsto of Newton, who stayed
at the inn last year and who was visiting friends in the area last
week. ``No matter what you wanted, it was there. I remember feeling
so cozy; they really made an effort. And the food was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Every night, the menu would read like a page from Gourmet
magazine: foie gras with a fig compote, venison prosciutto,
farm-fresh Camembert. The suites were luxuriosly elegant, with an
accent of Shaker simplicity. Next to four-poster beds, quarried
stone fireplaces reached to cathedral ceilings. Outside, verandas
overlooked sheep-grazing hills. Families could rent a renovated
farmhouse for $800 a night.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of international luxury dining, the restaurant
kept its prices down. Dinner with wine cost about $110 to $150 for
two _ reasonable enough for some in the surrounding area to enjoy a
birthday or anniversary celebration there. Everyone in Old Chatham
_ a village comprising little more than a general store and Post
Office _ knew someone who worked at the inn. Now, most know someone
who is out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really put Columbia County on the map,'' said Stephen
Kinglsey of Hudson Michael Realty. He has mentioned the inn and
restaurant in New York Times ads he placed to sell nearby property.
``It's definitely a setback for the area,'' Kingsley said. ``People
came from all over for that restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   But success came at a price. Tensions grew between Kelly and the
Clarks, many say. Kelly, a co-manager of the property, didn't want
interference in her kitchen. But the Clarks wanted their say.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Kelly and Kushner announced they would leave at the
end of the year to open their own restaurant. Tension continued to
mount, and Kelly and Kushner told the Clarks in July they would be
leaving at the end of August. They later agreed to stay until Sept.
15. And then came the quarrel over the cook.
</P>
<P>
   The Clarks say they were interviewing other chefs. But after the
fight, ``the decision to close the inn was made quickly,'' Nancy
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   With Kelly gone, ``getting the inn to that point again will take
a lot of work and effort, and we are not sure we want to do that
again,'' Nancy Clark said. ``Even though you hire managers, this
job consumes you 28 hours a day, nine days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Clarks don't have immediate plans for the inn and
have not ruled out reopening or living on the property. Tom Clark
said there are no plans to sell or lease the inn. Earlier this
week, staff members washed down walls and cleaned curtains to
preserve the guest rooms and property.
</P>
<P>
   Behind their worry was a curious pride: For its brief life, the
Old Chatham Sheepherding Inn had succeeded in doing something well
_ producing a world-class meal and setting for a parade of
discerning gourmands _ and the thrill of that accomplishment seemed
reason enough to hold one's chin high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all sad,'' said Kathy Eil, at the Old Chatham Country
Store. ``But if you gotta go, why not go out on top like Michael
Jordan?''

Y2K CELEBRATIONS: BIG, LITTLE AND NO BUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To some, Jan. 1, 2000, is the start of the False Millennium.
That's because 2000 is really the final year of this millennium.
(When you count to 2,000, you don't stop at 1,999, do you?) That
technicality, however, isn't going to stop people from whooping it
up this Dec. 31, and there are plenty of activities to choose from.
Some of them cost nothing, some a little, and some a lot. Here's a
tiny sampling:
</P>
<P>
   --Let's start at the top. A 16-day ultra-deluxe journey will
culminate in a New Year's Eve black-tie celebration atop the world
in the Himalayas. Also included are three nights in a private
bungalow in Pokhara Village overlooking the foothills of the
Annapurna Range; first- and business-class flights; luxury suites,
including two nights in Katmandu; a hot-air balloon or airplane
flight over Mount Everest; and a full-day desert safari in Dubai.
The trips will take place Dec. 26-Jan. 9 or Dec. 28-Jan. 11. Only
10 couples can go, and the price is $26,000 per person, double
occupancy. For information, call World Travel Consultants at
800-432-7436 or e-mail wtcinc(at)juno.com.
</P>
<P>
   --Philadelphia plans a 24-hour celebration beginning at 7 a.m.,
Dec. 31. Each hour, one of 24 clocks inside the Pennsylvania
Convention Center, representing time zones around the world, will
strike midnight. Confetti will float to the ground, and music and
fanfare will feature a country in that time zone, where the
calendar is actually turning to 2000. For more information, call
the Philadelphia Visitors Center at 800-537-7676 or 215-636-1666,
or, on the Web, visit http://millennium.philadelphia.org/.
</P>
<P>
   --The Stonehedge Inn, a European-style country manor in
Tyngsborough, plans a three-day extravaganza beginning Dec. 31,
when guests will toast the millennium with Crystal Champagne,
Methusaleh Bottle Number 1,078, 1990 vintage. (There are only 2,000
bottles of this bubbly in the world.) Throughout, there will be
lavish dinners and buffets _ and sleigh rides, too. Prices begin at
$4,250, double occupancy, including tax and tips. For more
information, call Crystal McKiel at 978-649-4400. For more
information about the inn, visit www.stonehedgeinn.com.
</P>
<P>
   --Boston's original First Night will be a three-day festival,
Dec. 31-Jan. 2. More than 3 million people are expected to join in.
Among attractions: large-scale arts projects, dance, music,
parades, parties, and fireworks. For information on First Night
hotel packages, ranging from budget to luxury, call the Greater
Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau at 888-SEE-BOSTON.
</P>
<P>
   --And then there's Times Square, where one thing is certain: Ed
Woodyard of Westchester County, N.Y., isn't going to miss seeing
the famed ball fall to usher in 2000. Woodyard booked a suite at
the New York Marriott Marquis, with a view overlooking the square,
16 years ago. That's two years before the hotel was completed. The
Marriott people were so impressed that they're picking up his tab. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of Y2K: According to one survey, 43 percent of those
who have made no travel plans for New Year's 2000 agree with this
choice on the survey: ``The millennium means nothing to me.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Four states begin and end with the same letter. Name
them. (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: A West Virginia valley that is considered the oldest
geological formation in North America has a river running through
it, making that the continent's oldest river. Its name: New River.
(With thanks to info(at)daytips.com via Mike Schuster of
Foxborough.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Don't confuse your travel agent with God.'' _ Kenneth
R. Morgan, an American writer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Triple treat: When the Portofino Bay Hotel opens in Orlando, Fla.,
next month, it will offer three unique services. The 750-room Loews
hotel, part of the Universal Studios Escape complex, will have
curbside check-in, making a stop at the front desk unnecessary. It
will also have Smart Rooms, which adjust the temperature to the
most comfortable setting, automatically report room malfunctions,
monitor whether a minibar needs replenishing, and alert
housekeeping when the room is vacant. The hotel will have butler
service in 26 of the rooms and suites. &QL; 
 &QL; 
On the menu: The Sea Street Deli at the famed Raffles Hotel in
Singapore offers such treats as Bacon Your Pardon; Lox, Stock &AMP;
Bagel; and Live and Let Liver. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: In Devon, Conn., it's unlawful to walk backward
after sunset. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Traveling the Web: Bella-Online, a new site that calls itself ``the
voice of women on the Web,'' has a travel and leisure section with
topics geared to women and their families, including student,
sport, and adventure travel. Check it out at www.bellaonline.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ghosts, ghosts everywhere: The ``Ghosts &AMP; Graveyards'' trolley tour
described last week isn't the only way to view the weirder side of
Boston. ``The Boston Spirits Walking Tour,'' led by ghost hunter
and storyteller Jim McCabe, visits the city's most infamous
locations. Who knows _ during this 90-minute tour you may even meet
such spirited fellows as Harvey Parker, founder of the Parker House
hotel, still seeing to guests' needs a century after his death.
Participants meet at 7:30 on selected evenings at the Boston Common
Information Center. For the schedule, more information, or
reservations, call 781-235-7149. The cost is $12 for adults and $9
for children under 12 or people in groups of 10 or more. Bus tours
for 10 or more are also conducted to Salem and Marblehead, and
Concord and Groton. The Web site is at

 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, and Ohio.

NEW LIFE FOR SAN FRANCISCO'S SOUTH OF MARKET SECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUIS A. DIIORIO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Foul lines and faultlines, new hotels and
restaurants, and a four-story, 350,000-square-foot entertainment
complex with 15 movie screens are helping turn the once drab
flatlands of SoMa (South of Market Street) into one of California's
hottest properties.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered the other side of town, SoMa and the China Basin
area are filling in a hurry . . . so much so that investors and
entrepreneurs have started looking to the neighboring Potrero
Hills. Cases in point: The Potrero Brewing Co., which opened in
May, took over the space formerly occupied by a Hellman's
Mayonnaise factory and transformed it into a three-level brewpub at
535 Florida St. (near Mariposa). And the ``Double Play,'' opened in
1909 as a watering hole at 2401 16th Street (at Bryant), has been
renovated, reopened, and expanded. Gigi Fiorucci's three-room
restaurant/ bar, kitty-corner from where Seals Stadium once stood
and where Joe DiMaggio began his professional baseball career, is
crammed with sports memorabilia and serves a hearty breakfast and
an Italian menu for lunch. No dinners, but the bar is open till 8
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, long before Bay Area Rapid Transit and the
Moscone Center, when if you headed south of Market and toured the
Anchor Steam Brewery or found the Esprit outlet, you had a great
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' according to one hotel employee, ``there's just so much
to see and do here we find tourists staying more than the usual
week.'' And from our room at the Hotel Argent on Third Street, we
could only marvel at what has been accomplished in the last 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscone Center, built in '81 for major conventions, trade
shows, and fairs, was the catalyst. And now, thanks to the removal
of the Embarcadero Freeway, the waterfront area south of Market
also has taken on new life. Rows of stately palms have been
planted; there's been a boom in restaurant and apartment
development; and Pacific Bell Park, the soon-to-be $319 million
home of the San Francisco Giants at Third and King streets, has
become a reality. A mere pipe dream a few years ago, construction
of the privately financed, 13-acre, 41,000-seat stadium is well
underway and according to Giants spokeswoman Traci Slaughter, it
will be ready in time for the April, 2000 opener.
</P>
<P>
   PacBell Park, if you can imagine it, is but a 15-minute walk
down Third from Market Street. It also can be reached by new Muni
(the city's trolley lines) service, buses, BART, and by ferry from
Marin, Oakland, and Vallejo. A marina is nearby and a CalTrain
depot is a block away.
</P>
<P>
   The park's main entrance will be on King Street where the Giants
will erect a nine-foot statue of Willie Mays making that famous
over-the-shoulder catch of Vic Wertz's fly ball to deep centerfield
at the Polo Grounds in the 1954 Giants-Cleveland World Series.
</P>
<P>
   And with a not-too-high right-field fence at 307 feet down the
line, ``Golden Gate Retrievers'' _ so they tell us with a
not-so-straight face _ will be diving into the bay during the
``Seventh-Inning Fetch'' for home run balls!
</P>
<P>
   (The park's mailing address: Pacific Bell Park, 1 Willie Mays
Plaza, San Francisco, CA 94107.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rooftop happenings &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The development of the stadium is changing the feel of this part
of San Francisco, from the Moscone Center to the bay at China
Basin. New businesses are moving in and businesses that were here
are expanding.
</P>
<P>
   One city official describes it as ``a renaissance in an area
that for years languished as a declining port and warehouse
district in the shadow of double-decker freeways.'' The 1989
earthquake eventually changed the face of the city, clearing
freeways and opening the neighborhood for what will be the nation's
newest vintage ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Yerba Buena, a burgeoning 87-acre urban renewal neighborhood two
blocks south of Market Street, has become home to the Rooftop at
Yerba Buena Gardens, the Esplanade, Yerba Buena Center for the
Arts, the Moscone Center, and the Museum of Modern Art, which
features more than 15,000 works of 20th-century art. In 2000, both
the Jewish and Mexican museums will be opened in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Rooftop, opened last October by the San Francisco
Development Agency as an urban destination for young people and
their families, cleverly covers the top of the Moscone Center along
Fourth, Howard, and Folsom streets. Among its attractions are a new
children's center opened with its flagship attraction, Zeum, a $56
million high-tech arts and production facility for children. The
rooftop also is home to a 12-lane bowling alley and a huge
child-care center with a two-acre interactive play and learning
garden, while its entrance houses a restored 1903 carousel from the
city's former amusement park, Playland-at-the-Beach. And much to my
pleasure, atop the Moscone Center is a 200 x 85 foot ice skating
rink at 750 Folsom St. between Third and Fourth streets. With
towering windows overlooking the San Francisco skyline, it's like
skating outdoors. There are skating schools, youth and adult
Faultline Hockey Leagues, Brian Boitano's youth skate program, a
senior program, pick-up hockey games, hockey workshops, power
skating lessons, and figure skating. It's a marvelous inner-city
facility and open to all. Call 415-777-3727 for additional
information.
</P>
<P>
   Metreon, a Sony Entertainment Center across from the skating
center and carousel, was opened June 16 at Fourth and Mission
streets. It includes 15 state-of-the-art movie theaters, eight
restaurants, the flagship Discovery Channel store: ``Destination
San Francisco,'' and the city's first Sony-IMAX theater with 2-D
and 3-D capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   It took 28 workers using ropes to lift the one-piece IMAX
screen. It weighs 600 pounds, is 80 feet tall and 100 feet wide,
and to project a clear image on the screen, movies must be made on
film three times the size of conventional movie film. ``Everest''
will be one of the first films shown there.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth floor of the Metreon is devoted to the imaginative
world of Maurice Sendak, award-winning author and artist of the
classic children's book ``Where the Wild Things Are.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Down by the Boulevard &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem with eating out in this city is that there are too
many good restaurants to choose from. On our most recent visit we
lunched at Boulevard where the ambience, food, and service were
incredible. It's our new favorite south of Market.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the Ferry Plaza at One Mission (at Steuart), Chef
Nancy Oakes and designer Pat Kuleto have turned the rundown 1889
French-style Audiffred Building into one of the waterfront's
hottest draws. Tables in the back provide a great view of the
harbor and Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its eclectic menu, Boulevard's is noted for its
desserts. Pastry chef Heather Ho, a Boston University hotel and
food administration graduate, boasts: ``No doggie bags with my
desserts.''
</P>
<P>
   Spared from the 1906 earthquake and fire by a quick-thinking
saloonkeeper, Boulevard offers lunch and a bistro menu Monday
through Friday; dinner is served nightly. As for the tale of the
saloonkeeper: Firefighters were about to dynamite the Audiffred to
halt the spread of fire _ until he promised them two quarts of
whiskey apiece and a cart full of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Recently added to the list of new restaurants south of Market
are Momo's at 760 Second St., serving new American fare across from
Pacific Bell Ballpark; Dadio's, at 300 Brannan at Second Street
(South Park), a fairly new hip, happening hangout; and Entros, at
270 Brannan, a bar &AMP; grill-arcade combo that offers food along with
unique mind-challenging games.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to get out of the city for a day or two, take
in Donna and Giovanni Scala's ``Bistro Don Giovanni'' on Highway 29
in Napa. With Tuscan ambience, mouth-watering food and a view
overrlooking the vineyards, it remains one step from heaven (call
707-224-3300). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Need a room? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the continued blossoming of SoMa, business and leisure
travelers need not look too hard for a room. At Third and Howard
streets in the burgeoning culture and commerce zone, the New
York-based Starwood Hotels &AMP; Resorts Worldwide Inc. has opened the
31-story, 423-room W San Francisco Hotel across the street from the
Moscone Convention Center, and next door to the city's Convention &AMP;
Visitors Bureau and Museum of Modern Art. The hotel features rooms
with an emphasis on style and comfort, and ``XYZ,'' an upscale
split-level restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bill Kimpton is at it again. When the sweater-wearing
hotel magnate opened the 236-room Serrano Hotel in the theater
district at 405 Taylor at O'Farrell streets, it was his 15th hotel
in the city. Number 16 will be the secluded 198-room Palomar at
Fourth and Market streets. To be opened Sept. 1, the Palomar will
be on floors 5-9 in the restored and refurbished 1907 landmark
Pacific Place building.
</P>
<P>
   SoMa really hit the jackpot when Four Seasons broke ground at
Market between Third and Fourth streets for its $300 million,
280-room hotel and tower. In addition to 142 luxury condominiums, a
fitness and spa facility and retail and restaurant space are
planned.
</P>

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: Weakness, not hypocrisy, did in Gingrich
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich's political future was cloudy at best
after his resignation as House speaker and congressman. Now it
seems all but over. News of his impending divorce _ his second _
and allegations of a lengthy affair with a 33-year-old
congressional aide have rendered him unelectable to any post
substantial enough to hold his interest.
</P>
<P>
   News of his affair has also exposed Gingrich to charges of
hypocrisy, not to mention a substantial bit of snickering. Some of
that's deserved. The man who decried what he called ``a
multicultural, nihilistic hedonism that is inherently destructive
of a healthy society,'' and who blamed liberals for Woody Allen's
affair with his stepdaughter and for Susan Smith's murder of her
two children, can't expect much sympathy when the chickens come to
roost on his own bedpost.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the most specific and damaging charge of hypocrisy _
that Gingrich was bashing Bill Clinton for immorality even while he
himself carried on with a House employee _ the issue is a little
more complicated. Because even as other Republicans were calling
Clinton everything up to and including rapist, Gingrich largely
refrained. The record of that period instead reveals Gingrich
struggling with a deeply personal dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   As a politician, he needed to criticize Clinton and make the
most of the opportunity the president had given him, if for no
other reason than to satisfy his own conservative supporters. But
as a human being, he could not condemn Clinton without also
condemning himself.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best example of Gingrich's struggle occurred on
April 27, 1998, in a speech before members of GOPAC, the political
action committee that had helped to put Gingrich in the speaker's
chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister-in-law, who is an elementary school teacher, and my
brother drove down with their two children, Kevin and Lauren, to my
daughter's wedding in January right after the scandal broke with
Monica Lewinsky,'' Gingrich told the crowd that night. ``And my
sister-in-law said to me, she was ashamed of the radio news because
she didn't know how to explain to her two children exactly what it
was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'First of all, we don't need to know these things.
There's a level of detail here which is grotesque and demeaning to
every American. We just don't need to know. Let's put it back in
the tabloids. Let's get it off television. Let's get it off
radio.'''
</P>
<P>
   One can only imagine the thoughts rumbling through Gingrich's
head during that conversation. His distaste for delving into the
personal lives of politicians was genuine and longstanding,
predating the Clinton scandal. But he also had to be worried sick
that someday soon, his sister-in-law might turn on the radio and
hear embarrassing details about his own personal life.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the speaker's reticence about Clinton had already
begun to perplex many conservatives. They were wondering out loud
why their favorite attack dog had fallen silent on such a juicy
topic. So in that same GOPAC speech, Gingrich also pledged that ``I
will never again, as long as I am speaker, make a speech without
commenting on (the Lewinsky scandal.)'' He kept that promise for
about a week, and even then he focused on Clinton's disrespect for
the rule of law, not his behavior with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Republican hierarchy, at least some of Gingrich's
colleagues must have understood what was going on; even back then,
rumors were circulating that the speaker was having an affair with
a House aide. But those in the know couldn't exactly explain their
leader's predicament to the Republican rank and file that was
screaming for Clinton's head. And eventually, though Gingrich never
did attack Clinton on personal terms, he did capitulate privately
to those who wanted all-out war against the president.
</P>
<P>
   For example, after release of the salacious Starr report to
Congress, the American public responded with anger at those who
thought such material germane to public debate. Within the
Republican House caucus, some moderate members wanted to withhold
additional supporting material submitted by Starr, which contained
tawdry details about cigars and other matters. Despite his belief
that ``such a level of detail ... is grotesque and demeaning,''
Gingrich caved in to the right, telling the caucus in a closed
meeting that the material would be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Again, just before the November election, Gingrich personally
approved $10 million in TV ads lambasting Clinton for his affair
with Lewinsky. That move also backfired, contributing to Republican
losses in the House and eventually leading to Gingrich's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is, Gingrich had been right. The American public
didn't want its nose rubbed in the dirty details of its president's
personal life, and it came to resent those who insisted on doing
so. If Gingrich had stayed true to his own principles, if he had
resisted those in his party willing to use any means necessary to
destroy Clinton, he could have saved himself, his party and his
country a lot of pain.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich didn't have it in him.
</P>
<P>
   Enslaved by his rhetoric
</P>
<P>
   That weakness fits a pattern that marked Gingrich's entire
career. He had a genius for inflaming and inciting an audience, a
knack born of his ability to ignore the many shades of gray that
make up public policy and cast it instead in stark terms of good
and evil. His audience came to demand that of Gingrich, and he felt
compelled to give them what they wanted. Through GOPAC, he taught
that style to an entire generation of Republican politicians to the
point that it came to define the party in the public's eye.
</P>
<P>
   However, that aggressive style of politics is best suited to
expressing a hard-right ideology that Gingrich in his heart did not
share. He was never a comfortable fit with the far right, and
through his college courses and his books, he even tried to
construct an alternative GOP ideology around the writings of minor
figures such as Peter Drucker, Alvin Toffler and W. Edwards Deming.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, that jury-rigged philosophy never took hold.
The people brought into politics by Gingrich's red-meat speaking
style were motivated by abortion, gun control, anti-environment
sentiment, homophobia, immigration and race relations, issues in
which Gingrich had little real interest or even disagreed with the
coalition that had put him into power.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the true hypocrisy. To gain and keep power,
Gingrich chose to say things that he didn't really believe, and to
say them with apparent heartfelt sincerity. It was a tragic choice
on his part, particularly given his oft-expressed admiration for
people such as Winston Churchill and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill, Reagan and other Gingrich heroes had a strong inner
core. They believed in certain things, and they did not alter those
beliefs even when self-betrayal might have brought them advantage
or saved them pain. That trait defined their greatness. Gingrich
understood that, but he proved incapable of emulating it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he never achieved the greatness he saw as his
destiny.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATHAM, Mass. -- Five years after the collapse of New England's
famed Georges Bank fishing ground, tough fishing restrictions are
beginning to restore the cod and other fish that had been pushed to
near eradication. But even as the fish stage a comeback, scientists
are calling for tighter limits. A new report by federal and state
biologists suggests that fishing for most of the region's major
groundfish may need to be cut further to speed their recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Every new restriction, every new rule, say frustrated fishermen,
is another blow to a dying way of life. Already, fishing
communities from New Bedford to Rockland, Maine, have lost tens of
millions of dollars in fishing income and hundreds of fishing
industry jobs, with more losses expected the longer the limits are
in force.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the end more poignant than among the cod fishermen,
whose quarry brought Europeans to Cape Cod in the first place. From
the halcyon days of the 1980s, when the cod catch was five times
larger than today, cod fishermen have seen 6,000 square miles of
ocean closed to them, and catch limits so low in the Gulf of Maine
that it might as well be closed, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the new rules reached everyone, from the Maine lobsterman to
the New Bedford scalloper. At times, meetings of the New England
Fishery Management Council, which makes the rules, descended into
catcalls and near-fistfights as rough-handed fishermen squared off
against the economists and biologists who had the difficult job of
trying to count the remaining fish and figure out how to save them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, fishermen yielded to limits on what gear they could
use, which fish they could catch, where they could go, and how
often they could go there.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, say regulators, is that fish from the flounder to
the cod were so severely depleted that it will take years to reach
a population that can sustain fishing over the long haul. That
means catching perhaps 20 percent of the available fish each year,
instead of the 60 to 80 percent a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't sitting well with the likes of Bruce Kaminski.
</P>
<P>
   Working his trade some 40 miles southeast of Chatham one day
recently, Kaminski gave a look of disgust as he removed one cod
after another from his hooks and tossed them back into the ocean,
dazed or even dead, and likely to be eaten by the swarm of blue
sharks chasing his boat, Never Enough.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of lean times in the Great South Channel,
Kaminski and other cod fishermen say they are having their best
summer season in a decade, but a new 2,000-pound catch limit is
forcing them to dump part of their haul. On this trip, Kaminski set
fewer lines than usual, and he still gave away 100 pounds of gutted
cod that exceeded the limit rather than throwing them overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is stupid,'' said Kaminski, 43, a stocky, ponytailed man
who has been fishing for 21 years. ``We're just killing fish and
throwing them back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As things do improve, you want to make the case persuasively
to invest in conservation the next five to six years rather than
catching the fish today,'' said Teri Frady, spokeswoman for the
National Marine Fisheries Service in Woods Hole. ``The challenge is
going to be staying the course.''
</P>
<P>
   However, what makes sense on land can look different at sea,
where fishermen often shake their heads in disbelief at the rules
and spend a healthy amount of creative energy trying to get around
them. They particularly despise rules that seem wasteful, such as
the new cod limit. Kaminski's trade organization, the Cape Cod Hook
Fisherman's Association, would rather see fishing grounds
temporarily closed than face limits on the daily catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most bizarre way to come to work I've known in 20
years,'' said Kaminski, standing over the gasping codfish he has
just pulled from the water. He makes no secret that he will
illegally give his surplus fish to other fishermen rather than let
his catch ``feed the sharks.''
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the coast, there are signs of the fishing crisis,
from fishermen learning to be computer programmers in Gloucester to
the scores of groundfishing boats that remain tied up in
picturesque villages, to the dozens of boats that fishermen sold to
the federal government under a program to reduce fishing pressure.
</P>
<P>
   And, though the collapse was years in the making _ the result of
too many fishermen using too much gear to catch fish _ many date
the crisis to August 1994 when the New England Fishery Management
Council announced plans to close some of the hardest-hit fishing
areas. Since that time, the 17-member panel has, with few
exceptions, steadily tightened the limits.
</P>
<P>
   But about 1,700 fishing boats are still catching groundfish,
according to the National Marine Fisheries Service, and these
people, generally the best or most aggressive of the lot, do not
give uy. Kaminski, one of about 20 Cape fishermen who rely
on baited hooks rather than nets, was offered $169,000 from the
federal government for his 40-foot boat _ and he refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I want to make my money any other way,'' said
Kaminski as he steamed through the fog of Chatham's Stage Harbor at
5 a.m., the start of a 17-hour day. His crewman, Mike Woods, 33,
feels the same way: He was all set to run a charter boat for
tourists this year, but he came back to Kaminski's boat instead.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen such as these have weathered hard times, with younger
ones such as Woods dreaming of buying their own boat. Many are
drawn by family or ethnic tradition, but Kaminski and Woods are
first-generation fishermen drawn to the work itself.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Kaminski and Woods were able to fish pretty much as
they pleased as long as they stuck to their little patch of the
ocean in the Great South Channel. As hook fishermen, who are both
less numerous and less damaging to the sea floor than fishermen who
drag nets on the bottom, Woods and Kaminski were among the last
holdouts from heavy regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But that only made it more frustrating when the Fishery
Management Council decided to limit the cod catch. The pair had
recently started having big days when they caught 3,000 pounds of
fish or more, a haul that can bring up to $4,500 for a day's work.
When the 2,000-pound cod limit took effect Aug. 15, they had to
stow some of their gear, and be careful not to catch too many fish.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, though, the cod came in too fast, lured to the
squid dangling from thousands of hooks on Kaminski's long lines.
The deck was quickly covered with dying cod and diluted blood as
Kaminski used a sharp gaff hook to pull in the catch and Woods
gutted each cod with two knife strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, by releasing hooked fish and giving away the gutted
ones, the Never Enough came home with 2,007 pounds of cod and both
fishermen made money. But, they said, this is probably just the
beginning of cutbacks in the cod catch that could force Kaminski to
lay off Woods, the father of two young children, or tie up the boat
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't done screwing with us. This is just the
beginning,'' said Kaminski.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the New England Fishery Management Council has made no
decision on what to do next, and it released a report earlier this
month that highlighted improvements in fish populations over the
last five years, such as a 45 percent increase in Georges Bank cod
and the complete recovery of witch flounder. Some fish, it said,
could even be fished more heavily.
</P>
<P>
   But the same report, compiled by a group of federal and state
biologists called the Northern Demersal Working Group, showed that
New England fishing is up to a decade from full recovery as six of
the 11 main groundfishing stocks remain at less than 50 percent of
recovery levels. Scientists are particularly concerned about cod
because they are producing so few young fish to replace those that
are caught and they are not sure why.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at it as a set of stocks rather than as
individual stocks, then additional restrictions are necessary,''
said Phil Haring, a fishery analyst with the New England Fishery
Management Council. The Northern Demersal Working Group report
suggested that fishing for eight of the 11 groundfish stocks may
need more restrictions to meet the conservation goals in the
federal Sustainable Fisheries Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the once-mighty Atlantic cod is dropping from
American menus. Americans eat 40 percent less cod today than they
did in 1990, according to the National Fisheries Institute,
dropping to sixth most popular seafood behind three species _
shrimp, salmon, and catfish _ that are largely raised in fish
farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we persist with strict conservation measures, (cod) stocks
should continue to increase, and consumption will likely follow,''
said Richard Gutting Jr., vice president of the Fisheries
Institute, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   That is small comfort to Kaminski and Woods, who, like many
fishermen, are convinced that the biologists do not go to sea
enough. ``The fish are back big time and I don't think they realize
it,'' said Kaminski. ``It's a shame because . . . they don't need
to do all this.''

MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They disagree on several major issues, but on one
thing Vice President Al Gore and his Democratic rival former Sen.
Bill Bradley are in accord. They both say the federal government is
too stingy in putting a floor under the nation's lowest wages.
</P>
<P>
   Courting organized labor, Bradley recently endorsed an increase
in the minimum wage, a perennially popular Democratic issue. By
doing so he echoed a theme Gore long ago incorporated in his own
basic stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in fact, is so far ahead of Bradley on this and other
labor-friendly issues that he is the heavy favorite for the
Democratic nomination among AFL-CIO members. Gore already has
several labor endorsements; Bradley has none.
</P>
<P>
   The federal minimum wage that employers must pay kitchen help,
waiters, salespeople, janitors and other workers at the bottom of
the economic ladder is currently $5.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   When the floor was established by the Fair Labor Standards Act
of 1938, it was set at 25 cents an hour. But in those days, 25
cents would buy five cups of coffee, five hot dogs or five rides on
the New York subway. Members of Congress were paid $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the standard has not kept up with inflation. Various
proposals pending in Congress would raise it to $6.15 an hour over
three years or boost it a dollar an hour in annual increments for
several years or provide annual increases up to 4 percent depending
on inflation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton favors the $6.15 pay hike, as does much of the
Democratic Congressional leadership. Labor unions, in a burst of
renewed political energy, are campaigning for it with the slogan
``America needs a raise.'' Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., tried to
attach it to a liability measure favored by the Republicans before
the August Senate recess, but he was procedurally outmaneuvered.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, concerned about the potential impact on
labor-intensive small businesses, have traditionally opposed
minimum wage legislation. In 1996, the last time the wage was
increased, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, vowed to
fight it ``with every fiber in my being.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey lost that battle and may well go down this time too. But
based on past experience, the GOP leadership will manage to pass
plenty of favors for business to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage issue will come up for a vote this fall. More
than two dozen moderate House Republicans, nervous about losing
their narrow majority in the 2000 elections, are inclined to go
along because it could benefit GOP incumbents in swing districts.
The moderates' votes could be enough to pass the legislation in a
House with just 11 more Republicans than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, less worried about losing control, may yet
block it. But it is more likely they will bend it to their own
ends. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., is planning a competing
bill, misleadingly called a ``workers' protection package,'' that
would offer other labor law changes favoring business.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dual-track strategy worked in 1996, when Congress
raised the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 but included in the
legislation $21 billion in tax breaks for business. Workers got
pennies; employers got the pot at the end of the rainbow. Everyone
was briefly happy, but they might as well have been eating Chinese
food. They were all hungry again soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage fight is more symbolic than substantive. But it
does focus national attention on the huge salary gap between
business executives and their lowest-paid employees. And it tends
to push up the wages of those just above that level to keep pay
scales proportionally distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   Once again we will hear the familiar debate over whether a
minimum wage increase will hurt small-business profits, force labor
cutbacks and drive up the unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   After the minimum wage was increased in 1996, however, job
growth appeared unaffected. The current unemployment rate of 4.3
percent is the lowest in almost three decades.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the liberal Economic Policy Institute,
the 1996 increase raised the wages of almost 10 million workers,
about 71 percent of whom were adults and 58 percent of whom were
women. Approximately half worked full-time.
</P>
<P>
   A contradictory survey by the pro-business Employment Policies
Institute, however, contends that only 44 percent worked full-time.
It reports that 37.6 percent affected were young people still
living with parents, who presumably could be tapped for additional
income.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are not drastically far apart, but they demonstrate
that it is easy to selectively highlight those statistics that
support the points you wish to make.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the minimum wage is not a living wage. It must be
supplemented by other federal programs, handouts from relatives,
investments or a second job if the worker's family is not to
starve. But it is politically naive to pretend that a raise
wouldn't send a friendly message for the coming election year.

USAGE FACTS FROM A FICTION WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Angela Thirkell Society, North American Branch, met in
Boston this weekend, so what better time to introduce word-loving
readers to this usage-conscious English novelist?
</P>
<P>
   Not that Thirkell is only for word mavens. Her gentle comedies,
written in the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, will appeal to many readers _
say, those who have dug down to the third tier of Trollope and are
finding ``Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite'' more a chore than a
diversion. (Thirkell is a conscious though modest borrower from
Trollope, setting most of her novels in the 20th-century version of
his fictional Barsetshire County.)
</P>
<P>
   But Thirkell deploys an attentive ear, as well as a sharp eye,
in her pictures of midcentury's shifting mores, and anyone who ever
tsk-tsked over ``12 items or less'' at the supermarket checkout
will find her a kindred soul. Her pet peeve is surely the
pronunciation con-TROV-er-sy, a barbarism she blames on
ill-educated BBC announcers (and one still common on BBC radio).
More than one book has a violent aside on the cultural decline that
would allow such an excrescence.
</P>
<P>
   Thirkell isn't merely a scold, though. Her characters comment on
usage the same way they discuss other conventions _ why the maid
shouldn't knock at the sitting-room door, say. So in ``Wild
Strawberries'' (1934), we learn that a well-bred girl (for so she
would be described) considers the toast ``Cheers'' _ at least on
the lips of her rival _ a ``schoolgirl exclamation.'' A desultory
suitor is alarmed when a woman proposes ``an intelligent discussion
of our present relationship'': the use of relationship for a
romantic involvement is new enough to be noteworthy, and the man
thinks (as his fellows have thought ever since) that ``the word
relationship had a sinister sound.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Private Enterprise'' (1947) the bugaboo is hullo, which,
Thirkell complains, ``is rapidly becoming the Basic English for all
greetings, morning, noon or night.'' A child's nurse tries to beat
it back: ``Say how do you do nicely,'' she urges her young charge.
On the other hand, turfing _ now hospital slang for dumping an
undesirable patient on some other department _ was old news even in
1947, it seems. A character describes the British Museum's
``turfing that delightful couple (a sculpture) out of the Etruscan
room,'' and further research reveals that turfing dates at least to
1888.
</P>
<P>
   Thirkell swings with the times _ there are no flies on her, as
her Mr. Wickham would say _ apologizing all the while for the
locutions she's forced to adopt, like ``the Barchester premiere (as
these things are called) of `Mayflower Madness.' ''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so she's not H.W. Fowler. On the other hand, most usage
books have no romance, and they often fail to explain the social
context of their rules. Fiction can teach things that usage guides
can't, and Thirkell, even half a century later, is a master of the
novelistic language lesson.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Missing' in action
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If a plane or an 18-year-old went missing, asks Paula Gillen,
``aren't they just missing?'' Paul Freeland of Hingham has been
wondering about the phrase too: ``Is it correct? Is it a new
coinage? Where does it come from?''
</P>
<P>
   It comes from England, fairly recently _ a 1944 citation was the
earliest I could find in the OED. And go missing seems not to have
been treated as slang: It appears in a list of similar (and utterly
standard) constructions with go, such as ``suppose he goes lame''
and ``Her cheeks went scarlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Go missing has been catching on gradually, probably by way of
the BBC, which brought us ``at the end of the day'' and the current
``people on the ground'' (the ones who really know what's
happening, as opposed to the official sources). It appeared in the
Globe sparsely in the '80s, a bit more frequently in the '90s _
though the record is 11 citations in a year.
</P>
<P>
   It's an import you're free to adopt or shun, but it's more
accurate than got lost when the speaker doesn't know whether the
missing plane (or woman) is truly lost or merely out of reach. And
it offers a zippier, more focused alternative to disappeared, a
verb that works with everything from rainbows to hamsters to
headaches. Now that we've got it, some of us would miss go missing
if it went missing.

HILARY PRICE DRAWS HUMOR FROM MUNDANE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER BONFANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ As Hilary Price tells it, she acquired
Doxy, a 6-year-old mix of husky and pit bull, in a rather peculiar
way. Her old roommate's boyfriend's ex-girlfriend was looking for a
new home for her dog, and would Price know of a good home? Price
took Doxy in.
</P>
<P>
   Much about Price's life lends itself to funky little stories,
and some end up in the 29-year-old's nationally syndicated comic
strip, ``Rhymes With Orange.'' (Incidentally, orange, as Price is
quick to point out, does not dominate her life. She has red hair,
she drives a red Jeep Wrangler, and she has red lenses on her
sunglasses. The strip's title is merely a little bit of whimsy on
her part. And except for door hinge and the scientific term
sporange, few words easily rhyme with orange.)
</P>
<P>
   A native of Weston, Price earned a bachelor's degree in English
literature from Stanford University. At 25, she became the youngest
woman ever to have a syndicated cartoon strip. Today she is in her
fifth year of a 10-year contract with King Features Syndicate,
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strip represents a perspective not normally seen on the
comics page, of a woman in her 20s and friends of a similar ilk,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhymes with Orange,'' which runs daily in more than 100
newspapers nationwide, including The Boston Globe, avoids
pie-in-the-face comedy in its thought-provoking wit. Price artfully
frolics with topics such as dogs' psyches and human relationships,
and finds humor in more mundane issues such as technology and
business. Most of all, she focuses on the ``tiny little details of
everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   Price found her niche without design. ``I never expected to be a
cartoonist. It didn't fit into the plans,'' she says, which in
college were to work in academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked art class. I drew on the side of my notebook and sent
notes to my friends, like jokes about the class,'' she recalls. ``I
always doodled, but I was never a fine artist. I'm fair to average
when it comes to drawing teacups and still lifes. I see myself more
as a writer than an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Price grew up in Weston reading ``Far Side'' and ``Bloom
County'' comics. She attended Concord Academy, which she describes
as ``funky, fun . . . not buttoned up.''
</P>
<P>
   After high school, ``I catapulted myself across the country for
some unknown reason,'' Price says. She graduated from Stanford in
1992, then settled down in San Francisco, where she lived in the
Mission district for five years. She freelanced as a copywriter at
an advertising agency. ``I wanted to try another avenue for
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   During that time, she published a weekend cartoon called
``Price'' in the San Francisco Chronicle, which inspired her to try
for syndication.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, she decided to return to Massachusetts. ``I really
wanted to move back to New England,'' she says, adding that the
West Coast was a ``great lesson for me. I learned that there are
funny, cool, smart, and active people everywhere, and I can meet
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Price settled down in the central Massachusetts town of
Northampton. She works in the hamlet of Florence, sharing her
office with a painter and a graphic designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work environment is different. It's a pretty funky
office,'' she says of the old brush factory that was converted into
office space and is full of artists.
</P>
<P>
   The strip allows her a flexible schedule. ``Creating a structure
will always be a challenge,'' says Price. ``I'm not the 
get-into-work-at-9-have-a-grilled-cheese-at-noon-and-then-back-to-wo
rk type. I'm much more of a meanderer and late sleeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, however, she works Monday through Friday from about
10 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   She begins her workday by reading all the comics in an
assortment of newspapers. She also regularly checks out the
cartoons in The New Yorker magazine by her hero, Roz Chast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Female cartoonists that are out there making it are few and
far between,'' says Price, calling Chast an inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to create a cartoon, Price turns to any of the 11
notebooks she has filled with ideas. Daily cartoons must be
submitted to the syndicate a month in advance, and the deadline for
Sunday cartoons is five weeks ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the business section of a newspaper yields a wealth of
ideas, because ``they use funny words . . . and talk about the
Internet,'' she says. ``I generally don't get inspiration from
other people writing funny stuff, but from serious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also Doxy and her family, whom Price describes as
``fertile ground.'' Her mother owns an ``environmentally friendly''
gift shop in Weston and her father is retired and lives in
Brookline. Price has an older brother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the strips that come easy. They keep their funniness,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Price draws the strip on tracing paper, outlines it in ink,
writes the script, and then scans it into her computer. When the
cartoons are completed, she sends them via computer to a branch of
King Features Syndicate in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not writing or drawing, she says, ``I want to
entertain and be entertained.'' To relax, she plays soccer, runs,
and does inline skating.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Andrews McMeel published a collection of the
first two years of her work in a book. Within the next year,
``Rhymes With Orange'' will be expanded into a line of greeting
cards.
</P>
<P>
   All of which, to use a favorite word of Price's, is pretty
funky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put pressure on myself or strive to be funky. If it
comes, it's by accident,'' she says. ``I'm not a perpetrator of the
funk.'' Just someone who captures it on paper.

American _ Burger King, Outback, 7-Eleven and Pizza Hut on every

the prop wash. Through the windshield, a landscape from a slower,
simpler time looms on the horizon. But Vieques' fetching appearance
belies its status as a battleground. For decades, Navy pilots have
practiced war on the island's northern tip, dropping tons of
munitions on a deserted zone that in places resembles a moonscape.

HOW TO DEMYSTIFY COUSINS TANGLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is a second cousin twice removed or a first cousin once
removed? I don't understand the cousin structure.
</P>
<P>
   _ N.P., Trophy Club, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: If you are not removed from a cousin, you have the same
relationship to the closest ancestor that you share.
</P>
<P>
   You have the same grandparent as your first cousin, who is a
child of your aunt or uncle.
</P>
<P>
   You have the same great-grandparent as your second cousin, the
same great-great-grandparent as your third cousin, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin who is one generation away from being your first cousin
is your first cousin once removed. The person could be either the
child of your first cousin or your parent's first cousin.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin who is two generations away from being your first
cousin is your first cousin twice removed _ either your first
cousin's grandchild or your grandparent's first cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Along these lines, a second cousin twice removed is either your
second cousin's grandchild or your grandparent's second cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Dwight Yoakam?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.A., Haltom City, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to him in care of the International Dwight Yoakam Fan
Club, 15030 Ventura Blvd., No. 770, Sherman Oaks, CA 91403.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old singer was born in Pikeville, Ky., and grew up
in Ohio, graduating from Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of trying to break into the music business,
Yoakam released ``Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'' in 1984 on a
small label and was signed by Reprise Records. Four songs were
added, and the revised album became his first gold record.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Yoakam released a greatest-hits collection, ``Last
Chance for a Thousand Years.'' The album includes ``Crazy Little
Thing Called Love,'' a hit song that he originally performed for a
Gap khakis commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam will star in ``The Minus Man,'' a film scheduled for
limited release in September.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've got a 200-year calendar for 1801 to 2000 printed on a
7-by-15 piece of paper. Where can I get a new one for 2001 to 3000
or something along those lines?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.M., Grand Prairie, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Each edition of the World Almanac includes a perpetual
calendar that covers the last 20 centuries and most of the next
one.
</P>
<P>
   You can use the calendar to find out the day of the week for
birthdays and other noteworthy occasions.
</P>
<P>
   An example: In 1492, Christopher Columbus first sighted land on
Friday, Oct. 12, in the present-day Bahamas.

CHILDREN ARE INDEED SUBJECT TO STRESS WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people of the United States have an enormous number of
rights. The harvest of countless protests, marches and sit-ins has
included a crop of documents explaining the rights of our citizens
and the limitations of our government.
</P>
<P>
   In 1791, the Bill of Rights was added to the United States
Constitution. In the tradition of England's Magna Carta of 1215, it
granted us a basic list of privileges including the right to bear
arms and the right to a speedy trial.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant piece of legislation for this country was
the 19th Amendment, passed in 1920, which finally assured that all
citizens, male and female, have the right to vote. More recently,
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, though often construed as legislation
specifically for minorities, actually is a law protecting the
rights of all.
</P>
<P>
   I revisited these landmark developments in the history of our
great nation in an effort to find another unalienable right that I
need to exercise. I have yet to find it documented anywhere, but I
didn't find the right to breathe, either, during my research.
Therefore, I have concluded that like inhaling and exhaling, it is
simply such a fundamental part of survival that we don't even need
to write it down. I am referring to the right to change my mind.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was a time in my life when I was steadfast and
unmoving about my ideas. Even when confronted with overwhelming
evidence to the contrary, I chose to stand my shaky ground and
endure the plummet into the chasm of ignorance that resulted when
my most recent theory split at the seams. Now, having miraculously
survived an embarrassing number of academic earthquakes, I have
finally learned an excellent survival technique. This won't be a
news flash to anyone but the young and the stubborn, but we
actually do have the right to change our minds. It's OK to be
wrong. It happens. Just hang a right and move along.
</P>
<P>
   What am I changing my mind about today?
</P>
<P>
   Kids and stress.
</P>
<P>
   In reflecting on my childhood through the myopic glasses of
middle age, I tend to focus on the good times, the happy times and
the funny times. Yes, I recall a number of harrowing moments, but
they pale in comparison to the laughter and gaiety that seemed to
be the order of the day. Consequently, I have been one of those
people who found the idea that children can be stressed out
incomprehensible. My usual response to the subject has been, ``What
do they have to be stressed about? They get food, clothing and
shelter for free. They don't have to work hard. They do a little
homework and play a lot. So what's the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the suicide rate among teens is at an all-time high.
Teen pregnancy and drug use continue to remain at alarming levels.
And kids are joining gangs because they want ``a real family.''
Clearly there is a problem, whether we adults can identify with it
or not.
</P>
<P>
   Judsen Culbreth, the editor of a parenting magazine, explains
that even the act of returning to school can be stressful. She
suggests that adults try to imagine going to a new job every year,
with new policies, new expectations and new co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   That's what returning to school is like for our children. That
really is stressful.
</P>
<P>
   So the moral of this story is simply that we need to be
sensitive not only to the physical state, but also the emotional
state of our children. A stressed-out mind puts up roadblocks on
the information superhighway. I guess an inflexible mind does the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing my mental map, it appears that taking a right at
this roadblock will actually lead me and my family to a better
place.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if it doesn't, I can always change my mind.
</P>

RHODE ISLANDERS TEAM UP ON '70s TEEN COMEDY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rhode Island is a small place, so it's not too
surprising that its two most prominent filmmaking entities _ the
gross-out joke-loving Farrelly brothers and street drama specialist
Michael Corrente _ would bump into one another.
</P>
<P>
   But as you might expect, Ocean State solidarity isn't quite
enough to bring two highly diverse creative temperaments into
harmony. ``Outside Providence,'' the alliance between the director
of ``American Buffalo'' and the guys who made ``There's Something
About Mary,'' keeps careening between uninspired slob comedy,
working-class sentimentality and a sporadically intelligent but
stubbornly half-baked coming-of-age story. It's a movie about,
among other things, solidarity among Rhode Islanders, but it seems
to be in a constant fight with itself.
</P>
<P>
   Scripted by Bobby and Peter Farrelly and director Corrente, the
film is based on a novel Peter wrote before ``Dumb and Dumber'' and
``Mary'' made him and Bobby something like Hollywood's reigning
artists of bad-boy humor. Oddly enough, Corrente comes from the
meaner districts of Pawtucket that ``Outside's'' hero, mid-'70s
teen-ager Tim Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy), calls home. The more
comfortably raised Farrelly built his book around the few poor
classmates he observed at his tony New England prep school.
</P>
<P>
   Tim lives with his crude/loving/undemonstrative widowed dad
(Alec Baldwin, pretty good until he goes overboard with the
everyman mannerisms), a wheelchair-dependent little brother (good
for a few of the Farrellys' awful handicapped gags) and _ though
Dad won't let it in the house _ a three-legged German shepherd with
an eye patch.
</P>
<P>
   Tim's a good if wayward sort who mainly hangs out with his
dope-smoking buddies until he rear-ends a police cruiser one
bong-befogged night. A friend of Dad's pulls strings to get Tim
enrolled in a fancy prep school; he hates the idea of leaving his
lifelong loser pals for senior year, but it sure beats jail.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Tim soon makes friends with a bunch of dope-smoking
winners at the Ivy League factory, and even attracts the attention
of the cutest, brightest girl on campus, Jane Weston (Amy Smart,
last seen in ``Varsity Blues''). Improbable as this may seem,
Hatosy's portrayal of a lower-class lunk is charming enough to make
the rich girl's interest credible; he's adorably awkward like most
teen-age boys, but he has more than enough street cool to
compensate.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the moment-to-moment behavior in ``Outside
Providence,'' in fact, will ring warmly true for anyone who grew up
in the '70s. Even the film's innocence is convincing; Tim's
Pawtucket posse brag brutishly about minor romantic exploits, but
this film hardly sports the sexual obsessiveness most contemporary
youth comedies wallow in. Indeed, we never even see the physical
side of Tim and Jane's relationship; the emphasis is, refreshingly,
on their emotional growth and joy in each other's company.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the absence of rampant horniness here is
compensated for by compulsive drug-taking. Not inauthentic for the
period, these kids' idiotic pursuit of getting high regardless of
the risk (what passes for a plot revolves around a vengeful dean's
efforts to bust as many dopeheads as he can) is nevertheless
unbelievable, especially when key characters have the chance to
logically outgrow their partying ways but refuse to do so out of
some hokey, rebellious impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, other serious matters are brought up _ such as how Dad
and his poker buddies cope with the revelation that one of them
might be gay _ only to be unexplored and laughed away half an hour
down the line. For these and many similar disappointments,
``Outside Providence,'' admirable as its desire to be a teen comedy
with a lot on its mind is, flunks out more than it passes. &QL;

words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (``p'' code)

<P>
   MCONNELL-FUNDRRAISING (Washington) _ Feature on the fight
between Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and a campaign reform group
led by business and academic figures. By Don Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   KEYES-PROFILE (Greenville, S.C.) _ Alan L. Keyes, the
arch-conservative radio talk show host, is the invisible man in the
Republican primary for president. He gets few cameras at his
events. Political analysts tend to forget him in their
prognostications. Polls show him receiving one percent of the vote,
or less. And when the Log Cabin Republicans, a homosexual group,
issued a news release last week attacking religious conservatives
for intolerance, Keyes didn't even merit a mention. But to his
small yet devoted cadre of followers, Keyes a former Reagan
administration diplomat with a Harvard Ph.D., has something his
fellow arch conservatives lack: mesmerizing oratorical skills
twinned with a messianic vision. By James Dao. (1600 words)

AIDS in Atlanta. By Lawrence K. Altman.

<P>
   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-ECON (Paris) _ Total Fina's hostile bid for Elf Aquitaine
and a three-way bank brawl have been the latest illustration of how
much French business has changed. In the last two years, France has
moved to shake up and slim down its corporate world. As a result,
France has become a darling of foreign investors more thoroughly
and quickly than many would have thought possible. The Paris bourse
has surged by 50 percent over the last two years. Growth prospects
are brighter than in a long time. And there is little sign that the
corporate reshuffling will let up soon. By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ A small group of analysts,
skeptical of the fuzzy financials of Internet retailers, have
devised a simple method for evaluating growth. They take the two
numbers that Internet retailers love to trumpet _ total revenue for
a quarter and total customer base _ and divide one by the other.
The results are eyebrow raising. They go straight down. Internet
companies argue that there is a gaping methodological flaw in this
formula, namely that the customer base number is cumulative. By
Leslie Kaufman.

percent. In Japan, the Nikkei closed down 2.69 percent, and Hong
Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 1.50 percent. By Kenneth N.
Gilpin.

deal valued at $2 billion.

<P>
   GARLIC (Clinton Corners, N.Y.) _ I had come to La Terre Garlic
Farm for a garlic refresher course. And I was about to learn what
those who shop at farmers' markets and grow their own already know:

<P>
   BAD-TABLES (New York) _ On the list of atmospheric irritants to
the dining experience, the bad table is right up there with the
rude waiter and ear-splitting noise levels _ and often accompanied
by them. With more restaurants opening than at anytime in recent
history _ 50 this fall alone _ and more money behind them for space

the subject. By Rick Marin.

   RAW-FISH (Undated) _ Sushi and sashimi opened the door to raw
fish; salmon tartares and tuna carpaccios took it beyond Japanese
restaurants and onto mainstream tables everywhere. Now ceviche has

cooking is involved. By Florence Fabricant.

TENSION MELTS AWAY IN `CHILL FACTOR' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's ``Speed'' in an ice-cream truck. It's ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' crossed with ``Breakdown.'' It's
rude, crude and eminently forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Chill Factor,'' a derivative, workmanlike buddy movie
that may find an audience with undiscriminating action fans upset
over the summer's paucity of explosions. But hard-core genre
enthusiasts will likely leave this movie disappointed, because for
all of its explosions, throat-slittings and off-camera
decapitations, ``Chill Factor'' delivers precious few thrills.
``Shrill Factor'' would have been a more apt title.
</P>
<P>
   The action, such as it is, begins on a tiny South Pacific island
where the U.S. government is conducting some perilous chemical
weapons research. An unfortunate accident occurs, causing one too
many ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' face peels for the servicemen
patrolling the area. Their commander _ not the scientist in charge
_ takes the fall and packs his bags for 10 years at Leavenworth.
</P>
<P>
   When his sentence is up, Maj. Andrew Brynner (Peter Firth)
decides to get his revenge, steal the deadly chemical substance and
sell it (on eBay we presume) to the highest bidder. Helping him is
a multicultural band of mercenaries, including an African-American,
a Latino and a blonde in tight leather pants.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in their way are an aimless drifter named Tim (Skeet
Ulrich) and an ice-cream delivery man, Arlo (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who
intercept the lethal goo. Their mission: Get it back to the
government and keep it cold. If the substance rises above 50
degrees (and the filmmakers conveniently provide the storage device
with a digital temperature readout), there will horrible death,
decay and cable outages within a 100-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley Scott protege Hugh Johnson doesn't do as much with the
premise as he could in his debut as a feature director. The film
veers between slack action and broad schtick, scoring occasionally
with a cheap laugh or decent chase sequence. More often than not,
though, the shifting tone results in a movie that doesn't quite
work as a thriller _ or a ``Midnight Run'' buddy comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding Jr. clowns broadly, but he needs a better joke writer.
And the movie's serious moments are pure corn. (Maj. Brynner to Tim
and Arlo: ``So the average citizens have decided to risk their
lives for country. I almost remember what that feels like.'')
</P>
<P>
   It would also be easier to buy into the movie's ``chill''
concept if they kept the chemical substance away from fire and
direct sunlight. The ensuing loss of tension, not to mention brain
cells, is palpable. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Chill Factor'' (R; violence and language). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Skeet Ulrich, Cuba Gooding Jr., Peter Firth, David
Paymer. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Directed by Hugh Johnson. Screenplay by Drew
Gitlin and Mike Cheda. Released by Warner Bros. &UR;  &QL; 
Running time: &LR;  One hour, 42 minutes. &UR;  &QL; 
Our rating: &LR;   &UR; 2 stars &QL;

NEW GAMING SYSTEM WILL BE HIT FROM DAY ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a few days, hundreds of thousands of people
will line up for what is likely to be the biggest opening day in
entertainment history, spending as much as $90 million to catch the
next big thing in fun.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans won't be queueing up and clamoring for a book, or a
record, or even a movie, not even one of ``Titanic'' proportions.
Instead, they'll be buying a new kind of videogame machine, Sega's
Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast is the first of the so-called next-generation
gaming machines expected to hit U.S. store shelves over the next 18
to 24 months. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The machine is a technological leap past the graphical and
other limits of current all-in-one game boxes _ such as Sony's
aging but hugely popular PlayStation and Nintendo's N64 _ that plug
into a television and are simple enough for even a techo tyro to
operate.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sony and Nintendo are developing their own successor
machines. But many observers believe those challengers to
Dreamcast's technological superiority will be unlikely to arrive
even by late next year, when the companies are promising to roll
out their machines.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, Sega has the coolest box in the business, the one
gamers will be clamoring to have.
</P>
<P>
   It's a box with the best graphics in consoles, by a long shot,
even outstripping nearly all personal computers in its visual
virtuosity. Sega boasts that the 128-bit brain in its machine is 15
times more powerful than the 32-bit brain in the PlayStation and 10
times more powerful than the 64-bit processor in the N64.
</P>
<P>
   It also brings Internet connectivity to console gaming, allowing
head-to-head play and much else that previously had only been
available to people with games made for far more expensive and
complex personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   And it blurs, more than ever, the edges between videogaming and
older kinds of entertainment media, such as television and movies.
More than ever, you'll be able to play engaging, absorbing games
that look more real, more cinematic than ever before possible.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Sega, the one-time king of gaming, has a chance to
recover its crown after a bad stumble with its Saturn machine,
which ended up mostly ignored in the mid-'90s round of new console
introductions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, much of Sega's future rides on the Dreamcast's success,
here and overseas. And for now, the prospects for success, at least
initially, look very good indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Already close to 300,000 people have put down deposits _ usually
a small percentage of the machine's $199 cost _ with a retailer to
reserve their own Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the cost of accessories _ such as a virtual memory unit
to save high scores and a couple of games _ and most buyers will
likely spend $300 or more apiece, said Christian Svensson, editor
in chief and CEO of MCV, a videogaming trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   And spend they will, Svensson predicts. Industry observers
expect the hard-core gamers who have put money down to show up in
droves on Day One to get their hands on their oh-so-fabulous new
toys. That should make for what, in any branch of the entertainment
world, would be a sweet opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have roughly 300,000 units sold the first
day,'' Svensson said. ``That could generate as much as $90 million
in sales that day. I can't think of any product, movie, record
that's generating that kind of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace''
grossed $28.5 million its first day, easily setting a record for
the movie business. ``Phantom Menace'' set another record at the
end of its unusually long five-day opening weekend, grossing just
over $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Figures for other kinds of media, particularly for new
videogaming consoles, aren't even close to the ``Star Wars''
numbers, much less what's expected for Dreamcast. Even the gaming
business has seen nothing like this, because when the PlayStation
and Nintendo 64 first came out in the mid-'90s, the gaming business
was a far smaller industry, far from the mass-market medium it has
now become, Svensson said.
</P>
<P>
   Because so much is riding on Sega's success with the Dreamcast,
the company is spending $100 million in U.S. marketing alone, with
hundreds of millions more to be spent in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   That's a ton of money by any standard. But the payoff could be
big.
</P>
<P>
   Look at what happened with Sony when its PlayStation took off
five years ago, eventually selling 20 million units in the United
States alone, and helping make videogaming a mass-market
entertainment medium. Now PlayStation generates more than a third
of Sony's profits, and you can find the little gray box in one in
five American households.
</P>
<P>
   Add another 13 million N64 units for Nintendo and you can start
to understand how gaming has become even bigger _ an estimated $7
billion this year _ than the movie business's domestic box-office
gross.
</P>
<P>
   Sega, left behind in the past few years of go-go profits, has
put together a machine designed to snatch back a big share of that
boom. Have they succeeded?
</P>
<P>
   So far, say gaming publication editors and gamers themselves,
the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Dreamcast is an amazing machine,'' said Greg Rau,
editor in chief of Incite Video Games, a new ``gaming lifestyle''
magazine. ``It's definitely the most impressive graphically and
gameplay-wise out there. It's really hard to look at other games
(on other platforms) the same way now.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   D.J. Panzer, a 9-year-old from Beverly Hills who was one of the
first people to rent the Dreamcast and one of its premier titles,
Sonic Adventure, this summer through Hollywood Video, generally
gave the experience high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun and the game moves very fast, but the graphics were
not quite as good as I expected,'' Panzer said in an e-mail
interview. ``Overall, I think the game is good.''
</P>
<P>
   He found much to like, including game levels where players dodge
avalanches and fly airplanes through vivid landscapes. And indeed,
Sonic Adventure is very fast, almost blindingly so, with sharp,
lush graphics that whip by at something closer to supersonic
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   D.J.'s main knock, and one that many gamers may have, is that
the machines don't include a virtual memory unit as standard
equipment. The VMUs, which cost an extra $25, plug into the
Dreamcast's controller or can be linked to each other to exchange
data.
</P>
<P>
   They look a bit like the Tamagotchi electronic toys of a couple
of years back, and can even play minigames downloaded from the
Dreamcast. Importantly, they also store a player's progress,
characters and high scores; without them, you have to start over
within a game each time you play.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the VMU, of course, gaming can be fabulous on the
Dreamcast, though whether a title takes advantage of the machine's
power depends on its developers. Some, as has happened particularly
with fighting games, were ``ported,'' or translated, from arcade
gaming with very few changes or improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But some titles _ Ready2Rumble, Shenmue, Sega Bass Fishing, Soul
Calibur, Armada, NFL 2000 and (despite D.J.'s mild disappointment)
Sonic Adventure _ are graphically so far ahead of the current crop
of machines that there is little useful comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shenmue, it's pretty close to unbelievable, just to see the
level of detail and character direction that they've taken from
movies,'' said Patrick Baggatta, a gaming veteran who edits the
!bold!Incitegames.com!off! Web site. ``There were characters that
were so beautiful they were just stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Shenmue, which won't be released until later in the fall,
represents what's possible with the machine: a much more cinematic
experience that takes advantage of striking 3-D visual compositions
and a ``camera'' that can watch action from many perspectives, or
mimic the points of view common in, say, a televised football game.
</P>
<P>
   That eye candy combines with the ability to create more kinds of
opponents and smarter ones, place them in complex and compelling
worlds, and even to play them over the Internet. Try that with your
television.
</P>
<P>
   It's all possible because of the machine's far more powerful
innards, which have been fine-tuned to chomp through demanding
graphic tasks with the ease of a T. rex gnawing a bronto burger.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, the machine runs a custom Hitachi-made computer
chip at roughly four times the speed of an Intel Pentium II
processor. That computer brain lets it provide not only great
graphics, but more complex environments and more challenging
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a graphics acceleration chip from NEC, an audio chip
from Yamaha, a whopping (for gaming consoles) 26 megabytes of
memory and, for the first time in console gaming history, a
56.6-kpbs modem and Internet connectivity, and you have a
remarkable new kind of machine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in Japan, where the machine has been available for 10
months, the Dreamcast has become as much an Internet appliance
allowing cheap Web access (through Sega's own gaming portal) as a
gaming platform, said Svensson.
</P>
<P>
   The modem and Sega's Web portal make it possible to play other
people online, something previously possible only with expensive
personal computers and a feature that could transform console
gaming.
</P>
<P>
   The only bad news here: Online play won't be available for a
couple of months in the United States, though chat, hints,
discussion groups, high-score listings, downloadable characters and
even partially played games will be available, Sega officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a whole different market dynamic there with the
online capabilities, and it's up to Sega to take advantage of it,''
said Svensson. ``They're going to have it happening to a much, much
larger audience than ever. It takes a lot of infrastructure to be
set up to take advantage of that, and it takes a lot of talent,
which Sega doesn't have in-house right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Sega has cut a deal with AT&AMP;T to provide
those Internet connections. It's part of an array of smart
partnerships the company has made, including the Hollywood Video
rental deal, a deal with Iomega to sell Dreamcast-compatible Zip
removable-storage drive, and sponsorship of a major fall rock-music
tour featuring Limp Bizkit and other chart-toppers.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has mended its battered relationships with the
companies that make games. Many of those gaming companies were
either excluded by Sega in the rollout of its last machine, the
Saturn, or lost a bundle of money in the Saturn's failure. This
time around, Sega has rebuilt relations enough to boast as many as
24 titles available on Sept. 9, easily a record for a new gaming
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim, the biggest console-game publisher outside the hardware
makers themselves, is one of those supportive companies, though it
also plans to develop titles for the new Sony and Nintendo machines
when those machines hit store shelves in 12 to 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect they will sell between 600,000 and 800,000
(Dreamcast) units by Christmas,'' said Acclaim co-chairman and CEO
Gregory Fishbach. ``And the overall software market for Dreamcast
will be between 4 million and 5 million units sold in that time. I
think that most of the software companies will enjoy a great deal
of success with the launch of the hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim will release Dreamcast versions this fall of games such
as Shadowman, WWF Attitude, Jeremy McGrath SuperCross and
Quarterback Club 2000 that each are also available for some
combination of the PC, PlayStation and Nintendo 64 platforms. On
Dreamcast launch day, they'll release Trickstyle, a futuristic
hoverboard racing game, Fishbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim also is developing a similar number of titles for the
PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's Dolphin, Fishbach said.
</P>
<P>
   When those even more powerful next-generation machines come out,
probably at the end of next year, they should represent yet another
big jump in videogaming technology. But for now, Fishbach said,
Dreamcast is the dream machine for gamers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another leap forward in terms of what hardware systems
can do,'' Fishbach said. ``I think they'll be off to a great start
in the first three, four, five months. Then they'll have strong
competition at the end of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   When it could be time for yet another big opening day.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; What should you get to go with the basic $199
machine?
</P>
<P>
   To start with, you have to get the virtual memory unit as well,
for another $20. Its presence will transform sports games, allowing
two people playing each other to secretly pick their plays on the
VMU's separate tiny screen.
</P>
<P>
   As well, with titles such as Sonic Adventure, it will download
mini-games and characters you can play independently, and most
usefully, stores high scores, characters and game progress. At
least one VMU is a must-have, adding a great deal to the
playability of many games.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple-player games (the machine has jacks for four
controllers) will require multiple controllers, and multiple VMUs
(you can actually fit two VMUs in a single controller, or a VMU and
the separate $19.95 Jump Pack for ``rumble'' functions), but you
can probably hold off a bit on that purchase, say for Christmas,
unless you're just itching to bash your buddies in a fighting or
sports game.
</P>
<P>
   Prices will vary on the extra controllers because Sega and
numerous accessory makers such as Interact (at www.interact.com)
are already making a variety of inexpensive alternatives, as well
as some unusual accessories such as keyboards, light guns and
driving wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of keyboards, if you're serious about using the
Dreamcast as an Internet machine for e-mail and the like, you'll
want to get a keyboard. Sega's custom keyboard will cost just $20,
a bargain for the annoyances it obliterates. &QL;

FULL ROSTER OF GAMES ACCOMPANIES DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Runs with DREAMCAST-SEGA and DREAMCAST-ACCESSORIES)  
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dreamcast will be blessed with a record array
of games when it launches, only a few of which I've personally
played. But several have caught my eye and are worth checking out
as you try to figure out what to try first.
</P>
<P>
   One unlikely title that I'm picking as a surprise hit is Sega
Bass Fishing, which uses Sega's fishing-rod controller (another
$34.95, but worth it for this game).
</P>
<P>
   I don't even like to fish, much less gut, clean and cook what
I've caught, but this title was absolutely an addictive, and
beautifully wrought, treat that is fun for all ages. And talk about
the ultimate catch-and-release policy.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other games that look interesting:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Sonic Adventure. Sega is putting a huge amount of resources
behinds its own game, featuring everyone's favorite blue hedgehog.
The game is appropriate for all ages, is blindingly fast, looks
great and has a great deal of depth in both the range of challenges
it provides and opportunities for long-term playability as Sega
creates more downloadable add-ons and mini-games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast will have at least four or five fighting games
available from virtually Day One. Though such games aren't much to
my taste, and several of the titles are extremely similar to their
arcade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Soul Calibur. It's getting great buzz but it's definitely
for more grown-up players, given its violent nature. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Ready2Rumble Boxing. This boxing title features the
trademark ``Let's get ready to rumble'' cry of ring announcer
Michael Buffer, and a raft of wildly different boxers throwing
taunts and left hooks with equal abandon. The violence here is
cartoonish and gently handled, so I can feel more comfortable
recommending this one for somewhat younger gamers, perhaps age 10
and up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; House of the Dead 2.Another gory grown-up hit in the making.
Blast zombies in a creepy city at night. Not much in redeeming
social value, but stimulating fun for adult gamers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; NFL 2K. I'm not a huge fan of football games on consoles,
but this title from Sega will be the only one of its type on launch
day (Acclaim comes out with Quarterback Club 2000, an excellent
challenger, on Oct. 1). NFL 2K, as Sega calls it, looks fabulous
and comes loaded with goodies. This is definitely a game that
benefits from having a human opponent, and virtual memory units in
each controller, because you'll be able to secretly select your
defensive set and offensive play without your opponent seeing.
</P>
<P>
   If these games aren't particularly to your taste, have faith.
Sega expects as many as 24 titles on launch day, and perhaps as
many as 45 titles available by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   By this time next year, the company projects as many as 100
different games will run on the Dreamcast. And with its Windows CE
operating system making game conversions from the PC relatively
easier for developers, there could be a flood of jointly developed
titles should the machine take off in popularity. &QL;

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
The Kansas City Star offers the following for use Wednesday, Sept.
1, 1999:
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUSH: WASHINGTON _ The political question of the moment is, did
Texas Gov. George W. Bush ever use drugs and if he did, should he
say so. But another question may be, shouldn't some of the others
who are wading into the debate about the Republican presidential
frontrunner's past keep quiet for fear of sounding hypocritical?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OZLAND: DeSOTO, Kan. _ Developers for the World of Oz theme park
will give away 2,800 acres of the Sunflower plant site, or almost a
third, to Johnson County Parks, Kansas University, Kansas State
University, De Soto and De Soto schools. The park land, about 1,700
acres, is less than originally sought. By Grace Hobson.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CROWD: KANSAS CITY _ Over pasta and pizza, Al Kohlman, Klaus
Frank and Arthur Abt talk about the restaurant business, Kansas
City's need for mass transit and the dent in Frank's car. Kohlman
serves another slice of pizza, and Frank marvels at the busy car
wash across the street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's casual talk, the kind they have every Friday over lunch.
The amiable conversation springs from a friendship that has endured
50 or 60 years, a friendship forged in much different times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These men, all Jews, escaped Nazi persecution in World War II.
Along the way, they lost loved ones _ fathers, grandmothers,

   They found ``the Crowd,'' a group of 11 Jewish immigrant

The county's new jail has been the subject of federal and state

inmates, allowed sex between male and female inmates and allowed
alcohol into the jail. By Will Sentell. 25. Map. (Miller County is
near Lake of the Ozarks.) &QL;

<P>
   WANT: KANSAS CITY _ Convicted killer Alan Echols evaded the law
for eight years before his capture last week, but a Jackson County
man wanted for murder has avoided the law for almost two decades.
Yellowing police reports tell of the tale of Richard G. Bocklage,
his 10-foot Burmese python and a bizarre letter that foreshawdows a
murder. Jackson County probably has fewer than a dozen outstanding
warrants for murder, investigators say. But Bocklage's case is the
oldest one that prosecutors could take to a jury. Bocklage is
accused of killing his former girlfriend, who was doctor. Joe
Lambe. 25. Photos.
</P>
<P>
   w/ SHARON01: Jackson County's oldest active murder warrant is
probably also the most notorious _ a pretty brunette called ``La
Pistolera.'' Sharon Kinne was charged with killing three people
before her 25th birthday, but the Independence woman once called
herself ``just an ordinary girl.'' She's been on the run for nearly
40 years. Joe Lambe 10. Photos, list of others wanted for murder.  &QL;

CHICKS STILL RULING THE ROOST WITH `FLY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fly,'' due in stores this week, finds the Dixie Chicks walking
the line between their independent Texas instincts and the country
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicks, the freshest act to emerge in country music in the
last two years, honed their bluegrass-inflected sound on the Texas
club circuit in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Maines' lead vocals combine a rock edge with deep
country roots and an unmistakable Texas twang, while the
instrumental abilities of fiddler Martie Seidel and banjoist Emily
Robison give the group a sound distinct from the Nashville assembly
line.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been 6 million sales _ the most ever for a
country duo or group _ of the Chicks' debut album, ``Wide Open
Spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly'' was co-produced by Blake Chancey and Paul Worley, the
same team responsible for ``Wide Open Spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   After writing only one song on their debut (the hit ballad ``You
Were Mine''), the group members have song credits on five of the 13
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The first single, ``Ready to Run,'' was co-written by Seidel and
Marcus Hummon. The song opens with Irish air played on the fiddle
by Seidel, then opens up into the spirited tale of a woman intent
on asserting her independence.
</P>
<P>
   Seidel and Hummon also collaborated on ``Cowboy Take Me Away,''
which builds from a folkish guitar part reminiscent of Lyle
Lovett's ``If I Had a Boat.'' Robison and Seidel contribute soaring
harmonies behind Maines' lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye Earl'' is a Thelma-and-Louise tale of two women who
conspire to murder an abusive husband and get away with it. Maines
delivers the lyrics with a rollicking good humor that should play
well to the Chicks' core of young women fans.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not until the middle of the program that the album
really takes off and flies. ``Hello Mr. Heartache'' is Buck
Owens-style Bakersfield honky-tonk. Maines' father, Lloyd Maines,
plays all the pedal steel guitar parts on the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Waste Your Heart,'' co-written by Robison and Maines, is
pure-country ballad sung from the unapologetic point of view of a
woman leaving a relationship. (The song mirrors events in Maines'
life; she was divorced last year.)
</P>
<P>
   This is followed by ``Sin Wagon,'' in which a woman looks
forward to doing a little ``mattress dancing'' following a wild
night on the town. Seidel, Robison and acoustic guitarist Bryan
Sutton contribute hot solos combining rock energy with bluegrass
instrumentation.
</P>
<P>
   Maines also co-wrote ``Without You,'' which somewhat less
effectively features a string orchestra. And ``Some Days You Gotta
Dance'' is as close as the album comes to smiley-face Nashville
filler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hole in My Head'' is twanging hillbilly rock, with Mike
Henderson on heavy-stringed lead guitar. Although Maines comes
across as soft and sweet when the song calls for it, she can also
punch out the lines with as much raw aggression as any female
singer in country music.
</P>
<P>
   The album closer, ``Let It Fly,'' was written by Austin, Texas,
songwriter Patty Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly'' is not the album to change the world, or even change the
rules in Nashville. But it demonstrates that the Dixie Chicks have
what it takes to keep on cluckin' for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 stars out of a possible 4. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; M. Trinchero Cabernet Sauvignon 1996, Napa Valley, Calif. About
$30. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a new name in the ever-expanding club of fine Napa
Valley cabernets. Well, not entirely new; the Trincheros have been
in the Napa Valley for more than half a century and own the hugely
successful Sutter Home Winery, a national leader in popular-priced
wines.
</P>
<P>
   With the market moving steadily upscale, this wine, and its
companion chardonnay, were a logical progression for the
Trincheros. It was also a good way for the present generation to
honor their late father, Mario, who left the Bronx to found Sutter
Home Winery in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He would have been proud of this wine, a rich, full cabernet
with classic cassis aromas and beautiful structure. Fermented in
stainless steel and aged 16 months in mostly French oak, it should
improve in the bottle for five years more and last a decade after
that.

   NEW YORK _ Wow, $380 for a Batard-Montrachet,'' I remarked to
the wine steward at a New York restaurant as I surveyed the wine
list. ``A lot of money for a bottle of white Burgundy. It must be a
tough sell.''

   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``It will be gone in a couple of days.
Now, that little California riesling for $18, our least expensive
wine, that's hard to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Was that because his customers did not like California riesling,
I asked. ``No,'' he said. ``They hate, absolutely hate, buying the
cheapest wine on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of a wine list is indeed an awfully lonely place,
overlooked by many if not most diners. For many people, choosing
any wine from a lengthy list is an unnerving experience: so many
names, so many prices, so little time. The people with you become a
critical audience; the server becomes every teacher who ever waited
for an answer you didn't have. One can feel the pressure to
overreact, to stab blindly at something costing far more than you
planned to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough to appear ignorant; at least you won't look like a
tightwad, too. And so that little riesling or Macon blanc or
obscure Bordeaux languishes alone and unwanted. Or does it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not here,'' one restaurateur told me. ``If no one will touch
the lowest-priced wine, I wait a few months, then raise the price
and move it up a few places on the list. Then it will sell _ no
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Another restaurant owner told me this was an old ploy. ``And it
works,'' he said. Neither man wanted to be identified, but others
were more open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lowest-priced wines are usually from obscure
appellations,'' said Daniel Johnnes, the wine director at
Montrachet, a popular New York restaurant. ``People don't buy these
wines because they are unfamiliar with them, so we talk about them.
Just giving them a wine list to look at won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he noted that the restaurant has a Sancerre that
costs $34. It also has a Quincy, which is very similar, for $22,
``but you have to talk about it to get people to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hersom, the wine director at Le Cirque 2000, regularly
sells rare Bordeaux for $2,000 a bottle and more, but is fully
aware of the problem of the low-priced wine that no one wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone paying $90 per person for dinner, a $60 bottle of
wine may be no problem,'' he said. ``But we have customers to whom
we recommend the lowest-priced wines _ and they buy them. It could
be a special celebration, a party of eight. They're better off with
three our four inexpensive wines, especially if there are people in
the group who don't drink wine.''
</P>
<P>
   At a restaurant like Le Cirque 2000, inexpensive is a relative
term, but Hersom said that some 80 wines are less than $40, with
the lowest another of those ubiquitous California rieslings, this
one from Fetzer Vineyards, at $18.
</P>
<P>
   At the Water Club, the manager, Bruno-Noel St.-Andre, said he
never has any problem selling his least expensive wine. ``It's a
Beaujolais-Villages at $25,'' he said, ``and very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaujolais benefits from its popularity. Indeed, the name is
almost a brand. People buy it because they know and like it,
regardless of the price. Unfortunately, many restaurants have
realized this and now charge outrageous prices for Beaujolais.
</P>
<P>
   At the Union Square Cafe, the owner, Danny Meyer, will
occasionally sell his least expensive wines by the glass if they
don't sell quickly enough by the bottle. A wine that sells for $18
a bottle translates into $5 a glass. ``That would be our least
expensive glass,'' Meyer said ``but we have no trouble selling it
that way. ``
</P>
<P>
   Union Square Cafe's wine list is divided into categories
determined by taste and style rather than by origin. ``Our cheapest
price is $18,'' Meyer said, ``but each category has one. We
confront people about their built-in fears. We make things easier
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's worth keeping in mind that where wine is concerned, price
is often more a reflection of demand than of quality. Most
restaurants that are serious about wine have a few gems that are
moderately priced because no one asks for them. And no one asks for
them because they are unknown. At I Trulli, the owner, Nicola
Marzovilla, and his wine director, Charles Scicolone, use
subterfuge to introduce their customers to their least expensive
wines. They put those wines in the tasting programs at their wine
bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will sell three tastes for a flat price,'' Marzovilla said.
``Afterwards, we may tell the customer that No. 2 or No. 3 was the
least expensive wine in the house. After that, he'll order it by
the bottle because he likes it, not because it's cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of I Trulli's wines come from the Puglia region and are
virtually unknown here. People avoid them because they have never
heard of them, not because they are inexpensive, Marzovilla said,
``but Charles Scicolone knows how to reassure them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always getting people to buy a less expensive wine,''
Marzovilla said, paying his colleague a grudging compliment. ``He's
the best down-seller in the city.''

WOOD-ROASTED TROUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the seventh of eight columns by Waldy Malouf, the chef and
an owner of Beacon in Manhattan. His collaborator on these columns
is Melissa Clark.) 
(jt) 
 c .1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I started experimenting with the wood-burning oven at
Beacon, I found that the combination of high heat and wood smoke
worked extremely well with fish, especially trout. Trout is a
relatively fatty fish, which allows it to take on the taste of the
smoke while the flesh stays juicy, despite the intensity of the
fire. The fire crisps the skin, which gives the soft fish a little
bit of crunch. It's a terrific cooking method.
</P>
<P>
   Its only flaw is that most people, like me, don't have
wood-burning ovens at home. But the recipe for wild roasted trout
below was easy to adapt to a charcoal grill.
</P>
<P>
   Using firewood, or even wood chips, and indirect heat, anyone
can turn an ordinary kettle grill into a near approximation of a
wood-burning oven.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer real wood charcoal, but any kind will do, so long as
you use plenty of it. If you are using a log, add it right away,
after lighting the charcoal. Then let the fire burn for about an
hour (depending on the size of the log) until the wood is
practically reduced to ashes and the coals are beginning to die
down.
</P>
<P>
   If you are using wood chips, soak a good-size handful of them in
water while the charcoal lights. About 10 minutes before you are
ready to cook (the charcoal should be gray all over), add the
soaked chips.
</P>
<P>
   The fish has to cook over indirect heat, so remove the grilling
rack and push the coals and wood over to one half of the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Then cover the grill, close the vents and let it get really hot
inside, like heating an oven.
</P>
<P>
   When the fish is placed inside, on the half of the grill without
coals underneath, it will actually be roasting, rather than
grilling.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce for the trout is also its marinade, which makes this
dish extremely easy once the fire is lighted. A simple chervil
vinaigrette, seasoned with shallots and Champagne vinegar, lends a
subtle herby-onion flavor to the trout.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sauce is made in a blender, you don't have to chop
any of the ingredients finely; just throw them all in together.
</P>
<P>
   I like to blend the herbs with only half of the olive oil and
then stir in the other half by hand. This is purely for looks. The
sauce isn't fully emulsified, and so it breaks on the plate. The
effect is like a pale green pool surrounding dark islands of herbs.
Spooned over the fish, it is so striking that no no other garnish
is needed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WOOD-ROASTED TROUT WITH CHERVIL VINAIGRETTE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes, plus about 1{ hours preparing the grill
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped chervil
</P>
<P>
   } cup chopped flat leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons roughly chopped shallot
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Champagne or white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 boned trout, skin on, heads removed.
</P>
<P>
   1. Light grill, using plenty of charcoal. If using firewood, add
it, and let wood and charcoal burn for about an hour, or until most
of the firewood is burned up. If using wood chips, soak them at
least 20 minutes; then, add to the coals after they are completely
gray. Let chips burn for 10 minutes. Move charcoal and wood to one
side of grill for indirect grilling.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, prepare vinaigrette. In a blender, puree chervil,
parsley, shallot, lemon juice and vinegar with { cup olive oil.
Transfer mixture to a small bowl, and stir in remaining oil, 1
teaspoon salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   3. Sprinkle inside of trout with remaining salt and pepper to
taste. Spoon about half of the vinaigrette on trout, inside and
out. Rub vinaigrette into fish. Cover trout, and refrigerate for 15
to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Spray one side of a 15-inch-square piece of foil with cooking
spray. Cover the side of grill that has no charcoal underneath with
the foil, sprayed side up. Place fish on foil, and cover grill.
Check fish after 10 minutes. (It does not have to be turned.) It's
done when flesh is opaque and skin is crisp. Serve immediately,
with remaining vinaigrette as sauce. Yield: 4 servings.

WORTH A TRY, GAZPACHO OR NOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I like gazpacho, but the ultimate minimalist technique _
pureeing a few tomatoes, a red pepper, some onion, oil and vinegar
in a blender _ is not the best. This yields a pulverized salad that
I find coarse, its raw flavor strong and entirely too lingering.
The vinegar, which adds necessary acidity, is also overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried many solutions to this problem over the years, most
of them actually traditional _ roasting the vegetables first to
reduce the raw taste; adding almonds, cucumbers or even grapes to
lighten the flavor; letting the soup sit overnight so the flavors
can meld. None really did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Then a friend suggested I abandon tradition (although you never
know when something you ``invent'' is in fact an old preparation)
and combine tomatoes with another fruit: cantaloupe. At first, I
was disappointed; the melon added essential sweetness but had an
unappealing graininess. Cooking, at least a little bit, would
surely help.
</P>
<P>
   I peeled and seeded the tomatoes, then quickly sauteed them and
the flesh of the melon in olive oil. I substituted lemon juice for
vinegar and added basil to produce the mildest, most delicious,
creamiest gazpacho I've ever tasted. With its bright orange color,
it was also among the most beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Was it really ``gazpacho''? I don't know. Some references say
gazpacho is any cold soup with vinegar; others say it is simply a
cold soup; still others say it has to have stale bread as a
thickener. All that matters is that this is one great soup.
</P>
<P>
   The tomatoes take an extra step because the skins are bitter and
the seeds are impossible to puree. To prepare them, core them by
cutting a small cone out of the stem end; then make a small ``x''
in the skin of the opposite end. Get a bowl of ice water ready, and
then plunge the tomatoes into boiling water for 10 or 15 seconds;
quickly remove them, and plunge them into the ice water. Peel with
a paring knife, cut in half through the equator and scoop out the
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The tomatoes and melon have to cook in separate skillets so they
sit in one layer and cook quickly without steaming, which would
make them mushy.
</P>
<P>
   This gazpacho has one disadvantage: it has to be prepared in
advance so it can cool. Using ice cubes in place of some of the
water in this recipe will speed that up. If you are really in a
hurry, pour the soup into a wide bowl, place it in an even wider
bowl filled with ice water and stir until it chills.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOMATO-MELON GAZPACHO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes, plus time to cool
</P>
<P>
   4 tomatoes, about 1{ pounds
</P>
<P>
   1 3-pound cantaloupe
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   10 leaves basil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Juice of a lemon.
</P>
<P>
   1. Core, peel and seed tomatoes; cut flesh into 1-inch chunks.
Seed melon, and remove flesh from rind; cut into chunks. Place a
tablespoon of olive oil in each of two 10- or 12-inch skillets and
turn heat under both to high. Add melon to one and tomatoes to the
other, and cook, stirring, until they become juicy, no longer than
2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a blender or food processor, puree melon with tomatoes, 1{
cups water and basil, along with some salt and pepper. Stir in
remaining olive oil. Chill, add lemon juice to taste and adjust
seasoning. Serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

ANTI-SEMITIC GRAFFITI FOUND ON JEWISH CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH YANG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Employees arriving at work at a San Francisco
Jewish center on Monday were confronted with a swastika and the
words, ``Adolf Hitler was here,'' the second of two apparent
anti-Semitic crimes in the region within hours.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the San Jose
home of a judge. Two 17-year-old boys and a 19-year-old man were
booked for investigation of committing a hate crime, terrorism and
arson, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects apparently thought Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge Jack Komar was Jewish, although he is Catholic. Neither
the judge nor his wife was harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The graffiti at the Jewish Family and Children's Services
center, which was written in what appeared to be black magic marker
on a support beam in front of the building, was being investigated
as a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Officers noted that the graffiti still smelled of marker fluid
when they arrived at the center shortly after 10 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Zahler, director of Emigre Services, an office of the
center, called the police shortly after the graffiti was noticed at
about 9:30 a.m. She said the desecration could have occurred any
time over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that makes you concerned,'' Zahler said. The
graffiti was painted over after the police arrived, and before it
could be seen by many of the elderly people and recent immigrants
served at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Zahler said the incident was the first time there had been a
problem at the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no leading up to this,'' she said. ``We're hoping
it's an isolated incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Both incidents were the latest in a string of anti-Semitic
events throughout the country that have put Jewish leaders on
alert.
</P>
<P>
   Security was heightened at many Jewish community centers and
schools after the shooting earlier this month at a Jewish center in
suburban Los Angeles, and the June arson attacks against synagogues
in the Sacramento area.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have their antennas up at this point,'' said Jessica
Ravitz, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League in San
Francisco. ``In the past, people would receive flyers or
threatening phone calls and just hit delete.''

<P>
   Emily Robison was a long way from home on the Lilith Fair tour
when she turned 27 a few days ago, and looking forward to
celebrating her birthday in a quiet, boring Detroit hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   And then she got a surprise: Her hubby, country
singer/songwriter Charlie Robison, to whom she's been married a few
months, flew in to spend a little quality time with her.
</P>
<P>
   So now, instead of just hanging out with fellow Dixie Chicks
Natalie Maines and Martie Seidel and crew members Sunday night in
Cleveland, she and Charlie prepared to hit the town and go to a
nice restaurant _ two attractive, successful people in the bloom of
their personal and professional lives.
</P>
<P>
   A romance novelist with a jones for Patsy Cline and Tammy
Wynette couldn't have written it any better: To be a Dixie Chick
these days is to constantly be given happy surprises, unexpected
gifts _ to find that life is just a little better than you'd
thought it was going to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year or so, that's meant two Grammys (including best
country album for ``Wide Open Spaces'' and best country vocal
performance by a duo or group for ``There's Your Trouble''),
playing on both George Strait's stadium tour and Lilith Fair (what
other group can claim that?) and, at present, watching as more than
6 million copies of ``Spaces'' walked out of the stores.
</P>
<P>
   The CD has sold better than any release by any country group,
ever, and is still in the national top 30 of the ``pop charts''
after 79 weeks. This would be astounding for anybody, but even more
so when we remember that not all that long ago the Dixie Chicks
were a cute (maybe too cute) Dallas novelty act, a-pickin' and
a-grinnin' and a-wearin' vintage cowgirl outfits, guaranteed to be
playing a bar or a wedding near you.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they are the sweet but tart country/bluegrass/pop trio,
role models of empowerment and self-expression for thousands of
young women who have spawned a series of blatant imitations
(SheDaisy, stand up! Redmon &AMP; Vale, take a bow!) while popping up
in the pages of Elle and in ads for Candie's shoes. This November,
they'll appear _ as sisters from Louisiana _ on an episode of
``King of the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Emily Robison is 27 and happy _ giddy, almost, when talking
about all things Chicks-related from her Cleveland hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING THE DISC: The main topic at hand is ``Fly,'' the
much-anticipated follow-up to ``Spaces.'' The new disc came out
Tuesday and is sure to be one of the most talked-about country
releases of the fall, if not the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we felt more confident this time, obviously, and this
one was easier,'' she says. ``And what really helped was setting
aside four or five months to do it and not try to do it when
touring.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Fly'' was cut this past spring after a round of
writing retreats in which the trio would snag a day or two at a
remote cabin, something that Seidel has credited in past interviews
with making the writing easier.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that five of the 13 songs were written by the
Chicks _ either together or with outside writers Marcus Hummon,
Stephony Smith and Eric Silver. Then Seidel and co-producer Blake
Chancey picked the best material from outside writers.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Griffin contributed the closing ``Let Him Fly,'' Matraca
Berg and Annie Roboff penned ``If I Fall You're Going Down With
Me,'' and Buddy Miller and Jim Lauderdale came up with the peppy,
rockish ``Hole in My Head.'' But some of the CD's best songs, such
as the party anthem ``Sin Wagon,'' were written or co-written by
the Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between ``Fly'' and ``Spaces'' is that the
former, Robison says, is more consciously about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more true emotions on this CD, and the emotions fit
our lives and what we're going through,'' she says. ``And all three
of us were going through such different things. I was planning a
wedding, Natalie was getting a divorce and Martie was keeping her
marriage going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parts of `Wide Open Spaces' were autobiographical, but this
album really is more us. It was subconscious _ we didn't reflect on
the songs and what they said as a whole until the CD was done.''
</P>
<P>
   And while there is a wide range of subjects and situations in
the ``Fly'' songs, there is still that independent streak.
``Goodbye Earl'' is about two longtime friends who kill an abusive
spouse after he defies a restraining order, and both ``Sin Wagon''
and ``Some Days You Gotta Dance'' are about not worrying about
boyfriends or long-term relationships and just going out for a good
ol' night on the town. Hence the CD's title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't name the CD until it was nearly done,'' Robison
says. ``We told the label we were going to name it `Sin Wagon' just
to scare them _ we had no intention of doing that. But as we
reflected on it, there are a lot of songs that have references to
flying and leaving and `don't tie this bird's wings' and stuff. We
thought it was universal and that it made a good statement.''
</P>
<P>
   LIGHT A CANDLE: But if both men and women can apply the messages
of the songs to their lives, Robison is well aware that she and her
bandmates are role models for young women walking gingerly through
the minefield of romance and independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people just feel we're honest,'' she says. ``A lot of
the Nashville stuff is so sterile and PC. Especially the young kids
_ I hope they react to things they think are real and honest. ...
We want to influence girls to pick up instruments and do things
that are more male-dominated. A catch phrase like `chicks rule' is
great, but it's just a catch phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, though, the Chicks do rule: They're perched on their
own little branch of country music, a singular entity that
satisfies the tastes of longtime country fans as well as youngsters
who maybe got into the music in the past few years and also listen
to female singers such as Jewel and Sarah McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, though, is that they're still fans of other
performers _ and they've been sharing the Lilith Fair stage with
some of them. Happy though she is throughout the interview, Robison
sounds positively rapturous when talking about the night before,
backstage in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fathom that Sheryl Crow is familiar with your
music,'' she says. ``It's just too cool to look up to someone so
much and have them respect what you do. Last night, they all gave
me a birthday cake, and Sheryl Crow sang `Happy Birthday' to me!''
</P>
<P>
   And the happy surprises just keep coming.

WHAT TO TIP? FLIP OVER THE CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way John Schreadley tells it, the idea came to him one
morning when he and his wife were having breakfast at a chain
restaurant. When the bill came, Schreadley, a paramedic in Tampa,
Fla., pulled a tipping chart he had bought out of his pocket. When
he looked down and saw both the check and tip card in his hand, a
light bulb went on. Why not, he asked himself, combine the two?
</P>
<P>
   With the help of his wife, Mitzi, who owns a commercial printing
company, he came up with a tipping chart, which he calls Computip,
that can be printed on the backs of restaurant checks, both flat
ones and tape rolls. It has calculations for 15 percent, 17 percent
and 20 percent tips for up to $100. After waiting 19 months for a
patent, he is test marketing it in the Tampa area.
</P>
<P>
   While New York City diners for years have had a built-in rough
guide for calculating a tip _ doubling the 8.25 percent sales tax
shown on the bill gives a 16.5 percent tip, which is in the ball
park _ Schreadley is hoping the Computip will make it a bit easier
to calculate tips. He wanted, he said, ``to bring some sort of
standardization to this ballgame, to remove some of the negative
issues _ the embarrassment and the fear and the anxiety _ of
tipping.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was careful to let diners know the guide is just a guide.
The top of each chart reads: ``For your convenience you may
consider referring to the chart below. It is designed solely for
assisting you in quickly calculating a tip and is in no way meant
to influence your usual method of tipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Schreadley knows tipping is a sensitive issue, with some
restaurants in recent years trying to add a standard tip percentage
to checks and others including tip calculations at the bottom of
the check, to encourage better tips for waiters and kitchen help.
But these techniques are often disliked by dinerc, who feel they
are being forced into leaving a larger tip than they want.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lynn, an associate professor of consumer behavior and
marketing at the Cornell Hotel School, said a guide like Computip
might be a good idea, as it gives diners assistance while making it
appear that they have as much choice as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Schreadley chose to print his chart on the back of
checks. ``The feedback is that people are offended by having it on
the front of the check,'' he said, ``but my feeling is that having
it on the back is a little more subtle.''
</P>
<P>
   So subtle in fact that restaurateurs who use it should worry
more that diners might not notice it, rather than be offended by
it.

`RICHARD NIXON, THE CONGRESS YEARS': TAKING EARLY NIXON OUT OF THE
DOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
(Publication notes at end) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The posthumous rehabilitation of Richard Nixon continues apace
with ``The Contender'' by Irwin F. Gellman, a professor of American
history at Chapman University in Southern California, not far from
Nixon's hometown, Whittier. Specifically, Gellman takes on the
widespread idea that Nixon owed his early rise to national
prominence to a unscrupulousness and dishonesty, the most important
element of which was his practice of associating his opponents with
communism and subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Gellman's focuses on Nixon's early years as a public figure,
from his first congressional race, in 1946, to his vice
presidential nomination in 1952. It was from those very beginnings,
Gellman argues, that Nixon's reputation became irrevocably stained
with powerfully negative myths, most important, that calculated
red-baiting of his opponents was the key to his early electoral
success. The truth, in Gellman's view, is very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixonphobia turned into a cult, and its visceral hatred cannot
be overemphasized,'' Gellman writes near the end of his narrative
of the early Nixon career. ``Every major charge brought against him
during his congressional years'' is ``not sustained by facts.'' In
reality, Gellman concludes, Nixon was a ``hard-working, promising
young star'' of Republican politics who played to win; and he did
win, not by engineering dirty tricks but, in Gellman's view, by
outthinking his opponents and better measuring the drift of
post-World War II American life than they did.
</P>
<P>
   Gellman's book will not convince everybody, but it is the solid,
heavily documented sort of work that will have to be taken into
account by serious people as the debate about Nixon continues.
</P>
<P>
   It is a full-scale political biography of Nixon during his early
career in politics. It is not a biography that adds a conspicuous
store of new material to what has been presented by other writers
over the years, from Garry Wills to Stephen E. Ambrose to Henry A.
Kissinger. But in directing our attention to what he portrays as
the anti-Nixon myth and its endurance, Gellman effectively joins
the argument. At some point in almost every chapter he itemizes a
few of the major allegations that have acquired the force of truth;
then he tries to refute them.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect of this is persuasive enough to cause some
reflection on the entrenchment of images in American political
life, how a certain view of a figure, enhanced by an unquestioning
acceptance of the putative facts of that figure's life, gains a
kind of etched-in-stone validity. But some of Gellman's refutations
are more persuasive than others. His detailed chapters on Nixon's
defeat of the Democratic candidate, Jerry Voorhis, for Congress in
1946 addresses accusations that that Nixon was the handpicked
choice of a cabal of monied conservative interests in Southern
California, and that he underhandedly and falsely charged Voorhis
with gaining endorsements from the political action committee of
the Congress of Labor Organizations, which at that time was viewed
as Communist-affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Gellman shows that the California committee that approached the
young Nixon to run for election in the state's 12th Congressional
District was not a bunch of professional dirty-tricksters but an
ordinary, non-nefarious group of Republican activists. They were,
in Gellman's description, doing nothing more than what many other
groups of interested citizens, Democratic and Republican, have done
for decades. As for the famous CIO-political action committee
connection, Gellman shows that Voorhis did receive such
endorsements, endorsements that the candidate himself found
troubling and had sought to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   An impressive element of Gellman's thorough research is that he
is able to pinpoint when certain anti-Nixon myths were born and how
they have been repeated over the decades. In the Voorhis case, they
began with a 1952 article in The New Republic by Ernest Brashear,
an unsuccessful candidate for the California State Assembly. Among
other things, Brashear wrote of legions of Nixon supporters' making
anonymous phone calls to voters accusing Voorhis of being a
Communist. Gellman finds no evidence that any such dirty trick took
place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some of the material that Gellman presents makes the
red-baiting charge seem more serious. Certainly, a significant
element in Nixon's 1950 senatorial campaign against the liberal
Democrat Helen Gahagan Douglas was to portray her not as a
Communist but as soft on Communism.
</P>
<P>
   The ``pink sheet,'' a significant artifact of Nixon's campaign,
involved the sort of suggestion that was at the heart of the
guilt-by-association technique used in that troubled time in
American history. The pink sheet demonstrated that Douglas'
congressional votes coincided almost exactly with those of the New
York congressman Vito Marcantonio, described in turn as ``the
notorious Communist Party-liner.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellman does not go into a deep analysis of the political
semiotics of the pink sheet. He simply states that it was ``mild by
comparison to later (or, for that matter, earlier) standards of
negative campaigning.'' The author's deeper argument, as he
examines other elements of Nixon's career _ especially his roles in
the sensational Whittaker Chambers-Alger Hiss affair and the on the
House Committee on Un-American Activities _ is that Nixon sincerely
believed that Communist subversion was a major threat to American
security.
</P>
<P>
   Gellman's attention is on the political career itself, and he
does not expend much effort demonstrating that Nixon was right or
wrong. His argument is that whatever the validity of Nixon's
beliefs, there was nothing underhanded or demagogic about the way
he expressed them.
</P>
<P>
   The real ``damage to governance of this period,'' Gellman
contends in what seems at best an overly simplistic statement,
``was the steadfast, rigid refusal of Truman and his advisers to
recognize that the United States had to address the question of
Communist espionage rather than just dismissing it as partisan
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, revelations from newly opened files in Moscow and
Washington like the so-called Venona papers, transcripts of some
3,000 communications between the Soviet Union and its agents in the
United States, have given support to Nixon's belief in the
existence of subversive forces. But Truman, even according to some
of the material that Gellman presents, was less rigidly unaware
than the author suggests.
</P>
<P>
   One can argue with Gellman, in other words. But his overall
vision of Nixon cannot be neglected as historians continue to
assess the man who was probably the most interesting president of
recent decades.

`CHILL FACTOR': ELVIS' TEMPERATURE IS RISING, AND THEY'RE ALL SHOOK
UP  
(PRODUCTION NOTES AT END)
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What would action-adventure screenwriters do without Elvis
Presley as a reference point? To their credit, the writers of the
comically tinged thriller ``Chill Factor'' have at least had the
wit to dream up a variation or two on the cliche ``Elvis has left
the building.'' In the movie's opening scene, as a deadly chemical
defoliant (code name Elvis) is about to be tested on a remote
Pacific island, a technician announces, ``Elvis is approaching the
stage.'' Later in the film, we have ``Elvis on ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Once it gets its engines going, ``Chill Factor,'' directed by
Hugh Johnson, is a mechanically efficient chase-by-numbers movie in
which two young men pursued by terrorists transport Elvis across
the Montana high country in a rattling stolen ice-cream delivery
truck. Leading the list of hazards is the fact that if the
temperature of Elvis' container rises above 50 degrees (hence
``Elvis on ice''), they and possibly hundreds of thousands of
others in the region will meet excruciating deaths as their flesh
is chemically stripped away from their bones. (The opening scene in
which a test of Elvis goes awry offers a brief but grisly preview.)
</P>
<P>
   Driving the truck is Arlo (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a goofy ice cream
delivery man who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong
time. Guiding him at gunpoint is Tim Mason (Skeet Ulrich), a young
fishing buddy of the guilt-stricken scientist (David Paymer) who
invented the top-secret Elvis and who informs Tim of its lethal
potency moments before dying from gunshot wounds. That information
goads Tim into heroic action: Elvis must be transported to a nearby
military base at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Long's murderer is his former boss, Capt. Andrew Brynner
(Peter Firth), an angry Vietnam veteran who went crazy in a
military prison after taking the rap for the hushed-up Pacific
island accident, in which 18 soldiers died. Now Brynner and a group
of commandos who resemble refugees from a James Bond movie hope to
sell Elvis on the international market to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   As the truck careens and clatters over the mountain passes of
Montana, Arlo and Tim face the predictable hair-raising situations.
The truck gets stuck and nearly tumbles from a narrow winding road.
Ultimately they have a collision with a car transporting a boat,
which the pair hijack and use as a downhill toboggan through the
forest, over a precipice and into a river whose icy waters keep
Elvis pacified. The final confrontation takes place in a tunnel
with the terrorists, the police and Elvis' custodians converging
just as Elvis' temperature rises above 49 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chill Factor'' has no aspirations to be anything but what it
is: a live action-adventure cartoon stuffed with macho banter,
decorated with weaponry and charged with enough cliffhangers to
stir up some adrenaline. For Gooding, the movie is quite a comedown
from the heights of ``Jerry Maguire.'' His scared-witless ice-cream
delivery man belongs to the same category of wisecracking
noncharacters as LL Cool J's indestructible, scared-witless chef in
``Deep Blue Sea.'' Ulrich's future as an action-adventure star
looks dim. He's too bland, too earnest, too normal to compete in a
field that requires actors to look and behave like flesh-and-blood
action-adventure toys.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   CLINTON CORNERS, N.Y. _ The overhead door of the big shed at La
Terre Garlic Farm was open as my car crunched over the gravel
driveway on one of those perfect cloudless summer mornings in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, I could see a long table set with a white cloth where
Ruth Nosonowitz was puttering under rows and rows of newly
harvested garlic, the bulbs hanging by their yellowing leaves, dirt
still clinging to their roots.
</P>
<P>
   The table had been set with a cutting board, a sharp knife, a
bottle of olive oil, chunks of baguette, bottled water, a large
bunch of parsley and several varieties of new garlic. Nearby, Mrs.
Nosonowitz had ready pesto, garlic soup and garlic puree.
</P>
<P>
   This was a tasting I was both eagerly anticipating and mildly
dreading.
</P>
<P>
   I had come for a garlic refresher course. I knew garlic came in
white and purple and something called elephant, which is actually
not garlic but a member of the leek family.
</P>
<P>
   I knew that some types had hard large cloves and were easy to
peel, that others had tiny cloves that were almost impossible to
peel. But I had no idea that garlic came in 200 varieties, with
some subtle and some not so subtle differences.
</P>
<P>
   I considered garlic generic _ whatever the grocery store had was
good enough, even though it might well be bitter because of its
age. I had no idea that it had lost whatever subtleties it might
have had when it was newly harvested. I certainly had no idea that
once I tasted fresh garlic, I would never want to use any other
kind.
</P>
<P>
   I was about to learn what those who frequent farmers' markets or
grow their own already know: some garlic is mellow, some pungent,
some sweet, some astringent and some have a bite that lasts and
lasts.
</P>
<P>
   I was anticipating the tasting because I love garlic; I was
anxious because I was sure the dreaded garlic breath would be with
me for the next two days. But that was why Mrs. Nosonowitz had set
out that bunch of parsley; chewing a few sprigs after each sample
of the several varieties she grows saved me. And that is one of the
few rules of garlic that applies to all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nosonowitz and her husband, David, an endodontist in nearby
Pleasant Valley, have been growing garlic for seven years. This
year, they planted 110,000 bulbs, by tucking a clove of each into
the soil.
</P>
<P>
   All of their garlic is organic, as is the rocambole variety
grown by Keith Stewart at Keith's Farm in Greenville, in western
Orange County, that he sells at the Union Square Greenmarket in
Manhattan. ``It's frightening what they spray on garlic,'' Mrs.
Nosonowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the peak of the garlic season. Growers in the Northeast
have harvested their crop and have either just finished curing it,
or will soon. They hang the garlic by its leaves for several weeks
under controlled temperatures and humidity, with fans blowing to
dry it. After the garlic is trimmed and cleaned, it is sorted
according to size and variety, and placed in string bags, which are
hung from the same rafters. From July to November, cured garlic is
at its best.
</P>
<P>
   If this local garlic is stored properly _ in a cool dry place in
a string bag or garlic keeper _ it will last until February and be
better than anything the supermarket has to offer, which is
commercially grown garlic that has come from thousands of miles
away. Almost 90 percent of the garlic sold in the United States
comes from California.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest differences between local and California
garlic is the basic variety: the former is hardneck, which sends up
a central stalk and is more tolerant of colder climates;
California's is softneck, which has a very small central stem.
</P>
<P>
   Chester Aaron, who grows 87 kinds of garlic in Sonoma County,
Calif., and is the author of ``The Great Garlic Book'' (Ten Speed
Press, 1997), is partial to hardneck garlic. He said commercial
farmers prefer the softneck because it is easier to grow, produces
greater yields, is less labor intensive and lasts longer. But most
softneck garlic has smaller cloves that are more difficult to peel
and, many insist, tastes harsher. (It may just be that it is older
when it gets here.)
</P>
<P>
   Hardneck garlic, Aaron said, ``has a span of tastes that is far
wider than softneck. Whenever I do a tasting I will put out both,
and people's response is always that the hardneck is far
superior.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences were certainly clear when Mrs. Nosonowitz sat me
down to taste her products, freshly minced and offered on a spoon.
She started me off with her favorite, Prussian White, also known as
Music. It was pungent, with a pleasing aftertaste. Then, we moved
on to Italian rocambole, one of the most popular garlics, somewhat
gentler than the Prussian but still pungent.
</P>
<P>
   German White was quite strong, with heat that hit at the back of
the throat; Marino was quite mild; German Red, which Mrs.
Nosonowitz said is always the strongest, was obviously different
this year because it was quite mild. Spanish Roja was strong, with
a bite on the tip of the tongue and a long garlic aftertaste. No.
65, not a particularly romantic name, packed the biggest wallop, a
slightly delayed hit at the back of the throat.
</P>
<P>
   The Prussian and the German White are porcelains, with white
skins and little or no purple; the others are rocamboles, which are
tan to white, with varying amounts of purple.
</P>
<P>
   The elephant garlic was, as always, perfect for those who aren't
sure they really like garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Those were my tasting notes, though. Mrs. Nosonowitz's were the
same in only some instances. As with wine, the taste of garlic is
very personal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I tried the chopped-up garlic that had been sitting for a
while. All of it was much gentler because its volatile oils begin
to dissipate once it is chopped, but the individual characteristics
remain. Spanish Roja, for example, was still more pungent than the
others.
</P>
<P>
   What struck me more than the various levels of bite or pungency
was the lack of bitterness that is so often part of the supermarket
bulb.
</P>
<P>
   After consuming plenty of water and bread, not to mention half a
bunch of parsley, we then moved on to the pesto, garlic puree and
garlic soup. The freshness of the flavors proved the difference
between supermarket garlic and the local kinds.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Alice Waters, who has been credited with reviving interest in
garlic in American cooking and does a garlic dinner at her
restaurant, Chez Panisse, on Bastille Day, summed up the appeal.
``The moment garlic is harvested, it's got an irresistible quality
about it,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``You can eat it raw
because it's very sweet and very pure. But as the year progresses,
we cook it more. Every day that garlic is drying, it's changing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, the first shoots of garlic, called scapes, appear
and develop seed pods on the tips of their very graceful stems. The
scapes are cut from the growing bulbs and used for the delicate
garlic flavor they impart. Some call them garlic scallions; others
think their texture is more like a blend of garlic and green beans.
Later in the season, young garlic, whose bulb looks like a swollen
spring onion, comes to farmers' markets. And sometime in July or
August, the harvest of the mature bulbs begins.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hoffman, the chef and owner of Savoy on Prince Street in
Manhattan, features whole bulbs at this time of year ``because it
is sweeter, creamier and has a smoother texture when it's
roasted,'' he said. ``I buy special garlic. It's local and has
incredible juice and life and has great full flavor, partly because
it's fresh. God knows how long California garlic has been stored.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the owner of Jean Georges, compares
garlic to ginger. ``There are so many different kinds,'' he said.
``When it's new it's very different.''
</P>
<P>
   Savoy, Jean Georges, Picholine and EQ buy La Terre's garlic
(800-909-2272 or 914-266-4320). What they look for are large firm
bulbs, and price is no object. A pound of garlic costs less than $3
in a supermarket, but La Terre's is $3.50 a pound plus shipping,
with a minimum order of $10. Stewart, at his stand at Union Square,
sells his for $1.25 a head ($6 to $8 a pound).
</P>
<P>
   He says the price to some shoppers may seem like garlic to a
vampire, but those who want the best-tasting heads, fresh and firm
with the largest, most easily peeled cloves, are hardly going to be
put off by price. Garlic is like corn and tomatoes: fresh and local
is always best.

   GETTING THE MOST FROM GARLIC &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By MARIAN BURROS
</P>
<P>
   Even with fresh local garlic, there are ways to get more out of
a bulb. Here are a few tips.
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose garlic by weight and size; the heavier it is, the
fresher it is likely to be; large heads have bigger cloves that
take longer to dry out.
</P>
<P>
   _ The more garlic is cooked, the milder it gets: roasting
produces a mild, sweet, nutty flavor; boiling, a mild flavor;
sauteing, a moderately strong flavor with more bite than boiled but
less intensity than chopped raw.
</P>
<P>
   _ Garlic sauteed with onion will almost always burn. To avoid
this, add the garlic at the end.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fresh garlic does not burn as quickly as older garlic because
it has more moisture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use stronger garlic for roasting a chicken; for flans, use a
more delicate variety.
</P>
<P>
   _ The green germ that grows in the center of each clove does not
need to be removed in fresh garlic; but later it becomes bitter and
should be cut away.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not store garlic in the refrigerator. Keep it in a cool,
dry place in a net bag or a garlic keeper so that air can
circulate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chop garlic at the very last minute; as soon as it is chopped,
it begins to change, to lose some of its characteristic pungency.
</P>
<P>
   To make chopping garlic easier, add a pinch of salt, which keeps
the garlic from sticking to the knife. The grains also help crush
the garlic.

   GROWING GARLIC IN THE GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   By RICHARD W. LANGER
</P>
<P>
   What separates great homegrown garlic from just good garlic is a
carefully tended garden, not too surprisingly. And garlic lovers
have just a few weeks to prepare for next year's crop, which should
be planted around the first day of autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Neophytes should know that a clove from an existing garlic bulb
is the seed for a new one: break the bulbs apart and insert the
individual cloves in the soil root end down, about two to three
inches deep and four to six inches apart. All things being equal,
the larger the clove you plant, the larger the bulb you will
harvest next July or August. But the garlic will demand that you
give it a care or two in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The soil for garlic needs to be loose, easily crumbled and well
drained. If the soil is hard packed, clayey or gravelly, it will
not allow the bulb to expand as it grows. Small, soil-squished
bulbs sometimes develop a more intense flavor, but the effect is
usually disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Raised beds filled with rich soil supplemented with sand, bone
meal, ash and other sources of minerals give garlic an excellent
footing. But if you use raised beds or grow garlic in containers or
on a terrace, make sure the soil never dries out. Garlic likes soil
that is constantly moist, but never wet. Wet soil induces fungus
and blight.
</P>
<P>
   In November, mulch the garlic heavily to a depth of at least six
inches. Come spring, you can just pull the mulch aside and leave it
around the plants for moisture conservation and weed control. It
will break down and enrich the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic originated in central Asia, in a region of long cold
winters, damp cool springs and hot dry summers. Areas of the United
States with similar climates are good for garlic, especially the
Rocambole varieties, which are the closest to their wild cousins in
their growing preferences. Rocamboles and the Silverskin varieties
are more flavorsome than the Artichoke variety from California most
often found in the supermarket. The Artichoke is easy to grow (it
does not need as long a winter as other varieties), but why grow
what you can buy so cheaply?
</P>
<P>
   First-time garlic growers might consider two good-looking
varieties: the Porcelain (golden brown with purple streaks) or the
Purple Stripe. These two are a bit more drought tolerant and better
for those who go away for weeks at a time in the summer and let the
garden fend for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant garlic _ very mild tasting but botanically not a true
garlic at all, but rather a relative of the leek _ is usually
disease free and not bothered by insects, but is a little more
frost sensitive. With so many varieties to try, a garlic grower is
never bored.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest your garlic when the leaves have half yellowed. Lift,
don't pull, the bulbs out with a spading fork so as not to damage
the stems. If you bruise the crop, it will not store well.
</P>
<P>
   Let the bulbs lie and cure in a dry, cool shaded place. In two
to four weeks you can cut off the stem and not be overwhelmed by
the smell of garlic. Remove all but a quarter to a half inch of
root and an inch of stem. Store the bulbs as close to 50 or 55
degrees as possible in an area with good air circulation. Cardboard
egg cartons (but not plastic) work well as containers.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sushi and sashimi opened the door to raw fish; salmon
tartares and tuna carpaccios took it beyond Japanese restaurants
and onto mainstream tables everywhere. Now, ceviche has expanded
the world of flavors and textures created in fish when no cooking
is involved.
</P>
<P>
   This simple preparation, which has long been everyday fare in
Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Mexico, essentially consists of
marinating small pieces of fish fillets or shellfish in citrus
juice and seasoning them with red onion and herbs or chilies. They
are transformed by the marinade, leaving them lightly pickled but
still raw. It's a formula, a culinary blank canvas, that begs to be
varied, and it's one that need not intimidate home cooks.
</P>
<P>
   American chefs are certainly taking up the challenge, tackling
ceviche with a Picassoesque fervor and coming up with an inventive
style that often eliminates _ or greatly abridges _ the traditional
marination.
</P>
<P>
   Le Bernardin, the Lenox Room, The Local, Oceana, ``21'' Club,
Quilty's and Bond Street are just a few places that include ceviche
among their appetizers. At Balthazar, the giant seafood platters
placed on table stands include ceviche in addition to shrimp,
mussels, lobster and clams and oysters on the half shell.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these new-wave ceviches incorporate ingredients unlikely
to be encountered in a cevicheria in Quito, Ecuador, like
pomegranate seeds, pistachios, ginger, balsamic vinegar and soy
sauce. But then they are usually made to order like selections at a
sushi bar, rather than steeping in their marinades for hours. The
texture is less chewy, and the flavor is certainly fresher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ceviche has now become just a step away from sushi and
sashimi,'' said Aaron Sanchez, who has worked at several nuevo
Latino places, including Patria, and who will be the chef at Isla
when it opens in October in Greenwich Village. Diners have become
more accustomed to raw fish, he said, and the other ingredients in
his ceviches, like strips of toasted coconut, become ``little
punches of flavor'' that do not camouflage the fresh fish.
</P>
<P>
   The ceviches Sanchez is creating to serve on a platter for two
at Isla sparkle with flavor and character. The velvety richness of
raw tuna is enhanced by the salty tang of soy sauce; the sweetness
of scallops in coconut milk is balanced by lime and chilies; tender
squid is tossed in a vibrant herb dressing, and oysters are
sharpened with onion, chilies and vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional acidic marinade literally transformed the fish,
essentially ``cooking'' it, but also rendering it chewier. And
that's why chefs are abandoning it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the quality of the fish we get now, you don't want to
mask anything,'' said Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin. Where
ceviches are now on the menu. ``Everything is flash-marinated these
days. They're even changing the way they do it in Peru. It's
better, because with longer marinating, the fish gets too firm and
loses its identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripert, who has visited South America several times, has
developed a ceviche made with sea urchin, cilantro, lime and a drop
of vodka, and another combining scallops, lemon juice and a touch
of olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Kenney's ideas for ceviche are further along than his
restaurant where he plans to serve them, Metrazur, in Grand Central
Terminal. ``My ceviches will be about presentation and flavor, a
cross, in principle, between sashimi and traditional ceviche,'' he
said. ``They'll be a big part of the raw bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ceviches he's working on are some traditional
combinations like tuna with lime and avocado, and red snapper with
chilies, and also others using fresh anchovies with lemon or shrimp
with fresh fennel and a touch of pomegranate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the new flavors and seasonings, and even the
revolutionary speed with which ceviches are now being made,
tradition has not been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs are still using citrus, onion and chilies, three of the
hallmarks of the dish, even as they add new seasonings. Nobu
Matsuhisa, the Japanese chef and co-owner of Nobu and Next Door
Nobu, who worked in Peru for many years, said that red onion is one
of ceviche's defining ingredients, and that he would never make a
ceviche without it.
</P>
<P>
   Another characteristic of a classic ceviche, the cut of the
fish, remains an essential to the new versions.
</P>
<P>
   The seafood is usually cut in uniform small chunks, as
distinguished from the extremely fine dice of a tartare, the little
slabs of sushi or the sheer, almost translucent slices of a
carpaccio or its Japanese cousin, usuzukuri. A type of ceviche
called tiradito in Peru, though, is made with thin slices of fish,
not chunks. At Bolivar, the tiradito of sea bass is accurately, if
cross-culturally, described on the menu as carpaccio.
</P>
<P>
   Matsuhisa said that tiradito is similar to ceviche but is made
by tossing thin slices of fish in a bowl with citrus juice and
seasonings. A similar Mexican dish is called tiritas. In her book,
``Cuisine of the Water Gods'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1994), Mexican
food writer Patricia Quintana described the dish as similar to one
made by indigenous fishermen on the west coast of Mexico, around
Zihautanejo, near Acapulco, that was described by Vasco Nunez de
Balboa, a Spanish sailor who landed there in 1513.
</P>
<P>
   Not all ceviches are made with raw fish. Shrimp, lobster,
mussels, octopus, squid and sometimes clams and conch are lightly
cooked before being marinated. Ceviches with no seafood at all are
also typical in South America, however new wave they sound in New
York. Frederic Kieffer will be serving an avocado ceviche garnished
with a tomato granita at the soon-to-open Southwest NY in the World
Financial Center.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the ceviche bar, like those at Bolivar, Sonora
and Patria, may also sound innovative, but in Latin America
cevicherias usually offer more than a dozen different ceviches,
often served with popcorn or roasted corn to nibble alongside, and
in Peru, with chunks of baked sweet potato.
</P>
<P>
   At tables or at the bar at Bolivar, customers can select from a
list that includes ceviches made with fluke, tuna, octopus and
oysters as well as a tiradito. Lime and hot peppers figure in most
of them. Sonora offers an array of mixed seafood ceviches,
including a Peruvian black ceviche made with squid ink; an
Ecuadorean ceviche with a three-citrus marinade; a Colombian
version with vinegar and chives in addition to citrus, and a
Chilean one that has a dash of mustard in the marinade.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Sonora, those who are interested can even try a Peruvian
custom of drinking the marinade juices as a pick-me-up (and a
hangover cure) after eating the ceviche. The tangy, murky liquid
served in a shot glass is called leche de tigre or tiger's milk. At
Bolivar, it's to be sipped off the saucer. It's an acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, ceviche is not. For the home cook, top-quality
seafood is essential. When in doubt about the freshness of the tuna
or the red snapper at your neighborhood fish market, substitute a
more reliable seafood like cooked shrimp. All the other ingredients
for ceviche are produce-stand regulars.
</P>
<P>
   The cutting of seafood for ceviche also does not require the
kind of expert knife work demanded by a sashimi, tartare or
carpaccio recipe. A simple half-inch dice is perfect. With the new
quick-marinating technique, home cooks can have bright-tasting
ceviches on the table in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The tiger's milk is optional.

<P>
   The Chinese have the perfect antidote to a late-summer heat
wave: cold wheat noodles, served with a piquant sesame sauce. The
soothing noodles are ice, the sauce fire, in the form of chili
paste, ginger and garlic.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably as many versions of this traditional Sichuan
dish, called dan dan noodles, as there are individual cooks. But
the Chinese are hardly the only Asians to have discovered that hot
weather requires cool thinking. The Japanese and Koreans also beat
the heat with an array of flavorful cold noodle dishes that are
irresistibly refreshing, whether you sample them in a restaurant or
make them at home.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best cold soba noodles this side of Tokyo can be
found in SoHo, at Honmura An. In this cool, Zen-like space, with
its high ceilings and uncluttered decor, you can watch the
buckwheat noodles being kneaded, rolled out and cut by hand. The
flour is ground on the premises, so of course the soba is
exquisite. But what really shows off the noodles is a cool,
delicately flavored broth that plays the briny tang of bonito
flakes and soy sauce against the sweetness of sake and mirin, a
sweet rice wine.
</P>
<P>
   Cold soba comes two ways at Honmura An _ in broth in a bowl or
on a plate with the broth served separately as a dipping sauce.
Accompaniments range from simple (slivered nori seaweed or bonito
flakes) to elaborate (sticky nameko mushrooms or gooey pearls of
ikura, salmon roe). And almost always, there's a fiery wallop of
wasabi.
</P>
<P>
   Honmura An's owner, Koichi Kobari, said the true connoisseur
prefers to eat soba cold. ``Hot broth makes the noodles swell,'' he
said, ``so you can better appreciate the texture of the soba when
it's served cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating cold soba calls for a personal touch: you stir in chopped
scallions, slivered nori, wasabi and other flavorings to suit your
taste.
</P>
<P>
   One dish found everywhere in Seoul, South Korea, mool naeng
myun, raises noodle soup to the level of art. It features slender
buckwheat noodles in an icy beef broth with a kaleidoscopic
assortment of sliced beef, pickled cucumbers, hard cooked eggs,
Asian pear and radish. For the diner, the dish is a study in
contrasts: chewy beef, crunchy cucumbers, chilly broth and hot
Chinese mustard.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes here may require a trip to an Asian market, but
natural-food stores may carry some items, too. For an impromptu
meal, I sometimes take an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach
to the cold noodle, combining flavorings from several different
Asian cuisines. The noodle salad here contains fish sauce and basil
from Thailand and lemongrass and chili paste from Vietnam, with an
ecumenical sprinkling of peanuts and bean sprouts for crunch. I
can't think of a better dish for lunch or light supper when the
weather runs to Indian summer.
</P>
<P>

WHERE ARE THE LOST CHICKS?
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies DIXIE CHICKS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before ``Wide Open Spaces,'' bare midriffs, blond ambition and
the occasional cuss word onstage, the Dixie Chicks were four
cowgirls of differing ages, hair colors and musical direction,
united by fringe and pearl snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank heavens,'' they sang, ``for Dale Evans.''
</P>
<P>
   Where are they now, those lost Chicks with the bluegrass ballads
and eccentric cowgirl style?
</P>
<P>
   Robin Macy, the first of the original Chicks to get walking
papers, doesn't like to talk about the experience or give
interviews, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   She married guitarist Mark Bennett and is living in Kansas City,
where they have transformed an arboretum into a one-of-a-kind
house. The two of them still perform informally.
</P>
<P>
   After her departure from the Chicks, Macy participated in
several musical ventures in the mid-'90s, notably the Domestic
Science Club with Sara Hickman, an eclectic/folk trio that released
a critically praised album.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Lynch, the bubbly brunette with the stand-up bass, married
Weatherford, Texas, cattleman Mac Tull after she was eased out of
the lineup. Now, she presides over a three-teen-ager household: her
daughter, Asia, 18 in September; and Tull's children, Meriwether,
16, and Christopher, 13.
</P>
<P>
   She first met Tull, a family friend, when she was 16, and he
would go out to her father's ranch in Dell City _ to take her
sister out.
</P>
<P>
   ``She sort of bequeathed him to me,'' Lynch said, laughing. ``I
ran into Mac again in '96 at an open house at Eagle Audio, and we
both said, `There you are.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch manages to keep busy in her post-Chick life, which has led
her full circle to the real Dale Evans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite thing I'm most excited about is the Cowgirl Hall
of Fame, and the groundbreaking this year,'' she said. ``It's such
a uniquely American museum, and Fort Worth was really on top of
things to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch is on the capital campaign committee, ``my
out-of-the-house deal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the music business, ``I'm still dreamin' about it,''
Lynch said. ``But it takes so much energy, and the blessing and
luck of it is, it takes chemistry. And you don't just go out and
find that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch tries to keep up with all current and former Chicks, band
members, agents and others, and spurns offers of solo gigs.
Someday, she says, she might put a band together and do something
low-key.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an `us' girl, not a `me' girl,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, relations are cordial with the current Chick
lineup, Lynch said: ``Martie and Emmy keep up with me more than
ever now.''
</P>
<P>
   She often comments on the early Chicks for media and television.
Her worst nightmare? Bad pix of the early Chicks that keep
surfacing, from TV to tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we had our cute days,'' she pined, ``but they always
run something ancient and heinous.''

REACHING FOR THE SKY: CHICKS `FLY' TO NEW HEIGHTS WITH SECOND
EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies DIXIE CHICKS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone obviously forgot to tell the Dixie Chicks about the
dreaded sophomore slump, in which a band puts out a great first CD
and then a miserable-by-comparison second.
</P>
<P>
   Released Tuesday, ``Fly,'' the follow-up to the trio's
6-million-sold-and-counting 1997 debut, ``Wide Open Spaces,'' is
fairly amazing on two fronts: One, that it's just so darned good,
and two, that it was made under so much pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not kid ourselves _ amid all the shows, all the interviews
and all the travel, making a weak follow-up would have been, well,
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't happen: This 13-song CD is the equal of the first and
maybe, just maybe, better. No kidding. ``Fly'' is the real deal, a
batch of sometimes bitingly funny, wickedly sexy or heartbreakingly
sad songs about love lost and found, raising a little hell _ see
the hilarious ``Sin Wagon'' _ and, on ``Goodbye Earl,'' making an
abusive ex disappear. Permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Empowerment-country is all the rage these days, but lead
vocalist Natalie Maines, fiddle player Martie Seidel and banjoist
Emily Robison have a lock on it, a knack for looking at young women
in various situations and making each one believable.
</P>
<P>
   You believe Maines whether she's looking at the joy of found
love on ``Cowboy Take Me Away,'' having a simple good ol' time on
``Some Days You Gotta Dance,'' staying away from a bad boy on the
Buddy Miller/Jim Lauderdale-penned ``Hole in My Head,'' or finding
the courage to let go of a relationship that just isn't going to
work, as on the quiet closer, Patty Griffin's ``Let Him Fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the perspective, these songs ring true, and the Chicks
and their studio buds (including steel guitarist and Natalie's
daddy, Lloyd Maines, and excellent organ players Steve Nathan and
Matt Rollings) rip through them like music's going to be made
illegal tomorrow. Blistering instrumental trade-offs are the rule
here but are most impressive on ``Cowboy'' and the breakneck ``Sin
Wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   And the harmonies? As was expected, fab.
</P>
<P>
   It's now apparent that ``Wide Open Spaces'' wasn't a fluke, and
that by balancing perspectives and story lines and singing like
barroom-savvy angels, this trio is going to be one of country's
finest for years to come. Perhaps two of the tunes here _ ``Without
You'' and ``Heartbreak Town'' _ are just OK, just good country
music. Otherwise, ``Fly'' takes off and doesn't look back.

   UNDATED _ There are two official Alamos in Texas. There is the
one that's in the heart of San Antonio, with the traffic congestion
and street noise that fill most major downtown areas. Then there is
the one in Bracketville, 150 miles away on the Southwest Texas
prairie where longhorns lie in sparse shade, rattlesnakes curl up
under rocks, and cactuses spring from hard-pan soil. It is quiet
there. The way it should be at a Spanish mission. Also, it was
there that John Wayne, dressed like Davy Crockett, whopped the
advancing troops of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna over the head with
the butt of his muzzleloader. No wonder people get the authenticity
of the two Alamos confused. By ART CHAPMAN. Story has moved in

GOVERNMENT SAYS HOTEL EMPLOYEE ADMITS TO GRUESOME KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A motel handyman directed the FBI to the
bloodstained knives he said he used to behead a Yosemite National
Park naturalist last month and to slash the throat of a teen-age
tourist in February, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Stayner, 38, also admitted to sexually assaulting the
teen-ager, Juli Sund, and her friend Silvina Pelosso before killing
them, the records said.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, filed in federal court in Fresno on Monday, are
the most detailed account yet of Stayner's reported confession to
FBI agents to the killings of Armstrong in July and Sund, her
mother, Carole, and their friend during a sightseeing tour of
Yosemite National Park in February.
</P>
<P>
   The knives Stayner said he used to decapitate Armstrong and
slash Juli Sund's throat appeared to have dried blood on them, and
investigators expected to lift fingerprints and other trace
evidence from them, the FBI said in the six-page affidavit seeking
samples of Stayner's hair, blood and saliva.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Stayner, Robert Rainwater, fought the
request to give the samples to the FBI, but U.S. Magistrate
Lawrence O'Neill signed a warrant Monday ordering Stayner to
comply.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner has been charged only in the Armstrong slaying. Although
he reportedly confessed to FBI investigators, he has pleaded not
guilty to the killing. Investigators say Stayner is the prime
suspect in the killings of the Sunds and Pelosso and sources have
said that he will probably be charged with those crimes before his
next scheduled court appearance on Dec. 2 in Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 26, was killed July 21 near her home in Foresta,
Mariposa County.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund, 42, Juli Sund, 15, and Pelosso, 16, a family friend
from Argentina, disappeared on Feb. 15 after checking into the
Cedar Lodge outside of the Yosemite National Park. Stayner had
lived and worked as a handyman at the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   The charred remains of Carole Sund and Pelosso were found March
19 in the trunk of their burned rental car. Juli Sund's body was
found a week later near Don Pedro Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   In a jailhouse interview with a television reporter shortly
after his arrest on July 24, Stayner admitted to the killings but
denied sexually assaulting any of his alleged victims.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to the affidavit, Stayner told investigators that
on Feb. 15, he ``sexually assaulted Juli Sund and Silvina Pelosso
and murdered both Carole Sund and Silvina Pelosso.'' He admitted to
entering the room of the three tourists at the Cedar Lodge and
binding them with duct tape. He left the room with Juli Sund and
killed her later, the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, Stayner became a suspect in the
Armstrong case after a Yosemite employee reported seeing a white
and blue International Scout, identical to the one owned by
Stayner, parked near Armstrong's home on the night the naturalist
was killed. A second park employee told the FBI he picked up a
hitchhiker near a similar International Scout later that same
night.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, investigators compared tire tracks found at the
Armstrong crime scene with the tire tread on Stayner's Scout and
found a possible match. The next day, Stayner did not show up for
work. Nor could he be found in his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the FBI found Stayner at the Laguna del Sol
Nudist Park in the Sacramento County town of Wilton after receiving
a tip from a woman who met him at the bar there the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did not have an arrest warrant for Stayner, only a
warrant to search his vehicle. But Stayner voluntarily agreed to
accompany agents back to the FBI office in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   There, after waiving his right to remain silent and speak to a
lawyer, Stayner not only described the Armstrong slaying in detail
but also stunned investigators by admitting to the Sund-Pelosso
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, investigators were focusing on a loose-knit group of
methamphetamine users in Modesto. In June, James Maddock, the head
of the FBI's Sacramento office, had said the people responsible for
the Sund-Pelosso killings were already in jail for other crimes.
Stayner had been questioned in February, but was discounted as a
suspect in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit said that Stayner gave details to interrogators
that only the killer would know.

PRINCE EDWARD, TAKING TEA AND MEETINGS, COMES TO HOLLYWOOD AS
PITCHMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood is a town that, for all the mumbo jumbo
about creativity, breeds a striking sameness _ in dress (Armani
casual), in automobiles (anything outrageously expensive), in
speech patterns (``Love ya!''), in ambition (multimillion-dollar
guaranteed contracts) and even in the frequency with which people
talk about seeking something different.
</P>
<P>
   But with the lords of the television industry in turmoil these
days, maybe it is time for the pattern to be broken by a
soft-spoken Englishman, one with almost no experience in American
media, a wardrobe filled with the sort of neckties people here
threw away after high school and a fondness for tales of kings and
queens rather than footloose 20-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   Just such a young man has come to America and in a relatively
short time has met with about every power in a town that often
takes more delight in the meetings rejected than the ones taken.
The young man's agent, the courtly Southerner Sam Haskell of the
William Morris Agency, said that for virtually the first time in
his career not a single person had turned down a meeting with the
overseas visitor, and some actually pleaded for invitations to dine
with him. In short order the visitor has lined up agreements to
develop movies or series with NBC, Showtime, CBS, Paramount and the
Fox Family Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast the suddenly hot, newly anointed mini media baron
sat ramrod straight in a navy blazer that he never unbuttoned, pale
blue and yellow tie in a whimsical pussycat pattern and jaunty
brown suede loafers. As he nibbled on fruit and yogurt and sipped
tea (he had to instruct the waitress to let it brew, so unpracticed
was she in the art of preparing a cup in this latte-sipping burg),
he explained that, great ideas or not, his presence here was
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is where the money is,'' said the canny newcomer,
Edward Windsor, who spoke delightedly of ``our business'' with a
brio that showed only traces of the English reserve with which he
was famously raised. Windsor, who is 35 and recently married, has a
checkered business record and, as it happens, is the third son of
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II. He is a prince, but in a realm with
its own notion of royalty he insists on the name Edward Windsor, or
just Edward, and describes himself disarmingly as someone who
``just wants what anyone in this business wants.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that, here anyway, that means money, and
that if he struck it really big he could buy a castle, he replied
dryly, ``Or repair one.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is famous for being jaded and insular, but Windsor
described it as a breath of fresh air compared with the Britain he
knows, and it was clear that he left many executives here
starry-eyed. Since he started his television production company,
Ardent Productions, in 1993, his treatment in the British media has
generally ranged from skeptical to savage, largely because of the
heavy losses the company has accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hate anyone who succeeds,'' Windsor said early in the
meal, served in a private suite with a single security man in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a much greater openness and willingness to take us
for what we are here,'' he added. ``Over there there's more
baggage, if you understand that expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The ardor goes both ways. Hollywood people who have met Windsor
stumbled over their words in talking about their encounters, and
acknowledged that they leapt at project ideas partly because they
would be produced by a real Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Lindy DeKoven, an executive vice president for movies and
mini-series at NBC, recently agreed to develop a mini-series about
Windsor's grandmother, the Queen Mother, and said it was unlike any
other professional experience she had had, particularly the first
lunch. ``I didn't even expect a meeting,'' Ms. DeKoven said. ``I
really just said to Sam once, `If you're having one of your parties
with him, please invite me.' I didn't know this was a pitch meeting
until it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But that did not put her off. She said Windsor had been
talkative and was well informed about his family's background.
``It's not often that you have lunch with a producer who really
knows something about history,'' Ms. DeKoven said. ``I can't put my
finger on it and say why, but it was kind of awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeKoven insisted that she would never commit millions of
dollars to a project just because the producer was related to a
monarch, but she did concede that Windsor was certainly not a
veteran at television.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were curious to know how you sell projects and
everything,'' said Ms. DeKoven, referring to Windsor and his
development executive, Nigel McCrery. ``I was kind of surprised at
some of the things they were asking.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Windsor said he understood that inspiring awe is not enough; he
knows he must prove himself with his productions. So far he has
sold ideas, which may not make it to television screens unless the
quality satisfies the networks.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to produce documentaries, detective shows and
historical dramas, he said, but conceded that he was probably
destined to have his failures remembered more than his successes.
</P>
<P>
   He has had his share of misfires in Britain. ``It's a Royal
Knockout,'' which he produced in 1987, was a game show to raise
money for a charity. The show was generally considered an
embarrassment. He later produced ``Annie's Bar,'' a political
satire that ran for one episode and was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   He started Ardent in 1993 and had his first success with
``Edward on Edward,'' a documentary about his great-uncle, King
Edward VIII, who abdicated the throne in 1936 to marry an American
divorcee, Wallis Warfield Simpson. He was later involved in
``Castle Ghosts of England,'' which ran in the United States on the
Learning Channel, and ``Crown and Country,'' a series on the royal
family's influence over English history, which he narrated and
which ran on public television in the United States. He has started
developing another documentary, potentially for CBS, on the
paparazzi who have bedeviled members of the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   He feels obligated to produce occasional shows about the royal
family, he said, but is much more interested in doing more of the
sort of show ideas he sold recently to the Showtime cable channel.
One is a new movie version of the Mark Twain story ``The Prince and
the Pauper,'' appropriately enough the tale of a prince who trades
places with a look-alike commoner. He is developing two other
movies for Showtime that could involve budgets totaling more than
$10 million if they are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zakarin, an executive vice president at Showtime who is
developing the movie ideas with Windsor, said it had been a heady
experience. ``You do get jaded in this business,'' Zakarin said.
``You meet the Hollywood stars, but there is a curiosity as to how
these guys'' _ meaning British royalty _ ``are different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I tell my wife before I went to the first meeting that I
was meeting a prince?'' Zakarin asked. ``Sure I did.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was impressed that Windsor clearly intended to be
intimately involved in the productions and not just lend his name.
``He does what all real producers are supposed to do but often
don't,'' Zakarin said. ``He picks up the phone and calls the talent
and asks them to get involved in the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Windsor said he liked that part of the job best, mixing with
commoners in a common enterprise and feeling useful. ``I do enjoy
it because it's what the business is all about,'' he said. ``You
feel like you're part of the team. Our business demands that.''

WHEN NICE PEOPLE GET BAD TABLES AT GOOD RESTAURANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eat out enough in this city, and chances are some
maitre d'hotel is going to stick you in Siberia. Once used for the
tourist-trap second floor at the old Russian Tea Room, the term
Siberia has become a metaphor for second-class seating.
</P>
<P>
   To the right of the door at Nobu. The frisbee-size table at the
entrance of Balthazar. Behind a column at Mercer Kitchen or Pop. In
any place's obvious bad-table zone: a drab tacked-on room, next to
a swinging kitchen door or the restrooms, within earshot of a
nerve-jangling service station.
</P>
<P>
   With more restaurants opening than at any time in recent history
_ some 50 this fall alone _ and more money behind them for space
and design, bad tables should have been wiped out, like smallpox.
But Tim Zagat, publisher of the restaurant guides, estimates that
his office sees 30 complaints a day on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Are there really so many bad tables at good restaurants? If
there are better tables open, why do paying customers so often get
the dogs? Most importantly, if a diner is dissed by a lousy
location, what is he or she supposed to do about it?
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Palmer, who owns Aureole, is the rare restaurateur to
acknowledge he had a Siberia problem. He had to: He noticed
comments in the reservation book like ``Don't put me upstairs.'' As
a result, the restaurant is redesigning its cramped, loud upper
level. The kitchen is up there, and a table that was right in front
of it has been taken out, with the three adjacent tables turned
into what Palmer called a ``cozy alcove.'' There will be more
fabric and carpeting to cut down on the noise.
</P>
<P>
   There is an element of subjectivity in all this. As Palmer
observed, ``Somebody's idea of a bad table is somebody else's idea
of a great table.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the bar, away from the bar. Banquette or center table. At
Cafe Boulud, some people request the little train-car nook facing
the bar and a service station. Can a tiny place like the Pearl
Oyster Bar be said to have a bad table? They're all equally bad, or
equally good, if you love oysters. At Ruby Foo's, the second floor
is the hot floor. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the main room at many traditional French restaurants,
like La Caravelle, diners have to go through a narrow section with
tables on either wall. Sometimes called the ``royale,'' this can be
considered the hot area both for people-watching and proximity to
the front desk, because the maitre d'hotel or captain can take
better care of you. Or it could be thought of as a traffic
nightmare, like living on a highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key things in life is not to be shy and sit there
feeling bad about yourself,'' Zagat said. Most of the time, they'll
move you, he continued. If not, he added, ask the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Gustafsson, the service director at Gotham Bar and Grill,
said that her restaurant's policy was, ``If somebody is not happy
with their table and we can move them, then we do.'' But as Ms.
Levine found, policy does not always translate into practice.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bastianich, a co-owner of Babbo, said he had reseated
customers up to three and four times.``We call it table hopping,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bastianich, like most restaurateurs, insisted, ``We have no bad
tables,'' but he agreed that ``the perception is that the place to
be is downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained his rationale for who gets seated where.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm working the door, you try to gauge people's
expectations and take advantage of that,'' he said. ``If you see
someone who's not going to care where they're sitting, you give
them a table that's more appropriate for them'' _ like businessmen,
he hastened to add, as opposed to a couple looking for a romantic
evening. Asked what category of customer would possibly want to sit
in the terrible triangle of kitchen-bathroom-bus station, he said,
``The last table is the last table.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs also say that their architects are now more
conscious of hiding service stations, kitchen entrances and the
like. Pia Prevost, a partner in CPS Design, a New York architecture
firm, has worked on several restaurants, including La Fourchette
and the new Southwest NY, scheduled to open next week in the World
Financial Center. ``I try to avoid any view into kitchen area,''
she said. ``The next point is bathrooms. If you sit at a table and
four feet away you can see the water closet, that is not very
nice.'' At La Fourchette, the kitchen is a level below the dining
room.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Nieporent took issue with the hypothesis that anyone seated
in the front right at Nobu is a nobody. ``You make the table, the
table doesn't make you,'' he said. ``The food's going to taste the
same whether you're sitting at one table or another.''
</P>
<P>
   At Nobu, he added, some diners start to protest when the hostess
leads them to the back of the restaurant, ``until they see a
celebrity.'' One glimpse of Robert De Niro and they wouldn't dream
of sitting anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming everyone's worst fears about the judgments made at
the front desk of a supertrendy hotel restaurant, Terrence
Wittmaack described his days as an assistant manager at Heartbeat,
Nieporent's restaurant in the W New York hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all unwritten,'' Wittmaack said (he left the restaurant
business a couple of months ago to become a contractor).
Unfashionably dressed hotel guests ``would be shoved up in the
front by the bar or put in the back so they wouldn't be seen,'' he
said. VIP's in T-shirts and ripped jeans would get the opposite
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to tell you there's not a single bad table in the
restaurant, but we know exactly where the bad tables are,'' he
said. Why assign someone a bad table when a good one is available?
The attitude, he said, was, ``We're going to pawn it off on you,
and if you accept it, great. Then it's like we kind of just
scored.''

2 OF 3 TENORS PAY TO SETTLE TAX DISPUTE IN GERMANY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Luciano Pavarotti has paid an undisclosed sum to a
German court to settle a tax evasion case arising from a lucrative
world tour by the so-called Three Tenors in 1996, the prosecutor's
office in Mannheim, Germany, has announced. Placido Domingo reached
a similar settlement last week; the sum was also undisclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti, Domingo and the third tenor, Jose Carreras, were
placed under investigation for possible tax fraud last December as
a result of a parallel case in which Matthias Hoffmann, the
promoter of the 1996 tour, was found guilty of evading some $10
million in taxes and was sentenced to five years and eight months
in prison. Hoffmann is free on bail pending an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's office said on Monday that Pavarotti had now
also been dropped from the investigation after he made a payment _
a six-figure sum, The Associated Press reported _ to cover
outstanding taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti's New York-based lawyer, Elliot Hoffman, said there
was no question of tax fraud. ``The issue was simply over whether
certain transactions were or were not taxable,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's office said the case involving Carreras
remained open.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of the Three Tenors has not only proved
embarrassing to them but has also obliged them to keep out of
Germany _ and in Pavarotti's case to cancel two concerts in Berlin
late last year _ to avoid the risk of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The tenors were brought together by Tubor Rudas, a
Hungarian-born impresario, who arranged their first concert in Rome
on the eve of the final game of the World Cup soccer tournament in
1990. Similar concerts were organized on the eve of the World Cup
final in Los Angeles in 1994 and in Paris in 1998. It was Hoffmann,
however, who in 1996 persuaded the three men to join a world tour
that included 10 concerts in crowded stadiums in the United States,
Europe and Asia. Many of the concerts were also broadcast on
television, while audio and video recordings generated even more
income. The German court said the Three Tenors were paid $1.5
million each for every concert.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Pavarotti was quoted as remarking: ``Good money, eh? By
God, it's good money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann, 48, was arrested in July 1997 and held in jail until
his conviction last December. Prosecutors said he evaded taxes by
dividing the $1.5 million-a-concert fee for each tenor into
$500,000 in salary and a separate $1 million in licensing income
that was paid to Tenor Trademarks Ltd., an Irish company controlled
by the singers that protects the ``Three Tenors'' trademark. The
prosecutors said Hoffmann failed to pay tax on each $500,000 salary
portion and to explain why such a large sum was siphoned off as a
licensing fee. The case against Hoffmann also involved other events
unrelated to the singers.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the settlement by Pavarotti and Domingo have not been
disclosed, but it is believed to involve some tax payment on the
money sent to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Music critics have often taken a dim view of the Three Tenors
concerts, with their potpourri of hummable arias, folk songs and
musical-comedy favorites boomed out over banks of loudspeakers. But
admirers of the tenors have argued that these concerts have helped
introduce millions of people to the sound of opera and, as such,
have done a favor to classical music.

`THE BUSINESS OF DEATH': ... AND THE CUSTOMERS NEVER TALK BACK
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Been dying to meet the graduating class of the San Francisco
College of Mortuary Science? Here's your opportunity. ``The
Business of Death'' introduces several students who are mastering
the art or craft of embalming, cremating, grief counseling and
coffin-selling on their way to becoming funeral directors.
</P>
<P>
   What has attracted these young men and women to a trade that has
been much mocked and exposed but not fundamentally reformed since
Jessica Mitford wrote ``The American Way of Death'' in 1968? One
student credits God with leading him into the work. Another says he
loves big funerals; they cheer him up, although he has found that
potential dates do not always share his enthusiasm. A woman
asserts, ``I can make a difference.'' And yes, there is the man who
says, ``Someone's got to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So there they are, serving their apprenticeships in funeral
homes where they practice basic and benign chores like removing a
body from an old-age home and pausing to assure a roommate of the
departed in the next bed that her friend has gone to a better
place. A student who tells of having been fascinated with embalming
since he was a child describes how he goes about making the victim
of a messy automobile crash presentable. A couple of trainees are
confronted with some decomposed remains of an unpleasant color and
odor, not to mention maggots. No public viewing is planned.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is an egalitarian aspect to the job. A student
who was at first curious about each cause of death now takes a more
populist approach: ``You treat everyone the same.'' Well, not
quite, since marketing considerations figure in the mortuary
science curriculum. As one aspiring practitioner observes,
``There's nothing wrong with making money.''
</P>
<P>
   So we learn that ``alternative containers,'' which might be
mistaken for cardboard boxes, serve in ``lower-cost situations.''
On the other hand classy coffins, with their highly polished woods,
plush interiors and cunning extras, are on tempting display. A
proprietor explains: ``We don't sell caskets. We provide a room
that has caskets in it for families to buy.'' Another instructor
admonishes the student salesmen, ``I don't want to hear the word
`cheap.''' Bill Kurtis, the host of ``Investigative Reports,'' who
makes harmless comments between the commercials, announces
cheerily, ``The future looks bright for the business of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Useful tips are offered through the hour. The one I took away
with me is to be sure if you're doing a cremation that you have the
right body.

`OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE': WHAT'S UP AT PREP SCHOOL? CULTURE SHOCK
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Outside Providence'' is about the circumstances that plunk Tim
Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy) into a Connecticut prep school classroom,
where he winds up answering ``Hamlet'' when asked to name his
favorite author. He also tries ``NASA'' when asked who launched the
New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dunph, as his friends call him, has not the faintest
desire to make good in this setting, his irreverence sets the tone
for Peter Farrelly's laid-back, raffishly funny 1988 novel and for
this eminently likable film version. ``Outside Providence'' doesn't
have time or piety for the usual coming-of-age hallmarks, and it
doesn't even bother to contrive much of an older-but-wiser happy
ending, unless you count the one supplied by fate.
</P>
<P>
   Farrelly, whose book was somewhat autobiographical (though he is
a doctor's son with a background significantly different from
Dunph's), went on to write and direct ``There's Something About
Mary'' with his brother, Bobby. That certainly qualifies as having
the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There once was a boy from Pawtucket. ...'' reads a road sign
featured in ads for ``Outside Providence,'' indicating that the
``There's Something About Mary'' sensibility is not far from hand.
Both its frat-house raunch and its improbable sweetness color this
account, circa 1974, of a boy from a blue-collar Rhode Island
background who is sent into culture shock by his bellicose father.
(Old Man Dunphy's nickname for his son is notably more coarse than
``Dunph.'')
</P>
<P>
   But ``Outside Providence'' also has an affectingly dramatic side
thanks to Michael Corrente (``Federal Hill''), another of Rhode
Island's finest, who wrote the film with the Farrellys and adds
some of his own experience to the mix. The part of the film that
details Dunph's fractious relationship with his father is
especially potent, thanks to a splendid performance from Alec
Baldwin in a far cry from his usual roles. Beneath that leading
man's exterior is a tough, versatile character actor who can
dominate a story from the sidelines, as the loudmouthed senior
Dunphy does here.
</P>
<P>
   Old Man Dunphy, who spends much of his time playing cards with
the group of like-minded bigots who are his cronies, has raised his
boys alone and has not been made more pleasant by that experience.
And since Dunph, while in Pawtucket, spends his time loafing and
smoking dope with his own no less dead-ended buddies, he inevitably
serves as a lightning rod for his father's angry outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   One day, a stoned fender-bender with a police car seals Dunph's
fate, and the father pulls strings to have him shipped off to
boarding school. Baldwin delivers a very funny evocation of the old
man's benighted side but also makes it plausible that a loving
parent is buried beneath all that bluster.
</P>
<P>
   When Dunph, played with disarming naturalness by Hatosy, arrives
at the school carrying his belongings in a trash bag, it looks as
if we're headed for another sociological skirmish among spoiled
schoolboys and less privileged ones. But one of the most likable
things about ``Outside Providence'' is its way of shrugging this
off, letting Dunph make friends easily, and just sending up the
place's prim atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The movie becomes sidesplitting, more than a few times, when
Dunph's worlds collide: The dean (George Martin) intercepts a
pricelessly lethal letter from Dunph's Pawtucket pal, Drugs Delaney
(Jon Abrahams), who clearly deserves his nickname. Just the dean's
reading this letter aloud, stone-faced, is enough to bring down the
house.
</P>
<P>
   The film, with a ``Rushmore''-like mix of sharply funny
observations and been-there-done-that knowingness, offers an
irresistible sketchbook filled with prep school memories. They
range from Dunph's first love (Amy Smart) to his nerdy roommate
(Jack Ferver) to the eternal dormitory nemesis (Tim Crowe) just
waiting to catch the students misbehaving.
</P>
<P>
   Though the film includes the masturbation gag that has become
the authorial stamp of the Farrellys, it weaves a surprising amount
of wisdom and tenderness into all these antics. Only one
well-meaning extra flourish, in which Old Man Dunphy's gay-baiting
friends (in a group including George Wendt) get their comeuppance,
seems out of sync with a time period that is otherwise flawlessly
captured, Drugs Delaney and all. That effect is enhanced by a
soundtrack full of best-loved radio hits of the early 70's. An
overabundance of familiar songs usually feels like a desperate
measure; this time, it's a jukebox to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Providence'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes colorful
profanity, frequent drug use and sexual references.

WHITE HOUSE LAUNCHES NEW ANTIDRUG CAMPAIGN TO REACH KIDS IN CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With nearly 60 million youngsters returning to
school, the White House on Tuesday unveiled seven new anti-drug
campaigns aimed at reaching children in the classroom, on the
playing field, at home and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're straight with them, kids do listen; so we need to
give our children every opportunity to hear the facts on drugs, and
that means surrounding them with information,'' Barry McCaffrey,
director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy,
said at news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the new campaigns are designed to go beyond
traditional advertising, such as radio and televisions commercials,
to reach children at all times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids spend a majority of their waking hours in school; so why
not use that to help get them the message about drugs,'' McCaffrey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns consist of:
</P>
<P>
   _ A documentary film about a cross-country trip by six high
school students who talked in different places with other
teen-agers, telling them about their own bad experiences with drugs
and alcohol. The film will be shown in 13 cities and distributed to
schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   _ A program to increase the number of reports in high school and
middle school newspapers that show harmful consequences of drug
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   _ The stepped-up use of anti-drug banners at sporting events and
rallies at high schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ The distribution of guides to teachers containing tips on how
to educate students of different ages about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   _ A program by cable TV companies around the country to give
schools, teachers and parents free access to more than 500 hours of
commercial-free educational programming on drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   _ An interactive Web site created by America Online in its Kids
Only channel where youngsters can learn about drugs, alcohol and
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   _ A special Spider-Man comic book series that teaches children
about drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey cited a recent study showing that drug abuse among
12-to-17-year-olds was down 13 percent in 1998 from its 1997 level.
That proves antidrug advertising has begun to change the way young
people look at illegal narcotics and alcohol, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has taken some time, but I believe we have turned the
corner on drug use in this country,'' McCaffrey added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russell Thompson, a 17-year-old student from Richmond, Va., and
one the six high schoolers featured in the antidrug documentary,
said students want information about drugs but don't want their
teachers and parents to preach to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids know the truth about drugs, they're usually smart
enough to realize how bad they are and that using them is a waste
of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Kosterman, a former Seattle high school principal who works
for the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said television,
radio and magazine ads aren't enough to stop teen drug use. She
said the campaign must also involve teachers and coaches because
they, along with students' peers and parents, have the most
influence on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need to hear the message about drugs not just from the TV
but from the people they see everyday in school because those are
the people they know and trust,'' she said.

A CAMP FOR CHILDREN OF GAY PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEVADA CITY, Calif. _ Ten-year-old twins Alison and Jason are
accustomed to the two-mom concept. They've been living in a lesbian
household since they were born. But the world is still unaccustomed
to the idea, so Alison, who like other children in this story asked
that her last name not be used, gets questions from children at
school. ``They say, `How can you be born if you don't have a
dad?'''
</P>
<P>
   To which she responds, ``My mom got sperm from the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' she says, ``they ask, `What's sperm?'''
</P>
<P>
   For one week each summer, Alison and Jason and 28 other children
don't have to explain anything to anyone _ why they have two
mothers or two fathers or two mothers and one father.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Lavender Hill in the Sierra foothills outside Nevada
City _ the only camp in the United States exclusively for children
of gay, lesbian or bisexual parents _ they can be just plain
children.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, Abi, now 16 and a counselor-in-training, has gone
with her two sisters to Lavender Hill from Willits, which she
describes as ``not the most gay-friendly town.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp is the first place she referred to her mother's partner as
her ``other mother'' instead of her ``friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit camp, for children ages 7 to 14, is run by Chris
Van Stone, a children's therapist; Cindy Romero, a former special
education teacher turned real estate agent; and Catherine Brenegan,
a marriage, family and child counselor. Van Stone and Romero are
partners and live in Guerneville. Brenegan is from Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the counselors at this summer's camp were Sonoma State
University students. The counselors are either gay or from a gay
household.
</P>
<P>
   In this way everybody relates to the same lifestyle _ ``no one
has to watch their pronouns,'' said Mary Blanchette, mother of a
camper.
</P>
<P>
   The latest salvo in the battle over gay rights is a California
measure on the March 2000 ballot calling for a ban on same-sex
marriages. It is likely to spur further debate over gays' and
lesbians' becoming parents.
</P>
<P>
   Although state law already defines marriage as between a man and
a woman, the Definition of Marriage proposition was written when it
appeared that Hawaii would recognize gay marriages and force other
states to extend the recognition. Hawaii ended up voting against
same-sex marriage, and so far 30 states have adopted such bans.
</P>
<P>
   A California poll this June showed that voters are split almost
in half over both gay marriage and parenting. Nearly 60 percent of
voters said they think lesbians and gay men can be just as good at
parenting as heterosexuals, but 55 percent oppose same-sex
marriage. The poll, commissioned by the San Francisco-based
Horizons Foundation, which opposes the same-sex marriage ban
initiative, was matched by a Field Poll in April showing the same
level of support and opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But public opinion polls don't matter inside Camp Lavender Hill
nearly as much as lanyard making and who has the gummi worms.
</P>
<P>
   Kavita, 11, from Cambridge, Mass., said her favorite activity at
Lavender Hill was mini-Olympics day. Two years ago Kavita went to a
traditional camp in New Hampshire. When another camper told
everyone in their cabin that Kavita's mother is a lesbian, Kavita
was teased; she told her mother she didn't want to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Kavita is adopted, a native of India, and has two mothers. It's
the last detail that causes her the most discomfort, even though
she says, ``I don't feel I'm different just because my family is
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Stone, who started the camp in 1992, wanted ``a place for
kids to feel part of a community, where there are no secrets, where
they can talk openly and not hold back at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmanuel, a 9-year-old from Stockton, like some of the other
children tells of being taunted. ``Sometimes people at school call
me a faggot and I walk away.'' He liked being where people
understand that you can have two fathers. Otherwise, he said,
``Some people think it's bad, because it's more regular to have a
mom and dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the rainbow flag and the lavender triangles on some
of the art work, there is nothing obvious to set this camp apart
from any other.
</P>
<P>
   As a group the campers seem more mature than many children their
age. Counselor-in-training Abi explained, ``You jump into maturity
because it's a very mature issue. At age 8 you're dealing with
being a minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp director Romero said, ``We don't sit everyone down and say,
`Now, let's all talk about the family.' We let them initiate
discussions. Most of it happens unscheduled in the cabins.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case late one afternoon in the big girls' cabin,
for girls aged 12 to 14. As the group showered, dressed and got
ready for dinner the talk turned to home.
</P>
<P>
   One girl said her father has started bringing his lover to her
basketball games, but it is OK. Another said she tells people at
school that her mother's partner is her aunt. One girl, who's been
coming to the camp since it opened, said, ``It meant a lot at first
to be assured you're OK, but now I'm used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't as cavalier. Peering into a mirror with an eyelash
curler in hand, a 13-year-old said, ``I wish I didn't have to deal
with it. I want to be homecoming queen. I don't want to be beaten
up. But I don't want to change my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizebeth DePrimo, 20, was the only counselor this summer who is
heterosexual, but she grew up in a gay family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the kids like me to be here,'' because they can
relate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Until she was 5, she lived with her mother and father. Then her
mother left home and moved in with another woman. When DePrimo was
12, she moved in with her mother and her girlfriend and the
girlfriend's son.
</P>
<P>
   DePrimo's background is typical of a lot of the campers but not
all, says Van Stone. ``At first we got lots of kids that came from
marriages before a parent became lesbian or gay. Now, more are
coming from lesbian and gay families that started that way.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 8 million to 13 million children are being raised
by gay or lesbian parents nationwide, according to the National
Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. Van Stone refers to ``a
baby boom'' among same-sex couples, of which she and Romero are
part. The two Guerneville women became mothers of twins this March.
Van Stone carried the babies, but the eggs were harvested from
Romero, a process they started a year before the birth.
</P>
<P>
   The biological father and sperm donor is Paul Brombige, a friend
and colleague at Romero's real estate office. Brombige and his
partner, Jeff Morford, were present at the births. All four are
helping to raise the babies.
</P>
<P>
   The twins, who accompanied their mothers to camp this summer,
were a novelty to the older campers, but the method of their
conception wouldn't have raised an eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   Camilla, a 10-year-old with glittery purple nails from
Williamsburg, Va., explained that her biological father, whom she
calls Bucky, is ``my unbiological mom's brother. My mom was
injected with his sperm.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchette, whose daughter attends the camp, said, ``I
understand that everyone needs to live in the real world, and these
children do for 51 weeks of the year. But for one week they get to
be with other children just like them. For one week, they are the
dominant culture.''

A LIGHT LOOK AT THE WORLD IN `NEW ART' AT THE TATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Helped along by the hype, gimmickry and raw talent
normally associated with British pop music, the current boom in
British contemporary art could hardly have gone unnoticed abroad.
In 1996, ``Life/Live,'' a show at the Modern Art Museum of the City
of Paris, introduced young British artists to France. Then, after
drawing huge crowds to the Royal Academy in 1997, ``Sensation,''
the iconic exhibition of this generation, traveled first to Berlin
and will soon open at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   However, if many Britons believe that artistic creativity starts
in London and ends in Glasgow these days, it is simply because they
have not been exposed to non-British contemporary art of late. Now,
the Tate Gallery is making amends with ``Abracadabra: International
Contemporary Art,'' a show running through Sept. 26 that brings
together work from nine countries by 15 artists ranging in age from
29 to 45. To judge by the crowds visiting the exhibition, it is
news that contemporary art also exists abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, three artists from France and Belgium, two from
the United States and Britain and one each from Italy, Brazil,
Japan, Spain and Germany are variously presenting sculpture,
photography, video, installations, drawings and even painting. As
for the problem of organizing such an eclectic group,
``Abracadabra'' has found a daring solution by displaying the work
in a single large space, in the process creating something of the
feel of a fun palace.
</P>
<P>
   The light mood in turn underlines one difference between this
international group and the British artists collected by Charles
Saatchi and presented in ``Sensation.'' Much of young British art,
whether Damien Hirst's dissected animals, Jake and Dinos Chapman's
disturbing mannequins or Richard Billingham's photographs of his
working-class family, suggests almost existentialist malaise. In
contrast, ``Abracadabra'' is often mischievous and, above all,
humorous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The London art scene has American bias, but this show leans
towards Continental Europe,'' wrote Mark Sladen in The Independent
on Sunday, noting that the show's main organizer, Catherine
Grenier, is a curator at the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris.
``The London galleries love painting and sculpture, but this show
offers more transitory media and participatory works. And London's
trendier artists tend to go for big themes and big statements,
whereas this show is characterized by an oblique, whimsical
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Entrenched critics of contemporary art, of course, have not been
won over. ``Though the Tate apparently resents it, comparison with
`Sensation,' the Saatchi circus at the Royal Academy two years ago,
is inevitable,'' wrote Brian Sewell, the drum-beating art critic of
London's Evening Standard, ``for `Abracadabra' is imbued with the
same overwhelming sense of the tacky, the tawdry and the pointless,
the urge to shock for no good reason, the whim to tickle fancy with
the childish and the frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Maurizio Cattelan's ``Twentieth Century
(Novecento),'' a dead horse with leather harness that hangs from
the ceiling of the Tate's lobby, is reminiscent of Hirst's defunct
animals. And predictably, it has provoked protest from Britain's
legions of horse lovers (Hirst is perhaps lucky that shark and cow
lovers are less vociferous).
</P>
<P>
   But in the show's main space, there are no echoes of
``Sensation.'' Cattelan's ``Stadium,'' a table-soccer game with
positions for two full 11-member teams, invites participation,
while his ``Bidibidobidiboo,'' a taxidermic squirrel sitting
slumped over a tiny table, with a miniature pistol suggesting a
suicide, is more Dada than depressing.
</P>
<P>
   Narrative is present in many of the works. Belgium's Patrick
Corillon, for instance, often recounts the life of a fictional poet
and composer, Oskar Serti. ``At the Station'' has Serti awaiting
his friend, Catherine de Selys, on a railroad platform, with each
portrayed full length on opposite sides of a large wooden board,
their faces cut out as in seaside photo booths. ``Oskar Serti's
House'' comprises five doors leading to dark spaces where visitors
can sit and listen to episodes of Serti's life.
</P>
<P>
   France's Pierrick Sorin focuses on his own life in many of his
droll videos. In ``Awakenings,'' he appears briefly and sleepily on
successive mornings as he mumbles excuses about going to bed too
late and drinking too much to be able to work. The exhibition
catalog explains that it is about ``the human desire for
rejuvenation and renewal,'' but the piece is simply funny because
it is familiar. In another work, ``I Have Kept My Slippers on So
That I Can Go to the Bakery,'' six television monitors show
different images of books tumbling on Sorin's head. His homage to
slapstick cinema is undisguised.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium's Eric Duyckaerts plays with the absurd in his ``Two
Thumbed Hand'' series in which, through drawings, sculptures and
video, he solemnly argues the benefits of an evolutionary mutation
that results in a symmetrical hand, with two thumbs and four
fingers. In ``How to Draw a Square,'' he appears in a video as a
lecturer who hides the simple in obscure language and, in the words
of the catalog, ``deconstructs and reconstructs the didactic
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Two British artists, Paul Noble and Emma Kay, neither present in
``Sensation,'' offer new twists to conventional narrative. Noble's
``Doley'' series includes a comic strip peopled by geometric shapes
representing social outcasts struggling to make ends meet. In ``The
Bible from Memory'' and ``Worldview,'' Ms. Kay reduces the Bible
and the history of the world to one sheet of small print text that
forces the vagaries of memory to provide the connections.
</P>
<P>
   The show also includes works by the Americans Katy Schimert and
Keith Edmier, Brazil's Vik Muniz and Spain's Fernando
Sanchez-Castillo, but the work that has awakened most interest is
Momoyo Torimitsu's ``Miyata Jiro,'' a crawling robot that resembles
a life-size Japanese businessman who drags himself along the ground
with a look of steadfast determination. He is, Ms. Torimitsu notes
dryly, ``a soldier of the Japanese corporate empire who invades
foreign economies for the motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying videos show the robot performing on Wall Street,
with Ms. Torimitsu walking beside him dressed as a nurse and
occasionally tending to him with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   In a catalog essay, Ms. Grenier said that what many of these
works have in common is a new theatrical sense of reality that
enables them to connect art and life. ``The central place is
occupied not by art, subject or society, but by humanity,'' she
writes. ``Man is thus looked at with a gaze that is neither
narcissistic nor ideological, neither soppily benevolent nor
sadistically cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   The result turns out to be something unusual for contemporary
art: visitors walk out of the show feeling good about the world.  &QL;

`PEARL' JAM: THESE DAYS, EVERYBODY LOVES JANIS JOPLIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long before the end, in July 1970, Janis Joplin and her Full
Tilt Boogie band plays on a multiband caravan traveling through
Canada. July 4, 1970, finds them in Calgary, and during the show
she introduces ``Little Girl Blue,'' a song she first heard from
Nina Simone. Joplin has been living a hard life for years, she's
tired and lonely and probably on heroin, which will kill her three
months later.
</P>
<P>
   But for the four minutes of ``Blue,'' Janis Joplin is a blues
singer nonpareil. ``Sit there, count your fingers,'' she coos
softly, her voice dripping sorrow. ``What else, what else can you
do? Honey, I know how you feel/I know you feel that you're
through.''
</P>
<P>
   The song is directed at a lonely young woman, but there's no
question that ``Pearl'' (as she was often known) is singing it to
herself, soothing the pain that was a constant part of her journey
from a teen oddball in Port Arthur, Texas, to a folkie oddball in
Austin, Texas, to the psychedelic era's foremost female vocalist,
who was found dead in a Hollywood hotel room at age 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue'' had originally been released on the ``I Got Dem Ol'
Kozmic Blues Again Mama!'' LP, but this version, which is found on
the new ``Box of Pearls: The Janis Joplin Collection'' boxed set,
is the keeper, a perfect blues tune from a woman who had long tired
of living them but couldn't find her way out.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, more people are listening to the music she made
than at any time since the flurry of commercial success that came
after her death on Oct. 4, 1970. The LP she was working on,
``Pearl,'' topped the national charts for nine weeks in early 1971,
and ``Mercedes Benz'' and ``Me and Bobby McGee'' became radio
staples.
</P>
<P>
   Set for release next Tuesday, the ``Box of Pearls'' boxed set is
the latest testament to the revived interest in Joplin. Featuring
remastered versions of all four of her studio records _ with
previously unreleased tracks _ and a five-song CD of previously
unheard material, ``Pearls'' is the definitive Joplin.
</P>
<P>
   There have been books about Joplin, and this summer, even a
two-act musical, ``Love, Janis,'' that is due to hit Broadway soon.
Featuring much of Joplin's most famous music, the narrative also is
in Joplin's own words, drawn from letters she wrote home to her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Rock fans have never stopped listening to Joplin: ``Piece of My
Heart,'' ``Mercedes Benz,'' ``Down on Me'' and ``Me and Bobby
McGee,'' have become classic-rock staples, songs that personify our
vision of her as a pioneer and casualty, whose star blazed briefly
and brightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistically, 40 percent of the people that buy Janis' CDs
are 25 and younger,'' said Mark Feldman, senior director for
marketing for Sony Legacy, which is releasing ``Box of Pearls.''
``It feels like a Janis renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the interest in Joplin is tied to the resurgence of
female rockers in recent years, particularly women who lead bands.
Among them and their bands: Sarah McLachlan, Hole, No Doubt, The
Corrs, Liz Phair, Texas, The Cardigans and The Cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the massive success this year of blueswoman Susan
Tedeschi, whose sometimes Joplinesque vocals have made her one of
the most successful youngsters on the blues scene.
</P>
<P>
   Women leading bands was rare when Joplin hit the San Francisco
music scene in the mid-'60s. At the time, the most successful
female acts were coming out of Motown and were shaped by music
executives and dance instructors. A female pop musician was
supposed to be beautiful first and compliant to what her male
managers wanted her to sing and wear.
</P>
<P>
   Joplin, however, was full of contradictions. A carefree spirit
shaping the San Francisco rock scene, she also wrote sentimental,
touching letters to her folks in Texas. Her songs are often about
needing one good man, as she once put it, but she also enjoyed
relationships with women.
</P>
<P>
   Although never conventionally pretty, she exuded a rough
sexiness and a raw, earthy toughness. And even though she could
out-drink and out-sing almost anyone, she also craved being alone
in her little nest, away from the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is why Joplin is appreciated by a younger
generation of female rockers. In ``Scars of Sweet Paradise,'' Alice
Eckols, a Joplin biographer, writes that Joplin was constantly
scared of being found out as an ``imposter, a talentless girl whose
powerful voice fooled people into thinking she could sing.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to longtime associate Sam Andrew, Joplin also had
boundless reserves of good humor and self-reliance. And she really
did ``lead'' Big Brother and the Holding Company and the Full Tilt
Boogie band.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very much a band leader,'' said Andrew, who wrote
``Combination of the Two,'' the leadoff track from ``Cheap
Thrills,'' the million-selling 1968 album by Big Brother and the
Holding Company. ``She wanted to make sure things were organized.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew notes that even though Joplin was lonely and drank too
much, she was also a joy to be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a lot more fun than she's given credit for,'' he said.
``She was real bright and real fast and very articulate. She was a
party on wheels, but not wild like Sid Vicious or Led Zeppelin. She
wasn't a victim; she was very strong.''

FINDING HOPE FOR THE FUTURE, ONE NOTE AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sept. 7) 
 (smw) By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pivotal moment in one of my all-time favorite movies is when
``Harold and Maude'' meet at a funeral. It foreshadows many of the
themes of the movie: Even a long life is short, embrace it fully;
no possession is truly yours; big issues are good and well, but
they too shall pass.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals, admittedly, make better theatrical devices, but to
renew my hopes for our species, I'll take a piano recital any day.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about all those kids in their best pants and
frilly dresses, so solemnly and nervously fingering out melodies.
</P>
<P>
   And not just when it's my kid.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I'm relieved when his piece is over and played well, since
we've heard it 693 times by then and really could do without ever
hearing it again.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole scene _ families sitting together, listening
politely as 23 kids do their best to fill an auditorium or church
hall with song _ warms my cockles.
</P>
<P>
   From the youngsters whose legs dangle from the wooden bench to
teen prodigies whose hands are a blur, piano recitals are proof of
so many reassuring things.
</P>
<P>
   They prove that practice pays off, even if it's done while
grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   They prove that even tiny fingers have memories, that Chopin and
Bach are still alive and kicking, that notes are just black dots on
a lined page until someone's heart gets mixed up with them.
</P>
<P>
   And they prove that a good number of families have decided they
have nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon than gather to
watch children play their recital pieces, even though movie
theaters beckon and water parks are filled and malls are open.
</P>
<P>
   I remember my son's first recital, in the back room of a music
store in Tampa, Fla. He was 5 and had just finished learning his
``twinkles,'' every child's first Mozart. As he walked up to the
stage holding my hand he leaned up and whispered, ``You think I'm
going to make a mistake, but I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right; I did think that. And he was right again; he
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, his recital pieces have become both harder
to master and easier to listen to. Oh, he's had his false starts
and stumbles, even with a piece he's practiced to perfection. But
for the most part, he does himself and his parents proud.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every minute of his nightly practice is a minute he'd
rather be doing 500 different things.
</P>
<P>
   So I make him extravagant promises about piano: That it will get
easier and easier. That when he's 17 and playing synthesizer in a
band, he will be able to have any prom date he wants.
</P>
<P>
   That in a few years he can take drums or trumpet or sax or
guitar lessons and I will gladly pay ... as long as he still takes
piano lessons, too. I'm sure a good number of these promises are
true.
</P>
<P>
   He still gripes, but he practices. And about twice a year, his
father and I sit in pews or folding chairs, holding a program with
the now familiar tunes like, ``Horse Sense,'' ``Lightly Row,'' and
``The Busy Bee,'' and get our fix of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Try it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a kid on the bench, I don't think anyone will mind
if you crash a piano recital.
</P>

 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nearly 80,000 items of baseball memorabilia _ from the
gorgeously historic to the madly esoteric _ that filled the
comfortable home of Barry Halper in Livingston, N.J., have mostly
been packed up and shipped out. About 20 percent of his collection
was sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame, where a wing named for this
collector non pareil has been built. Most of the rest of the
collection will be sold at a weeklong auction at Sotheby's in
Manhattan, beginning on Sept. 23, which, according to Sotheby's,
has a chance to break the house record of $34.4 million set by the
sale of the Jackie Kennedy Onassis estate.
</P>
<P>
   But in Halper's home, some things remain the same. He was unable
to part with some items of value, for sentimental reasons. He was
also unable to part with some items of perhaps little economic
value, for the same heart-plucking reasons. He has held on to books
and photographs signed ``To my friend, Barry Halper'' from the
likes of Joe DiMaggio and George Brett, a lock of Babe Ruth's hair,
a rubber glove once used by a doctor to examine Mickey Mantle, to
name a few.
</P>
<P>
   In Halper's spacious den, which is sectioned off into four
rooms, are empty glass cases and barren areas on the walls. No
longer can one peer into the window in one part of the wood
paneling and see, with a flick of a switch, 1,053 baseball uniforms
come rolling past on a dry cleaner's carousel. Many of the uniforms
are signed; they include those worn by Cap Anson for the 1888
Chicago White Stockings, Jim Thorpe for the 1918 New York Giants
and Jackie Robinson when he played for Kansas City of the Negro
leagues in 1946; others belonged to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Willie
Mays and Pete Rose. (About the only things left on the carousel are
a few of Halper's seldom worn suits and some dresses that belong to
his wife, Sharon.)
</P>
<P>
   Gone from his home, as well as from warehouses where the rest of
his collection was kept, are the baseball treasures he compiled
over a half century. Halper, now 60, began his quest when he was 8
years old and continued it through his years as a partner in the
family's wholesale paper business, now defunct, in New Jersey. He
went about collecting with a determination, a passion, sometimes
with an obsession. The list of what he has got rid of is
staggering. Gone are the myriad baseball gloves and shoes and caps
and bats. One bat, for example, bore the signature of Earl Averill,
the Hall of Fame outfielder, who signed it for Halper a month
before his death. Gone, too, are the mountains of signed baseballs
and photographs and rarest of baseball cards and letters and
contracts and trophies. Alas, gone as well is the first issue of
Playboy Magazine, published in 1953, with Marilyn Monroe on the
cover and in the centerfold. Halper asked her husband, Joe
DiMaggio, to autograph the cover. He agreed but only on the
condition that Halper not show it in DiMaggio's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was going through my collection,'' Halper recalled, ``I
said to my wife and sons, Steven and Jason, `I'll have to keep this
contract of Babe Ruth's from the Red Sox in 1918, and I have to
keep this ball and that bat ... ' And they said, `If you're going
to keep all those things, you might as well start a new
collection,' and so I let most of it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Halper had suffered a stroke a few years ago _ he has recovered
almost fully _ and decided that it could create financial chaos for
his family if he left the collection as it was. ``And I didn't want
a fire sale,'' he said. So he went about looking for a home for it,
and wound up with the current arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Robbins, a spokesman for Sotheby's, conservatively
estimated that the sale would yield $10 million. ``I would hardly
be surprised, however, if it surpassed our record auction,'' he
said, referring to the Onassis sale. Another indication of the
worth of the Halper collection was a $42 million appraisal from an
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Still hanging on the wall in Halper's basement, however, is a
framed letter from 1932 that reads: ``In all my years in baseball I
have received many requests of autographs, balls, bats, equipment,
but you are the first person to ask for some of my hair. Therefore
I feel I am obligated to comply with such a request at least once.
You will find enclosed an envelope containing some of my hair. I
don't know what you're going to do with it, but I hope you enjoy
it. Good luck with your collection. Sincerely, Babe Ruth.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the frame is a lock of the Babe's hair, dark brown with a
few strands of gray. A note beside it reads, ``I guarantee that the
enclosed hair is my own, Babe Ruth.'' The note was addressed not to
Barry Halper but to Matthew Ward, a memorabilia collector from
Ruth's time with whom Halper would have obviously identified.
</P>
<P>
   Halper, whose hair remains as thick and dark as Ruth's and whose
stocky build, in sport jacket and tie, is a scaled-down version of
the old slugger's, walked around his den, stopping at various
places to point out to a visitor what wasn't there and explaining
why he had kept what he had. As he did so, one could sense the
bitter-sweet feeling he had about parting with much of his
collection. (While understanding of her husband's obsession, Sharon
Halper was not reluctant to see the collection go. ``She's not much
of a baseball fan,'' Halper said. ``Besides, I think all the mildew
in the house was getting to her.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``What I kept are some items that I felt personally about,''
Halper said. Many of the objects he kept are associated with the
Yankees. He owns 2 percent of the team, enough to enable him to sit
in the box of the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, when
attending games. (One thing he held on to is a felt yarmulke with
the red-white-and-blue Yankee logo sewn into it. A letter
accompanying it describes it as a gift to Halper from
Steinbrenner.)
</P>
<P>
   From a shelf in the office of his den he pulled off a silver
nail-file case bearing the initials ``GHR,'' for ``George Herman
Ruth.'' ``I rub this for good luck when I'm watching Yankee
games,'' he said. ``Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.'' He
also has the Babe's tweezers, hand mirror, shoe brush, hair brush
and glass tooth-brush case, all monogrammed.
</P>
<P>
   In a glass case nearby, he has a handful of baseball bats
autographed to him, including one from some 30 years ago that
reads: ``To Barry _ the No. 1 collector from the No. 1 home run
king. Best always, Roger Maris.''
</P>
<P>
   Halper pointed out an empty spot in the case where the Averill
bat once stood. He recalled how he had acquired it: He had been
attending the 1983 All-Star game in Chicago on the 50th anniversary
of the first major-league all-star game, in which Averill had
played. ``I saw him in the hotel lobby after the game,'' Halper
said, ``and he was looking very sickly. He said he'd sign the bat
tomorrow. I thought that if he made it to tomorrow it would be a
miracle. I just about begged him to do it now, and we went to his
room, where he signed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next morning I came down to the lobby, and there's a big
commotion. Averill was leaving the hotel in an ambulance, and died
shortly after. I don't want to be callous, but I did get lucky.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   On another shelf Halper has also kept high school yearbooks of
famous players (a 1963 yearbook from Scottsdale, Ariz., includes a
senior named Jim Palmer, star baseball and basketball player, as
well a junior varsity basketball player listed as ``Danny Quail,''
who later became vice president and who himself had at least one
moment of shaky spelling).
</P>
<P>
   A framed cover of a record album on a wall is titled ``My
Favorite Hits, Mickey Mantle.'' It is inscribed with Mantle's own
peculiar brand of spelling, ``To Barry _ You should here me sing!
Mickey Mantle.''
</P>
<P>
   Halper, pausing to look at the album cover, smiled. He had
become friends with Mantle, as well as with DiMaggio and other ball
players. Many came to his home not only to look at his remarkable
collection but also to eat at the table of Sharon Halper, who is
known for her Italian dishes. (Her shrimp fra diavolo over linguini
was a particular favorite of DiMaggio's.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey had a great sense of humor, sometimes a bizarre one,''
said Halper. ``I was in Dallas shortly before he died, and he was
holding a news conference to discuss his liver cancer. He saw me
and hollered, `Hey, Barry, do you want to buy my liver?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey knew that I had Ty Cobb's dentures,'' Halper added,
with a laugh. ``Maybe he was trying to be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Halper wasn't interested in Mantle's liver, but he did covet the
scalpel used in the liver-transplant operation. The surgeon said he
could not be sure which one he had used, but Mantle had another
idea. A few weeks later Halper received a Federal Express package,
and when he opened it he found a plastic glove, with a note: ``This
is the glove from my hemmorid exam. Mickey Mantle.''
</P>
<P>
   Halper framed the glove in a glass butterfly case but discreetly
tucked it in a drawer. ``What should I do?'' asked Halper. ``Throw
it away?''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging from a peg in Halper's den office, meanwhile, is another
glove, but this one an actual baseball glove, which also bears
Mantle's name. In the Sotheby catalog for the Halper collection, a
glove worn by Mickey Mantle, ``circa 1960,'' is listed at $10,000
to $20,000. And what is this one worth?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' Halper said. ``It's my glove. It just happens to be
a Mantle model. But it's from the days I played softball.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, winds near 50 mph and 10 to 15 foot waves battered
portions of the North Carolina Outer Banks as Hurricane Dennis
ceased its eastward drift and stalled 100 miles east of Cape
Hatteras. Wednesday, the clockwise circulation around high pressure
over the Northeast should cause Dennis to move slowly westward,
bringing the threat for windswept heavy showers to eastern North
Carolina. In a weakened form, the hurricane is expected to drift
near the southern Middle Atlantic Coast on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Subsiding air currents associated with the Northeast high will
promote abundant sunshine from the central Great Lakes to New
England. After a cool start, temperatures will rapidly rebound,
reaching the low 80s by midday. An exception will be along the
Northeast Seaboard where onshore breezes bring cool ocean air
inland.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of showers and thunderstorms will erupt over eastern
Texas and Louisiana today as a weak low pressure system interacts
with humid air emerging from the Gulf of Mexico. Farther north,
increasingly humid breezes from the south intercepting a cold front
will set the stage for a few potent thunderstorms across the
eastern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the front, unseasonably chilly air will spread into the
Northern Rockies with the risk for a few snow showers in the higher
mountain peaks of western Montana. Offshore breezes will bring
sunshine and milder weather to the Northwest Coast while sunny and
hot conditions cover the Southwest deserts.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Changes
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hurricane Dennis was a changed storm. An infusion of
cool, dry air from the continent caused the hurricane to begin to
lose some of the characteristics of a tropical cyclone and take on
the appearance of middle latitude storm. The tall thunderstorms
surrounding its center, the heat engine of a hurricane, collapsed.
The strong winds that once hugged close to its core spread out over
a large area and weakened. The storm's eye became a cloud-filled
swirl. Disturbances that share features of both tropical and middle
latitude cyclones are sometimes called sub-tropical storms.

   CHINA-POLLUTE _ BEIJING _ Authorities on Tuesday revealed a
sooty secret long suspected by residents of this heavily polluted
capital: that for vital state occasions, the Beijing government can
switch off the smog. Beijing officials promised to use that power

the 50th anniversary of the communist takeover of China on October

American _ Burger King, Outback, 7-Eleven and Pizza Hut on every
corner, at least outside the historic district _ disappears with
the prop wash. Through the windshield, a landscape from a slower,
simpler time looms on the horizon. But Vieques' fetching appearance
belies its status as a battleground. For decades, Navy pilots have
practiced war on the island's northern tip, dropping tons of
munitions on a deserted zone that in places resembles a moonscape.

 _ SF CHRON   CDs vs. Money Market For the Short Haul 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: I soon will receive a lump-sum inheritance. After paying off the
mortgage, I will have approximately $100,000 to invest. I would
like to park that money safely for up to three months, by which
time I hope to find an investment counselor. Should I choose a CD
or a money-market account or something else?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Either a CD or money-market bank account _ fully covered by
federal deposit insurance _ will do for a short period of time.
Such accounts currently are paying interest of about 5 percent
annually, which translates to $1,250 on a $100,000 deposit if you
maintain your account for three months. Shop around for the best
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that a CD will pay more interest than a money-market
account at the same institution because with a CD, you won't have
the freedom to withdraw your funds without penalty until the three
months are up. There are no such penalties with a money-market
account.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting part of your question is your throwaway
line about ``paying off the mortgage.'' You ought to consult your
investment counselor first. If your mortgage interest rate is lower
than the estimated return on stocks, mutual funds or whatever other
investments your counselor recommends, it might be best to keep the
mortgage and invest more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also, don't forget that paying off the mortgage would deprive
you of a significant tax deduction _ the amount of interest
included in your monthly mortgage payments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Q: My husband is going to retire soon, and we are planning to
move to a smaller home. We heard about Proposition 90, which is
supposed to keep our property taxes low when we change homes. How
does this work, and in which counties does it apply?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: Actually, there are two propositions that protect certain
Californians ages 55 and older _ as well as disabled homeowners of
any age _ from an increase in property taxes when they change
homes. One is Proposition 60; the other is Proposition 90.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 60 permits these homeowners to transfer the current
assessed value of &UR;  &LR; the homes they sell to the homes they buy if
both homes are in the same county and if the new home costs no more
than the sale price of the old home.
</P>
<P>
   This can be a huge benefit for taxpayers who have lived in their
present homes a long time. Thanks to another Proposition _ No.13 _
many people are paying taxes of only a few hundred dollars annually
on $300,000 houses they bought 20 years ago, while their neighbors
who moved in last year are paying $3,000 or so.
</P>
<P>
   The tax authorities of all 58 California counties legally are
required to honor Proposition 60, says Kristine Cazadd, senior
staff attorney with the state Board of Equalization.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 90 covers moves from one California county to
another, but the coverage is less sweeping. The ground rules are
the same as with Proposition 60 _ but only if the county where the
new home is located has authorized the use of the old tax base.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, not many counties have done so, and some of those
that did initially have withdrawn their authorization. The current
list of those that authorize transfers of tax bases numbers only 10
counties: Alameda, Kern, Los Angeles, Modoc, Monterey, Orange, San
Diego, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Q: Is it true that I can delay withdrawal of money from my
traditional Individual Retirement Account if I continue working
beyond age 701/2? That seems only fair because, after all, it is a
retirement account and I won't be retired.
</P>
<P>
   A: &LR;   &LR;  A: Your logic is flawless, but man does not live by logic
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Calderaro, technical coordinator with the Internal Revenue
Service, says you must begin taking withdrawals from your IRA no
later than April 1 of the year following the year in which you
reach age 701/2. ``It's a must,'' he remarks. ``There is no way of
getting around it. It's like Social Security. At age 701/2, you
start drawing it whether you want it or don't want it.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation would be different with a Roth IRA. No matter how
old you get, you never are required to withdraw funds from a Roth _
and you can continue making contributions beyond age 701/2.

WE KNOW THE SUN IS BAD FOR US, BUT WE'RE STILL DOING A SLOW BURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An ultraviolet ray shoots out from the sun and travels 93
million miles through space, hurtling toward Earth in an
eight-minute mission to attack and destroy those who fail to
protect their skin.
</P>
<P>
   The ray is thwarted thrice by its targets who, at the last
second, put up an umbrella, put on a hat and apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   The third time's the charm. The determined ray lands on the back
of an unsuspecting lad who has just taken off his shirt. A warning
label flashes across the television screen at the end of this
public service announcement: ``Exposure to the sun's UV rays can
damage your skin.''
</P>
<P>
   As August melts into September, the public service announcement
serves as a timely reminder: Just because summer is ending doesn't
mean the sun isn't going to get you. And keep getting you. The PSA
is part of The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
five-year ``Choose Your Cover'' campaign, an effort co-sponsored by
the American Cancer Society Skin Protection Federation that urges
Americans to ``Slip! Slop! Slap! Wrap!'' and, whatever you do,
``Protect the skin you're in.''
</P>
<P>
   The federation is a coalition of nonprofit organizations,
government agencies and corporations working together to inform
people how to protect themselves from the sun: Slip on a shirt,
slop on sun screen, slap on a hat and wrap on sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple, but here's the concern: Although overall cancer
rates are dropping, the number of skin cancer cases continues to
climb. Melanoma and basal and squamous cell carcinomas now occur
more frequently than all other cancers combined in the United
States and are increasing, with approximately 1 million new cases
annually _ 80 percent of them linked to the sun's burning rays.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 44,200 Americans are expected to learn that they have
malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. That's up
6 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in skin cancer appears to be related to increases
in voluntary sun exposure. We're apparently asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Skin cancer experts say huge increases in weekend and childhood
exposure to the sun's rays have made a big difference. Blasts of
blistering exposure, especially in crucial early years of life, are
taking a lot of the blame for the increase.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? What we've heard before, but obviously need to
hear again: Protect your skin. The Department of Health and Human
Services estimates that about one-third of adults take measures to
protect their skin from the sun's UV rays.
</P>
<P>
   Three new polls show there is a lot we either don't know about
skin cancer prevention or foolishly choose to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   For example, although health professionals agree that children
under 6 months should not be exposed to the sun's harmful rays at
all, more than 70 percent of people polled for Discovery Health
Media say they believe infants can be protected with sunscreen, and
62 percent think, wrongly, that light-colored clothing offers the
greatest protection from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a typical dry, white cotton T-shirt offers only about
an SPF level of 8 to 10, as does an SPF-15 sunscreen if applied
only sparingly. Closely woven, long-sleeved shirts provide the most
protection; wet T-shirts provide hardly any. Infants should never
be exposed directly to the sun, no matter how much sunscreen they
have on.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also shows that Americans don't understand sun
protection factors (SPF) found in sunscreens. More than half
believe incorrectly that sunscreen with an SPF of 30 offers twice
the protection of a sunscreen with SPF 15.
</P>
<P>
   In a second poll, conducted in behalf of Cancer Care Inc., the
majority of respondents (82 percent) said they have experienced a
serious sunburn that resulted in blistering or peeling, yet
slightly more than half (52 percent) said they rarely or never
apply sunscreen to their exposed skin when planning to spend more
than 15 minutes outside in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of those polled said they have never been to a
dermatologist to get their skin checked for abnormal moles. That
survey also found that men are much less likely than women to apply
sunscreen when they're outdoors, though more men are found to have
melanoma (and die from it) each year.
</P>
<P>
   The third poll, conducted earlier this summer for the Cancer
Society's Youth Sun Exposure and Skin Protection Study, found
almost three-quarters (72 percent) of youths ages 11 to 18 get
sunburned in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Weinstock, chairman of the Cancer Society's Skin
Cancer Advisory Board, says the findings confirm that people do not
use sunscreen properly and do not take other measures to cover up
with hats and protective clothing. In other words, we seem to know
how to thwart those rays, we just don't do it.

</P>
<P>
   Sun Protection 101
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we should be doing to protect ourselves against the
sun's rays:
</P>
<P>
   Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15
liberally on any exposed skin at least 15 minutes before going
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Reapply sunscreen every two hours or more often when swimming or
perspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Wear wrap-around sunglasses to protect the eyes and the delicate
skin around them.
</P>
<P>
   Plan outdoor activities to avoid the midday sun, whenever
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Slip on a shirt, slop on sunscreen, slap on a hat and wrap on
sunglasses.

   Avoid trouble in the garden by knowing which plants are toxic
</P>
<P>
   Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Sept. 2
</P>
<P>
   By Danny C. Flanders
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kids _ and some adults _ eat the darndest things.
</P>
<P>
   That philodendron leaf on the floor looks kind of like the
spinach Mom was trying to get Johnny to eat the night before; and
those plump red berries covering the holly bush outdoors could pass
for the raspberries Suzy likes on her cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the type of plant and the amount ingested, symptoms
of poisoning can range from stomach upset to organ damage and even
heart failure, according to officials at the Georgia Poison Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``For about 80 to 90 percent of the cases, it results in
nothing, just watching for symptoms,'' said Dr. Gaylord Lopez,
director of the emergency information service at Hughes Spalding
Children's Hospital. The remainder of the cases are referred to
area emergency rooms for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The key to avoiding poisoning is knowing which plants are toxic.
Even plants thought to be nontoxic can cause an upset stomach when
eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Most problems stem from the foliage of houseplants or the
berries of outdoor plants, said Paul Thomas, a floriculture
specialist for the University of Georgia Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We average about one call a week, though in the spring it
picks up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the calls are seasonal, especially during the holidays,
when children, attracted to the colorful plants, ingest mistletoe,
Jerusalem cherries and poinsettias. The latter, while not
poisonous, can cause an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Both the poison center and the Extension Service begin by
identifying the plant in order to advise the caller on how to
react. ``Without being able to identify the plant, we can't give
them any advice,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   If Extension staff members have some description of the plant,
they consult the ``Southeastern Poisonous Plant Guide'' and contact
the poison center to determine if there have been other reports of
problems with the plant. ``If we see it's a dandelion or a
poinsettia, we can tell them it's not poisonous,'' Thomas said.
``But if it's something like nightshade, castor bean or oleander,
those are pretty serious, and we refer them to the center.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, staffed around the clock by physicians, pharmacists
and nurses, advises callers to make sure no part of the plant
remains in the victim's mouth. ``We're not botanists, but parents
are pretty good about knowing what's growing in their yards or
inside their homes,'' Lopez said. ``Then we try to figure out how
much they ate and the symptoms they're having.''
</P>
<P>
   Most indoor plants are nontoxic, but three of the most common
ones _ philodendron, dieffenbachia and peace lily _ cause problems
for children. When chewed, their leaves release microscopic
crystals that become embedded in the lips and tongue. If ingested,
they can cause pain, swelling and breathing difficulty, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Most calls about outdoor plants occur in summer, when children
spend more time outside. Most often they result from berries the
child has eaten from plants such as pokeberry, lantana and
pyracantha, but the foliage of ornamentals such as caladiums and
elephant's-ears also holds varying levels of toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious cases, referred to emergency rooms, are ones in
which the person has ingested wild mushrooms and, to a lesser
extent, castor beans, which can cause heart problems, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that most often the kids don't get into that
much of it,'' he said. ``And just because they've gotten into a
toxic plant, it doesn't mean they will experience toxic effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the center gets few calls about poison ivy, poison
oak and sumac, the saps of which can irritate skin with a burning
and itching rash.
</P>
<P>
   And while cows are concerns for veterinarians, most dogs and
cats don't eat enough toxic plants to experience symptoms, Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many varying degrees of poisoning,'' he
said. ``Some plants can only irritate your mouth or cause an
allergic reaction. Some make you sick to your stomach. But others
are very deadly.''

yard. If you need help identifying the plant, take a piece of it to
a nursery, florist or county Extension Office.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Label plants so you can later identify any that have been
eaten.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep houseplants, seeds and bulbs out of the reach of children

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't eat wild plants or mushrooms. (Cooking them does not
make them safe.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Destroy mushrooms growing in your yard.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep children and pets away from lawns newly sprayed with

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Teach children never to put any part of a plant in their
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If any part of a plant is ingested, remove as much of it from
the mouth as possible and call the poison center. Don't wait for a
victim to become ill.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Avoid touching poison ivy, poison oak or sumac by wearing
gardening gloves. If you do come in contact with those plants, wash
the area with warm soapy water right away. Also wash any clothing
or gardening equipment you suspect may contain the plant's sap.

 &HT;    Fall won't be same without Celestine, woman for all seasons
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Sept. 2.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a touch of fall in the air,'' Celestine Sibley
was fond of saying and writing this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it didn't matter whether the touch turned into true cool
that meant the end of summer's sizzle. Or whether we only had a
brief respite before melting again. No, Celestine's touch had much
more to do with heart and senses than with mere thermometers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of life cannot be measured, quantified. So it is with
autumn's embrace. Each year, unpredictably, a moment comes and
takes us across an emotional threshold _ to autumn, a moment much
like one in which a stream of western sunshine bathes a stand of
bamboo in buttery splendor. When that happens, you know the change
has come, independent of shorter days, breathable air and crisper
nights.
</P>
<P>
   And you smile, as Celestine used to, eyes sparkling, a little
more pep in her step, a whole lot of gardening in her head. This is
the time of the autumn renewal. In the garden and in the gardener.
</P>
<P>
   When we found our fall touch, Celestine and I would launch into
planning our mind gardens, talking about what peach trees we were
going to plant, dwarf or full size, where the biggest mullein
stands grew, how lovely was joe-pye weed, whether to dig more
Christmas ferns out of the woods and plant them closer to the house
(Celestine always loved putting them in containers).
</P>
<P>
   Too, a touch of fall always put us in a chinaberry state of
mind. That's because, on one blue-sky day, we trekked to Newnan,
Ga., where a reader friend gave us several of the underappreciated
trees, along with a sumptuous lunch of soup and fried cracklin
bread. Knowing these sweet-blooming, fun-fruiting trees were rarely
seen in her north Fulton County and my southwest Atlanta, Celestine
and I would wonder at autumn whether our gifts would survive the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   We're all touched by fall but not necessarily at the same time,
not in the same way. Yes, calendars mark the season's start, but
that signifies not much. The real mark is individual, carved in the
soul.
</P>
<P>
   This year, I crossed that emotional threshold with more than a
week left in August, when the daytime temperatures still bubbled
past 90.
</P>
<P>
   Browned leaves drifting from stressed trees made me long for
drought-busting rains, but the sight also signaled time's passage
and progress toward cool and cold.
</P>
<P>
   My touch of fall awakened a desire to reclaim the heat-beaten
garden; I cut back the parched cinnamon-colored pigtails of several
Japanese painted ferns and in a week or so noticed renewed growth
sprouting green and fresh. I emptied about a dozen pots of
long-gone perennials, retiring the containers until fresh material
comes along. Soon. Too, I pruned off several pieris branches that
had roasted in the heat, renewing the plant and opening up space
around it.
</P>
<P>
   Experiencing a surge of renewal and a need to assert some
control of my space after giving it up for the summer, I swept the
brick walk down to only two layers of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   And, sensing an eventual chill that would make spicy food
especially enjoyable, I picked enough cayenne peppers (I got a good
crop for a change) to put up pepper sauce, shoving the bright red
and green pods into new bottles of vinegar and recapping them. In a
few months, I'll hungrily slosh that hot juice onto a plate of
collards or a bowl of black-eyed peas and savor the summer,
displacing memories of its searing pain.
</P>
<P>
   These pepper-sauced victuals will remind me of similar meals
enjoyed with Celestine, including the incomparable red beans and
rice that she and her family shared with Lyn and me when we enjoyed
a Sunday visit to Sweet Apple cabin a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That day steamed, but it was so mellow and fine, filled with
good cheer, cold brew and strolls through Celestine's garden and
chats about what we'd soon plant, what would grace our spaces the
next spring. It was all so free and easy, I could swear there was
something fallish going on.
</P>
<P>
   It was back in the 1970s, when I was a member of the
Constitution's editorial board, that I first heard Celestine sing
out with delighted hope from her office down the hall from mine,
``There's a touch of fall in the air!'' Pretty soon each year,
several of us joined her in reciting that restorative line. There's
a touch ...
</P>
<P>
   Even in later years, when she did not say it or write it, I
still thought it. And thought about her, her ever-renewing spirit,
quest for life's rich and varied offerings, her exquisite love for
words. Ohhh, the words.
</P>
<P>
   And, now, still less than a month after Celestine left us after
devoting some 58 of her 85 years to writing for this newspaper,
it's undeniably clear: There's more than a touch of loss in the
air. Fortunately, though, she left a skyful of zestful grace. For
all seasons.

 &HT;    Poisonous Plants of Georgia

<P>
   Most calls to the Georgia Poison Center from parents whose
children have just eaten leaves or berries turn out fine in the
end. But Georgia does have its share of dangerous plants (although
any plant can make a child or pet sick if enough of it is eaten),
and it's a safe bet that knowing what's poisonous will put you
ahead of the game when it comes to protecting your family. That's
where our guide comes in. Here, we feature some of the most common
poisonous plants found in the Southeast, as well as a few of the
most common toxic houseplants. Some of the plants featured below
are more toxic to animals than humans; the severity of the symptoms

 &HT;    The swing's the thing at big metro Atlanta party
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``It's fun. It's energetic. It makes me smile. It
makes my body feel good. And I get to flirt and socialize with
everyone,'' says Kitty Wimbish, a Delta Air Lines flight attendant
who organizes a swing dance party every other month with Robert
White, a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   There you have it: swing dance in a nutshell.
</P>
<P>
   Rob and Kitty's Swing Dance, held in the First Existentialist
Congregation building in Atlanta and promoted mostly by word of
mouth, features a beautiful hardwood floor and a live band, Scott
Janna &AMP; Friends, that plays all kinds of dance music, from waltzes
to rhythm &AMP; blues.
</P>
<P>
   At Reunions, the lounge at the Atlanta Marriott Perimeter
Center, a DJ provides the music when the Atlanta Swing Dancers
Club, with about 340 members, takes over the floor on Friday and
Sunday nights. On Saturdays, the lounge becomes the hangout for
Shag Atlanta, which has about 470 dancin' fools.
</P>
<P>
   These and others like them are the dancers Elizabeth Benjamin
hopes to tap with ``A Natural Ball: An International Swing Dance
Extravaganza,'' at the Gwinnett Civic &AMP; Cultural Center(Ga.) this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, whose sister taught her to swing dance as a youngster
in Jacksonville, is a former production accountant for a film
company who founded the New York Swing Dance Society in 1993. She
now runs Everybody Dances Inc., which promotes and proselytizes
swing dance.
</P>
<P>
   Her company produces instructional swing dance videos and CDs of
swing music; organizes dances, competitions and festivals; and
provides Internet guides and other ways for swing dancers to
exchange information.
</P>
<P>
   Swing comes in all styles and degrees of athletic abandon. The
Lindy Hop, invented by ``Shorty'' Snowden in 1927 to celebrate
Charles Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic flight, takes lots of floor
space for its lifts and flings. West Coast swing, by contrast, is a
``slot dance.'' Dance floors became smaller as real estate prices
rose during the postwar building boom, so swing dancers learned to
move within a narrow rectangle.
</P>
<P>
   Every kind of swing goes on in the Atlanta area. Clubs meet
weekly or monthly in lounges and nightclubs; studios such as
Atlanta Dance World School &AMP; Club Ltd. and City Lights Dance Club
host dance parties where students can show off what they've learned
in class.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin thinks there's more than enough local talent to fill up
the Gwinnett center, which has 50,000 feet of floor space. And she
plans to lure the locals with some top-flight names, including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Frankie Manning, still spry at 85, the man who helped
popularize the Lindy Hop.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Count Basie Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Jivin' Lindy Hoppers from England.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Rhythm Hot Shots from Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Champion dance teams of all ages and swing styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so disappointed I can't go to the whole thing,'' said
Shelley Schumaker of Lawrenceville, Ga., ``but I'll get to
everything I can.''
</P>
<P>
   A resources and marketing coordinator for Gwinnett County Senior
Services, Schumaker took up dancing in October as ``a way to be
active, to learn a new skill, to meet people. And it helps me to
lose weight.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to acquire new steps, the day hours at the
Gwinnett center are packed with workshops on every kind of swing.
``If I'm going to give a party,'' Benjamin said, ``I want everyone
to come.''

JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN SECOND DRAGGING DEATH TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ Prosecutors spared the grisly details Tuesday as
jury selection began in the capital murder trial of Lawrence
Russell Brewer Jr., the second of three white men accused of
dragging a disabled black man to death in Jasper last year.
</P>
<P>
   The racially charged trial, which was moved to the Brazos County
Courthouse to avoid giving Brewer an easy appeals issue if he is
convicted, drew 161 potential jurors. Twenty of them, including
five black women, were excused for a variety of reasons, leaving a
jury pool that includes only 14 blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some evidence in this case that's a little bit rough.
It's a little bit tough,'' Jasper County District Attorney Guy
James Gray told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this case is also very fascinating and very interesting,''
he said, adding that jurors would learn about a subculture of
racists and criminals and would hear testimony about DNA evidence
that can be gleaned from tiny spots of blood or saliva from a
cigarette butt or a beer bottle from the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is just about as serious as a heart attack,'' Gray
added. ``And it belongs to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's 20-minute, low-key talk was in stark contrast to the
speech he gave on the first day of jury selection in last
February's trial of Brewer's former prison buddy and fellow white
supremacist John William ``Bill'' King, who was convicted and
sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Gray shocked jurors, and even the victim's family,
by revealing that James Byrd Jr. was alive and conscious when he
was chained by his ankles to a pickup in the early morning hours of
June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old father of three was dragged more than two miles
down Huff Creek Road east of Jasper. He died when his head slammed
into a culvert, decapitating him. His mangled body lay a mile away,
in the middle of the road outside the gates to a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a different environment,'' Gray explained later,
after jurors were dismissed for the day. ``In Jasper, everyone
thought these were just drunks that went crazy. Now there's so much
out there and people know what happened that night. I thought it
was best not to say too much.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gray said the 12 jurors who ultimately decide this case will
find some of the evidence ``real, real traumatic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of pictures and they're bad. They affect
you,'' he said. ``You don't just walk away from this without being
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's defense lawyers, Doug Barlow and Layne Walker of
Beaumont, cautioned jurors to keep their focus when they hear the
evidence. ``Don't decide this case on some fascination over how the
evidence was collected,'' Barlow said.
</P>
<P>
   And Barlow asked jurors not to use their feelings against the
death penalty as an excuse to get out of jury duty. ``Just being
opposed to the death penalty doesn't prevent you from serving, but
we need people who are able to listen to the evidence and make a
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker reminded jurors that the indictment against his client is
not evidence of anything, and said, ``There is nothing in this
indictment that says Mr. Brewer is a racist. The sole issue is
whether he is guilty or not guilty of capital murder. Right now,
the evidence in this case is at zero.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked jurors to consider the case as seriously as they would
consider their most important personal affairs, and he gave as the
example purchasing a house.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, wearing dark green slacks, a blue shirt, tie and an
oversized cream-colored jacket over a bullet-proof vest and a stun
belt, sat at the defense table, swiveling in his chair and asking
his lawyer for mints. His girlfriend, Tammy Perritt of Como, sat in
the back of the courtroom. She declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Barlow said Brewer, 32, has been
``fairly distraught'' as the trial approaches. ``It's hard to be in
good spirits when you're charged with capital murder, but he's
doing as well as can be expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the 20 jurors excused from duty Tuesday had
medical or child care conflicts, one black woman juror told the
judge that ``something similar'' had happened to her friend in
Mississippi. It was unclear whether she meant that her friend was
killed, and lawyers did not ask her to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining jurors were dismissed by early afternoon, after
filling out a three-page questionnaire, asking routine questions
about their education, work history, church and political
affiliations, and their views on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a dozen jurors will return for individual questioning,
and lawyers said they hope to seat a jury of 12, plus two
alternates, in the next couple of weeks. Testimony is tentatively
set to begin Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Brewer would be sentenced to life in prison or
death by injection. A third defendant, 24-year-old Shawn Berry of
Jasper, will be tried later this fall.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Three of Byrd's sisters and his nephew spoke briefly outside the
courthouse and said they have prepared themselves to relive the
horror of the King trial. Clara Taylor of Houston said starting
Brewer's trial is ``like the same nightmare over and over and over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   But her sister, Mary Verrett, also of Houston, said she hopes
this trial will be easier than the first because there will be
fewer surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least this time, we know what happened to James Jr.,'' she
said, ``so the information will not be as horrific as last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding hands with her sister, Betty Boatner of Jasper, Verrett
said family members now know more than they wanted to know about
Byrd's death. ``But we had to hear it,'' she said. ``Now we know
step by step, moment by moment, mile by mile and we know how he
suffered _ and how he fought.''
</P>
<P>
   Verrett said the family has received thousands of letters since
Byrd's murder, and continues to receive about 100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Many are from prisoners on death row who wrote to say that in
following the Byrd case, they realized for the first time the
impact that their crimes had on their victims' families. Other
people write to say that the case has made them re-examine their
own racist actions, however subtle they may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we can see that something good can come of this,'' Verrett
said. ``We try to answer every one of them.``

   LAUNDER-MANSION (Undated) _ Last September an opulent California

who immediately ensconced his wife and children there. But
Lazarenko has not moved in just yet. He is in a U.S. detention
center fighting a Swiss extradition request on charges of looting
millions from his homeland. With the U.S. investigation of the

federal judge in Philadelphia. ``I'm hopeful, but we're hanging on
a limb,'' said Garcia. The Players Association has rated Garcia,
57, as one of the best umpires in the game for his effort and
competency, but Garcia will be among 22 umpires losing their jobs
after Wednesday's games, barring a legal interception or an
unforeseen truce in the umpires' splintered labor war with Major
League Baseball. By Buster Olney.

BAYREUTH, LIKE WAGNER, SURVIVES THE CRITICS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYREUTH, Germany _ Does Bayreuth's cult of Wagner still matter?
Some mavens say no and stay away. Bayreuth, of course, is the poky
Bavarian backwater where, in 1876, Wagner introduced his mighty
cycle, ``Der Ring des Nibelungen,'' all four evenings and 17-odd
hours of it, before an audience of crowned heads, artists,
socialites and intellectuals. The revolutionary Festspielhaus he
built here, with its concealed orchestra pit and egalitarian
amphitheater-style seating, was meant as a sketch for a more
splendid theater of the future, yet it endured. The second season,
in 1882, brought the first performances of ``Parsifal,'' a mystic
ritual Wagner wished to reserve for his festival alone.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wagner's death the following year, the five other operas
in the canon (``Der Fliegende Hollaender,'' ``Tannhaeuser,''
``Lohengrin,'' ``Tristan und Isolde'' and ``Die Meistersinger von
Nuernberg'') have taken their places in Bayreuth's exclusive
repertory, in productions that always aspire to the definitive. The
festival's (never quite airtight) monopoly on ``Parsifal'' expired
along with the score's 30-year copyright, but for years to come,
Bayreuth continued to set the agenda for Wagnerian interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   In the first decades after World War II, timeless, ascetic,
psychologically profound stagings by the composer's grandson
Wieland Wagner revitalized the tradition. After Wieland's death, in
1966, other pioneering directors carried on. The last thunderclap
from Bayreuth's Green Hill sounded in 1976, with the unveiling of
the post-modern centennial ``Ring,'' directed by Patrice Chereau
and conducted by Pierre Boulez. Since then, wherever opera is
performed, the array of theatrical styles has exploded
exponentially. Iconoclasts from Arizona to Australia are forging
``Rings'' of their own, with or without regard to Bayreuth
precedent. If the festival no longer enjoys its old hegemony, that
is simply a measure of its success. These days, Wagner belongs to
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 80s and early 90s, professional visits brought me to
the festival here every second or third summer. Since 1993, for no
particular reason, I lost the habit. But even in my earliest
seasons, critics and cultural historians galore were looking on
Bayreuth with a jaundiced eye, complaining of interpretive
irrelevance, questionable casting, an inability to come to terms
with the nightmare of Wagner in the Third Reich. Not that the press
then or now has any impact on demand for tickets, which outstrips
supply by a factor of seven.
</P>
<P>
   But now the chorus of detraction is growing louder. In July, The
Economist prefaced the new Bayreuth season with a historical and
political analysis under the headline ``A Wagnerian Crisis of
Imagination.'' The magazine was not alone in blaming Richard
Wagner's grandson Wolfgang Wagner. Wolfgang, who turned 80 last
week, has been running the festival since its postwar opening in
1951, originally in tandem with his brother, Wieland. Wolfgang's
administrative talents, in stark contrast to his contributions as a
stage director, have never been in doubt. The trouble, as many now
see it, is that he stays on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolfgang has neither found the right moment to step down,''
The Economist put it, ``nor has he adequately prepared a
successor.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang had promised to name a new director in late July. When
the time came, he announced that he would be sticking around an
undetermined time longer. ``I know what I owe Bayreuth,'' he
explained in Der Spiegel, Germany's leading newsweekly. The German
economy is tottering. Government support is faltering. A cut of
more than a quarter of a million dollars is threatened. Michael
Naumann, the German Minister of Culture, makes light of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the waiting list for tickets to Bayreuth is as long
as for a handmade Lamborghini,'' he declares, irrelevantly, ``the
future of the festival is assured.'' Against such attacks, Wolfgang
says, he must defend Bayreuth as only he can.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several Wagners by blood are waiting in the wings,
none, alas, combining the executive track record and fresh artistic
agenda the job ideally requires. This summer, dueling Q-and-A's in
German news magazines, plus commentary from the pundits, made brisk
reading, especially the barbs that flew between Nike, Wieland's
bookish, sharp-tongued daughter, and Gudrun, Wolfgang's right hand
and second wife, both 50-something. Most festival regulars regard
Gudrun's future high in the Bayreuth hierarchy as a foregone
conclusion. A lofty post for Katharina, Gudrun's daughter by
Wolfgang, in her early 20s, likewise seems a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The polemics injected excitement into what would otherwise have
been a somewhat low-key year. The ``Ring'' of the 90s, admired for
James Levine's conducting but not for Alfred Kirchner's production,
has been retired. The ``Ring 2000,'' from the director Juergen
Flimm and the designer Erich Wonder, under the baton of Giuseppe
Sinopoli, is taking shape in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from ``Tannhaeuser,'' the rest of the Bayreuth canon was
on view, with a new ``Lohengrin'' taking pride of place. Of all his
creations, Wagner deemed this romance of the maiden falsely accused
of murder and the white knight of her dreams who uselessly comes to
her rescue ``by far the saddest.'' In the hearts of the public, it
has also proved the favorite, so much so that Wolfgang has written
of the ``burden'' of its popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Lohengrin'' held a special appeal for me. Last spring, the
conductor Valery Gergiev, director of the Kirov Opera in St.
Petersburg, invited me onto the production team for a new
``Lohengrin.'' On a sabbatical from my usual occupation as a
writer, I spent most of June backstage at the Kirov, working on
everything from individual coaching and dramatic workshops with the
singers to staging and lighting design. Our premiere on July 1 was
the closing event of the White Nights festival. The next day, the
show was packed up for dates at the Ravenna Festival in Italy, and
in Baden-Baden, Germany, where we opened four days ahead of the new
``Lohengrin'' in Bayreuth. My curiosity, I trust, needs no
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Bayreuth's ``Lohengrin'' _ directed by Keith Warner, with sets
by Stefanos Lazaridis and costumes by Sue Blane _ was a wonder of
space-age hydraulics and engineering. In the first of many
drop-dead yet dramatically cogent effects, the King and his
warriors entered not from the wings but from the sky on a tray,
which hovered in midair across the full width of the stage like the
space station in ``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   At the climax of the tragedy, more cryptically, a massive
platform representing the bridal chamber suddenly tipped, spilling
a cataract of water into a sinkhole, necessitating a pause in the
music surely longer than Wagner would have approved. (I have it on
the authority of Wolfgang Wagner that water, in this production,
represents the feminine principle. Armchair Jungians can take it
from there.) The blasted landscape on the stage floor resembled
some crater on the moon, dressed up with a chair here, a daybed
there. In a more abstract vein, mystifying cubes of varying
dimensions and materials had their symbolic parts to play. The king
and his army wore the clanking armor of the Age of Faith.
Otherwise, the wardrobe suggested the 19th century.

   On the surface, the Kirov ``Lohengrin'' was by intention an
altogether more old-fashioned affair. The late Yevgeny Lysyk's
settings (realized by Tadey Ryndzak) looked torn from illuminations
of a medieval manuscript, dominated by the blue of lapis lazuli,
airily Gothic yet twisted into strange, dreamlike perspectives. The
jewel-studded costumes (also from Lysyk's designs, realized by
Oksana Zinchenko) were sumptuous to a fault, in a palette ranging
from snow white to blood red by way of rich ivory and deep gold,
with ethereal flowered coronets for the women.
</P>
<P>
   Yet deep down, the Bayreuth and the Kirov productions converged
with surprising frequency. At the crucial point when Lohengrin
tells his bride-to-be that she may never ask his name, the
triple-cast Kirov Lohengrin (the visiting Gosta Winbergh, Victor
Lutsuk or Leonid Lubavin) grabbed the double-cast Elsa (Tatyana
Pavlovskaya or Tatyana Borodina) by the chin, raising his free hand
as if to strike her. In Bayreuth, Roland Wagenfuehrer, not
otherwise long on ferocity in this unsettlingly hot-and-cold part,
held Melanie Diener and shook her like a rag doll: a picture as
unsettling as I hope ours was.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, both productions conceived the great duet of the
villains at the beginning of the second act, beneath its blistering
mutual recriminations and ice-cold conspiracy, as a depraved love
scene. In Bayreuth, Gabriele Schnaut's Ortrud, reclining on a
divan, drew Jean-Philippe Lafont's Telramund into her arms and
locked her legs around him. The Kirov's sopranos Larisa
Gogolevskaya and Makvala Kasrashvili worked their wiles on the
basses Edem Umerov and Victor Chernomorzev in more maternal
fashion, wife cradling husband's head in her lap, stroking his
hair, gently dripping into his ear her words' deadly poison.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the different stage pictures in the Bayreuth and
Kirov productions reflected genuine differences in intention. Minor
figures we did our best to particularize in St. Petersburg _ four
noblemen who conspire with Telramund, four pages who clear the way
for Elsa's procession to the church _ in Bayreuth sang unseen on a
stage plunged into pitch black. John Tomlinson, the King in
Bayreuth, played his part as a stentorian Lear, decaying from
authority to impotence and death at the final curtain: an
outside-the-box reading at the farthest possible remove from the
straight-ahead majesty of the Kirov's Mikhail Kit and Gennady
Bezzubenkov. Lohengrin himself _ an underwritten character, in my
opinion, mostly a blank onto which the beleaguered Elsa and her
antagonists project their fears and desires _ emerged in Bayreuth
as a hero against his will, in the grip of some churning anxiety or
neurosis the root of which was never revealed.
</P>
<P>
   But in the unusually painstaking treatment of the mute character
of Gottfried, the rightful heir of Brabant, the two productions
were again in striking accord. When the story begins, the boy is
missing and feared dead. Elsa, his sister, stands accused of his
murder, but Lohengrin clears her name through trial by combat.
Moments before the end of the opera, the boy's true fate is at last
revealed. In a plot to grab the duchy, the witch Ortrud has
transformed him into a swan: the very swan that guided Lohengrin
across the waters to Elsa in the first place. As his final act
before returning to his sacred retreat, the hero lifts the spell,
restoring Gottfried to a rank and title _ indeed a life _ no one is
left to protect. In the power vacuum of Brabant, the young duke's
prospects (pawn or lamb to the slaughter?) are bleak indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The symbol of the swan has not aged well. Realistic or stylized,
it morphs into instant kitsch. The bright haze that worked for a
while has worn to cliche. Yet the creature's presence must be
palpable. Lohengrin's farewell to the swan _ the first passage he
sings _ is among the most heartfelt moments of his part, surpassed
only by the page in which Lohengrin hands over his horn, sword and
ring to Elsa as keepsakes to hold in trust for her brother. The
savior's purity of compassion for the wronged, absent child strikes
a note of pathos quite distinct from that of his oddly contingent
affection for the sister.
</P>
<P>
   To motivate Lohengrin's intensity and tenderness, we at the
Kirov wanted the audience to see from the start the truth behind
the illusion. Lohengrin made his first entrance led by the hand of
a boy: Gottfried, lightly disguised in a short, feathered cape he
would shed at the moment of his release. At the same point in the
action, the Bayreuth audience saw Gottfried suspended high above
the stage, imprisoned in a glass cube, beating desperately against
the sides. The final tableau, in both productions, centered on the
child, barefoot and half-dressed at the Kirov, wrapped in the
King's cast-off scarlet in Bayreuth, in either case traumatized,
vulnerable and alone.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Bayreuth principals, Ms. Diener's vocally underpowered
yet mesmerizing Elsa led the field, her every gesture bold and
sudden, punctuating a stillness that was never inexpressive. In
Wagenfuehrer's sweet-toned Lohengrin, the lack of power proved a
greater liability. Opposite Ms. Schnaut's squally, hyperactive
Ortrud, Jean-Philippe Lafont's Telramund offered powerful singing
and insight that struck to the character's core. Antonio Pappano
conducted at an urgent pace, achieving rich color and sharp
dramatic detail.
</P>
<P>
   In other performances, Wolfgang Wagner's thoughtful but stolid
``Parsifal,'' erratically led by Sinopoli, boasted deluxe vocalism
from Violeta Urmana as the time-traveling Kundry and a touching
account of the title role from Poul Elming, especially convincing
in the potentially awkward scenes as a wild child of the forest.
Dieter Dorn's classic picture-book ``Fliegende Hollaender,''
unforgettable for the yellow house that levitates and slowly
pinwheels through the night sky, returned for one last summer,
still looking magical, though surely a shade less so for viewers,
like me, who had marveled at it before.
</P>
<P>
   Also on view for the last time was Heiner Mueller's spare
``Tristan und Isolde,'' which was new to me. In 1993, most critics
showered its unveiling with disdain. Staged in precisely calibrated
color fields by Wonder, inspired in part by the ritual theater of
Japan, in part by the endgames of Samuel Beckett, the production
has ripened to a masterpiece, every moment charged with precise,
impassioned meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, too, the performance was a triumph, with Waltraud
Meier incandescent as the tempestuous Irish princess and Siegfried
Jerusalem holding the course beyond all expectation as her
guilt-haunted lover. From the covered podium of the Festspielhaus,
unseen by the audience, Daniel Barenboim led a reading shattering
in its raw power yet equally remarkable for transparency, lyricism
and finesse.
</P>
<P>
   For artists as well as for audiences, the isolation and tunnel
vision of the festival add up to an experience not easily
duplicated elsewhere. Whatever the complaints against Bayreuth in
the present or anxieties for Bayreuth in the future, there is still
no better place for Wagnerites to check their bearings.

BUSH REACHING OUT TO NON-HISPANIC CATHOLICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush's
proposed new partnership between government and charities has a
subtle message: He wants support from Catholics, one of the
nation's largest voting blocs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congregations and community groups must fight for children and
neighborhoods, creating what Pope John Paul II calls `a hospitable
society, a welcoming culture,''' Bush said as he unveiled his plan
in July in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Although far from having the Republican presidential nomination
sewed up, Bush's campaign staff already plans to win the general
election in part by targeting Hispanics, suburban women and the
nation's non-Hispanic Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that my message of hope and optimism is a message
(that) will appeal to people of faith,'' Bush said Tuesday while
campaigning at a Catholic school. ``I hope people understand that I
am serious that the compassion that exists in churches and
synagogues and mosques can change people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The defection of suburban women _ the so-called soccer moms _
from Texas Gov. Ann Richards in 1994 helped propel Bush into the
Governor's Mansion that year. And Bush's capture of about 40
percent of the Texas Hispanic vote in 1998 turned his re-election
victory into a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush aides say privately they also are reaching out
nationally to the non-Hispanic Catholics who once constituted the
core of the Reagan Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are likely to be 30 percent of the turnout in a national
election,'' said William B. Prendergast, author of a new book on
Catholic voting patterns and former research director for the
Republican National Committee. ``They also are strategically
located in states that are rich in electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Hispanic Catholics comprise large portions of the population
in Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Catholics and other voters who traditionally voted Democratic
switched to the GOP column in the 1980s under the sway of Ronald
Reagan's patriotic appeals and became known as Reagan Democrats.
Total Catholic populations also are substantial in Texas, Florida
and California.
</P>
<P>
   While Reagan appealed to this group with a tough anti-communism
message in a Cold War world, Bush aides believe they can attract
Catholic voters with his ``compassionate conservative'' message.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president can speak without apology for the values that
defeat violence and help overcome poverty,'' Bush said while
outlining his faith-based initiatives in an Indianapolis speech.
``A president can speak for abstinence and accountability and the
power of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Portions of Bush's $8 billion plan _ new tax deductions and
credits for giving to charities, including those run by churches _
echo 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole's overture to
Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan, like Dole's in 1996, appeal to an area of Catholic
social teaching that social problems should be solved first at the
local community or church level before government becomes involved.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's design on Catholic voters also appears to be shaping his
eventual potential quest for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge has been frequently mentioned for
Bush's second spot. And Bush, at an early campaign stop with Ridge,
said he would not rule out a running mate who favored abortion
rights, such as Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   But syndicated columnist Robert Novak recently reported that a
Bush adviser met privately with a prominent Roman Catholic
archbishop who said Ridge, especially because he is Catholic, would
be unacceptable to Catholics because of his views on abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he opposes abortion rights, even though he would not
fight as president to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court
decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, I am pro-life,'' Bush said Tuesday. ``I assume
there are some in the Catholic Church who will make their
determination based on that issue. I hope that convinces some
people to be for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Flynn, former Boston mayor and ambassador to the
Vatican, now heads the Catholic Alliance, a get-out-the vote
organization similar to the Christian Coalition. Flynn's goal is to
get the nation's 62 million Catholics to vote based on Catholic
issues, not partisan rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, both parties have been insensitive to the Catholic
vote,'' said Flynn, a longtime Democrat. ``The Catholic voter has
been ignored or taken for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said Catholics are ``pro-life, pro-family, pro-poor.'' He
said Democrats tend toward helping families and the poor while
ignoring Catholics on the abortion issue. He said Republicans tend
to be anti-abortion and for the family but generally turn their
backs on the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn in his weekly national radio addresses has been critical
both of Bush and Vice President Al Gore, the front-runner for the
Democratic presidential nomination, saying there is little
difference between the two.
</P>
<P>
   To win over Catholic voters, Flynn said, Bush is going to have
to show his compassionate conservative message is more than just
lip service on a few targeted programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about cliches. I'm talking about specifics,''
Flynn said. ``Who's in favor of health care for families ...Who's
in favor of a decent wage so people can support their families.
These are the blue-collar bread and butter issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan and President Carter almost evenly split the Catholic
vote in 1980, but Reagan's 1984 re-election set the record for the
largest Catholic vote received by a Republican, 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush won his 1988 presidential victory by capturing about
half of the Catholic vote. But Bush lost his re-election bid in
1992 with support from only 35 percent of the total Catholic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast said that a lack of Catholic support for Democrats
was one of the causes of the Republican takeover of Congress in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   But Prendergast said Catholics also have shown themselves as
more of a swing vote rather than realigning to the Republican
Party. As much as 35 percent of the non-Hispanic Catholics tell
pollsters they are independent.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton won 53 percent of the Catholic vote in 1996,
Prendergast noted in his book, The Catholic Voter in American
Politics, but exit polls found the vote by non-Hispanic Catholics
dropped by more than a million votes from the 1992 election while
the turnout of Hispanic voters grew by 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won that vote largely by targeting Catholic voters with
political rhetoric that the White House dubbed M2E2: Medicaid,
Medicare, education and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast said Bush's compassionate conservative message could
be a Republican answer to that formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems in making a persuasive case to Catholic
voters is the perception that they (Republicans) are not
compassionate,'' Prendergast said.

SERIES EXPLORES WHAT'S ORDINARY, AND WHAT'S NOT, IN A BIRACIAL
FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 5) 
 (smw) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, to the camera's casual eye, the most
conspicuous aspect of the Wilson-Sims family is that the mother
looks like an interloper. Karen Wilson is a slightly built white
woman. Her children, Cicily Wilson and Chaney Sims, resemble their
father, and not only because their skin is dark. With their strong
jaw lines and tall builds, you would pick them out of a roomful of
other young black women as Bill Sims' daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The physical differences are part of what makes the family's
obvious affection so touching. In ``An American Love Story,'' the
extraordinary 10-hour series that follows them through nearly two
years of everyday life and crises, it is not surprising to hear
Karen say protectively of Cicily, ``She's my baby,'' though the
baby towers over her.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the series' most revealing moments throws such easy
observations back in a viewer's face. As Episode 6 begins, Karen
and Cicily are sitting on a bed chatting when the voice of the
film's director, Jennifer Fox, is heard asking, ``Is it difficult
for you guys cause you don't look alike?'' Karen stares silently
into the camera as if she were contemplating a lunatic. Her look
seems to ask, ``Haven't you learned anything?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that scene the other day, Ms. Wilson said
cheerfully: ``I looked at her a lot like that. People have to
remember that the film is Jennifer's vision of us, not necessarily
us. She would ask questions about race a lot, and to me this has
nothing to do with race; it's my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox, in a separate interview, said: ``Karen and I got into a
huge discussion about that. Part of Karen's way to see her family
is not to see race. Bill sees it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Who sees race where? That issue is the most eye-opening element
of this subtly artful, engrossing, socially important series. ``An
American Love Story'' (on PBS next Sunday through Thursday nights
in two-hour installments) is being packaged as the tale of Bill
Sims and Karen Wilson's 30-year love affair and marriage, which on
the most obvious level it is. Beneath the consumer-friendly romance
of its title, though, the series is more genuinely about a new kind
of family and about America's multiracial future.
</P>
<P>
   Its most compelling story is not that of Bill and Karen's
interracial marriage; we've seen such relationships before, however
fraught with problems they remain. But television has not
previously paid attention to someone like Cicily. Her painful
struggle to be accepted as herself, not a skin color, becomes the
gripping central drama of ``An American Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   When most of the film was shot, from May 1992 through January
1994, she was a college student who had left the security of her
family's home in Queens for Colgate University in upstate New York,
only to feel rejected by both blacks and whites. The black
students, only 3 percent of the student body, wanted her to align
herself with them, apart from whites. The white students saw her as
different. Cicily didn't think she should have to choose. The
camera follows her to Nigeria with other Colgate students for a
semester, and into an even more fraught racial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is an illuminating perspective for a television audience
accustomed to seeing race, when seeing it at all, in stark terms of
black and white. With its more complex, biracial view, ``An
American Love Story'' sends a sobering message: There will be no
idyllic, color-blind society any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The series is especially timely now, when the NAACP has rightly
called attention to the absence of major black characters in the
season's new entertainment shows and is planning to choose a
network to boycott during the November sweeps. Several producers
have scrambled to parachute black characters into their casts as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   In the ordinary course of things, it counts as progress when
color goes unnoticed in a television romance, as it did when Ally
McBeal fell in love with a black doctor last season. (It probably
helped that both characters were well-educated professionals; the
issue of class and interracial marriage is yet another volatile
issue that television flees from.)
</P>
<P>
   When race goes unnoticed in ``An American Love Story,'' it is to
make a larger point. The series' most realistic attitude emerges
from the way it veers smoothly between what is universal to any
family and what is particular to this interracial one.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing the structure of episodic television, it organizes
each hour around a particular theme or event. The events in Episode
5 have happened to everyone. Chaney, 12, wants to go on her first
date, but her parents don't know this boy and want him to come to
their house. Like any adolescent, Chaney can't begin to explain why
that is embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Race casts a heavier shadow over Episode 10, as Bill and Karen
go to her high school reunion in Ohio. She recalls that when they
started seeing each other there, in 1967, ``the sheriff followed
Bill everywhere we went.'' Because they were not married when
Cicily was born, a social worker advised her to give the baby up
for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   And Episode 7, more typically, makes the point that this family
is both like and different from most of America. Karen, so weak
from her recent hysterectomy she can barely walk, insists on going
to Cicily's graduation from Colgate; what mother wouldn't? But how
many would warn her husband to take his passport when leaving the
hotel? Having it might help if he is stopped by racist police, she
says, a worry that nags at her in what she calls this ``podunk
town.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, this entire family comes across as immensely
likable, which is important if a viewer is to make it through 10
hours in their company. But ``An American Love Story'' is also a
work shaped by a sophisticated filmmaker, whose awareness of the
complexities of an interracial romance began with her firsthand
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Ms. Fox planned an hourlong documentary about three
interracial couples, including herself and the black man she was
dating at the time. The project gradually evolved into a three-hour
film on the Wilson-Sims family and finally this 10-part series. She
and her sound recordist and co-producer, Jennifer Fleming, shot a
thousand hours of film of the family, sometimes camping out on the
floor of Cicily and Chaney's shared bedroom for days at a time.
They follow Bill, a blues guitarist, on the road and back in Queens
puttering around the kitchen. Karen, who is a human resources
administrator in Manhattan, is seen in her office at the computer
and at home in her bathrobe.
</P>
<P>
   As Sims said recently, proving that race is never far from their
lives, ``One of the things about our family is, when you go out in
the world you feel that people are always watching you anyway,'' so
it was less of a trauma to have cameras in and out of their house
for two years than it might have been for some people.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is more than access that accounts for the film's
resonance. Ms. Fox also shot 400 hours of on-camera interviews,
some made well after the major events in the film had happened. She
and the series' editor, Jay Freund, have dazzlingly woven these
interviews into the scenes of the family in action, often layering
the voices over those events as if the characters were commenting
on themselves. The most thoughtful and sometimes most passionate
comments on race emerge from this layering technique. We hear Bill
say that Cicily's upbringing left her unprepared for what she faced
at college: ``Black kids tend to group together, and she wasn't
brought up to be segregated.''
</P>
<P>
   We see Cicily at Colgate, the only black student in class, and
hear her say in voice-over: ``I realized the first day I got to
college that I had the job of re-educating these people. Is this my
job? I just want to live my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox said of this narrative technique, ``As they live their
lives, people don't talk their feelings,'' so she got them to
discuss those feelings later. ``It's a construction, but hopefully
it's true to some central reality.'' This layering of voices and
addition of hindsight do more than enhance the film's social
perspective. By creating a richer texture, the technique keeps the
viewer engaged and coming back for more, avoiding the lulling pace
of so many documentaries that simply pretend the filmmaker isn't
there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we hear about racism more than we see it in the series,
partly because it shows the family members interacting with one
another more often than with the outside world. The camera's
presence changes things, and it is impossible to say what would
have happened, in public or in private, if Ms. Fox and her camera
hadn't been around. Asked about that, Ms. Wilson mentioned an
episode in the film in which she and her husband kiss goodbye in
the morning at the subway. A woman behind them, she recalled, was
staring in their direction. ``We're so used to being stared at I
thought she was staring at us, but maybe she was looking at the
camera.'' (With her well-honed antenna for such things, she noticed
a stare that few television viewers are likely to catch.)
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Fox recalled: ``By summer '93 I realized we had sort of
hit the glass wall. There is a point at which you can film more and
more and you'll never get more depth. The real discussions will
happen behind closed doors. Certain arguments will never happen on
camera.'' A line is drawn, she said, defining the border of ``the
subjects' sanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their protection,'' she explains. ``It's very easy to see
films where there are no boundaries and you feel a sense of
perversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the family is shown with flaws, the film treats them
gently. They had the right to tell Ms. Fox to turn off the camera
and to ask for changes in the final cut of the film. Everyone
agrees that they requested, and got, only minimal changes. A few
comments that might have hurt some relatives' feelings were
deleted; Cicily asked that an entire sentence, rather than a part,
be used when she vaguely describes a sensitive subject, an
explosive argument that would never have happened on camera. Her
father was drunk, mean and belligerent and she didn't talk to him
for three weeks afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a family in crisis, but we made it through, still
standing,'' Bill says in one of those layered interviews filmed
recently. After that crisis he stopped drinking and has been sober
for five years. A CD of his music has just been released; so has a
soundtrack from the series. (After the series' final episode on
Thursday, some PBS stations will present ``An American Love Story
Update With Bill Moyers,'' an hourlong interview in which the
family discusses the series and brings the story to the present.)
</P>
<P>
   Though there are references in the series to Bill's drinking (at
one point his wife says, fairly cryptically, that she knows he has
been ``on a binge''), there is only one scene in which he clearly
seems to have had too much, as he sits in bed talking about how he
plans to go on drinking. Not going for the most lurid, voyeuristic
approach may seem unfashionable in a television era of
full-throttle confessions, but ``An American Love Story'' has a
more serious social purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox explained what she hoped viewers would experience:
``First they're going to see an interracial family. Eventually, at
moments they'll forget about race. And in that forgetting and
remembering there will be a moment of epiphany; they'll recognize
their own racism, and their own perceptions of family.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement is accurate, though such lofty phrases have no
place in the series itself, which remains rooted in one family's
illuminating and richly captured lives.
</P>
<P>
   What is most remarkable about ``An American Love Story'' may
finally be the hard-nosed realism of its message. It does not
pretend that racist attitudes can be wiped out with a gesture or in
a generation. It presents the more disturbing idea that racism
simply keeps changing along with the country. Beyond the scope of
the series, the Wilson-Sims children offer proof of how attitudes
need to evolve along with the country's racial mix.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney, now 18, has become a thoughtful adult since filming
ended and is a women's studies major in college. She said recently
that she was going through many of the things her sister had
experienced. Though Chaney went to a performing arts high school in
Manhattan where the majority of students were either black or
Latino, she felt pressured by them to choose a group to belong to,
just as her sister had at Colgate. She said about the series:
``Growing up, I never saw anyone on television that was like
myself. I think that's important, to see there are people who are
biracial, and they experience a different kind of prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cicily, now 26, works in development and communications at a New
York music conservatory near the neighborhood where she grew up.
She is engaged to be married and when asked the inevitable question
about race, sounded very much like her mother's daughter. ``I love
him to death; I love him no matter what he is,'' she said first.
``He's white. Until now I haven't dated a white man. This is just
who I fell in love with.''

 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (For release Sunday, Sept. 5)  
(mk) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNS, Scotland _ The British director Terence Davies had never
watched even a single episode of ``The X-Files'' when he plucked
Gillian Anderson's picture from a pile last summer and decided that
she would be perfect for his next film, an adaption of Edith
Wharton's ``House of Mirth.'' She had the sort of fin de siecle
face he had been searching for, a face that might have been painted
by the great society portraitist John Singer Sargent.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Ms. Anderson had been given a handsome volume of
Wharton's tragic 1905 novel as a gift not too long before _ a
coincidence worthy of Dana Scully herself. And she was a huge
admirer of Davies, a painstaking and stylish filmmaker who is
hardly a household name in Hollywood but whose work _ three short
autobiographical films and three full-length features _ has drawn
critical acclaim and captured an abundance of film festival awards.
</P>
<P>
   She also liked the fact that Davies did not even know her in her
most obvious incarnation, as one of television's highest-paid and
best-known stars. ``Whenever anybody would ask me what my favorite
films were, `The Long Day Closes' would always come to my mind,''
said Ms. Anderson, referring to Davies' 1992 autobiographical
account of growing up in working-class Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in filming here on a cold and rainy summer
afternoon, dressed in a voluminous purple gown, Ms. Anderson
explained how she had hunted down a tape of ``The Long Day
Closes,'' bought it and recommended it to anyone who would listen.
``You know how when you see a film, it just rocks your world?''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Ms. Anderson, who plays Lily Bart, the beautiful
heroine taken up and then rejected by upper-crust society in
turn-of-the-century New York, the cast of ``The House of Mirth''
includes Eric Stoltz as Lawrence Selden, the charming suitor whose
fatal flaw is that he is not rich enough; Laura Linney as Bertha
Dorset, a married friend who builds Lily up and then knocks her
down, and Dan Aykroyd as a date rapist before his time _ a married
man who tries to force himself on Lily. Davies hopes the film,
which does not have a theatrical distributor in America yet, will
be accepted at the Cannes International Film Festival next spring.
</P>
<P>
   After investigating a number of possible locations, including
Philadelphia and Baltimore, the filmmakers decided on Scotland.
Glasgow, with its grand tobacco and shipbuilding mansions, became
1905 New York. And Manderston House, a stately home in this
community near the English border, became an estate in upstate New
York, the scene of the country house party that marks the beginning
of Lily's end.
</P>
<P>
   The book is very much of its time, but the story is a timeless
account of the ruthlessness and hypocrisy of a society fat with
wealth and misplaced morality. ``It's a society where the lines are
very strictly drawn,'' said Laura Linney, who played Jim Carrey's
wife in ``The Truman Show,'' and whose character's petulance and
spite in ``The House of Mirth'' help touch off Lily's eventual
downfall. ``The drama happens when you veer out of line. If you're
caught, the result is immediate expulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Anderson _ who is back to work on the
``X-Files'' this month _ said she was drawn to the complexities in
the role she plays, a character whose entire upbringing has trained
her to marry well, but whose inherent morality makes it impossible
for her to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of her behavior is propelled by innocence and
naivete,'' she said. ``She finds herself in these terrible
situations, and the audience has to sit by and watch her do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies said he had long wanted to film ``The House of Mirth,''
having come to love Wharton's tart, brilliantly observed novels
when he switched on his radio one evening years ago and heard the
actress Faith Brown reading from the author's letters. Of all her
novels, he said, this one has the most resonant, and the most
tragic, story.
</P>
<P>
   ``A genuine tragedy for me is when the character cannot do
anything other than what they do, and it destroys them,'' Davies
says. ``Lily makes a conscious effort to do all the right things,
but does the wrong things at the right time and the right things at
the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   The film represents a departure for Davies, who specializes in
highly stylized, elliptical films that have mostly dealt with
memory and the mysteries of the past. ``The problem with cinema is
that it is in the eternal present, and I wanted to experiment with
the nature of time and memory in film,'' he said. ``But I found
that I'd come to an artistic cul-de-sac, to the end of that
particular artistic experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   He's had to adjust to a new challenge: filming what is
essentially a straightforward, linear narrative. And in paring down
and reshaping the novel into a screenplay, he has had to be finely
tuned to the nuances of Wharton's sharp, elegant prose _ writing
that captures to devastating effect the cruelty beneath the surface
of the society she describes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a question of adapting the story,'' he said.
``You have to adapt the tone as well. When you read Edith Wharton,
it's unmistakably Edith Wharton, and you have to capture her tone,
her voice. It gave me enormous pleasure to write dialogue in a way
that I think she would have. One of the things about these people
is that they speak and are very articulate, but they never say what
they feel. When they share love and emotion, they're like inept
teen-agers.''

NATALIE'S DADDY, LLOYD, HAPPY AS A RELUCTANT STAR
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies DIXIE CHICKS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ On a recent weekend night at Sons of Hermann Hall, one
of the most important figures in Texas music was on stage. But as
usual, Lloyd Maines was in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Playing pedal steel in Ray Wylie Hubbard's band, Maines
epitomized the unsung hero: There he was, a man whose steel playing
helped define a sound and style in and out of the city limits of
his Lubbock hometown, a man whose production credits grace the
liner notes of nearly 100 discs, a man whose daughter fronts one of
the nation's most popular groups _ there he was, just sitting off
to Hubbard's side, perfectly content with the spotlight shining on
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never wanted to be a star,'' says Maines, 48, calling a
few days later from his home in Austin, where he has lived for the
past few years. ``I want to be respected by fans and peers, but
seeing my name in lights, I could care less.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that unselfish attitude, along with his musical versatility
and patient, hands-off approach to producing, say longtime friends
and collaborators, that makes him one of the most sought-after
producers in the music industry _ and one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked with Lloyd many, many years, and that's one of the
great things about him, he's not about taking a lot of credit or
getting a lot of attention,'' says acclaimed Texas
singer/songwriter Joe Ely, whose history with Maines spans more
than two decades. ``He lets you do your thing. He helps artists
realize their own sound without influencing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Hendrix, a San Marcos-based singer who has worked with
Maines since 1997 and will go on a European tour with him and
Hubbard in two weeks, says it's Maines' chameleonlike flexibility
that has made her one of many of his repeat customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lloyd can produce anything. He's not just a country
producer,'' she says. ``I do all styles of music, and he just goes
right along with me. He's a jack-of-all-trades. That's what brings
him to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   As a producer and pedal steel player _ and let's not forget he's
also the father of Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines _ Lloyd
Maines has been involved with some of this era's best records, from
vital efforts by Texas musicians like Ely, Terry Allen, Robert Earl
Keen and Butch Hancock to discs from national scene-makers like
Jerry Jeff Walker and Uncle Tupelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most amazing musicians I've ever met in my
life,'' says Jeff Tweedy, the 32-year-old front man of rock outfit
Wilco and veteran of Uncle Tupelo, early practitioners of the
now-trendy roots-rock genre. Maines played steel on Uncle Tupelo's
influential 1993 Anodyne disc and Wilco's 1995 debut, A.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a steel player when we were making Anodyne, and
someone recommended him,'' Tweedy says from a tour stop in
Cleveland. ``The great thing about him was that he was so patient
with us. Being the hacks that we are, it would take us 30 takes to
get a song right. He'd get his part right on the first take. He
made those songs so special, too. Some of them we don't even play
live because they seem so empty without him.''
</P>
<P>
   With an upbringing greatly steeped in country music (courtesy of
the Maines Brothers, a Lubbock outfit featuring Maines' father and
two uncles, and his parents' love for Buck Owens and other country
veterans), Maines learned to play a variety of instruments,
starting while he was in his teens. His favorite: pedal steel
guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in Lubbock, you do one of two things: play sports
or play music. I did both,'' Maines says. ``There was an old steel
player in my dad's band. I was always infatuated with watching him
play, and once when I was at football practice, he set up a pedal
steel for me. I came home that night and started playing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can apply some of what you know on regular guitar to pedal
steel guitar, but I had to pretty much figure it out on my own,''
he says. ``Back then (in the mid- to late-'60s) there were no
teachers or instructional tapes. Willie Nelson used to come to
town, and I would study the techniques of his steel player, Jimmy
Day. And Waylon Jennings had a terrific player, Ralph Mooney.
That's how I learned to play. It was a pain ... to carry around,
but it's the only instrument that you can make cry or scream. It's
just a real emotional instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   GETTING STARTED: By the time Maines was in his 20s, he and his
three brothers _ Kenny, Steve and Donnie _ were playing as the
Maines Brothers, after their father, James, retired the original
lineup. Off and on for the next two decades, this lineup of the
Maines Brothers would tour and release two discs for
Mercury/Polygram; Maines says that because of everything else in
his life _ producing, playing on other artists' records, his home
life as a husband and father _ the group has been inactive since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he had an ear for music, Maines recognized that he had a
knack for production, as well. In the early '70s, he started
tinkering around in Lubbock's Caldwell Studios, learning the
technical ropes of how to make an album tick. He learned fast _ so
fast that it was the norm for him not only to play on a Lubbock
artist's record, but also to engineer or produce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew early on that record production was what I wanted to
do,'' he says. ``As a musician, you can come up with a great lick,
but it goes into the ozone of the song. Producing songs, you make a
lasting impact on them.''

 &HT;    BellSouth's equipment deal with Lucent shows growth of wireless
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth has announced a $180 million deal with
Lucent Technologies for hardware, software and services needed to
expand the company's wireless network in Atlanta and southern
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year deal, an extension of a contract that expires
this year, is a reflection of increasing use of BellSouth's
wireless network in its two largest markets, said Kristie Madara,
spokeswoman for BellSouth Cellular. ``We are enhancing what we
have, adding capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has about 5.2 million wireless phone customers. The
company does not provide statistics for individual markets, but
demands on the network have been skyrocketing. For instance, the
company's customers in north Georgia (including Atlanta) now use
about 150 million minutes of wireless air time each month _ roughly
double the demand of only two years ago, according to Madara.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment for most of BellSouth's wireless network had been
provided by Hughes, an agreement that has been replaced with a
recent deal to buy from Ericsson. However, Lucent's portion is
substantial: One-third of BellSouth's system is represented by
north Georgia and south Florida, which includes Miami, Fort
Lauderdale, Boca Raton and West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of many carriers have complained in recent months that
some calls are dropped or blocked by crowding on the network. But
Madara said the expansion was not forced, since BellSouth's system
is not at capacity. ``Everyone is expanding their network. If you
are a wireless carrier, you are expanding your network because you
are looking at future growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Lucent products will come to BellSouth from outside
the region _ including the transmission equipment that is made in
Massachusetts. However, the fiber optics are coming from Lucent's
huge plant in Norcross, said Lucent spokesman Jim Messenger. The
company is providing various software, as well as transmission
equipment and some bigger optic lines that are increasingly
connected to cell sites. The fiber can carry far more information,
including digitized conversation, than copper lines. As wireless
phones are increasingly used to carry data _ especially from the
Internet _ the wireless carriers are looking for still more
capacity in the lines connecting cell sites to networks.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has more than 7,400 employees in metro Atlanta.

 DUNS, Scotland: inept teen-agers.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the actors took pay cuts of various magnitudes in order
to appear in the film, whose budget of roughly $8 million is modest
by Hollywood standards. But, said Stoltz, they weren't in it for
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the material is embarrassing and terrible _ that's when
you get the big paycheck,'' said Stoltz, eating a vegetable-heavy
lunch after completing a scene where his character abandons a
tete-a-tete with Bertha in order, very subtly, to follow Lily on a
walk outside. ``It's such a relief to come across a story like
this, with a literate script that doesn't condescend or pander to
13-year-olds. Not that I'm opposed to those films, God knows. But
it's like getting a meal from a master chef after eating at
McDonald's for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   In immersing themselves in Wharton's rarefied, rigidly
structured society, the filmmakers and actors were struck by its
parallels to the world of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could take this story and put it in a small town, a high
school, a college, in contemporary New York or London and it would
still apply,'' said Aykroyd, admitting to some discomfort at having
to grope Ms. Anderson in his pivotal scene. ``What still applies is
the stratification of society and the ability of people to savage
someone who's vulnerable.'' One mini-society where the same lessons
apply, it seems, is Hollywood itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors are not only part and parcel of this world, but we're
the worst offenders when it comes to cutting people off,'' Stoltz
said. ``I've been in and out so many times I'm dizzy.''
</P>
<P>
   When the filmmakers were searching for an actor to play
Lawrence, said Olivia Stewart, the producer, they were made more
aware than ever of how ruthless the film industry is, with a strict
but always changing pecking order that assigns every actor an
instantly recognizable position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strict gradation of importance,'' Ms. Stewart said,
speaking in the production's makeshift office in an old stable at
Manderston House. ``It's all about who's in, who's out. We would
hear things like, `You're not having dinner with so and so, are
you? He's lunch!' And that's exactly what the script is about:
pretense, manners, keeping an eye on the main chance, or on what's
perceived as the main chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies said: ``It's a very modern, savage satire. We live in an
age of surfaces. They did then, and we do today. What's true today
is that how you look and how much money you have is what matters.
Being a good person doesn't matter, and it still applies now as it
did in 1905.''

A BRITISH PARABLE ABOUT LIFE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 5) 
(jt) 
 By MATT WOLF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Right Size _ or, as this two-man comedy team
prefers it, the right size _ is into more than typographical
anarchy. With nine original shows to date, these British performers
have acquired a sizable following since meeting at a clown school
in Paris a little more than 10 years ago. Absurdist drollery with a
sprinkling of Sartre and a dash of Beckett might describe their
most popular show so far: about being locked in a bathroom with a
stranger for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 8 that show, ``Do You Come Here Often?,'' will mark the
New York debut of Sean Foley, 34, and Hamish McColl, 37, when it
begins performances at Public School 122 in the East Village. The
work, which runs through Oct. 10, won an Olivier Award this year in
London for best entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one scatological gag in the entire thing,'' said
McColl, the more manic of the team and the one with longer hair.
``That's not to say that we didn't get them out of our system in
rehearsals.''
</P>
<P>
   A 75-minute mixture of sight gags, verbal groaners (``We need
nutrition'' elicits the reply, ``What's wrong with old trition?''),
and a healthy dose of the mock-portentous, ``Do You Come Here
Often?'' finds the comedy in confinement. The similarly bound (if
placeless) tramps of Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot'' never allowed
themselves this much diversion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Beckett's name has come up in describing the piece, as
have such disparate figures as Sartre, Ionesco, Abbott and
Costello, and the quintessentially British comic team of the late
Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise. Americans, for their part, may think
first of Monty Python or, closer to home, of Bill Irwin and David
Shiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a lie to say we're not aware of that resonance as
we're doing the show,'' said McColl, responding to the Beckett
comparison. ``We put the characters in this situation because it
exposes their humanity extremely well. But we're not working from
an existentialist philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, why a locked bathroom? ``We were once stuck in an airport
toilet in the north of Norway,'' Foley said. ``The attendant had
finished the shift, so for 15 minutes we shouted very loudly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the men moved away from their own material, appearing
to critical acclaim in `` Puntila and his Man Matti'' at the
Almeida Theater and then on the West End. McColl was the
hard-drinking landowner Puntila, with Foley as his comically
put-upon chauffeur, Matti, in a staging that folded mime, Bessie
Smith and an ode to the properties of herring into Brecht's 1948
parable.
</P>
<P>
   The production confirmed that the two are actors, not simply
sketch artists, which is why ``Do You Come Here Often?'' isn't the
exercise in lavatory humor it could have been (notwithstanding a
whimsical reference to ``papier de loo''), nor is it a foray into
audience participation _ for which, read humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke's always on us, I think,'' said Foley, who, like
McColl, lives in north London. Directed and co-devised by Jozef
Houben in a variety of comic styles, ``Do You Come Here Often?''
asks what it would be like to spend years with another individual
who starts out a stranger but over time becomes companion and
adversary, even as both parties try to escape now and again. The
scenario resurrects an age-old archetype: companionship is a
defense, no matter how absurd the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   And what of that name, the Right Size? ``We thought it was such
a good title for us,'' McColl said. ``We weren't sure it made a lot
of sense, but we liked it.''

 &HT;    Bank software firm is on the money
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Magnet Communications is typical of an Advanced
Technology Development Center success.
</P>
<P>
   The company started in 1995 in the nascent field of Internet
banking for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last September, the company, which started in
Georgia Tech's ATDC, a state-funded incubator for high technology,
employed eight people. Steve Gordon, who was brought in as
president and chief executive, was No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company employs about 53 people. Last week, Magnet
closed its second round of venture capital, receiving a $9.5
million investment from a group of firms, including Cordova
Ventures and Live Oak Equity Partners near Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Magnet received $3.2 million of venture capital in September
from Minneapolis-based Coral Ventures, which also invested in the
recent round.
</P>
<P>
   Magnet Communications reported revenue less than $500,000 for
1998. Gordon said the company is on pace for about $5 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Dalton, a venture capitalist with Cordova Ventures, said
he tries to visit the ATDC once every three months. He said he
likes the Internet banking industry and the depth and strength of
Magnet's management.
</P>
<P>
   Magnet offers a group of 14 software products that let
businesses manage their money through the Internet. Magnet products
automate much of the software-based or pen-and-paper-based duties
of a company treasurer, Gordon said. Its customers include SunTrust
and First Union.
</P>
<P>
   This has been the year Internet banking has taken hold in the
public consciousness. In April, NetBank, a company near of Atlanta,
saw its share price climb 754 percent in the first four months of
this year. Shares of the Internet-only bank have since re-entered
the stratosphere _ up about 146 percent for the year _ but the
market activity made people aware of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based S1 and nFront, both of which write software that
banks use to offer their products online, also had big years. S1
announced plans to merge with Edify and FICS, two of its larger
competitors. NFront, which sells its products to small and
medium-sized banks, had an initial public offering of its stock in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Magnet Communications' business model is closer to nFront or S1
than to NetBank: Magnet's software for banks targets business
banking. S1 and nFront target individual banking customers.

 &HT;    Everyday stock investors showing little sign of panic
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Y2K arrived on Wall Street in August, with debt
markets flooded with offerings by companies unwilling to chance a
year-end computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   On Main Street, however, the much ballyhooed prospect that
computers might fail on Jan. 1, 2000, apparently is being viewed by
individual investors as a yawner.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers, investment advisers and mutual fund officials
agree that while the individual investor is interested in the
problem, and even becoming concerned enough to ask about it, there
is no evidence of panic.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the sentiment just 121 days before the world finds
out what happens when computers have to read dates ending in double
zero. The old ones can't, which created the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients have not made an issue out of it at this point,''
said Jack J. Calhoun Jr., vice president of Capital Directions, an
Atlanta investment counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, this is no different from any other
potential event that you have to endure because you have no way of
knowing how it will come out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When investors do ask about the issue, they get pretty much the
same advice, at least from mainstream advisers: Don't panic and
don't go to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advise clients not to take special precautions other than
the ones they normally take in today's market,'' said Robert M.
Balentine, chief executive of Balentine &AMP; Co., an Atlanta
investment counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, take a few extra dollars out of an ATM machine so as not to
be caught short of cash at the end of the year. But no, don't make
any wholesale portfolio changes.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, investors apparently are following that advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any specific investment decisions made in
anticipation of Y2K,'' said Balentine.
</P>
<P>
   If and when investors do decide to act, they'll have plenty of
information to go on. Amazon.com, the online book seller, lists 250
titles dealing with Y2K. A Y2K computer search brings up at least
800 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, other financial institutions and professional
organizations have published brochures and articles designed to
inform investors of the nature of the problem and to reassure them
that it will not be ``the end of the world as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   But one mainstream analyst who comes close to a doom-and-gloom
attitude is Edward Yardeni, chief economist and strategist for
Deutsche Bank Securities. He has repeatedly forecast widespread
computer breakdowns that threaten to cause a worldwide recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we're hearing lots of good news doesn't mean that
everyone who's important to our economy will be ready,'' Yardeni
said in a published interview.
</P>
<P>
   If individual investors are not yet absorbed by Y2K, it may be
because they are distracted by a stock market that has already
suffered a moderate midyear correction and two Federal Reserve
interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage, people are wondering if the market has already
topped out,'' said Victor Ugolyn, chief executive officer of the
Enterprise Group of mutual funds, based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the individual's concerns, they are likely to
be about interest rates, or whether there will be inflation, or a
turnaround in the price of oil. Y2K is there, but pretty far down
the list,'' said Ugolyn.
</P>
<P>
   That's not just a local phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Yankelovich Partners Inc., a research organization, conducted a
national survey for the Securities Industry Association in April
and May and found that only 6 percent of investors said they would
be likely to take money out of stocks before the year 2000 due to
concern about computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   J. Walker Smith, a vice president of Yankelovich Partners,
attributed that low level of concern to the amount of publicity the
problem has gotten in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels like, wherever the problem might be, it has
been addressed, especially in the last six to 12 months,'' said
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, people are getting a little tired of hearing
about it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith blames the doom-and-gloom tenor of some scenarios on
``consultants who can't sell their services unless they create a
demand, and they have been very skillful in stirring up hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that 2000 marks the end of a millennium, with its
biblical allusions to Armageddon, contributes to the Y2K issue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial advisers are concerned that gullible investors may be
taken in by various defensive schemes, some of which border on the
survivalist agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is money to be made by playing on people's fears,'' said
Calhoun. ``In the recession of the early '90s, the doomsday
scenarios recommended that people put their money in gold. That was
the worst strategy they could have adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun and other advisers urge investors not to do anything
drastic with their assets. Their advice is mostly common sense in
nature: Keep good records of holdings and transactions and stick to
a long-range strategy unless there is some compelling reason to
change.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of issues that individuals are likely to
become more concerned about as the year wears on, the advisers
agree.
</P>
<P>
   What won't change is the predicament that everybody is in
because of the unique nature of the problem. There are no
precedents for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in unknown territory,'' said Atlanta investment adviser
Lewis J. Walker, chief executive of Walker Capital Management and
national president of the Institute of Certified Investment
Management Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an adviser, I can't look back and say, `We went through
this back in '72 and '73, and did this and that.' At the same time,
this is not something that is catching us by surprise. The
uncertainty is there, but it's not the same as something coming at
us out of the blue.

FREEH SEEKS INDEPENDENT PROBE OF DEADLY WACO BLAZE, SAYS FBI
SPOKESMAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ FBI Director Louis Freeh, believing his agency's
credibility is in question, wants someone from outside the bureau
to examine whether his agents helped set the deadly blaze at the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco in 1993, an agency spokesman
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh believes the FBI cannot credibly investigate itself
following the agency's belated admission that it might have used
pyrotechnic devices in storming the cult's facility after a 51-day
standoff with group leader David Koresh and his followers, said
spokesman Tron Brekke.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who had denied for six years that
the FBI used incendiary material, has called for an investigation
to ``get to the truth'' of what munitions the FBI fired during its
April 19 raid on Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has met with Freeh regarding how the Branch Davidian
probe should be conducted, has not decided if someone inside or
outside the Justice Department should handle the inquiry. Brekke
declined to say whether Freeh had made his position clear to Reno,
his superior at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be better to have an outside group do the investigation
so there can be no question of conflict of interest or
impartiality,'' Brekke said in describing Freeh's opinion. ``We
understand the need to do a complete, thorough and impartial
investigation .... Our interest here is in getting to the bottom of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between Reno and Freeh followed the FBI's
acknowledgment last Wednesday that its agents might have used a
``very limited number'' of flammable military gas canisters to
penetrate the roof of an underground bunker away from the main
Branch Davidian building. These canisters ``may have contained a
substance that is designed to disperse the gas using a pyrotechnic
mixture,'' the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 75 cult members, including Koresh, were killed by
gunfire and the fire that erupted during the raid. An earlier
federal investigation concluded that some Branch Davidians shot
fellow members and deliberately set the fire during the siege, but
leading Republican lawmakers say that investigation is now tainted.
</P>
<P>
   House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Dan
Burton, R-Ind. and a vocal critic of Reno, plans to subpoena the
White House, Justice Department and Pentagon on Wednesday for any
documents and evidence related to the FBI's possible use of
pyrotechnic devices at Mount Carmel, committee spokesman Mark
Corallo said. Burton, who plans to hold hearings this fall on the
siege, has already subpoenaed the Texas Rangers and the U.S.
attorney's office in Waco for information, Corallo added.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon will be asked for information related to reports
that members of the Army's elite Delta Force anti-terrorism unit
were at the scene of the raid, Corallo said. The Defense Department
has said three military observers were at Mount Carmel but had no
operational involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah and a
presidential candidate, agreed with Freeh that an independent
investigation is needed. The senator said he expects to hold
hearings on the siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must determine whether this was a cover-up or a negligent
oversight,'' the senator said. ``There must be an independent
inquiry of this matter because the credibility of this Justice
Department is at an all-time low.''

UNDATED: impact on them.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Maines' steel playing, though, that helped spearhead a
sound and scene among Lubbock musicians such as Ely, Hancock, Allen
and Jimmie Dale Gilmore _ singer/songwriters who often performed
together (with Maines) and whose eccentric, poignant looks at
small-town Texas life became sonic blueprints for the waves of
Texas songwriters to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on just about everything that came out of there during
that time,'' says Allen. ``There's no way his playing didn't have a
huge influence on that era of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ely says Maines' steel was unlike anything he had heard before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was this screaming rock 'n' roll steel that would scare you
to death,'' he says. ``He truly invented his own sound.''
</P>
<P>
   That sound would eventually turn up on countless records _ by
Ely, Hancock, the Maines Brothers, Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff Walker,
Andy Wilkinson, Ray Wylie Hubbard and many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I influenced all of the above, but I also feel they
influenced me,'' Maines says. ``The way I approach things, record
things. I learned something from everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Maines' first landmark record came early: Allen's ``Lubbock (On
Everything),'' a 1978 effort often cited as one of the most
important records in the history of Texas music, as well as country
music in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a classic in Texas music history,'' says Casey
Monahan, director of the Texas Music Office in Austin. ``Lloyd
could have quit when that came out, with his place assured in Texas
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a wonderful songwriter, says that record is so special
because it features so many artists of that time and place,
focusing on a single project. Maines, Ely, Jesse Taylor, Don
Caldwell and Curtis McBride all contributed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kinda like a family gathering,'' Allen says. ``It felt
like a family after we finished it.''
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't then, that ring of performers soon became a family.
Lubbock signaled the beginning of long, fruitful relationships
among everyone involved in Lubbock's music scene. Ely and Allen,
especially, would become inseparable from Maines. For a time during
the late '70s, Maines was a part of Ely's band, which toured with
everyone from Linda Ronstadt to the Clash. When Maines got married
and had children, though, he decided to cut back on touring so he
could spend more time with his family and work close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I needed to be home more. I had a wife and two
young kids who were in their formative years,'' Maines says. ``Ely
was great about it. He left me an open-door policy _ play when you
wanna play, when you can't, ya can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The late '80s and early '90s brought Maines a new wave of
attention and demand, primarily due to his work with Jerry Jeff
Walker and Robert Earl Keen. Maines produced several Walker discs,
including his 1997 effort, ``Come Away to Belize.'' But although
Maines had also worked with Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, Hubbard, Radney
Foster, and the Robison brothers, Charlie and Bruce, Maines'
association with frat-crowd magnet Robert Earl Keen was perhaps his
cash cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``My affiliation with him certainly hasn't hurt me,'' Maines
says. ``Since (working with Keen), I've had all these young Texas
singer/songwriters coming up to me, wanting me to produce them.''
</P>
<P>
   A DIXIE DAD: Further complementing and complicating his life and
career, his daughter Natalie joined Dallas bluegrass act the Dixie
Chicks, whose 1998 major-label debut, ``Wide Open Spaces,'' has
sold more than 6 million copies. Speculation about Natalie's
joining has been the talk of the industry since Spaces took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``VH1 was here yesterday and interviewed me and my wife (Tina)
about this,'' Maines says. ``I actually played with the Chicks
before Natalie even joined them. A lot of people don't even realize
this, but Laura Lynch (the group's pre-Natalie singer) had called
me and told me she was getting tired of the road and her daughter
was 13 and she wanted to spend time with her. It was a painful
departure for her, but one she knew she had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, I just gave 'em a cassette of Natalie
singing,'' he says. ``I wasn't even pitching her for the band. That
never even entered my mind. I just wanted to let them know what one
of my offspring was doing. Apparently, they kept the tape. Almost a
year later, (band member) Martie (Seidel) called and asked me if I
thought Natalie would be interested. She jumped on it. Within a
week, she had all the songs learned and was playing her first gig
with 'em.'' Massive popularity soon ensued. On Tuesday, the Chicks
released their much-anticipated second disc, ``Fly.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, with plenty of star power under his belt, Maines
knows he could easily move to Nashville and rake in twice as much
money as he's making now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a couple offers to move to Nashville, and it wouldn't
take me long to break into the scene there,'' he says. ``But I like
living in Texas, and these new kids deserve fair treatment and
getting their music captured the way they want it captured. You get
a lot of satisfaction with people being happy with the way their
music has turned out, and I've had great luck at accomplishing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than 30 years of performing and producing, the only
thing Maines has yet to do: put out his own record. Just may
happen, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife the one thing I'm gonna set a goal to do is to
make a record this year, but I just don't have the time right
now,'' he says. ``It's hard for me to turn work down. When you're
self-employed, you like to hear the phone ring. I'll still do the
record. But if I'm gonna be in the spotlight, I'll have to dye my
hair.''

GOING THROUGH A `DIFFICULT' PHASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labels are a destructive, hurtful byproduct of our very mean,
mean-person, meanie society. I know. I endured many before
fatherhood: e.g., ``baldie,'' ``flirt'' and ``hack.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a caring father, I have to endure another unfair label:
``difficult.'' It's so wrongly applied to me. Herewith, I make my
case that I am not difficult, merely ``concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   I wrote a few weeks ago about my daughter's impending maturation
into kindergartenhood. I warned readers that I was having trouble
imagining that my sweet angel of purity _ hereinafter, ``Maddison''
_ was ready to leave the nest, primarily because state laws forbade
me from standing at the classroom door all day in an attempt to
ensure Maddison's every whim was served.
</P>
<P>
   Since many of you have asked, I will first tell you that my
daughter has adjusted to kindergarten fine. Swell. Loved it. Has a
friend named Kia. She's infatuated with some boy who eats whatever
comes out of his nose. Wants to get to school early so she can
swing while belting out ``Deep in the Hundred-Acre Wood.'' Normal
kid stuff.
</P>
<P>
   I, however, have been labled ``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   It began on Day 1 at 0800 hours. The kindergartners filed into
class, parents in tow, and took their seats. They immediately began
coloring with school-issued Crayolas. There were, as I recall,
eight in the box. I always provided my precious ball of bubbly
perfection (i.e., Maddison) with 24 crayons at home, but, you know
... public schools. Whatareya gonna do?
</P>
<P>
   The teacher _ whom I'm still running background checks on; full
report in weeks to come _ told the children that they could, if
they so desired, write their first names on the sheet of paper they
were drawing//coloring on.
</P>
<P>
   This was no problem. My daughter, after many years of day care,
not only has many separation issues that will be probed in therapy
someday but also knows how to write her name very well. I stood
proudly as she wrote it out in, I believe, Violet. Some parents,
overly concerned with ``competition'' between tots, panicked
because their munchkins were so behind Maddison. You could see them
huddle around their tot, frantically blurting out in stage
whispers, ``DEEE ... AYYY ... ARRR ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``And now,'' the teacher said, ``you can write your last name.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddison looked up at Mommy and Daddy with confusion. She had
never practiced this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last name!'' I bellowed uncontrollably, then turned to my
wife. ``What kind of psychotic taxpayer-funded last-name-writing
boot camp are they running here?'' Then I noticed that Kia, across
from my poor bewildered baby, whipped out her last name. This was
serious. My daughter was ... ``behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher noticed my wild eyes and red face. She squinted. I
could read her mind: ``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wife, please make a note,'' I said. ``Tonight, two pots of
coffee, a Big Chief tablet and six solid hours of last-name
calisthenics.''
</P>
<P>
   I think it was Day 4 that sealed it.
</P>
<P>
   All seemed to go well at first. Swinging at 0730. The line-up
bell at 0750. But the teacher was late. The kids and parents waited
in the hall. We were told something about ``car trouble,'' but that
the kids would be ``fine.'' They could wait in another teacher's
classroom until their teacher arrived. The parents kissed their
munchkins and left for work. All 'cept one. That would be me. Dr.
Difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, can I help you?'' asked a pleasant person from the school
office who had been sent to deal with this person standing in the
hallway at 0820. ``Nope,'' I said, ``juuuuust waitin' on teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Office person's eye's narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, sir, I can relay a message ...?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you are, sir. What can I tell the teacher?''
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. I gave in. I figured I'd now been labeled ``difficult.''
But the next level is ``psychotic,'' and we don't want to go there,
so ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted her to know that Maddison doesn't like peanuts
in her M&AMP;M's. So if someone could be assigned to remove them before
snack, you know, that'd be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, I decided on the way to work, and based on reports from
the PTA meeting, I don't think I won the ``difficult vs.
concerned'' debate.

HOUSTON TEACHER ARRESTED AFTER COCAINE FOUND IN SCHOOL BATHROOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HANSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A special education teacher was arrested Tuesday on
drug charges after cocaine was found in a room the teacher had just
vacated, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Yvonne Dailing, 38, a teacher at Jefferson Elementary
School, was charged Tuesday with possession of a controlled
substance, said Carmen Abascal Gomez, a spokeswoman for the Houston
Independent School District.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said that around 12:15 p.m. CST Monday, workers at the
school noticed that Dailing was behaving erratically.
</P>
<P>
   ``She met with the school nurse and then asked if she could use
the principal's restroom, which she did,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   After Dailing left the restroom, the school principal, Ann
Zamarripa, went into the restroom and noticed there was a bag in
the room containing what appeared to be drugs, the spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said the principal called HISD police, who had the
substance tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be 5.5 grams of cocaine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   HISD police took the case to the Harris County District
Attorney's office, where the charges were filed in the 182nd
District Court. Bail was set at $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said Dailing was arrested about 3 a.m. Tuesday at her
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Dailing, who instructs children on different grade levels, will
remain on the district's payroll, but she will be relieved of
teaching duties pending the outcome of the case, Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She also said Dailing was given a drug test and, if the results
are positive, the teacher will be terminated.
</P>
<P>
   HISD teachers are not drug tested before employment, Gomez said.
However, she said teachers are tested randomly or at the request of
a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   HISD officials said drug offenses among teachers are so rare
that they don't keep statistics on drug-related firings.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Federation of Teachers President Gayle Fallon concurred
that few teachers have ever been charged with drug possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not common,'' she said. ``It's tragic, but it's not
common.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A review of Houston Chronicle stories showed only two drug
arrests of HISD teachers in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some parents outside the school in north Houston
expressed surprise about the arrest, while others said they did not
know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Pilar Sifuentes, standing outside the school Tuesday waiting for
her two children, said she was not bothered by the arrest. ``They
don't even have any contact with her,'' Sifuentes said.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Guagarer said she was shocked to learn of the allegations.
``They should check out all the teachers before they let them in
the school,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another parent, who did not want to be identified, said she was
concerned about the arrest but added that such incidents can happen
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good school. Drugs are every where in this
country,'' she said.

<P>
   IZMIT, Turkey _ A strong tremor shook already devastated towns
in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday, bringing several buildings
crashing down and causing at least one death.
</P>
<P>
   It was the strongest tremor to hit the area since the shattering
earthquake of Aug. 17, which killed more than 14,000 people.
Thousands more are still missing and hundreds of thousands are
homeless as a result of that quake.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's tremor, which shook the Earth back and forth for about
10 seconds, struck shortly after 11 a.m. and was followed by an
aftershock about 20 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The principal observatory in Istanbul said the first tremor
measured 5.2 on the commonly used scale of magnitude and the
aftershock measured 4.6. Seismologists with the U.S. Geological
Survey put the strength slightly higher at 5.4 for Tuesday's
initial tremor and 4.7 for the aftershock.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Izmit, where many homeless families are living in tents
and railway boxcars, 166 people were admitted to hospitals and
clinics after being hit by debris.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-year-old man was killed when masonry fell on him as he was
fleeing a building that had been weakened in the Aug. 17 quake.
Seven buildings were reported to have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   A man broke his leg in the town of Adapazari when he jumped from
the third floor of a swaying building. The local governor sent
aides into the streets with loudspeakers to urge residents not to
panic.
</P>
<P>
   In Golcuk, a town on the Sea of Marmara that was one of the
hardest hit by the Aug. 17 quake, which had a magnitude measured at
7.4, Tuesday's tremor sent people racing away from blocks of
already weakened buildings. Many buildings shook, but none fell.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's tremor was also felt in some parts of Istanbul, which
is about 65 miles from the apparent epicenter near Izmit. Dishes
rattled in some homes, and desks shook in one of the few schools
where the academic year had already begun.
</P>
<P>
   But in Istanbul as in other areas, the main effect was
psychological.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it doesn't do more damage, I don't like it,'' said
Yusuf Ozkul, a carpenter in Golcuk who lost his home in the earlier
quake and who is now living in a tent beside the Sea of Marmara.
``It makes me nervous, because I've seen what these things can do.
I hate it when the ground shakes, even if it only shakes a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The tremor struck minutes after J. Brady Anderson, administrator
of the U.S. Agency for International Development, left Golcuk after
a tour of the devastated area.
</P>
<P>

   Prosecutors in the town of Duzce, on the eastern edge of the

   They were charged with using low-quality concrete, weak
reinforcing rods and shoddy construction techniques that led to the
fatal collapses of their buildings in the Aug. 17 quake.

   ``I've been a construction engineer for 30 years, and I've never

   One Turkish contractor who is being sought by police, Veli

large apartment complex in the seaside town of Yalova in which
several hundred people are believed to have perished.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for me to have a guilty conscience,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``Naturally I sympathize with the victims and
their families, but I don't understand why I'm being made a
scapegoat. I began building the Bahcekent complex in Yalova about
six years ago. Naturally I didn't know much about the business. I
studied literature in school. I'm a poet, not a structural
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember visiting my first construction site. I saw workers
using beach sand to make concrete. When I asked about it, the
architect told me it was completely normal. Only later did I learn
that this is a completely wrong and dangerous technique. So I gave
the order to stop doing such a disgusting thing. Unfortunately,
half the complex was already finished by then.''

 &HT;    FREEH 'WOULD SUPPORT' OUTSIDE WACO INVESTIGATOR
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI would ``welcome and cooperate with'' an
outside investigation of its handling of the 1993 siege at the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, an agency spokesman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While not specifically recommending that Attorney General Janet
Reno call in an independent investigator, bureau director Louis
Freeh has made it clear during regular conversations with Reno that
the bureau would not object to such a move, said FBI spokesman Tron
(CQ) Brekke.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of talk is going around that the FBI can't investigate
ourselves,'' Brekke said. ``I think we would be very comfortable
with any outside investigator or staff of investigators that the
attorney general might choose.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, a division of Reno's Justice Department, has been
under fire for more than a week because of its disclosure last week
that ``pyrotechnic'' canisters containing a riot control substance
were used on April 19, 1993, the day the religious cult's Mt.
Carmel compound burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure, which contradicted assurances by Reno and FBI
officials for more than six years that no incendiary devices were
used by federal officials at Waco, touched off a new round of
congressional investigations and caused Reno to declare that she
was ``upset'' at having been misled by bureau officials.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform Committee has issued subpoenas in
its own investigation of the use of what FBI officials have
described as ``a very limited number'' of the exploding canisters
on the final day of the extended Waco siege.
</P>
<P>
   The committee wants to see evidence gathered by Texas Rangers
following the fire in which cult leader David Koresh and 79 other
members of his apocalyptic sect died, according to a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the Government Reform
Committee, has said he will hold hearings on the matter in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Rangers' evidence, Burton has said he wants
to know what role members of the U.S. Army's secret ``Delta Force''
anti-terrorism unit played in the Waco tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department and the FBI have acknowledged that three
or four active duty members of the military were at the Branch
Davidian standoff but only as observers and advisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the interest of avoiding a potential perception on the part
of the media and others of a conflict of interest, it might be in
the best interest of everybody concerned to have outside
investigators,'' said Brekke. ``We have 40 assistant directors here
and a staff that does this kind of investigation quite often, but
some people are saying the FBI can't investigate itself and any
findings would be tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Reno was quoted by the Associated Press as
saying she had not made a decision Tuesday on how to investigate
the FBI's admission that some exploding canisters of ``CS,'' a
military riot control substance, were used at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials say the canisters were fired away from the
compound where Koresh and his followers holed up during the 51-day
siege and were used early on April 19, roughly six hours before the
Davidians' compounds burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Documents made public last week by the FBI and the Defense
Department indicate Reno questioned not only FBI officials, but
also commanders of the ``Delta Force'' and Defense Department
chemical weapons specialists, about the affects of the CS before
approving its use to force Davidians out of their compound.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was told the bureau had evidence children inside
the rambling wood-frame building were being abused and that the
extremely irritating substance would force members of the sect to
leave the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after an armored military vehicle began pumping CS dust
into the Davidian's building, the structure burst into flames. The
FBI has said the Davidians themselves set fire to the building.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Financial reports from Internet retailers are like the
pronouncements of the Delphic Oracle: future-focused and infamously
inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers, Sears and Wal-Mart among them, report
changes in sales for stores open at least one year, providing
analysts a way to evaluate whether growth is real or merely a
construct of new stores. Online merchants offer no such equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the king of e-tailers, reports skyrocketing revenues
each quarter. But the numbers include income from newly acquired
businesses, leaving outsiders no way to discern whether the core
book business is driving the growth or whether income from the new
additions masks a decline there. (In his most recent quarterly call
with investors, Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos
said revenue was growing across all parts of the business, but
declined to give specifics. His remarks put pressure on the stock,
which has fallen 40 percent from its peak in April but remains up
16 percent for the year.)
</P>
<P>
   Since most Wall Street analysts who follow Internet retailers
work for firms grown fat on taking these companies public, there is
little incentive to complain. But a small group of renegade
skeptics has taken on the task of clearing the fog and are applying
their approach to companies besides Amazon. Their method is simple
_ perhaps deceptively so. They are taking the two numbers that
e-tailers love to trumpet (because they are always growing) _ total
revenues for a quarter and total customer base _ and dividing one
by the other. The results are eyebrow raising. They go straight
down.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Von der Porten, who runs a small hedge fund in San Carlos,
Calif., has crunched the numbers for Amazon and CDNow, the online
music store rated the sixth-largest Web shopping site in July by
MediaMetrix. He found that CDNow's revenues per customer declined
in 1998 from $23.15 to $21.26. The first half of 1999, after CDNow
bought a competitor N2K, brought an even more precipitous drop to
$18.15 at the end of the first quarter and $14.42 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   For Amazon, Von der Porten calculates a similar plunge. Revenues
per customer for the fiscal quarter ended in July were $29.26, down
20 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Looked at through this prism, Ebay also looks like a bloodbath.
Faye Landes, who follows the online auction leader for Thomas
Weisel Partners, estimates that revenues per user declined from
$10.30 in the first quarter of 1998 to $6.80 for the second quarter
of this year. Significantly, the decline resists cyclical upturns
around Christmas, and has been a steady drum beat since early last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp drop at Ebay suggests that its dazzling stock gain may
be masking a major weakness. Ebay's stock has gained 56 percent
this year. Ebay closed Tuesday at $125.5625, up $6.125, while CDNow
closed at $14.125, down 22 percent for the year and well off its
$16 offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies are swift to point out the gaping flaw in the
formula, namely that the number of customers is cumulative, not
taking into account people who shop once or twice and never come
back. It is inherently unfair, they say, to divide revenues for one
quarter by all-time customers. ``Not every person shops every
quarter. So a steady decline is exactly what you would expect to
see,'' said Bill Curry, an exasperated Amazon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay also faults the approach. ``It doesn't pass the common
sense test,'' added Steve Westly, a vice president of Ebay. ``On
average, the number is going down because not all customers stay,
but the customer who is staying is spending so much more that it
outweighs the attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   While stock analysts acknowledge the equation is not perfect,
they say it is justified by the companies' own business model.
Online merchants have long argued that they should not be judged as
conventional businesses. They justify huge current loses by saying
that revenues will be recouped as customers spend more.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, for example, rationalizes the deficits it has rung up
lately to add an auction house and a toy store to its site by
reasoning that in the future, customers who previously used the
site to buy just books will add a Ricky Martin CD and Pokemon cards
to their shopping baskets when they come in search of the John
Grisham thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the ones inviting this comparison and this
calculation,'' Von Der Porten said. ``E-tailers need strong repeat
business in order to generate profits from their customer bases.
That's why the declining per-customer revenues call into question
the viability of the business model.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive as they are to the criticism, Internet retailers have
not released numbers that might make such imperfect calculations
unnecessary. Amazon could disclose how many customers it has each
quarter, a statistic that would provide a fairer measure of growth.
Will they? ``Nope,'' said Curry. ``We consider that proprietary
information.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ As he wanders the nation prophesying a
political apocalypse, Alan L. Keyes, the staunchly conservative
radio talk show host, is the invisible man in the Republican
primary for president.
</P>
<P>
   He gets few cameras at his events. Political analysts tend to
forget him in their prognostications. Polls show him receiving one
percent of the vote or less. And when the Log Cabin Republicans, a
homosexual group, issued a news release last week attacking
religious conservatives for intolerance, Keyes didn't even merit a
mention.
</P>
<P>
   But to his small yet devoted cadre of followers, Keyes is the
best kept secret of the campaign. To them, Keyes, a former Reagan
administration diplomat with a Harvard Ph.D., has something his
fellow conservatives lack: mesmerizing oratorical skills twinned
with a messianic vision.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the heart of the Keyes for President campaign.
With little money, name recognition, organization or governing
experience, Keyes is running on his powerful voice, breathlessly
wooing far-right voters with Boschian word pictures of schools that
are ``places of death,'' taxpayers who are ``enchained slaves'' and
children who have fallen into a ``howling moral void.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he is given little chance of winning _ he finished
seventh of nine candidates in the Iowa straw poll _ winning is not
what he promises his followers. What he offers is the chance to
feel morally correct on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion I've reached is that no one is doing what I
believe needs to be done,'' Keyes said in a recent interview,
speaking of the moral issues. ``If I were satisfied that anyone
else was addressing it, I would not run.''
</P>
<P>
   His campaign chairman in South Carolina, Hal W. Stevenson, said,
``If you only care about your chances of winning, you don't back a
guy like Alan. You back him because you like what you hear. You'll
feel better when the election is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes did win the Alabama Republican straw poll last Saturday,
but other than Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who finished second, he
was the only candidate who competed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at a time when several Republican candidates, including
the front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, are trying to downplay
divisive issues like abortion and gay rights, Keyes provides an
eloquently uncomfortable reminder that, to some dedicated
conservatives, ideological purity matters more than victory in
November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a struggle going on in the party,'' said
Keyes, 49, who also ran for president in 1996. ``It's a struggle
between the Money-is-God Republicans and the God-is-God
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Keyes aims the sharpest barbs at Bush, whom he
considers a tepid-tongued pragmatist. In Greenville, he mocked
Bush's slogan of ``compassionate conservatism,'' saying, ``You
don't prove you are compassionate by talking about it.'' He accused
Bush of exploiting moral issues, ``without being seriously
committed to facing the moral challenges.'' And he ridiculed the
Texan for saying he would not demand that all his nominees to the
federal bench share his opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it true we need leaders who will be vague in their response
to the most compelling moral issues we face as a people?'' Keyes,
who is black, asked the virtually all-white crowd in Greenville.
``No!'' many of them responded.
</P>
<P>
   Though his campaign has received little media attention, Keyes
has consistently drawn hundreds of people to his ``Renewing
America'' speeches in South Carolina, Iowa and New Hampshire.
Marietta Kaiser, 72, of Greenville, walked out a convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a breath of fresh air,'' she said following Keyes'
appearance here two weeks ago. ``We've heard the cliches of the
other candidates, and they just don't move the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   But his against-all-odds campaign has drawn questions from some
rivals and analysts, who suggest that he is using the race to draw
attention to his speaking-for-hire business and to gain listeners
for his radio program, which until recently was syndicated to about
75 stations in more than 43 states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, Keyes gave about 20 paid speeches a year,
typically to corporations or college groups, charging between
$12,000 and $15,000 for each, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But the aides scoffed at the assertion that he profits from
running for office. They said that he suspended the radio show
during the campaign and has scaled back his paid speaking
engagements to about 15 this year. They added that most of his
speeches are given free to benefit pregnancy counseling centers and
anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics have asked whether Keyes is living off his
campaign account, as he did during his losing 1992 U.S. Senate race
in Maryland when he paid himself more than $8,000 a month from
campaign donations. Though the practice was legal, it prompted
criticism even from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes says he is not drawing a salary from his campaign fund,
which had raised $1.9 million as of June 30 and had $172,497 on
hand. But he argues that the practice is legitimate and that his
critics are ``wealthy oligarchs.''
</P>
<P>
   In private, Keyes cuts a different figure from the acid-tongued
talk show performer who has amazed even the most combative hosts
with his ability to shout them down. With his goatee and newly trim
build _ he has lost 70 pounds in two years _ he can come across as
a genial academic. An opera buff, he confesses to relaxing with
westerns and action films or ``Star Trek'' re-runs.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, the youngest of five children, is the son of a career
Army officer who moved the family repeatedly through Italy and the
United States. Raised a Roman Catholic, Keyes attended parochial
schools for much of his youth, though he graduated from a public
high school in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, he was already demonstrating his powerful
speaking skills, winning the American Legion's national oratorical
competition and getting elected president of the Legion's Boys
Nation, the first black to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Though his parents were die-hard Democrats who admired John F.
Kennedy, Keyes became a Republican while attending Cornell
University in the late 1960s, where he viewed Vietnam War
protesters as repugnantly anti-American. He transferred to Harvard,
where he earned a doctorate in government.
</P>
<P>
   While serving as a State Department official in India during the
Reagan administration, he met Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, who later
called him ``one of the most dramatically articulate people'' she
had ever met. After she became chief delegate to the United
Nations, Ms. Kirkpatrick made Keyes the ambassador to the U.N.
Economic and Social Council. Reagan later appointed him assistant
secretary of state for international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In India, Keyes also met his wife, Jocelyn Marcel Keyes, who is
Indian. They have three children and live in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Keyes' speeches are aural spectacles, part revivalist sermons,
part Oprah. With a microphone on his lapel, he wanders through the
audience, talking _ sometimes in a whisper, sometimes in a shout _
for an hour or more without notes, weaving incandescent images of
an America going to Hell in a high-speed handbasket.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that a collective loss of faith in God's authority has
caused a panoply of social ills, from the breakdown of
``marriage-based families'' to the Columbine shootings to failing
schools to ``immoral'' military interventions abroad, including in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Without God in their lives or their politics, Americans are
allowing an increasingly authoritarian central government to tax
and regulate them into submission, he says. Likening Americans to a
frog that sits calmly in a pot while the water gets hotter, he
argues that Americans are passively watching their freedoms erode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're past medium rare and headed toward well done,'' he said
in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, he prescribes some strong medicine. He would
eliminate the income tax and finance the government on tariffs,
duties and excise taxes. He would end welfare and outlaw abortion.
He has even endorsed the public paddling of parents who abandon
their children.
</P>
<P>
   But in private conversation, Keyes reveals more nuanced views.
And that makes for some interesting paradoxes.
</P>
<P>
   Though he ridicules targeted tax cuts as ``marionette strings,''
he also endorses federally subsidized mortgages for families and
tax breaks for banks that invest in poor neighborhoods. And while
he warns that ``perpetual war'' is a means by which totalitarian
governments control their citizens, he is not an isolationist,
having strongly supported America's involvement in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Grenada and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   There are interesting nuances in Keyes' views on race as well.
He is an ardent opponent of affirmative action and other race-based
social programs. But he also speaks passionately about the need to
address urban poverty through private investment, and has often
lambasted the Republican Party for not recruiting more blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans vacillate between trying to buy off black
voters with programs, trying to out-Democrat the Democrats, and
just writing them off,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Keyes says, his revulsion for slavery has intensified
his conservatism, not weakened it. As a teenager, he voraciously
read books about slavery, weeping while he wondered why more slaves
did not revolt. Lincoln became his hero. Even his stump-speech
language _ ``We need to strike off our chains,'' is a favorite
phrase _ is drawn from the peculiar institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered, why didn't people resist to the point of
fighting and dying?'' he said. ``Why would human beings let
themselves be oppressed, when they could have said, `give me
liberty or give me death,' and gone out in a blaze of resistance?''

PURE NITROUS OXIDE CUTS OFF ALL OXYGEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nitrous oxide, the colorless, sweet-tasting gas believed to have
been involved in the death early Tuesday morning of MIT student
Richard A. Guy, has been used for decades as both a legitimate form
of anesthesia and, not so legitimately, as a drug to induce
euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   When used properly to induce anesthesia, it is quite safe,
anesthesiologists say, because it is always given as a mixture with
oxygen. But if someone breathed 100 percent nitrous oxide, that
would mean he was getting no oxygen, which would be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Discovered in England in the late 1700s, nitrous oxide (not to
be confused with another gas, nitric oxide) was common in traveling
fairs, said Dr. Jeffrey Uppington, a Massachusetts General Hospital
anesthesiologist. After a few puffs, people would start ``cavorting
around,'' triggering the nickname, ``laughing gas.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 1830s, an American dentist, Dr. Horace Wells, noticed
that during such gaiety, people seemed to experience no pain, the
first clue that the euphoria-inducing gas might be an analgesic as
well.
</P>
<P>
   To prove his hunch, Wells arranged for a public demonstration of
nitrous oxide at MGH in January 1845. But he apparently failed to
give enough because his patient yelped as Wells pulled his tooth.
</P>
<P>
   With cries of ``Humbug!'' medical students drove Wells from the
room. (A more successful demonstration of anesthesia _ with ether _
occurred the next year at MGH, prompting surgeon John Collins
Warren to proclaim then, ``Gentlemen, this is no humbug!'')
</P>
<P>
   Despite this awkward beginning, nitrous oxide was soon adopted
by surgeons and dentists because it worked quickly _ inducing a
rapid onset of anesthesia and wearing off fast, too.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nitrous oxide is used in virtually every operating room,
though it's still unclear precisely how it (or any general
anesthetic, for that matter) works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common anesthetic agent. We use it all the time,'' said
Dr. David Feinstein, an anesthesiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But to prevent danger, anesthesiologists always use a mixture of
70 percent nitrous oxide to 30 percent oxygen. In fact, anesthesia
machines are calibrated to mix the two gases so that the patient
never breathes 100 percent nitrous oxide.
</P>
<P>
   The human body does not naturally make nitrous oxide, but it
does make the gas with which it is often confused, nitric oxide,
which causes blood vessels to dilate. Nitric oxide is often given
in intensive care units to patients suffering from pulmonary
hypertension; inhaled, it works quickly to dilate blood vessels in
the lungs, without reducing blood pressure elsewhere in the body.

   PARIS _ When Thierry Desmarest joined the French oil company
Total as an exploration expert 19 years ago, most of Total's
shareholders were French _ including the French state, with 35
percent _ and most of its profit was made in France. Its far larger
domestic rival, Elf Aquitaine, was mainly a government fief run by
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest, now the chairman at age 53, mused in a recent
conversation that it would be ``difficult to imagine'' Total
contemplating a merger with Elf back then.
</P>
<P>
   Today both companies are publicly owned, and about 65 percent of
Total's shareholders and 51 percent of Elf's are not French.
Earlier this year, Total took the brash step of merging with the
big Belgian group Petrofina to become Total Fina, and it is now
locked in a brawl to acquire Elf Aquitaine. If Desmarest succeeds,
and he is convinced he will by the end of the year, the combined
Elf and Total Fina will still be only half the size of new giants
taking shape, like the Mobil-Exxon combination, but it will dwarf
many European rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things can change rapidly,'' Desmarest said, seated in his
office here with a view of Elf's black glass headquarters tower.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, France has moved to shake up and slim
down its corporate world more thoroughly and quickly than many had
thought possible. And in the process, it is simultaneously creating
a kind of fortress within Europe even as it reaches aggressively
beyond its borders into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   France has gone through periods of wrenching restructuring in
the past. In the 1980s, heavy industries like steel and coal, as
well as financial services like insurance, were reorganized, and
tens of thousands of jobs were shed.
</P>
<P>
   But while those changes, aimed at overcoming a chronic bloat
that was smothering the economy, required France to go through a
decade of pain, there are tentative signs that the latest wave will
produce a much faster payoff.
</P>
<P>
   France has become a darling of foreign investors, and the Paris
bourse has surged by 50 percent in two years, against an average of
44 percent for the top 300 European companies.
</P>
<P>
   Growth prospects are brighter than in a long time. This year,
the economy is expected to grow 2.5 percent, and though that is
less than last year's 3.3 percent because of the downturn in
emerging markets, the government expects as much as 3 percent in
2000. Last year's growth produced a windfall of tax revenues, which
were $6 billion higher than anticipated in this year's first half,
prompting discussion of possible tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   There is even some relief on the job front. Though unemployment,
at 11.5 percent, remains stubbornly high, in this year's second
quarter private-sector jobs rose by 266,000, or nearly 2 percent,
over 1998. The feeling, however tenuous, that things are getting
better has helped transform the gloom that shrouded France in the
mid-1990s into a new consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   And there is little sign that the corporate reshuffling will let
up soon.
</P>
<P>
   In banking, an unsuccessful $37 billion hostile bid by Banque
Nationale de Paris for two domestic rivals, Societe Generale and
Paribas, ended with the takeover of Paribas, a strong investment
bank, by the far larger Banque Nationale, creating what will be the
third-largest bank in Europe after Deutsche Bank, the German
banking giant, and Switzerland's UBS. The takeover will reshape the
banking landscape in ways that could favor future consolidation
beyond France.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the changes, French corporations are entering new
and inventive alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the big aluminum group Pechiney joined Alcan
of Canada and Alusuisse Lonza of Switzerland to form a behemoth to
challenge the pre-eminence of Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the chemical giant Rhone-Poulenc agreed to a $23
billion merger of its drug activities with those of Hoechst in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   And as French companies reorganize, they are flexing their
muscles abroad. Americans were struck in recent months by the
struggle of two French giants, Vivendi and Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux,
for control of the growing American market for water services. In
March, Vivendi, once a stodgy utility called Generale des Eaux,
made the biggest French acquisition ever in the United States when
it paid almost $8 billion for the United States Filter Corp. Not to
be outdone, Lyonnaise des Eaux has spent more than $6 billion on
similar acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other way but to follow the rules of the game as
it's played now,'' said Eric Barthalon, chief economist at Paribas.
Change is much in evidence at Paribas itself after the takeover by
Banque Nationale. Yet Barthalon senses spirits rising.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when he returned to Paris after spending two years at
Paribas' offices in London, ``it was a nightmare,'' he recalled.
Paris was crushed by gloom, particularly among the young, who
thought there was little chance of upward mobility. Talented
graduates emigrated to Britain or the United States, finding work
in Silicon Valley or at London brokerage firms. ``This has pretty
much changed over the last two years,'' Barthalon said. ``Good
people don't have to go abroad for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly, the shake-up is the work of a new type of French-bred
corporate raider. Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH-Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has consolidated the fashion and perfume
businesses. Earlier this year, the billionaire Francois Pinault
bought a large stake in Gucci, the Italian fashion group, in hopes
of creating a rival luxury goods conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   More often, graduates of the elite French training schools are
learning to play by the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Bebear, chairman of the big AXA insurance group, got a
degree from the Ecole Polytechnique. But with results below those
that would have qualified him for top government jobs, Bebear went
to work at a sleepy insurance company in Normandy. In the past, he
would never have made it to the top of French society. But Bebear,
now 63, had a strong sense of opportunity, picking up acquisitions
at opportune moments. The turning point in his career came in 1991,
when AXA paid $1 billion for a majority stake in the Equitable
Insurance Company. Today, AXA's share is worth 15 times that.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bebear went further, acquiring Union des Assurances de
Paris, a big French insurer the government had sold off two years
earlier. But Bebear's real influence comes from AXA's role as one
of France's, and the world's, largest asset managers. AXA is the
biggest shareholder in Elf Aquitaine and owns substantial shares of
Banque Nationale and Paribas. ``He is a fabulous manager, but he
has a vision,'' said Elie Cohen, a leading French economist. He
added that Bebear, who is an avid big-game hunter, brings the same
instinct to his business decision-making. ``He knows that if you
have to kill, you have to kill immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Also driving consolidation is the government's push the last two
years to sell big shares of more than a score of huge enterprises,
including banks, industrial companies, and insurance. Though the
state still holds large stakes in companies like Renault, Air
France and France Telecom, the government of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, despite its Socialist heritage, has sold assets worth more
than $30 billion to private shareholders. Many of these assets have
gone to British and American investment funds, which become
involved with the way the businesses are run, demanding good
returns on investment and sensible long-term strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Total was one of the pioneers. In 1991, the company listed its
shares on the New York Stock Exchange, starting a flood of
investment from institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   And the trend toward an international shareholder base
continues. The arrival of the euro is encouraging European
investors to diversify geographically. ``What strikes me much more
now,'' Desmarest said, ``is the arrival in the last year of new
shareholders from Germany, the Netherlands.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the private sector is getting back into shape,
over-manned government operations pose even greater challenges for
Jospin. Government spending, much of it on railways, postal service
and medical care, account for 54 percent of the economy, against 40
percent in Britain. More than 25 percent of the workers in France
are employed by government compared with 14 percent in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce unemployment, the government has resorted to an
immensely costly make-work program that created 174,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's immediate challenge, advisers say, is getting a handle
on pensions and health spending. With more than two years before
national elections, Jospin wants to start debate on reducing the
gap between government pensions, which reach as much as 85 percent
of final salary, and those in private business, where they are
about 50 percent. To cut medical costs, the government wants to
consolidate the public hospital system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite union resistance to changes in the traditional public
sector, labor leaders support Jospin in his bid to speed financial
and industrial privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Christophe Le Duigou of the executive board of the CGT, the
big labor federation that grew out of the Communist labor movement,
accepts the government's retreat from the business of running
businesses, arguing that the public sector had ``reached its limits
both industrially and financially.''
</P>
<P>
   And he acknowledges that the private sector is creating jobs,
even if many of them are considered temporary or part-time
employment. Last year, hours lost through private-sector strikes
were the fewest ever in postwar France. What his union now wants is
for the government to help by improving education and pouring more
state money into industrial research. Referring to a cellular phone
on his desk, Le Duigou asks, ``Why should this be made by Nokia or
Motorola _ not in France?''
</P>
<P>
   His union is conciliatory in part because Jospin delivered on a
pledge to enact legislation cutting the work week to 35 hours, from
39. The idea, based on a popular notion of the labor market as a
pie of fixed size, is that if the slices are cut smaller, there are
more slices for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Le Duigou acknowledges that the 35-hour week has not
automatically created jobs. Still, he says, the new law is
delivering benefits because it forces labor, business and the
government to sit together and discuss ways to ease the dislocation
caused by corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Business grudgingly swallowed the 35-hour week, negotiating in
exchange a union commitment to more flexibility. In exchange for
fewer hours, business won the right to more overtime, weekend and
night work, increasing the productivity of factories that operate
on high- and low-production cycles, and can now run nonstop in
periods of high demand.
</P>
<P>
   Total Fina is an example. The 35-hour week, Desmarest says,
means the company ``will try to achieve a level of productivity
gains to compensate'' for lost hours. Total Fina should benefit
from greater flexibility at its robot division, which supplies the
auto industry, with its seasonal and cyclical demand.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Desmarest added, he would have preferred a different
approach. ``At the end of the day,'' he said, ``I am not at all
convinced this will create jobs.''

TWO YEARS LATER, DIANA IS THE `FORGOTTEN' PRINCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, on Aug. 31,
1997, marked the beginning of an outpouring of grief and national
stock-taking that astonished no one more than the British
themselves. They awoke to find that they lived in a country whose
most famous lip was suddenly a trembling lower one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two years later, Britons are struck by how quickly the
woman whose funeral drew the largest television audience in history
has come to be overlooked in her own land, how swiftly buttoned-up
royal reserve has returned and how few of the societal changes that
were so confidently forecast then have actually taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgotten'' was the one-word banner headline in the Mirror
deploring the neglect of Diana's memory. ``It is almost as if she
never existed,'' the paper complained. ``If we are not very
careful, there is a real danger that she will disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   The tabloids kept her alive long after her death with adoring
biographical series, reminiscences from acquaintances no matter how
distant, and excerpts from instant books. But, significantly, The
Mirror is now the only newspaper rising to the defense of
enshrining her memory. Attitudes elsewhere in print were epitomized
by Anne McElvoy, a columnist for The Independent, who concluded,
``Diana is yesterday's princess.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Mallory Wober, a social scientist who has just completed a
book on the news media and the monarchy, said he was not surprised
at this year's diminished commemoration. ``When Diana died, we
allowed ourselves to go over the top for a bit, but now we have
gone back to normal,'' he said. ``We have discharged all the grief
at her death, which has thrown up all sorts of emotion _ including
embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a monument in Kensington Park have been shelved
without even a scaled-down tribute under active discussion, and the
exhibit about her life and death at her stately family home Althorp
House is no longer a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchy remains starchy, remote and secure despite the
abrupt readjustments it had to make in the week after Diana's death
to meet the expectations of the sorrowing British population who
thronged central London and demanded that the royal family get more
in touch.
</P>
<P>
   The heir to the throne, Prince Charles, appears in public with
Camilla Parker Bowles, the mistress whose permanent banishment from
his side was said to have been insured by the public canonization
of his dead young former wife.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll by the Sun in June, 59 percent of readers who
responded said that Charles should be free to marry Mrs. Parker
Bowles without having to renounce his right to the crown.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parker Bowles regularly sees Diana's sons, Prince William,
17, and Prince Harry, 14. The boys spent Tuesday, the second
anniversary of Diana's death, with their father in Balmoral, the
Scottish residence of Queen Elizabeth II, rather than with their
other ``blood relatives'' whom Diana's brother Earl Spencer
famously called their true guardians in his eulogy at Westminster
Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The queen decided there would be no special commemoration of
Diana's death, as there was last year when a special prayer service
was held in Crathie Church with Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
wife, Cherie, in attendance. The flag at Buckingham Palace, lowered
a year ago, flew at full staff Tuesday, and the state rooms of the
royal residence in London were open to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Diana, 36, died in Paris in the early hours of Aug. 31, 1997,
from injuries suffered when the chauffeur-driven car carrying her
and her millionaire admirer, Emad Mohammed ``Dodi'' Fayed, 41,
slammed into the wall of an underpass by the side of the Seine,
killing the two of them and the chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   A French judge's official report into the accident and its
causes is to be published shortly, and prosecutors have already
concluded that, contrary to claims in the immediate aftermath,
paparazzi photographers chasing the limousine were not responsible
for its losing control. The driver, Henri Paul, was found to have
three times the legal limit of alcohol in his body and to have been
traveling at excessive speed.
</P>
<P>
   Income to the Diana Memorial Fund has declined substantially,
but much of that is attributable to its announcement last summer
that in fairness to other charities it was no longer actively
seeking money. It is estimated to have attracted $150 million, much
of it in royalties from Sir Elton John's ``Candle in the Wind,''
memorably sung at the funeral, and from approved memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, the fund expects to have distributed
$40 million to charities favored by the princess, including groups
that support land-mine clearance and care for people maimed by the
devices.
</P>
<P>
   The committee to come up with a London monument, headed by
Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer _ the second most
powerful person in the Blair government _ has been dormant since
its proposal for a three-acre memorial garden and fountain outside
her Kensington Palace home was squelched by neighborhood objections
over its size. The committee has not met since November.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a permanent London shrine was the principal
lament of people who placed flowers at the gates outside her former
home Tuesday. ``Where's Diana's memorial?'' one placard read.
``Remembered by the people and forgotten by the establishment,''
said another.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not so many people out here this year, and it's
going to get less and less, which is why we need a permanent
memorial, '' said Joyce Vanherring, 42, from Bracknell in
Berkshire.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors used the occasion to attack the former cavalry
officer James Hewitt, 40, Diana's onetime lover, whose plans to
write a new book about their relationship. The 60 love letters that
the princess wrote him emerged this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ought to be hung, drawn and quartered,'' said Iris O'Brien,
63, of Hornchurch, Essex. Her husband, Michael, 69, said: ``As a
young man, I never went around saying what I did with girlfriends
and things like that. He would have been shot in the past. He is
supposed to be an officer and a gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since his emotional funeral tribute to his
sister galvanized resentment against the royal family, Earl Spencer
has seen his own image battered by coverage of his divorce in South
Africa from a former model, Victoria Lockwood. Among other things,
it emerged that he had scorned her for having eating disorder
problems similar to those of his sister for which he had sought
public sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer observed the second anniversary of Diana's death in
privacy at Althorp House, where Diana spent her teen-age years and
where she is buried. The public exhibit there, which includes a
mock temple, early photographs and home movies, school reports, her
wedding dress, texts of speeches she made and a visit to the
shoreline of the small lake with the island where her grave lies,
closed Monday night and will reopen in July. Of the 150,000 daily
tickets available over the summer, 8,000 remained unsold.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Diana frenzy is over,'' columnist Tony Rennell conceded in
The Observer on Sunday. He said it was true that all the bright
predictions of a new, caring Britain had not been realized, but he
said the outcome left him uneasy for another reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``What troubles me is the attempt in some quarters to pretend it
never happened,'' he wrote. ``No one has the right to dismiss those
emotions as cheap or false or unworthy. Puzzle over what happened,
yes, but don't belittle it and don't deny it.''

   DILI, Indonesia _ Anti-independence thugs who have terrorized
East Timor for months reasserted themselves Tuesday, one day after
an extraordinarily peaceful referendum on the region's future in
which, officials said, 98.6 percent of eligible voters cast their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The thugs, who had been mobilized into irregular militias by the
Indonesian military, set up roadblocks in Dili, the tiny capital
city of this territory, and on a number of rural roads.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance they stalled a convoy of 17 vehicles carrying
150 foreign and local workers for the United Nations for several
hours. The convoy, which was traveling from the Ermera area to
Dili, later proceeded without incident, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A militia leader, Eurico Guterres, said his armed men would bar
what he called the East Timorese elite from leaving. He claimed to
have blocked some people from boarding a scheduled flight Tuesday,
but airport officials said all passengers who had tickets had
boarded.
</P>
<P>
   Some promoters of independence said they had received death
threats and were going into hiding. There were also reports that
the militias might harass foreign journalists. But despite the
threats and menacing behavior, there were no confirmed reports of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Fischer, the leader of the Australian observers here, said
he understood that three people had been killed on Monday in the
Ermera area, southwest of Dili. But a U.N. spokesman, David
Wimhurst, said he could not confirm this.
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst said the electoral process was proceeding as scheduled,
with all the blue plastic ballot boxes from around the country
securely gathered, ``all safe and sound'' in a counting center
here. The center is guarded by unarmed U.N. police advisers. The
main police station is next door, although the local force has been
mostly passive in the face of the violence here.
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst said reviewing and counting the ballots would begin on
Wednesday. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is to announce the
result within about a week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the referendum, voters chose whether to accept an offer of a
new, more nearly autonomous status within Indonesia, in which East
Timor would control its own affairs except for foreign relations,
the military and some judicial and financial administration. If the
offer is rejected, President B.J. Habibie has said, Indonesia will
grant full independence to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The choice, after 24 years of warfare that has deeply divided
the territory, brought a new crescendo to the long-running
violence, with the militias acting as surrogates for the Indonesian
military.
</P>
<P>
   The former Portuguese colony was invaded by Indonesia in 1975
and annexed the following year as the 27th province. But it has
never submitted to Indonesian rule, and an estimated 200,000 people
have died in the separatist war.
</P>
<P>
   The strong voter turnout suggested a victory for independence,
and opponents of independence began Tuesday to raise complaints
about the balloting and to balk at a role in a planned commission
of reconciliation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several key pro-autonomy leaders refused to attend an initial
meeting of the commission, which is to include 10 supporters and 10
opponents of independence and five U.N. representatives. They
distributed a letter addressed to the United Nations that claimed
the referendum was biased in favor of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst said, however, that he was not aware that any
complaints about electoral irregularities had been filed through
the official channels set up to review the conduct of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the anti-independence groups, Basilio Dias
Araujo, issued a statement Tuesday asserting that the United
Nations ``is really encouraging the people of East Timor to break
East Timor away from Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the interpretation of a fair and just ballot shall mean
that the pro-independence side should win, then the outcome will
really be just garbage,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst expressed concern that some of the 4,000 East Timorese
who helped the United Nations conduct the vote may be at risk of
reprisals. He called on the Indonesian police to assure their
safety.
</P>
<P>
   He said the successful and peaceful conduct of the referendum
had been a rebuke to the attempt to use violence to block it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could not work, it did not work and it will not work,'' he
said. ``It is imperative that everybody lays down their arms and
ceases all violent actions, as it is completely futile, but instead
focuses their energies on the long process of reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Carina Pirelli, who heads the office of electoral affairs at the
United Nations in New York, said the huge turnout ``shows that
neither fear nor violence nor intimidation can stop the people when
they want to have their voices heard.''
</P>
<P>
   She said most of the people who had been forced by militia
violence to flee their homes in recent weeks and months had emerged
on Monday to vote and then, in many cases, fled again into hiding.
A number who were unable to return to their home regions to vote
had since come to the U.N. office here, she added, telling
officials: ``I couldn't vote. Can I vote? I want to vote.'' But it
was too late.

 &HT;    Elway hopes for TD with MVP.com site
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Football legend John Elway is already one of the
game's most valuable players. Now he wants to repeat on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The former Denver Broncos quarterback, along with the
Atlanta-based J.W. Genesis Co., are 50-50 partners in a new online
venture called MVP.com set to launch on Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The site _ at www.mvp.com _ plans to focus on finances, sports,
fitness and lifestyles. It's a concept similar to the
woman-oriented site iVillage.com but aimed at men, something Elway
says hasn't been done before.
</P>
<P>
   MVP.com hopes to use Elway's connections and J.W. Genesis
financial know-how to build a high-end Web site featuring the
``most valuable'' goods and services for its users.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a niche that's in high demand and doesn't have much
competition,'' Elway said in an interview Tuesday. ``It's a chance
to do something different and separate ourselves in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   MVP.com's Chief Operating Officer Joel Marks says the idea for
the site evolved gradually with a little nudge from Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this year we were deciding whether or not to take the
plunge and go into online trading,'' Marks says. ``We've been one
of the real resisters because we couldn't see how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   J.W. Genesis handled Elway's investments from its Denver office,
and Marks briefly considered an online trading business with Elway
as a spokesman. However, once Elway was in the picture, the company
decided to rethink its online strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we did more and more homework, we realized that the
relationships John has established in business, charity
endorsements and personal contacts was opening doors for us,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seemed, wanted toto connect to John Elway's
Internet star.
</P>
<P>
   ``What started as an online brokerage became a lifestyle
company,'' Marks says.
</P>
<P>
   Elway admits he doesn't know much about Web development strategy
or business models. Still, he's savvy enough to see the potential
of the Web as a commercial enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at how far the Internet has come in the last few years
and where it is headed,'' Elway says. ``I want to be there on the
cutting edge. It's still early and there's still time and nobody
has figured out how to make money. We'd like to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone with Elway's celebrity stature could have joined forces
with nearly any Internet company he wanted. But he says he chose
J.W. Genesis because it offered him the chance to be involved from
the ground floor. ``I'm not just an endorser,'' Elway says. ``I'm
involved in the shape and the direction the company takes.''

GLASS SLIPPER IS HARD TO FILL AT CBS; `MILLIONAIRE' GAME SHOW IS A
BIG WINNER   AT ABC; PITCHING  ` HAMLET ' AT TNT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though CBS has mainly invoked Cinderella as its
preferred metaphor, the network has, in truth, turned the hunt for
a female co-anchor to pair with Bryant Gumbel on its revamped
morning show into a summerlong game of Clue.
</P>
<P>
   As in: ``Ms. Green (from inexperience) in the news reader nook
with a contingency clause!''
</P>
<P>
   That suspect translates to Jane Clayson, whom CBS apparently was
close to hiring as the news reader for the show, with the
possibility of her being moved up to the co-anchor slot after she
got into the CBS fold. Then ABC, her current employer, blocked that
move, using a clause in her contract that allows ABC to match any
offer for her.
</P>
<P>
   So far the envelope with the right combination of elements to
solve the mystery remains empty on the CBS game board.
</P>
<P>
   Having missed its first planned deadline by not hiring a
co-anchor by July, when CBS could have introduced her to about a
hundred reporters in the same room at a news conference in
Pasadena, Calif., CBS instead told that assemblage of reporters
that Labor Day was the target date for this long-awaited
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Labor Day weekend looming, CBS looks likely to miss
that date as well.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives said Tuesday that they were about 99 percent
certain that the selection would spill over at least into the
middle of next week, perhaps to the beginning of the following
week. That will leave CBS only seven weeks to work the chosen one
into its plans for the show, which is set to have its premiere the
morning of Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   More important, perhaps, it only gives CBS seven weeks to mount
a recognition campaign for the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The news of morning television is bound to get cluttered during
the next two weeks. NBC will start ``Later Today,'' its 9 a.m.
follow-up program to ``Today,'' the day after Labor Day, and the
following Monday ABC is to open up its news studio overlooking
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   CBS did announce one new addition to ``The Early Show'' on
Tuesday. Laurie Hibberd, a correspondent for ``Good Morning
America'' and a former co-anchor of a morning show on the cable
channel FX, will become a correspondent, doing twice-monthly
reports on popular culture.
</P>

<P>
   SUCCESSFUL `MILLIONAIRE'
</P>
<P>
   The success of ABC's summer game show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' has been so staggering _ it was the No. 1-rated show
again last week and led ABC to a resounding weekly ratings victory
_ and apparently so unexpected, that it left the air on Sunday
night after its two-week run without being able to tell viewers
when to tune in next.
</P>
<P>
   Regis Philbin, the host (and truly the show's biggest winner of
all), did tell viewers the show would return in November. But
exactly when and at what time is apparently still up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   So is the format for the new editions, though several ABC
executives said Tuesday that it was almost certain that the network
would present the show in a tournament style at least one more
time: a burst of editions on consecutive nights over two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If that works, ABC may face tougher choices about whether to
make the show a weekly series or perhaps turn it into a syndicated
show, which could be highly lucrative for the television production
company. ABC executives said Tuesday that though some calls were
being made to television stations this week about possible
syndication interest, these were not made by ABC, and ABC owns the
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives acknowledged that uncertainty remained about the
show's long-range potential. In Britain, for example, where it
originated and has become a phenomenon, it has only been on for a
year. So no one knows how long the public appetite for the show
will last.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the best American television tradition, every effort
is being made to ride this suddenly popular horse and, inevitably,
beat it to death. Other networks and producers are pitching game
show ideas all over Hollywood. CBS had hoped to broadcast a new
version of the ancient game format ``What's My Line'' this summer
but got started too late and put off the show until next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has other games in the works, including a comedy game
concept with Norm MacDonald called ``Have I Got News for You.''
</P>
<P>
   But having turned summer television upside down with
``Millionaire,'' ABC is looking at its options with a lot of
caution, said Edward L. Dandridge, the vice president for network
communications. ``I can tell you a concern about cannibalization
exists,'' Dandridge said.
</P>

   'TIS NOBLER TO SYNOPSIZE
</P>
<P>
   The TNT cable network has been building a reputation for
acquiring rights to first-run movies and giving them their
commercial television premieres. Normally they have been popular
movies like ``Space Jam'' or ``Ghosts of Mississippi,'' but this
Sunday night, TNT will present Kenneth Branagh's 1996 ``Hamlet'' in
its full four-hour production.
</P>
<P>
   The film will have just one corporate sponsor, Mercedes-Benz,
which will interrupt it only four times for brief commercial
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, even with Branagh starring and other celebrities in
minor roles (Robin Williams, Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal),
``Hamlet'' is unusual fare for TNT. So the network hired a
freelance writer to synopsize the text for television writers and
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Her one-page summary explains that ``Hamlet has been seeing
Ophelia, Polonius' daughter,'' and that, believing the young prince
is ``out of his mind,'' Polonius and Claudius ``decide the best
thing to do is to have his mother talk some sense into him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fortinbras storms the castle in the final scene to find
Hamlet, Gertrude, Claudius and Laertes all dead, the summary says,
``By process of elimination, he assumes the throne of Denmark.''
</P>
<P>
   The synopsis seems accurate. But what does it say about TNT's
view of the nation's television critics?

VENEZUELA'S PRESIDENT PUTS ALLY IN CHARGE OF OIL COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ President Hugo Chavez moved to solidify his
control over the powerful state-run oil monopoly Tuesday by naming
an ally as the company's new chief.
</P>
<P>
   The previous leader had resigned Monday, saying that an internal
dispute had made it impossible for him to stay at Petroleos de
Venezuela, which controls the largest reserves of oil outside the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez appointed Hector Ciavaldini to head the company, saying
the move would correct ``the erroneous policy of the previous
government.'' He said he would announce other ``small changes at
the board level'' soon.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate for president last year, Chavez, a former army
colonel who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt, criticized
PDVSA, as the company is known here, as an uncontrollable ``state
within the state.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to eliminate its extravagant ``gold-card culture,'' to
cut production to help drive prices up and to seek closer ties with
other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a process of integrating PDVSA within the economic and
political model of Venezuela,'' Chavez said Tuesday. ``We are going
to strengthen OPEC,'' he also promised, referring to a meeting here
last weekend in which the Venezuelan, Saudi and Mexican oil
ministers resolved to continue production cuts into next year.
Prices of Venezuelan oil have risen from $7 to more than $17 a
barrel since Chavez took office in February.
</P>
<P>
   Ciavaldini takes over from Roberto Mandini, an industry veteran
who led the company for less than seven months. Company officials
said his departure grew out of a dispute over management and
production policies. But it took place at a moment of political and
constitutional crisis that has raised questions about the future of
democracy in this nation of 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Since its election last month, a Constitutional Assembly
dominated by supporters of Chavez has taken over the court system
and stripped Congress of its power to pass laws. Leaders of the
panel said Tuesday that within days they would begin debate on a
related proposal to declare an emergency giving them authority to
dismiss the governors of Venezuela's 23 states and hundreds of
mayors.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped statement shown to employees on Monday and
broadcast on national television Tuesday, Mandini said that his
decision to step down had nothing to do with any discrepancy with
the government over strategy or objectives. Rather, he said, he and
other officials whom he did not identify could not agree ``how to
achieve them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have a commercial corporation divided into
factions, because that is something that inevitably leads to
failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent allusion to the populist economic policies
favored by some members of the Chavez administration, Mandini also
warned against regarding the oil company as ``the goose that lays
the golden eggs or a cash cow.''
</P>
<P>
   The company accounts for 80 percent of all the nation's exports
and one-third of government revenues. It is the largest exporter of
oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A group of employees recently issued a manifesto complaining
that ``people committed to revolutionary change have been
threatened with early retirement, dismissal or demotions'' under
Mandini's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these revolutionary times it is necessary to resolutely and
implacably demolish the control and power of the old PDVSA
establishment,'' their document concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Ciavaldini, in contrast, is said to be a close friend of Jorge
Giordani, Chavez's minister of planning, and has clashed with top
management at the company. In 1995, he was fired from his post as
an adviser to a company affiliate, but appealed the decision,
eventually won his job back after a long court case, and in
February was named the company's vice president for planning. He
was appointed, along with three military officers, to its
seven-member board.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the newspaper Economia Hoy published
Tuesday, Virgilio Avila, a former chairman of the Energy Committee
of the Venezuelan Senate who is now a member of the constitutional
assembly, urged the Chavez government to ``prevent the
politicization of PDVSA, as that would cause terrible harm.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez said such fears were misplaced. ``We will respect the
meritocracy'' that has governed promotions within the oil giant, he
promised.
</P>
<P>
   He added that what is taking place is ``the Venezuelanization''
of the company, to ``bring it in tune with new times.''

MONICA ASKS: WHO'S PROFITING FROM WHOM?
</HEADLINE>
  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a three-day stint at Marie-Claire magazine that  &UR; Monica &LR; 
 &UR; Lewinsky  &LR; describes in a forthcoming issue, the former White House
intern refers to columnist  &UR; Maureen Dowd  &LR; as Moremean Dowdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wrote that  &UR; Joyce Maynard &LR;  and I are `leech women,' ''
Lewinsky said in a statement quoted in the New York Post. ``This is
a woman who won a Pulitzer Prize by printing untrue things about
me, for seizing on my pain and my family's pain. Who's the leech?''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Lewinsky also told the magazine that she's planning to sell
her own line of handbags on the Internet. Prices will range from
$70 to $130; Lewinsky says she designed the purses when she took up
knitting during a period of enforced solitude in the middle of the
White House scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really excites me,'' she said about the purses, ``is that
this has nothing to do with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE KITCHEN OF THE FUTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A lot is cooking in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Kitchen of the Future lab, where, says the latest issue of
Smithsonian magazine, the following concepts are being explored:
</P>
<P>
   - An oven mitt that tells its user whether the food is hot and
ready to eat.
</P>
<P>
   - A pH meter, to be embedded in a spatula, that measures acidity
or alkalinity, thereby indicating that salad dressing, for example,
is ``mild,'' ``getting spicy'' or ``sour.''
</P>
<P>
   - A laser cutter that can slice a bagel and write or make
drawings on cut fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   - A kitchen drawer that serves as a washer and storage space for
dishes and tableware.
</P>
<P>
   - A spoon able to ``taste'' food by recognizing the ingredients
in it.
</P>
<P>
   - A countertop scale that counts calories when food such as ice
cream, for example, is spooned into a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   - A microwave oven that reads the bar code on a food package and
cooks it for the right amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   - A counter that becomes a cooking surface when you put a pot on
it.
</P>
<P>
   - Mr. Java, an espresso machine that fills orders transmitted by
a tag embedded in the bottom of the user's cup.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers told the magazine that the laboratory focuses on
kitchens because they are the site of the home's most complicated
tasks. ``Offices have a fairly modest set of interactions compared
to the kitchen, where you have recipe timing, guests arriving, food
temperatures, ingredients and a lot of other complexities most of
us take for granted,'' said researcher  &UR; Michael Hawley &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Denny Delk  &LR; asked a teacher to explain this week's report
that the skills of California high school students are lagging. Her
response: ``Well, like, DUH!''
</P>
<P>
   - In a story labeled gossip and told with no geographical
reference, Vogue reports that when a security guard wouldn't allow
a shopper entry to a recent invitation-only sale on Manolo Blahnik
shoes, the shopper bit him. Aside from the wound, it couldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   - The Smithsonian Institution bowed to pressure from  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Gielgud &LR; , PETA and others and canceled its foie gras event.
Officials quoted in the Wall Street Journal said they feared
``something untoward'' would occur.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CATCHING UP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a New Yorker Talk of the Town piece about the Illtop Journal,
Harvard's new black counterpart to the humor magazine the Lampoon,
its founder  &UR; Chris Rock &LR;  proclaims, ``Our comedy-writing skills are
far behind that of the white man.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not shy about admitting a link to prior generations of
humorists. ``When I got to `Saturday Night Live' '' said Rock, ``I
robbed  &UR; Mike Myers &LR;  of everything he did. He'd do `Wayne's World'?
All right, I'll do `I'm Chillin'.' Everything he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you do. White, black, whoever you are, I don't
care _ if you want to be good, you steal. ... They've done it to us
for centuries, well, we can do it to them!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys always say to me, `I just want a girl with a great sense
of humor,' forgetting, perhaps, that I make a career of being
funny. Then I see them a week later with a gorgeous girl who has
nothing to say, &LR;  but who laughs uproariously at their jokes. That's
when I lean into the guy and say, `You really scored with this one.
She's friggin' hilarious.' They never like that.''
</P>

MONICA ASKS: WHO'S PROFITING FROM WHOM?

<P>
   During a three-day stint at Marie-Claire magazine that  &UR; Monica &LR; 
 &UR; Lewinsky  &LR; describes in a forthcoming issue, the former White House
intern refers to columnist  &UR; Maureen Dowd  &LR; as Moremean Dowdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wrote that  &UR; Joyce Maynard &LR;  and I are `leech women,' ''
Lewinsky said in a statement quoted in the New York Post. ``This is
a woman who won a Pulitzer Prize by printing untrue things about
me, for seizing on my pain and my family's pain. Who's the leech?''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Lewinsky also told the magazine that she's planning to sell
her own line of handbags on the Internet. Prices will range from
$70 to $130; Lewinsky says she designed the purses when she took up
knitting during a period of enforced solitude in the middle of the
White House scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really excites me,'' she said about the purses, ``is that
this has nothing to do with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE KITCHEN OF THE FUTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A lot is cooking in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Kitchen of the Future lab, where, says the latest issue of
Smithsonian magazine, the following concepts are being explored:
</P>
<P>
   - An oven mitt that tells its user whether the food is hot and
ready to eat.
</P>
<P>
   - A pH meter, to be embedded in a spatula, that measures acidity
or alkalinity, thereby indicating that salad dressing, for example,
is ``mild,'' ``getting spicy'' or ``sour.''
</P>
<P>
   - A laser cutter that can slice a bagel and write or make
drawings on cut fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   - A kitchen drawer that serves as a washer and storage space for
dishes and tableware.
</P>
<P>
   - A spoon able to ``taste'' food by recognizing the ingredients
in it.
</P>
<P>
   - A countertop scale that counts calories when food such as ice
cream, for example, is spooned into a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   - A microwave oven that reads the bar code on a food package and
cooks it for the right amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   - A counter that becomes a cooking surface when you put a pot on
it.
</P>
<P>
   - Mr. Java, an espresso machine that fills orders transmitted by
a tag embedded in the bottom of the user's cup.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers told the magazine that the laboratory focuses on
kitchens because they are the site of the home's most complicated
tasks. ``Offices have a fairly modest set of interactions compared
to the kitchen, where you have recipe timing, guests arriving, food
temperatures, ingredients and a lot of other complexities most of
us take for granted,'' said researcher  &UR; Michael Hawley &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Denny Delk  &LR; asked a teacher to explain this week's report
that the skills of California high school students are lagging. Her
response: ``Well, like, DUH!''
</P>
<P>
   - In a story labeled gossip and told with no geographical
reference, Vogue reports that when a security guard wouldn't allow
a shopper entry to a recent invitation-only sale on Manolo Blahnik
shoes, the shopper bit him. Aside from the wound, it couldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   - The Smithsonian Institution bowed to pressure from  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Gielgud &LR; , PETA and others and canceled its foie gras event.
Officials quoted in the Wall Street Journal said they feared
``something untoward'' would occur.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CATCHING UP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a New Yorker Talk of the Town piece about the Illtop Journal,
Harvard's new black counterpart to the humor magazine the Lampoon,
its founder  &UR; Chris Rock &LR;  proclaims, ``Our comedy-writing skills are
far behind that of the white man.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not shy about admitting a link to prior generations of
humorists. ``When I got to `Saturday Night Live' '' said Rock, ``I
robbed  &UR; Mike Myers &LR;  of everything he did. He'd do `Wayne's World'?
All right, I'll do `I'm Chillin'.' Everything he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you do. White, black, whoever you are, I don't
care _ if you want to be good, you steal. ... They've done it to us
for centuries, well, we can do it to them!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys always say to me, `I just want a girl with a great sense
of humor,' forgetting, perhaps, that I make a career of being
funny. Then I see them a week later with a gorgeous girl who has
nothing to say, &LR;  but who laughs uproariously at their jokes. That's
when I lean into the guy and say, `You really scored with this one.
She's friggin' hilarious.' They never like that.''

The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Sept. 5.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-PBS-LOVESTORY (Undated) _ At first glance, to the camera's
casual eye, the most conspicuous aspect of the Wilson-Sims family
is that the mother looks like an interloper. Karen Wilson is a
slightly built white woman. Her children, Cicily Wilson and Chaney
Sims, resemble their father, and not only because their skin is
dark. With their strong jaw lines and tall builds, you would pick
them out of a roomful of other young black women as Bill Sims'
daughters. The physical differences are part of what makes the
family's obvious affection so touching.
</P>
<P>
   Caryn James reviews ``An American Love Story,'' the 10-hour
series that follows one biracial family through nearly two years of
everyday life and crises.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-MIRTH-WHARTON (Duns, Scotland) _ The British director
Terence Davies had never watched even a single episode of ``The
X-Files'' when he plucked Gillian Anderson's picture from a pile
last summer and decided that she would be perfect for his next
film, an adaption of Edith Wharton's ``House of Mirth.'' She had
the sort of fin de siecle face he had been searching for, a face
that might have been painted by the great society portraitist John
Singer Sargent. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-COMEDY-THEATER (London) _ The Right Size _ or, as this
two-man comedy team prefers it, the right size _ is into more than
typographical anarchy. With nine original shows to date, these
British performers have acquired a sizable following since meeting
at a clown school in Paris a little more than 10 years ago.
Absurdist drollery with a sprinkling of Sartre and a dash of
Beckett might describe their most popular show so far: about being
locked in a bathroom with a stranger for 25 years. On Sept. 8 that
show, ``Do You Come Here Often?,'' will mark the New York debut of
Sean Foley, 34, and Hamish McColl, 37. The work, which runs through
Oct. 10, won an Olivier Award this year in London for best
entertainment. By Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES/COLLECTIBLES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL-MEMORABILIA-ART (Undated) _ The nearly 80,000 items of
baseball memorabilia _ from the gorgeously historic to the madly
esoteric _ that filled the comfortable home of Barry Halper in
Livingston, N.J., have mostly been packed up and shipped out. About
20 percent of his collection was sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame,
where a wing named for this collector non pareil has been built.
Most of the rest of the collection will be sold at a weeklong
auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan, beginning on Sept. 23, which,
according to Sotheby's, has a chance to break the house record of
$34.4 million set by the sale of the Jackie Kennedy Onassis estate.
But in Halper's home, some things remain the same. By Ira Berkow.

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-WAGNER (Bayreuth, Germany) _ Does Bayreuth's cult of
Wagner still matter? Some mavens say no and stay away. In the first
decades after World War II, timeless, ascetic, psychologically
profound stagings by the composer's grandson Wieland Wagner
revitalized the tradition. After Wieland's death, in 1966, other
pioneering directors carried on. The last thunderclap from
Bayreuth's Green Hill sounded in 1976, with the unveiling of the
post-modern centennial ``Ring,'' directed by Patrice Chereau and
conducted by Pierre Boulez. Since then, wherever opera is
performed, the array of theatrical styles has exploded
exponentially. Iconoclasts from Arizona to Australia are forging
``Rings'' of their own, with or without regard to Bayreuth
precedent. If the festival no longer enjoys its old hegemony, that
is simply a measure of its success. These days, Wagner belongs to
the world. By Matthew Gurewitsch.

<P>
   &UR; ARCHITECTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-ARCHITECTURE-CHURCH (New York) _ The new New York
Presbyterian Church, which officially opens on Sept. 18, is as
striking a piece of architecture as those we once had to go to Los
Angeles to see. Situated in Queens, N.Y., the church can claim a
place on the small list of projects that are helping to lift New
York architecture out of its long creative slump. By Herbert
Muschamp.

 &HT;    Young men expanding HIV rates
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because as little as 10 percent of young Americans infected with
the AIDS virus are aware of their status, many continue high risk
behaviors, thus fueling the epidemic, new research shows.
</P>
<P>
   Young people, especially young gay and bisexual men, make up at
least half of all new cases of HIV infection. Yet perhaps only 10
percent of HIV-infected people in their teens or early 20s have
been tested for the virus that causes AIDS, researchers estimate.
And most young HIV-positive people aren't aware of their status,
according to research presented Tuesday at the National HIV
Prevention Conference in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that risky sexual behaviors were common among the
HIV-positive youth we studied,'' said Dr. Paul Denning of the HIV
surveillance branch of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, which co-sponsored the conference.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS trackers have known for some time that people under 25, as
well as minorities and women, are on the leading edge of the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, research from the CDC and several universities confirms
suspicions that a growing complacency regarding AIDS is
contributing to the high infection rates. Many people falsely
perceive AIDS as a manageable disease because of recent advances in
HIV drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers estimate that at least 100,000 and possibly as many
as 225,000 people 13 to 24 are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of
3,492 gay or bisexual men aged 15 to 22 years found that 41 percent
of them had engaged in unprotected anal sex within the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Of the young men in the survey who turned out to be
HIV-positive, only 18 percent already knew they were infected.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that research shows young people seem to
respond well to youth-savvy prevention programs. A condom marketing
program aimed at teens in Seattle and Portland, Ore., and San Jose,
Calif., resulted in fewer sexually active teens and higher rates of
condom use.

 &HT;    GOP weekend to include speech by Gingrich, award for Barr
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Annie Taylor went over Niagara Falls in an oaken
barrel and lived to tell about it.
</P>
<P>
   The next election will tell whether Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) can
survive the rough and tumble journey of leading the way on
President Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Barr and two colleagues who also served as House
managers in Clinton's trial in the Senate will receive the Annie
Taylor Award at the fourth annual Weekend in Colorado Springs,
Colo. The gathering is the conservative alternative to the
Renaissance Weekend that draws President Clinton to Hilton Head,
S.C., each New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a Michigan schoolteacher, braved the falls in 1901
hoping for fame and fortune. She died destitute.
</P>
<P>
   But David Horowitz, executive director of the Center for the
Study of Popular Culture in Los Angeles, the organizer of the
weekend, suggested that the award carry her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of represents bravery,'' said John Campbell, the
center's managing director, explaining Horowitz's reasoning. ``Or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's lineup features leading Republicans and
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich will give the keynote speech
at the conference's first breakfast Friday. It will be Gingrich's
first public appearance that is open to the media since he filed
for divorce from his wife, Marianne, in late July.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the program are seminars on the 2000 presidential
campaign and the Chinese espionage scandal. A forum entitled
``Caring About the Inner City'' will include Wayne LaPierre,
executive vice president of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   NRA spokesman Bill Powers said LaPierre will talk about the
group's support for Project Exile, a program that stresses strict
enforcement of federal gun laws.

 &HT;    End of busing in N.C. city will challenge schools' diversity
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any day now, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter is expected to
decide whether three decades of forced busing in North Carolina's
Charlotte-Mecklenburg's schools should end. It would close a
historic chapter in the nation's 23rd-largest school district, the
first in America to use busing to achieve racial integration. It
also would pose challenges, which Superintendent Eric Smith, 49,
discussed with staff writer Chris Burritt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Citing the uncertainty hanging over the judge's ruling, the
Mecklenburg County Commission recently refused the school board's
request for a $365 million bond referendum on November's ballot.
How do school officials reconcile that setback with the need for
new schools and renovations to bring greater equality to the
district's 138 schools?
</P>
<P>
   A: It certainly sent us back to the drawing board. We know that
without question we need additional student capacity in our
high-growth areas. We have a need to bring our older buildings up
to standard. Our long-range master plan calls for 11 new schools
over the next eight years, on top of the 10 that are currently
being built. We estimated needing $1.3 billion over a 10-year span.
We have yet to determine how we are going to bring this about,
possibly with bonds after the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last spring the school board devised a five-year plan that
would end forced busing by creating three to five geographic
clusters in the school district. Each cluster would be diverse by
race and socio-economic factors, allowing children in those
clusters to attend schools near their homes. How might the judge's
ruling affect that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The court might not allow that. We do not know what it is
going to say. It might say that any consideration of race is not
allowed. In that case, even the development of clusters that would
be racially consistent would not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would that wipe out this cluster idea?
</P>
<P>
   A: If we did not base it on race, we could probably base it on
other factors, such as population growth, economics. This would be
dramatically different from what we've done for the last 30 years
under the court's directive that we achieve a balance of 40 percent
black and 60 percent white in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   The real question now is how much time the judge will give us to
make these changes. If he says we have to do the conversion by next
fall, I cannot build new buildings by next fall. I may be
converting pupil assignments and using facilities that are known to
be inferior. The question becomes how quickly can we bring new
facilities on line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: County Commission Chairman Parks Helms said that an end to
forced busing might create schools which are all black or all
white. Explain that.
</P>
<P>
   A: When we are directed to stop using race as a factor in how we
draw boundaries, obviously we are going to stop looking at 40/60
(black-white ratio). Obviously those African-American students (in
the city) who were transported out for the purpose of racial
balance will more than likely be given an assignment close to home.
Those schools become primarily African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would that be widespread?
</P>
<P>
   A: We haven't put numbers to it, but it would be widespread. It
is a major problem from a facilities standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 30 years in Mecklenburg, we have built buildings
based on an integrated school system. If we no longer transport
students out of the city to suburban schools, they will be going to
school closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   We will have to build new buildings. Otherwise, African-American
children would continue to be bused to suburban areas, even after
we receive the court order, because there simply are no schools for
African-American students to go to.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Specifically, a return to neighborhood schools would create
demand for 7,000 additional seats in the inner city, reflecting the
African-American students who would no longer be bused. Explain
that.
</P>
<P>
   A: We currently transport about 7,000 African-American students
out to suburban schools for the purpose of racial balance. If you
are now going to say that students are to go to their closest
school, it works fairly well in the suburbs where we have built
schools for the last 30 years. It does not work well in the city
where we have not built schools for 30 years and where many of the
existing schools have been converted to magnet schools ... in part
as a way to encourage white students to come into the city schools.
With those seats being occupied by magnet-school students, we are
short 7,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you see these schools, which are becoming predominantly
one race, or all one race, over time becoming more diverse?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't necessarily see that happening on a natural basis.
Our experience here is when schools become significantly
identifiable by one race or another, they have a tendency to become
even more that way.

<P>
   Q: At what point does this pattern cause concern that
re-segregation of public schools is happening?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is a major concern today. I think it is going to be a
major concern across the country. The benefits that diversity
brings to individual students and their ability to compete
academically, to compete in the work place, the ability to work
together _ these are things we all need to be concerned about
losing.

CONGO'S REBELS SIGN PEACE ACCORD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia _ The divided rebels in Congo finally signed a
peace agreement Tuesday, a key step toward ending the fighting but
only the start toward reconstructing one of Africa's biggest,
richest and least stable nations.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for a cease-fire within 24 hours. The other
combatants in the war _ Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia
and Congo itself _ signed the far-ranging document last month, and
it now goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the rebel groups signed the accord in a hotel ballroom
here, they continued to squabble about how to carry out its first
main provisions. But Tuesday was significant nonetheless, because
the peace process could go no further until the document was
signed, whatever the coming hardships in putting the plan into
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just get those signatures,'' Patrick Mazimhaka, a top
Rwandan official, said impatiently as reporters asked him before
the signing how difficulties could be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Congo started a year ago, when a group of rebels
who had little in common united to oust President Laurent Kabila,
who had himself taken power in a similar rebellion only the year
before. With the backing of Rwanda and Uganda, the rebels, called
the Congolese Rally for Democracy, captured nearly half of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of tensions, both among the rebels and between
Rwanda and Uganda, the rebel group split in May. Then in July, the
rebels declined to sign the accord because one faction refused to
sign if the other did.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday that disagreement was resolved in a chaotic compromise,
which involved not only the faction leaders but all 50 people who
founded the Rally for Democracy in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As a choir of Congolese refugees sang, the rebels sat in
alphabetical order, in two long rows facing each other, and each
signed copies of the accord. Thus the group's first leader, Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba, was nearly last to sign, while his replacement,
Dr. Emile Ilunga, was among the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a ridiculous way of doing things,'' said Amama Mbabazi,
the top Ugandan official at the ceremony. ``But it's their
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the reasons why Ilunga's faction agreed to the
compromise became clear Tuesday: Of the 50 original founders, 41
follow Ilunga in a faction based in Goma, a city in eastern Congo
that includes most of the rebellion's military might. Only nine
have remained loyal to Wamba dia Wamba, who is based in Kisangani,
in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, members of the Goma faction said, they are entitled to
chose both representatives to a powerful military council being
formed that will administer and monitor the peace. Tuesday night
they named their two choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are just following the simple rules of democracy,'' said
Moise Nyuragabu, vice president of the Goma group. ``We can vote,
do an election.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wamba dia Wamba said he expected to name one person to the
council based on informal agreements among the parties before the
signing. ``There is no way we can't get a seat unless you have
amended the agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The poisonous atmosphere that has preceded the signing seems to
jeopardize long-term prospects for peace. ``I'm not too
optimistic,'' said one European diplomat. ``Knowing the guys we are
dealing with, you can't expect everything to be solved. It's just
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level the disagreement appears to be a continuation of
the two groups' vengeful squabbling. Little held the rebels
together from the start, and only two weeks ago they were engaged
in battles in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   But if the accord holds, Tuesday marks the end of the armed
struggle and the beginning of the political one _ and so the
disagreements among the rebels are partly an early struggle to lead
an opposition to try to topple Kabila in elections.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important deadlines in the agreement is one in 45
days, when the rebels, Kabila and other civic and opposition groups
are to engage in a ``national dialogue,'' as yet ill defined, that
will determine how a new Congo will be structured.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement's other main parts include the establishment of
the military council within seven days; the withdrawal of foreign
troops within 180 days; and deployment of U.N. peacekeepers within
120 days.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Zambia, Frederick Chiluba, who has been the
main force behind the peace talks, said over and again at the
signing that Tuesday was only the beginning, and perhaps the
easiest part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big responsibility that does not end with the
signing,'' Chiluba said. ``It begins with the signing.''

$18 MILLION TRADING LOSS REPORTED AT KAUFMAN &AMP; BROAD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kaufman &AMP; Broad Home Corp., one of the
nation's largest home builders, said Tuesday that it had lost $18.1
million from unauthorized trading of mortgages by an employee.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company said, it will take an after-tax charge
against earnings of 24 cents a share in its third fiscal quarter,
which ended Tuesday. The charge will reduce the quarter's earnings
by about 25 percent. Analysts had forecast that Kaufman &AMP; Broad
would earn 93 cents a share. The company said that even with the
charge, it expected record earnings for the quarter, exceeding the
68 cents reported in the comparable period last year. It added that
the full extent of the loss had been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman &AMP; Broad, which is based here, said the unauthorized
trading had mainly been conducted in the last 30 to 60 days by a
single person, whom it declined to identify. The employee, who the
company said tried to conceal the trading by falsifying records,
has been dismissed, and it is now considering what, if any, legal
action to take.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to take the news in stride, with the stock
dropping 37.5 cents to $20.4375.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the ultimate scheme of things, it was a relatively modest
one-time event,'' said John Stanley, an analyst at Warburg Dillon
Read, who has been recommending the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The employee who engaged in the unauthorized trading was Kaufman
&AMP; Broad's only mortgage trader. He had worked at the company for
two years and there were no other known problems with him, said
Mary M. McAboy, vice president for investor and public relations.
She declined to discuss his possible motive but said there was no
evidence that the employee had profited personally from the
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The problem occurred at a San Fernando Valley subsidiary that
provides mortgages for about 80 percent of the parent company's
home buyers, the Kaufman &AMP; Broad Mortgage Co. of Woodland Hills,
Calif. It then resells the mortgages in the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
   Because it takes 30 to 60 days from the time a loan to a home
buyer originates until it can be resold, the company makes a
contract to sell the loan at a future date at a specified price.
This locks in the interest rate, insulating the company from any
gains or losses caused by interest-rate fluctuations that might
occur until the mortgage is sold.
</P>
<P>
   The company's policy is to make such forward contracts only for
loans it originates, Ms. McAboy said. But the employee engaged in
speculative trading not connected with such loan origination. While
she was not specific, he might have agreed to sell loans that the
company had not yet originated, hoping that interest rates would
decline before he had to deliver, allowing him to obtain a loan and
resell it at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the employee was the only mortgage trader could
have given him latitude to hide his dealings. Ms. McAboy said the
trading was caught by the company's internal security and audit
procedures, which have since been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman &AMP; Broad said it expected to be the nation's largest home
builder this year in terms of the number of homes delivered. It has
grown by acquisitions and has benefited from a strong economy in
its territory, primarily California and other Western states.
Orders for the third quarter are up about 35 percent over last
year's period, in part because of an acquisition late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's stock, like that of many other home
builders, has not performed well; investors fear that rising
interest rates or the eventual end of the economic boom will
depress the housing market, Stanley of Warburg Dillon Read said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., one of Congress' most
ardent opponents of a bill that would overhaul the campaign finance
system, has aggressively urged 10 business executives to resign
from an organization that has endorsed a ban on unlimited
contributions to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of letters sent late last month to executives who
are members of the Committee for Economic Development, McConnell
accused the group of trying to ``eviscerate private sector
participation in politics'' by imposing ``anti-business speech
controls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you will resign from CED,'' McConnell, the chairman of
the National Republican Senatorial Committee, scribbled near the
bottom of one letter sent to an unidentified senior executive of a
telecommunications corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Committee for Economic Development, which
includes executives of General Motors, Xerox, Merck and Sara Lee
Corp., refused to identify the executive or the corporation in the
letter. But they did say that McConnell wrote letters to executives
who work for companies that have significant issues pending before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell also wrote that he was ``astonished'' that the
corporation had ``lent its name, prestige and presumably financial
backing'' to the Committee for Economic Development, which he said
was lobbying on behalf of a ``radical campaign finance agenda.''
McConnell argued that the executive's alliance with such a group
had consequently damaged the reputation of the executive's
employer.
</P>
<P>
   In his public statements, McConnell argues that current
campaign-finance legislation would infringe on free speech
protections of the First Amendment. Critics of the Republican
Party's position on the issue, however, say that Republicans are
motivated by the knowledge that they hold a commanding advantage in
raising campaign money from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kangas, a co-chairman of the Committee for Economic
Development's panel that studied the campaign finance system, said
Tuesday that McConnell's letter confirmed for him that the
organization, which has enlisted more than 100 current and retired
executives to endorse new campaign finance rules, was beginning to
shape the contentious debate on the subject on Capitol Hill. The
letter was first reported on Sunday on the editorial page of The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've been doing as a group of business leaders is
obviously beginning to have an impact,'' said Kangas, the chairman
and chief executive of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the accounting and
consulting firm. ``If we weren't having an impact, he would not be
communicating with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kangas said that none of the executives who had received the
letter had resigned and that he did not expect that any would leave
the committee. Indeed, Kangas, and other committee leaders, said
they had already recruited more executives in the past several
days. They said their goal was to have 300 executives endorse their
campaign finance proposals by late autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the people at CED have figured how just how
corrupt the campaign finance system is, and this letter is just an
example of what they already knew,'' Kangas said. ``Actually, we
are broadening the constituency of business leaders who recognize
that the campaign finance system is a real problem. Sen.'s
McConnell's letter has not had much impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was seen by some as an attempt to intimidate the
members with the implied message: Resign and keep quiet or don't
count on doing business with Congress. ``The reaction was
interesting,'' Kangas said. ``These guys are running big
enterprises of their own. They are not easily intimidated. They
looked at the letter and most of them just chuckled and filed it
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is a 60-year-old business-led public policy and
research association based in Manhattan. Its leaders pride
themselves that it is fiercely nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kolb, the committee's president, said there was a
growing consensus in the business community that the campaign
finance system is ``out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives on the committee are urging Congress to prohibit
soft money, the unlimited donations that corporations give to
political parties. The committee also advocates increasing the
limit on individual contributions to $3,000 from the current limit
of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community, by and large, has been the provider of
soft money,'' said Kolb. ``These people are saying: We're tired of
being hit up and shaken down. Politics ought to be about something
besides hitting up companies for more and more money.''
</P>
<P>
   For two years, the committee's members studied the campaign
finance system, and said they were horrified at the public
perception that big donors received special favors in Washington.
In a report released in March, the committee wrote, ``The suspicion
of corruption deepens public cynicism and diminishes public
confidence in government. More important, these activities raise
the likelihood of actual corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   In a response to McConell sent last week, leaders of the
committee wrote, ``We know that a majority of the House and the
Senate supports campaign finance reform. That sentiment is also
shared by a growing number of business community leaders. We hope
that you will reconsider your opposition and enable the issue to be
discussed and voted on this fall in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Warren Buffett, the acclaimed value investor and chief
executive of Berkshire Hathaway, and Jerome Kohlberg, a founder of
the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., have tried
on their own to persuade chief executives of businesses to embrace
campaign finance reform measures. But many, though sympathetic,
refused to speak out because they did not want to rankle the
legislators on whom they depend.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the executives on the committee are speaking for
themselves, and not necessarily on behalf of their companies. But
most of their corporations still continue to give large sums to
political parties and candidates. The American subsidiary of
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Kangas' corporation, gave $185,300 to the
Republican Party and $41,725 to the Democratic Party in 1998,
according to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   Kangas said he disagreed with McConnell's position that campaign
contributions were protected by the First Amendment. ``I was a
little disappointed that he would suggest that freedom of speech
does not apply to us, but it applies to the people who agree with
him,'' Kangas said.

 &HT;    Cause of fatal truck crash may never surface, police say
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two Alabama truckers hauling a load from Birmingham,
Ala., to Charlotte, N.C., died before dawn Tuesday, consumed in an
explosion that engulfed their eighteen-wheeler on eastbound
Interstate 285.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, at what DeKalb County police say is one of the
busiest intersections in the Southeast, closed down I-285 in both
directions. And for five hours spanning the morning rush,
interstate commuters in both directions were forced to merge into
one or two lanes of traffic as they made their way around the
burned-out wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, road crews with the state Department of
Transportation will spend the next three days repairing damage to
the underside of the Ashford-Dunwoody Road bridge, police said.
Crews will repair the bridge one lane at a time in an effort to
ease congestion on the already crowded highway.
</P>
<P>
   James Neal Tinker, 39, of Ashville, Ala., and George Kenneth
Thomason of Lincoln, Ga., died in what one witness described as a
terrible fireball that erupted after their semi-tractor trailer hit
the interstate's median wall, careened across the highway, crashed
into a bridge abutment and leaped a second wall into oncoming lanes
of traffic, DeKalb police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that the truck's diesel fuel tank ruptured,
spilling fuel across the highway and precipitating the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb police found the body of one man in the driver's seat.
The second man was in the truck's sleeping compartment. Tuesday
afternoon, the county's medical examiners were waiting for dental
records that would confirm who of the two was driving the truck
when it crashed about 3:20 a.m., said DeKalb Sgt. Andy Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that police may never know for certain what first
caused the truck to swerve into the right-hand emergency lane and
hit the median wall.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``It's typical of an accident where someone falls
asleep, drifts to the side, hits the wall, wakes up, and
overreacts.''
</P>
<P>
   After striking the right-hand wall, the truck veered across the
interstate into the far left lane and struck an abutment shoring up
the Ashford-Dunwoody Road bridge, Anderson said. Leaking diesel
fuel, the rig's cab leaped the median wall separating the eastbound
from the westbound lanes and burst into flames. ``The trailer was
still driving it,'' Anderson said. ``It probably drove it (the cab)
up and over the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Because both of the truck's occupants are dead, ``We'll never
know what really happened,'' the traffic investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the truckers were team drivers. The practice _
during which one trucker sleeps while the other drives _ allows
truckers to keep their rigs on the road longer because they can
meet federal requirements that limit a trucker's driving hours
without rest.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were hauling a mixed load of seating, metal
fittings, and nuts and bolts, Anderson said. There were no
hazardous materials found in the truck that might have contributed
to the fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing the wreckage from the highway and removing the bodies
was delayed by interstate commuters who jammed into the highway's
single emergency lane in a futile effort to circumvent the
accident, Anderson said. Consequently, state DOT HERO trucks, which
carry traffic cones and other equipment to quickly clear a highway
and re-route traffic around an accident, were themselves caught in
the jam. So was the hearse that transported the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a broom in my hand, sweeping stuff out of the road
because the HERO units couldn't get up there,'' Anderson said.

 By SHERYL WuDUNN and NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ One of the striking paradoxes of Japan is that this is a
country with the greatest savers in the industrialized world, and
yet everywhere one looks there is debt.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese savers are famous for their ability to salt away money
for the future, but as a nation, this country has some of the worst
accounts in the industrialized world, and its debt trajectory
increasingly looks like that of a third world country like
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the public debt, which totals about $5.4 trillion, was
taken on at the urging of the United States to stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan's debt situation is now so precarious that there are
growing doubts about how long Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi can
continue to spend furiously in hopes of reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to adjust the fire carefully so that you
don't ruin the fish,'' said Sadakazu Tanigaki, a vice minister of
finance. ``The weight of the debt is extremely large. It is obvious
that we can't leave the current situation as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The dangers are difficult to gauge, and if Japan's incipient
recovery gains momentum, profits may flow in around the country and
the nation's debt problems could diminish. Indeed, despite
gloom-and-doom talk from some economists in the 1980s, the United
States has transformed a budget deficit in those days into a
surplus today, while enjoying spectacular economic growth now.
</P>
<P>
   So the Clinton administration, while concerned about Tokyo's
debt, has urged Japan to keep spending on the bet that doing so may
revive the economy and generate the cash to pay back later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Japan's debt is not only tarnishing the government's
reputation as prudent proprietor of the world's second-largest
economy. It is also raising troubling questions that extend far
beyond Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no end in sight to the buildup of debt,'' said
Vincent J. Truglia, managing director at Moody's Investors Service,
which has downgraded Japan's formerly pristine credit rating, an
important sign of diminished foreign confidence in its financial
stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just concerned that Japan has already entered the
highest levels of debt of an industrialized country,'' Truglia
said, ``and soon will be entering unprecedented levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, rising debt levels will tend to lead to
higher long-term interest rates in Japan. The effects of those
higher rates may nudge up lending rates around the world, possibly
threatening the economies of Asia that are trying to climb out of a
financial crisis that is now two years old.
</P>
<P>
   Higher lending rates could also ripple across the Pacific to
raise business costs in California and mortgage rates in Florida,
undermining the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Japan goes through a period of fiscal paralysis or outright
crisis, then it's going to have a very negative impact on global
financial stability,'' said David L. Asher, a specialist on Japan
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``They've already
broken a lot of world records for debt management in postwar
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk of a default by the Japanese government is remote, but
there are anxieties here that rising debt levels could lead to a
confidence crisis, provoking a flight of capital and currency
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japan's troubles have not hurt America so far, a sudden
shift to safe assets in the United States could send the dollar
soaring in value against the yen and hurt American exports by
making them more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The debt is an astonishing contrast to Japan's reputation for
thriftiness. Japanese citizens have amassed a pool of $6.4 trillion
in household savings, which appears at least on the surface to be
more than enough to pay off the debt.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem is that the domestic savings and foreign
assets held by private citizens are exactly that: private. The
debt, by contrast, is held mostly by the government, and the
government can hardly seize the savings of private citizens to pay
it off.
</P>
<P>
   The deterioration in Japan's finances has been amazingly rapid,
a result of tax cuts and spending increases that have resulted in
annual budget deficits that now amount to 10 percent of its economy
_ or 13 percent, if nationalized railroad debts are included. Even
the lower figure is the highest among the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1992 the Japanese government's gross debt
amounted to just 70 percent of its gross domestic product, a ratio
only a bit higher than that of the United States. This year,
Finance Ministry figures show, the debt will reach 120 percent,
exceeding that of Italy, which for many years has been by far the
worst among the Group of Seven industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund estimates that in 2003 the
Japanese ratio will rise to 138 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Moody's estimates that the government may also have to
absorb additional debts equivalent to between 30 percent and 40
percent of gross domestic product from the banking system, postal
system loans and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   That would take Japan's debt to around 170 percent or 180
percent of GDP, a figure about three times the level of U.S. debt
in the 1980s, when American budget deficits and mounting public
debt were the talk of the world.
</P>
<P>
   These days in Japan, the central government's tax money cannot
even cover the bills for debt service and entitlements like
pensions, let alone payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Its debt-to-revenue ratio, which measures potential fiscal
problems by comparing a nation's debt burden to its annual cash
intake, is quickly approaching 1,400 percent, far worse than that
of other industrial powers. That means that Japan must repay 14 yen
for every yen it takes in from taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   All this puts Obuchi in a bind. He has managed to restore growth
to the Japanese economy this year, but only by huge stimulus
measures that add to the debt. And there is widespread apprehension
that the economy will run out of momentum when the extra government
spending fades this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Already, after raising about $1.4 trillion since 1992 to boost
the economy, the scorecard shows a massive pile of debt on one side
and on the other seven years of minuscule annual growth that may
not be self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, officials worry, the debt will get so high that
the benefit of any further stimulus will be outweighed by rising
long-term interest rates. Already, long-term rates are nearly 60
times the level of short-term rates.
</P>
<P>
   Ichizo Ohara, an influential member of parliament, said he had
warned the prime minister against bowing to pressure from President
Clinton for a new supplementary budget to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would raise interest rates and knock stock prices down,''
Ohara said.
</P>
<P>
   But Obuchi is moving to introduce, probably by autumn, yet
another giant supplementary stimulus package that could reach $45
billion or more, adding to the mountain of debt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Japan's central government that is vastly
overextended. Debts are emerging everywhere else as well.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The local governments of Japan's top four most populous regions,
including Tokyo, have declared a fiscal emergency, and to stabilize
themselves they must lay off large numbers of workers or get a
central government bailout. Already, local governments around Japan
have amassed $1.6 trillion in debt, a staggering sum that is
greater than the assets of any bank in the world.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the corporate sector, the bad debt problems of the banks are
well publicized and by some estimates may still amount to hundreds
of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan's insurance companies invested in many of the same
foolish property ventures as the banks, yet the insurance companies
so far have barely faced up to their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Countless other companies, engaging in construction, real estate
and even in autos and technology, also are mired in bad debts
because Japanese companies historically have financed themselves
through bank loans. Many of the companies have used permissive
accounting rules to hide the obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Mikuni &AMP; Co., Japan's only independent credit rating agency,
assesses the risks of Japan's top 1,000 bond issuers _ the
country's corporate equivalent of prime real estate. Even looking
at just those elite companies, Mikuni rates about two-thirds of
them BB _ junk status _ or below.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is very scary,'' said Akio Mikuni, who runs
the rating agency and expects many corporate defaults to come. ``So
far in Japan, the government has avoided bankruptcies. But this
system cannot be continued. It is impossible. So the probability of
bankruptcies is quite significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Mikuni expects those bankruptcies to help strengthen
Japan's economic efficiency by clearing away weak, money-losing
businesses. But the more immediate result may be that defaults will
ripple through the economic system, adding to unemployment and
exacerbating the sense of economic despair.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese officials deny that the problem is so serious.
They note that Japan's ``net debt'' figures, which take into
account the country's social security assets, look much better than
the gross figures usually cited.
</P>
<P>
   But economists are nearly united in agreeing that the net
figures are misleading, because social security accounts are
themselves in disastrous shape. While there is a surplus today, the
social security system is projected to run out of money by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Economists estimate that the public pension system may be
severely underfunded. Corporations are in the same position, and
Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd. has estimated that pension plans at
major corporations are underfunded by about $727 billion _ making
the corporate problem one of roughly the same scale as the banking
system debts that have hobbled the Japanese economy in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of what has been done with the funds
that come from deposits at the government-run postal savings
system. Japanese post offices accept cash deposits in a system that
if it were counted as a bank would be the biggest one in the world
_ and perhaps one of the worst-run.
</P>
<P>
   The government has used those funds, a total of about $3.8
trillion, for pumping up the economy by lending to small businesses
or for building bridges and tunnels around Japan. The government
has also used public pension contributions and postal life
insurance premiums on similar projects.
</P>
<P>
   Many people worry that much of the money has been squandered,
though the government denies it. The upshot is that when losses in
these areas are finally acknowledged, the government will have to
absorb them and its debt levels will rocket even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many politicians and officials acknowledge that
Japan's finances are spinning out of control, they say it will be
difficult for the political process to correct the problem any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gap essentially must be bridged with taxes,'' Kaoru
Yosano, the minister of International Trade and Industry and a
senior member of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, said in a
somber interview in his spacious office. ``But the Liberal
Democratic Party and all other political parties are enormously
wary, even frightened, of raising taxes. Accordingly, politically
speaking, it has become a taboo.''
</P>
<P>
   Yosano paused and added, ``I think that this can be
characterized as a lack of courage among the political parties.''

after he led the ransacking of a McDonald's restaurant in the town
of Millau. His group as well as farmers elsewhere in the country
have picked various hamburger outlets as targets in a low-level

Gen. Momir Talic, the highest-ranking Bosnian Serb official

   Police are investigating whether the murders of a young Orthodox

were politically motivated. Newspapers reported that the woman had
been raped, which is atypical of an organized terrorist act by
Islamic fundamentalists. But the police, who are releasing no
details and have banned the publication of information about the
case, apparently believe that the murders were committed by an
Arab. It is not known whether that is the only factor that has led
them to investigate the deaths as political.

failed to agree on how to select a joint presidential candidate.
The opposition leaders declined to immediately identify the
committee members.

   COLOMBIA: STRIKE CALLED
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of labor unions and social movements began what they
called an indefinite nationwide strike to protest President Andres
Pastrana's economic austerity program. The action is supported by
left-wing guerrilla groups, one of which said it had seized an
electrical power plant as a gesture of solidarity. In a speech,
Pastrana called for patience, and announced measures to assure that
public transportation and other services would continue to
function, but many schools and some businesses around the country
closed anyway.

<P>
   Refugees fleeing fighting between the ruling Taliban and the
remnants of the government they ousted three years ago have been
arriving daily in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, where at least
8,000 are crowded into the former Soviet Embassy grounds. Taliban
officials, facing more than 40,000 displaced people on their
territory, say they cannot provide for the basic needs of the
refugees.

</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called on the United Nations to hold
a referendum in Kashmir similar to the one just completed in East
Timor to allow Kashmiris living on territory in dispute between
India and Pakistan to decide their future. India, which regards the
Kashmir Valley as its territory, has not allowed United Nations
resolutions from the late 1940s demanding a plebiscite to be
carried out.

 &HT;    Holyfield-Lewis II a done deal
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evander Holyfield has been training since early July
hoping to hear he would get a chance to redeem himself _ and unify
the heavyweight championship _ against Lennox Lewis this fall.
</P>
<P>
   That word came Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield and Lewis teamed with promoter Don King to announce
that nagging details had been resolved and the Nov. 13 bout at the
Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas is on.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy surrounding their draw last March finally can be
resolved in the TVKO pay-per-view bout _ maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the fight was made again,'' Lewis said. ``It came
down to the last minute. Many people stopped me on the street and
said I won the (first) fight. And I'm sure many people stopped
Evander and told him he lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield never conceded as much. He did, however, admit Tuesday
to ``mistakes,'' which included execution of his fight plan and the
uncharacteristic prediction of a third-round knockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from the first fight; now I have to apply it,''
Holyfield said. ``All you can do is your best. My best wasn't good
enough the last time. But I've watched the tape, and I know what to
do.... No, no predictions this time. I just know I'm going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Each fighter will earn $15 million for the rematch, which is $5
million less than before for Holyfield. That pay cut, Holyfield
says, signifies his desire to prove himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only one to take a pay cut,'' he said. ``I wanted
the fight. I'm the type of person who always overcomes his
mistakes. I made some mistakes, and I paid that price. One who can
admit his mistakes can overcome them.''
</P>
<P>
   The March 13 draw triggered inquiries and allegations by boxing
officials and government regulators. Most observers had Lewis
(34-1-1) the winner.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to fulfill his third-round KO prediction,
Holyfield (36-3-1) was inactive and took a pummeling from Lewis.
However, Lewis failed to take out the seemingly vulnerable
champion, and that failure drew criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have better skills to show,'' Lewis said. ``Now that I've
been in there with him, I know what to expect. Things will get
under way quicker. You'll see me a lot more aggressive. I don't
think he'll have the answer for Lenox Lewis again.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My house has old fashioned double-hung windows with wood
sash. These windows have been painted many times over the years and
two or three of them are now very hard to open, especially the
lower sash. I scraped off some layers of old paint and used a putty
knife to cut through the caked paint around the edges of the sash,
but this only helped a little. The lower sash in each window is
still very hard to move. What else can I do to free up stubborn
sash?
</P>
<P>
   A: Raise the sash all the way up and use a scraper or piece of
sandpaper to clean off caked-on paint from the edge of the stop
molding where it presses against the inside of the sash. Then use a
hammer and block of wood, as shown in the drawing, to slam the
block against the edge of the stop molding. This should move it
just slightly away fromthe sash to provide additional clearance
for the sash inside the window channel. If this helps, but you
still need more clearance, repeat the process. Then do the same on
the other side of the window frame.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many years ago we put up wood panels over the plaster walls
of our family room. Now we would like to remove the wood panels and
go back to painted walls. Should we put up drywall on top of the
wood paneling, or is it advisable to remove the wood panels first?
</P>
<P>
   A: My suggestion would be to remove the wood panels and then
check the condition of the plaster walls underneath. If the plaster
is in reasonably good condition you may be able to simply patch the
plaster and paint directly over it. However, if (as seems likely)
the old plaster is badly cracked and so full of holes that patching
and smoothing is almost impossible, then you would probably be
better off installing the drywall directly over the old plaster.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My house has no basement and is built on a concrete slab. The
floors get very cold in the winter so I'm thinking about some type
of insulation. Is there any way to insulate such a concrete slab?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the heat lost through a concrete slab floor occurs
through its edges, so the most effective way to insulate an
existing slab is to insulate those edges. This is usually done by
installing a type of rigid insulation that is sold in home centers
and building materials dealers. It can be either a thick
asphalt-like material, or a type of rigid foam insulation board and
is installed by digging a narrow trench around the perimeter of the
slab. Then place the insulating boards in the ground and press them
against the edge of the concrete before replacing the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We unwisely used ice melting chemicals for several years on
our newly installed concrete driveway. The concrete now has a
number of small holes in the surface. How can we repair them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your best bet would be to use one of the vinyl or acrylic
patching cements that are sold in hardware stores and home centers.
Unfortunately, however, chances are that each patch will be visible
when it dries because it will probably cure to a slightly different
color than the old concrete.

DAFOE, SINDEN TALK ABOUT CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Byron Dafoe, the Bruins' free agent goalie, has
maintained that if he doesn't have a contract by the end of the
week, he will board a plane for his offseason residence in Southern
California and train there until he receives a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   Well, put those airline reservations on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe Tuesday sat down with Bruins president/general manager
Harry Sinden for about 30 minutes in an effort to break the
stalemate, and if progress is made in the next 24 hours, it's
possible the entire situation could change.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said the meeting was initiated by coach Pat Burns, who
also got involved last year when negotiations broke down with
center Jason Allison. Dafoe said Burns wasn't in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully something will come in the next couple of days,''
said Dafoe. ``There's a little bit of communication going on, so
that's a good sign. It was just a quick meeting to kind of hear
each other out. We explained both sides. Obviously we didn't talk
numbers because I don't want to do that without (agent Ron Salcer)
but Harry explained why they are there and I explained why I am
here. We both didn't see why the other was there but I wasn't going
to get into statistics. I was going to let Ronnie do that. That's
kind of where we left it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, with star players such as Cam Neely, a meeting with
Sinden often has led to a resolution. It hasn't always been
immediate but it usually has started the ball rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for us to see where we're both coming
from,'' Dafoe said. ``It's getting to crunch time now in terms of
do I stay or do I go. Who knows? Maybe something will come of all
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden was hoping for the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to do that because if you don't do it, we go further
and further with our comments and all of sudden, we actually piss
each other off,'' said Sinden. ``What happens is one side or the
other, or sometimes both, dig a hole that they want out of but
can't find a way out. At least, we can talk now. If we can't
resolve it, we can't resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden believes there is sincerity on both sides, and they are
bargaining in good faith. The next step is Salcer sending Sinden
some specifics to back up their contract demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait to see what they are,'' Sinden said. ``We
probably think we can tear holes in everything he says. We didn't
want to be in a position with this player where we didn't put our
best foot forward. There's no question, if someone like his agent
or Byron can show us we haven't, we're going to make sure we
correct it. If they can't, we're not going to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said part of the problem in an extended stalemate is that
the communication breaks down and the media get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the sides are not talking, then all they're doing is
reading press clippings,'' Dafoe said. ``That can always get thrown
out of whack or misconstrued. At least when you're face to face,
you're hearing it right from his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The news isn't so encouraging on Hal Gill, who is also a
restricted free agent. Sinden spoke with Gill's attorney, Mark
Witkin, Tuesday morning, but it's unlikely that Gill will be signed
before this weekend's start of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's status quo,'' said Witkin. ``I talked with Harry for a
short time and with Mike (O'Connell) last week. There were no real
offers or anything. A nice, neutral description would be that Harry
told me what was on his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the stumbling block is that Gill wants a big bump-up
this year even though he didn't have arbitration rights. In order
to use the collective bargaining agreement effectively, Sinden said
it makes more sense for Gill to get a small raise in a one-year
deal and next summer he can take the club to arbitration, where
he's almost sure to get a big raise. Sinden said Gill would be
taken care of if he signs a two-year contract, which would
eliminate the need for arbitration altogether next year.
</P>
<P>
   Witkin said the Bruins have put forth offers of one, two, and
three years. So far, they don't approach what he's looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've respectfully declined,'' said Witkin. ``I haven't really
heard from them with offers and I would think they're going to wait
a while and hopefully the situation will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he signed his first contract, he said you prove you can
play in the league. They cited where he was drafted and his career
in college was good but not spectacular to their way of thinking
and there were players with much greater profile. They said, `Look,
you show you can play in the league, you have to sign a two-year
deal, and you will be treated appropriately,' and he fulfilled his
part of the bargain. You can argue the CBA different ways but they
promised to treat him fairly and I think they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said Witkin told him Gill was going to go live with the
bears in Maine and Sinden resented that because there are only
black bears in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said dealing with the black bears was not as bad as dealing
with me,'' he said. ``I resented that because had there been
grizzly bears in Maine, I would've accepted that. But little black
bears, I've got to be a lot tougher than them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the club spoke to Neil Abbott, attorney for free
agent left wing P.J. Axelsson, but rejected Abbott's latest
proposal. He said the sides are far apart.

A QUEENS FACTORY IS BORN AGAIN, AS A CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 5) 
(jt) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The new New York Presbyterian Church, which
officially opens on Sept. 18, is as striking a piece of
architecture as those we once had to go to Los Angeles to see.
Situated in Queens, N.Y., the church can claim a place on the small
list of projects that are helping to lift New York architecture out
of its long creative slump.
</P>
<P>
   The building was designed by Doug Garofalo, Greg Lynn and
Michael McInturf, three whizz kids of the computer generation who
live and work in three different cities _ Los Angeles, Chicago and
Columbus, Ohio _ and who practice together in an office somewhere
in cyberspace. For this trio, design is a paperless enterprise,
aided by software originally developed for automobile styling and
movie animation, and conducted with the playfulness of a video
game. These people are wired.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have long been standard equipment in architectural
offices, but few architects have tried to exploit the potential of
software as an expressive medium. Wes Jones, the Los Angeles-based
architect, has used the term blobmeisters to describe architects
who are pursuing this potential today. Conventional (so-called
orthogonal) buildings are typically rendered by plans and
elevations, two kinds of two-dimensional drawing. Blobs, on the
other hand, are rendered as three-dimensional computer models, like
those we see for cars, bodies or molecular structures. By
collapsing plan and elevation into a single three-dimensional form,
the computer model encourages architects to break out of
orthogonal, right-angled space. Instead, they can manipulate all
dimensions at once. Space becomes as plastic as a hunk of Silly
Putty. It can be pinched, rotated, kneaded, stretched, cut into
sections, shattered or left to ooze. The computer model displays
the impact of each manipulation on the whole.
</P>
<P>
   Blobmeisters use software the way modernists used structure: as
a springboard for form. By way of explanation, Lynn says that a
movie like ``Antz'' came about not because a director wanted to
make a movie about insects, but because a technician discovered
that a particular computer program was effective at depicting
animated bugs. At the Presbyterian Church, the architects used a
program called Alias, developed for movie animation and industrial
design. They have combined new blob elements with the box form of
an older, existing structure to produce a hybrid design, or
para-building _ an addition that radically transforms what came
before.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1970, the Presbyterian Church of New York has a
rapidly growing congregation whose members are mostly of Korean
descent. In addition to the religious services held in the
sanctuary, the new building's largest space, the church functions
as a social and educational center for the Korean community. The
new building, which cost $10 million, contains 80 classrooms, a
banquet hall-cafeteria with seating for 1,000, a wedding chapel,
day care center, library and medical clinic. As an expression of
faith, parishioners fasted one day each week while their church was
in construction.
</P>
<P>
   The church's physical context is almost lyrically gritty, flat
and gray, an area dominated by used-car lots, warehouses, factories
and chain super stores. Grand Opening, pennants fluttering, Nobody
Beats Our Prices: a Northern Boulevard version of Ed Ruscha. Across
the street from the church, Long Island Rail Road trains zip by on
an overpass. Beyond, the leafy streets of Sunnyside, Queens,
emphasize the nearby urban grit. Into this sliced-up,
wrong-side-of-the-tracks setting, Garofalo, Lynn and McInturf have
introduced chop-shop architecture: an assemblage of old and new
industrial parts.
</P>
<P>
   The original structure was built in 1932 for the Knickerbocker
Laundry Factory, a commercial firm that held the franchise for
cleaning Yankee uniforms. A local landmark, the precast concrete
Art Deco edifice later housed a perfume factory. The church retains
the laundry's street facade, though its curving Deco surface, once
white, has been painted black. The architects call it the Shroud.
</P>
<P>
   In the original building, a two-story industrial shed lay behind
the Deco facade. For the remodeling, the architects have added a
new structural framework that doubles the height of the shed. They
have sheared away three of the existing walls _ chop, chop _ and
replaced them with new ones: two finished with a purple-gray
stucco, the third made of translucent fiberglass panels inset with
clear glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   Blobmeister forms often resemble horror movie monsters. Earlier
this year, Lynn presented an installation in Vienna called ``The
Tingler,'' after the old William Castle movie about a
centipede-like parasite. For the church, he and his partners have
invented a form they call Nestor, so named because it is composed
of trapezoidal shapes that appear to nest inside one another, like
a stack of baskets laid on its side. Nestor is not an object, but a
form, a spatial void that is used to define different areas on the
top two floors of the church. Imagine it as the hollow cavity of a
Jurassic fossil.
</P>
<P>
   Nestor's form is reptilian, with a serrated surface that recalls
a lizard's hide. The form is only partly visible from outside, in a
series of zinc-clad, folded canopies that cascade down the northern
facade of the building, sheltering an exterior fire stair of poured
concrete. Admirers of '50s sculpture may see a resemblance of these
canopies to the work of Seymour Lipton. Inside the shed, Nestor
contains the church's main space, the sanctuary, with seating for
more than 2,500 parishioners. The capacity is roughly that of St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn and McInturf both worked in the New York office of Peter
Eisenman and make no effort to cover their tracks. We have seen
lots of work from the generation after Frank Gehry, but it's a
novelty to see second-generation Eisenman, particularly in New
York, where the mentor himself has built only a humble fire
station, and that some years back. There are people who break out
in hives whenever Eisenman's name comes up, but the Presbyterian
Church may persuade them to reconsider. The younger architects give
us Eisenmanesque forms without the Hate me! Hate me! provocation.
That loss is a gain all around.
</P>
<P>
   For the convention center in Columbus, Ohio, Eisenman designed
``snakes,'' curving shapes that turned the roof into a so-called
fifth facade. Lodged within the Presbyterian Church are what the
architects call tubes: three vertical corridors that contain
entrances, hallways, stairs and elevators and provide circulation
throughout the building.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The hopeful dawn of a new school year was
shattered Tuesday at MIT, where students struggled with the
school's second substance-abuse death in two years.
</P>
<P>
   A 22-year-old MIT student was found dead in his East Campus dorm
room just after midnight after he used a plastic bag to inhale
nitrous oxide, campus police said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy showed that Richard A. Guy of Mission Viejo, Calif.,
died of asphyxiation. The medical examiner had not determined
whether his death was an accident or suicide, howevere.
</P>
<P>
   Guy was a third-year physics student who apparently lived alone
in his fifth-floor room at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technololgy.
</P>
<P>
   As students arrived on campus Tuesday, they struggled to make
sense of another autumn death tied to the abuse of substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``MIT prides itself on letting people be individuals with free
reign over their own lives, but some people take advantage of
that,'' said Eric Ferreira, a senior from California. ``They have
done an excellent job on drug education and the majority of people
here listen to what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira added: ``MIT students are just getting back and this is
a shock. It's just such a bad way to start off the year.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997 freshman Scott S. Krueger, 18, died after an
alcohol overdose at a fraternity hazing party. His death prompted
MIT, which had long relied on fraternities to deal with a shortage
of dormitory space, to announce plans to build a new dorm and
require freshmen to live on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we came to school, they made a big deal over Krueger's
death,'' said an 18-year-old freshman from New Jersey, who declined
to be named. ``I think MIT was trying very hard to make sure
something like that never happened here again.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT spokesman Kenneth Campbell said that because nitrous oxide _
popularly known as laughing gas _ is used on campus for work in
science and medicine, it is not illegal to possess it. But it is,
he said, unlawful to inhale it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campus police reported that the student apparently had been
using a plastic bag to inhale nitrous oxide (laughing gas),'' MIT
said in a statement. ``This can result in asphyxiation.''
</P>
<P>
   State Police attached to the Middlesex County district
attorney's office investigated Guy's death, but swiftly determined
that it was not a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy results showed that Guy died of ``asphyxiation due to an
obstructed airway due to nitrous oxide intoxication,'' said Anson
Kaye, a spokesman for Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley.
</P>
<P>
   In Mission Viejo, a southern California city located roughly
between Los Angeles and San Diego, neighbors of Guy's family were
shocked and saddened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sad even talking about it,'' said Debra Violette, who
said she learned of the MIT death when a television news crew
knocked on her door Tuesday. ``They're a very nice family. They
travel quite a bit. It's such a terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although classes at MIT don't start until next week, many
students already have returned to campus. On the grassy quandrangle
outside Guy's dormitory off Ames Street Tuesday, tearful friends
and classmates consoled each other, declining to speak with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Randolph, the senior associate dean of students and
undergraduate education, said that Guy's parents were notified late
Tuesday morning about ``the tragic death of their son.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure nitrous oxide dissolves in the bloodstream. It pushes
oxygen out from the blood into the lungs and deprives the brain and
other organs of oxygen. Dentists often use it as an anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   It is commonly abused by teenagers, who buy small pressurized
containers of the gas, called ``whippets'' because they are used to
power whipped cream containers sold by restaurant supply companies
and gourmet food stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's becoming a lot more popular on campus,'' said one
21-year-old junior Tuesday. ``But the school works really hard to
combat any sort of substance abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. H. Westley Clark, director of the Center for Substance Abuse
Treatment at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration in Washington, said the percentage of 18- to
25-year-olds who have used nitrous oxide rose from 6.6 percent in
1997 to 7.9 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use a plastic bag around your head or strap a mask to
your face and you pass out, your body will want oxygen and it won't
be able to get it,'' Clark said. ``And, therefore, you die.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT's move to mandate that freshmen live in dormitories sparked
a student protest. The Undergraduate Association said a campus poll
last fall showed 90 percent of students opposed the move.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger, a fraternity pledge, died after an initiation rite
called ``Animal House Night.'' He and others drank beer and spiced
rum while singing fraternity songs. Krueger passed out, was left in
his basement apartment, and choked on vomit. His blood alcohol
level was .401 _ five times the legal limit used to measure
intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, MIT withdrew the diploma of the fraternity member
accused of leading the forced drinking binge. The school said the
diploma will be reissued in five years. The former fraternity
member, 23-year-old Charles Yoo, has said he will sue to get his
diploma back.

 (For release Sun., Sept. 5)  
 NEW YORK: the building.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shroud, shed, Nestor, tubes: these are the basic components of
the church's organizing system, and it is helpful to keep them in
mind, because it's not immediately apparent that a system is in
operation. The tubes, for example, overlap as they weave through
the structure. The overlapping areas are sometimes, but not always,
articulated by ceiling soffits and by the color of the linoleum
flooring. The building's undulating roof corresponds to Nestor's
bulging contour just below. The canopies are not, as one might
think, arbitrarily sculpted shapes, but Nestor's serrated western
edge.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary is the most impressive interior to be built in New
York in many years. The room's ceiling (Nestor's inner hide) serves
an acoustical function but is mainly an experiment in folded
planes, a device long associated with Eisenman. The space is
asymmetrical, with angled banks of seating that violate the
traditional arrangement around a central axis. The effect is not
weird or Caligariesque. Rather, the asymmetry makes the space more
fluid, its vast size less overwhelming. Chop-chop: a glass wall
slices through the sanctuary along its northern edge, allowing
natural light into the space and dissolving any sense of
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Other fine moments: a magnificent processional staircase that
leads from the main entrance lobby to the sanctuary two floors
above; the most dramatic feature within the tubes, the stair curves
and narrows slightly as it rises, the deviations accented by strips
of neon lighting overhead. The black asphalt parking lot,
surrounded by white concrete walls, that sets the church off like
an industrial velvet matte. The fixtures and furnishings brought in
by the church itself _ lots of wood, vases with scrolls on them _
that help draw the place into the vernacular. The view of the
church from Northern Boulevard: a free-falling image, pure formal
play, the zinc-covered canopies reverberate across the northern
facade like tolling bells.
</P>
<P>
   Shortcomings in blob architecture might be called glitches,
blips or crashes. The Presbyterian Church has a few. Stairs. In the
balcony aisle, and an exterior stair near the parking lot, the
treads are too long. You have to hop-skip, leading first left foot,
then right. This rhythm is boring and distracts from the irregular
geometries of the space. Such discomforts can be found in many
conventional buildings, but it's screwy when formalist architecture
does not work with the geometry of human form. The funereal
palette: purple gray; black; mauve. The architects say that their
adaptive reuse replaces the laundering of dirty uniforms with the
cleansing of tarnished souls. A lovely conceit. Why the mourning
dress? One senses the strain of young architects trying to look
sober beyond their years.
</P>
<P>
   Wasted space. The upper landing of the outdoor fire stair,
sheltered beneath the topmost canopy, is a wonderful space, perhaps
the best in the building, with views of the Manhattan skyline and
the sanctuary inside. A perfect place for a garden of
contemplation. Fire codes permitting, the entire staircase, and the
spaces beneath it, would benefit from landscaping. Software-driven
design should maximize what chat rooms cannot provide: habitable
public space for integrated bodies, minds and souls; physical
proximity; tactility; the here as well as the now.
</P>
<P>
   The glitches do not, however, diminish the stature of this work,
as both a fulfillment of historical forces and as a preview of
things to come. Half a century ago, the British historian John
Summerson said that architects should ``learn to study not merely
minimum requirements, but maximum possibilities; to learn not only
how to economize space but how to be extravagant with it; to study
the overtones of architecture and the geometrical discipline of
space as space; to learn not only to use space but to play with
space.''
</P>
<P>
   The words come from an address Summerson delivered to the
Architectural Association in London in 1947. He was responding to
the impact on architecture of modern communications technology.
Radio, television and telephone, Summerson thought, had relieved
architects of the need to create imposing public symbols of social
cohesion. This had liberated them to focus on space, an element
media could not supplant.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, however, communications technology has
gone far toward capturing the spatial dimension. The culture now
lives more imaginatively in simulated spaces _ blue screen
backgrounds, VR, SimCity _ than in those created by architectural
means. Obviously, Garofalo, Lynn and McInturf are not opposed to
this development. In fact, their cyberspatial mode of working may
be more revolutionary than their design. They have dealt with
displacement by incorporating new media into their method. The
church is a natural extension of the process the architects used to
design it. That process caused three architects to reconfigure the
spatial relationships between them. The church amplifies those
relationships in architectural terms.
</P>
<P>
   It would be odd if the computer did not set off a spatial
revision comparable to that sparked by Brunelleschi's development
of linear perspective in 15th-century Florence. Indeed, blob
architecture undermines the enduring authority of perspectival
space. While blob architecture has its Baroque aspects, its twists
on axis, symmetry and procession violate classical norms. In
Queens, the classically symmetrical Deco facade accentuates the
anti-classicism of the addition.
</P>
<P>
   It was fortuitous that this project was commissioned by a
church. Faith is supra-rational, like mountain climbing. Believers
throw a line up into the unknown and we haul ourselves skyward, and
it's only when we have done this quite a bit that we know that
faith works: we can look back and see how high we have climbed.
Architecture works the same way. Architects may have no idea what's
up there, but they throw the line anyway, and when this happens
often enough, a history of architecture is revealed. The New York
Presbyterian Church signifies a new stage of ascent.

   In a national art contest with 70,000 entries and just a dozen
winners, what are the chances that a brother and sister from
Arlington, Texas, would succeed?
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Templin, 14, and her brother, David, 12, both drew a
winning birthday-card design in the contest for kids sponsored by
Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 winning entries are part of the company's summer lineup
of greeting cards. The pair entered four card designs each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one they chose was actually my favorite one, so it was
kind of weird that they chose it,'' Alicia said. Her winning
drawing is of a candle bowing from a cake to its candle friends.
</P>
<P>
   David's design is a floppy-eared dog sitting on top of a
birthday cake.
</P>
<P>
   The Templins, who go to Grace Preparatory Academy in Arlington,
got to tour the Hallmark Cards headquarters in Kansas City, Mo., as
part of their prize. Last weekend, they traveled to Easton, Pa., to
see the Crayola crayon and marker factory.
</P>
<P>
   The kids' talent for art likely came from their parents. Their
father, Gary Templin, is a graphic design artist, and their mother,
Crystal Templin, is a computer artist. They run an art school
called Art Smart in their home.
</P>
<P>
   David and Alicia already help out with teaching the classes, and
they both picture art in their distant futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to do clay animation,'' David said. ``So I'm not sure,
but I may want to do that when I grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia said: ``I definitely want to do something in art. I might
even want to be an author and illustrator for children's books.''
</P>
<P>
   Check out the Templins' artwork on their Web sites: Alicia's is
at www.polo.8m.com; David's is at www.monsters.8m.com.

   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura returned to his roots recently,
exchanging a business suit for referee gear to preside over the
World Wrestling Federation's SummerSlam.
</P>
<P>
   His behavior sparked a debate over whether his actions are
appropriate for an elected official and high-profile role model.
</P>
<P>
   Some said Ventura, a former pro wrestler who retired from the
ring in 1986, was abusing and degrading the office of governor.
</P>
<P>
   Others said he was sending the wrong message by appearing at a
WWF spectacle complete with vulgar chants, guitar-shattering
violence and scantily clad women making suggestive gestures.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the three-person title match _ involving Stone
Cold Steve Austin, Triple H and Mankind _ Ventura barked orders,
but didn't join the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in my state now,'' Ventura shouted at Triple H before
the match started. ``I am law and order here.''
</P>
<P>
   The event, attended by 19,404 rowdy onlookers, was carried on
pay-per-view TV. Ventura has said he will donate to charity the
$100,000 fee he was given to referee.

 MUSIC CD REVIEW: EDWIN McCAIN'S ``MESSENGER''  World rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``MESSENGER''
</P>
<P>
   Artist: Edwin McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Category: soft rock.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody forgot to tell Edwin McCain that mellow doesn't have to
equal monotonous. One song sounds like another ... and another. The
lyrics are repetitious and the mostly midtempo music doesn't really
stand out. Even when he's trying to rock, it sounds tired. This guy
can barely trudge from one tune to another, so how can he expect
listeners to hold on for the whole CD?
</P>
<P>
   McCain's husky voice is his best asset. Maybe next time he
should count on someone else's songwriting abilities.
</P>
<P>
   This album feels like it's coming to a climax, but it never gets
there. It's limp. As for his hit ``I'll Be,'' just buy the single.

<P>
   Meet: Ashley Cantley.
</P>
<P>
   Age: 16.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown: Mesquite, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: Finalist in the Chanel/``Seventeen'' New Model of
the Year Contest.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbies: Photography.
</P>
<P>
   Pets: A dog, two cats, two Australian flying squirrels, three
salamanders and a school of fish.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know Ashley Cantley, you might think her life as a
teen model is easy.
</P>
<P>
   After all, her break into the modeling world began with just a
routine trip to the mall when she was 13. A talent scout from Page
Parkes Model's Rep in Dallas spotted her shopping and persuaded her
to give the business a try. Ashley eventually signed with The
Campbell Agency in Dallas and began appearing in catalogs for
department stores J.C. Penney and Dillard's.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the junior got another big break. Competing against
20,000 girls ages 14 to 20, she was selected as one of eight
finalists in the Chanel/``Seventeen'' New Model of the Year
Contest. In May, Ashley flew to New York City for hair and make-up
sessions, a photo shoot and a runway show attended by the press at
the Chanel Boutique.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashley will tell you that what she does requires a lot of
effort. ``My friends don't believe me when I tell them it's hard
work,'' she says. ``It's really tiring. When I get home from
shooting all day I'm tired. It may be because of the pressure, when
the photographer wants a certain look or mood you have to show it.
It's like acting to a still camera.''
</P>
<P>
   To boost her stamina and to stay fit, Ashley, who describes
herself as ``totally not athletic,'' recently took up running. She
picked the hottest time of the year to begin; with Texas
temperatures reaching above 100 degrees, Ashley has to wait until 9
p.m. or later to hit the streets.
</P>
<P>
   An honor student and student government participant, Ashley
tries to keep a balance between her career and her everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I went to school with mascara on but no other makeup,''
she says. ``I know it's impossible to look like I do in photos.
Sometimes, they don't even look anything like me.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the future? Will she stay with modeling?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice,'' she says. ``There are millions of girls
trying to do the same thing. I've wanted to be a pediatrician for a
long time, but 10 more years of school? I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a while to decide. Meanwhile, check Ashley out in the
Chanel special advertising section in the September issue of
``Seventeen.''

SUN AIMS AT MICROSOFT WITH FREE SOFTWARE VIA INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Why pay hundreds of dollars for word-processing software when
you can get it for free?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question Sun Microsystems Inc. posed Tuesday to
millions of consumers accustomed to forking over hundreds of
dollars apiece for word processing, spreadsheet and other software
sold by, among others, Sun's archrival, Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In what is widely perceived to be its first substantial assault
on Microsoft, Sun said that it has acquired Star Division Corp. and
is distributing Star's word processing, database, spreadsheet,
graphics and presentation programs free over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft derives about 40 percent of its nearly $20 billion in
annual revenues from selling a similar suite of programs, called
Microsoft Office, for about $500 to $800 each, depending on the
version. About 100 million people worldwide currently use Microsoft
Office, making it the number one office software.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, with $11.7 billion in sales for the 12 months ended last
June 30, is better known for its network-focused hardware and
software, including the Java programming language that has become
integral to Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft countered by noting that Sun's latest offering is not
new, nor is it entirely free to users.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's free software on the market today. That's not new,''
said Phyllis McNeice, a Microsoft spokeswoman. ``Offering it for
free doesn't mean that everyone will want it. There will be other
costs associated with owning that software, like maintenance and
support.''
</P>
<P>
   While consumers can download the Star Office software from the
Internet at no cost, users may have to pay another firm to store
documents created by Star Office.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, based in Palo Alto, Calif., acquired Star Division, of
Fremont, Calif., on Aug. 5. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Sun downplayed its rivalry with Microsoft, saying the move is
not intended to unseat the Redmond, Wash., software giant. Instead,
Sun executives say, it's about Sun's long-held strategy to move the
center of technology universe away from the personal computer to
the Internet, where Sun's role in selling high-powered machines,
called servers, is much more prominent.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's strategy is not altruistic. By giving away software, the
company says it hopes to build sales of its servers to businesses
that store and manage data for clients, much as banks hold money
for depositers. Sun's plan would also create a stream of revenue
from customers wanting technical help in using the software, said
Marko Boerries, former CEO of Star and now a Sun vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will need and want our services,'' Boerries said. ``To
get that, you can buy subscriptions from us, and we continually
update and support you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun's stock gained 3 7/8 to close at 79 1/2 on the Nasdaq.
Microsoft stock, also on the Nasdaq, edged up 5/16 to 92 9/16.

EXPLOSION IN MOSCOW INJURES 30, PROVOKES FEARS OF TERRORISM

<P>
   MOSCOW _ A powerful explosion rocked Moscow's fanciest shopping
center Tuesday night, bringing the threat of terrorism to the foot
of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people were wounded in the underground Manezh shopping
center, a marble and glass showcase of glitzy stores and a popular
gathering place for teenagers and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion coincided with an upsurge in the fighting in
Dagestan and provoked anxious speculation that Islamic militants
might have begun a series of terrorist attacks against the seat of
Russian power. The latest fighting has left eight Russian soldiers
dead and many more wounded, just days after Russia declared victory
over Islamic rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also possible that the blast was the work of a lone
fanatic, the result of gang warfare or perhaps even a pretext to
justify a ``state of emergency'' that would enable the Kremlin to
suspend the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosion and officials
said there had been no warning.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesmen said initially that they did not know what
caused the explosion. But Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said it was
caused by a bomb, containing about five ounces of TNT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that comes to mind is the situation in
Dagestan,'' Luzhkov said Tuesday. ``But a more serious examination
is needed to make an accusation. Tonight we shall find out what
kind of bomb it was.''
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the Kremlin and near Red Square, the Manezh
complex is a favorite hangout for young Muscovites, who go there to
socialize, window shop and eat at its fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The blast took place near a crowded fountain at 7:59 p.m.,
ripping apart a video arcade and sending shards of glass flying
through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Blood was smeared across the floor of a McDonald's restaurant.
Of the nearly 30 people who were wounded, five were reported to be
in grave condition.
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred amid a new wave of fighting in Dagestan.
Tuesday, the Russian military unleashed artillery barrages and air
strikes near the villages of Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi, close to
the Dagestan capital of Makhachkala.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian attacks took place barely a week after Moscow
declared that it had triumphed over Islamic militants who have
crossed into Dagestan from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The raids Tuesday were directed against the Wahhabis, an Islamic
sect in Dagestan that has been sympathetic to the militants. Some
of the militants are even believed to have hidden in Wahhabi
villages.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wahhabis have also been generally content to govern
their own territory, and some specialists said that the attacks
might further inflame the already unstable Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous Russian policy had been to leave the Wahhabis
alone,'' said Dmitri Trenin, deputy director of the Moscow office
of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ``My own feeling
is that the situation will deteriorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian offensive has already been costly. The Russian
military acknowledged Tuesday that eight of its soldiers had been
killed and 31 wounded. Russian officials said 80 ``militants'' had
been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The ORT television network observed dryly Tuesday night that
``the operation in Dagestan may take longer than initially
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether terrorism will be a part of the conflict is still
unclear. Although contract killings are virtually routine in
Russia, Moscow has generally been safe from terrorists. And Tuesday
evening jittery residents turned to the live news broadcasts from
the Manezh and wondered whether that has changed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Heavily promoted by Luzhkov and opened in 1997 during the
celebrations of the city's 850th anniversary, the Manezh is a
symbol of the nation's new freedoms and excesses. It is also just a
place to people watch and relax.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the explosion spread, television crews and ambulances
raced to the scene. Security forces took up positions in Red Square
and nearby streets.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion could prompt Moscow police to detain more people
from the Caucasus region. Already, dark-skinned people are often
stopped by the police and harassed. The Manezh mall, however, is
managed by Umar Dzhabrailov, an ethnic Chechen, who is close to
Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have often complained that President Boris Yeltsin, who
resides at a government complex outside the city, is out of touch
with events. So Yeltsin's spokesman made a point Tuesday of saying
that the president had been informed about the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, a potential presidential candidate, did better. He
rushed to the Manezh, toured the complex and then appeared before
the television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   With school classes set to resume on Thursday, the fact that so
many young people were among the injured prompted special concern.
The culprits, Luzhkov told reporters, were ``not human.'' No normal
person, he said, could have planted a bomb where children and young
people gathered.

PRO-JAKARTA MILITIAS CONTINUE INTIMIDATION DESPITE VOTE

   DILI, East Timor _ Pro-Jakarta militias renewed in earnest their
anti-independence campaign of intimidation Tuesday, just one day
after East Timor's residents voted in relative peace to choose
between independence and autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian police and military had earned praise on Monday
for reining in the paramilitary groups, whom they are widely
believed to support. But the militias were back out in force
Tuesday, setting up roadblocks, barring East Timorese from leaving
the territory and laying siege to 150 election officials and
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of violence and intimidation, nearly 99 percent
of East Timorese cast their ballots Monday in a vote that is widely
expected to favor independence.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from election day violence, meanwhile, was put at
three Tuesday. A Brazilian UN election officer in the town of
Atsabe, 20 miles southwest of Dili, said local members of his staff
were stabbed before his eyes as he carried the ballot box to his
car.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents cast doubt on the peaceful transition planned for
this island territory the size of Connecticut, from a province
annexed by Indonesia to either a semi-autonomous state or an
independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, this agrarian territory was a far-away, neglected
colony of Portugal at the edge of the Indonesian island chain,
until 1975 when the Portuguese withdrew and Indonesia invaded. In
the five years that followed, one-quarter of the population
perished in civil war, starvation and disease.
</P>
<P>
   The international community never recognized Indonesia's rule
over East Timor, and early this year, Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie agreed to let East Timorese determine their future. The
run-up to the ballot was plagued by massacres of independence
supporters and clashes between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Eurico Gutteres, an erstwhile independence activist who
was captured and reputedly tortured years ago before becoming a
pro-Indonesia militia commander, kept his pledge to block land, sea
and air borders so that East Timorese could not ``flee'' before
vote results are announced next week.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, black-shirted members of his Aitarak (Thorn)
militia were seen preventing locals from boarding ferries at Dili
harbor, setting up airport roadblocks and confiscating air tickets
from East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the UN, which is administering the referendum and
transition in East Timor, were called to the airport to intervene,
but were apparently unable to stop the militias from blocking
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesian law guarantees freedom of movement. Whoever wants
to leave East Timor can do so,'' said an Indonesian government
spokesman, Dino Djalal, who promised to raise the issue immediately
with local police.
</P>
<P>
   But local police and the military seemed in no mood to rein in
the militias. Armed civilians were allowed to run roughshod over
the town of Gleno, 16 miles southwest of Dili, burning seven houses
and offices of independence supporters, blocking a UN helicopter
from picking up ballot boxes and surrounding election officials and
observers.
</P>
<P>
   UN mission spokesman David Wimhurst confirmed that 17 vehicles
and 150 election workers and observers _ 100 foreigners and 50
local staff _ were trapped in Gleno most of the day before the UN
police commissioner and senior Indonesian police were able to
negotiate the convoy's return to Dili. Militias fired shots, twice
preventing a UN helicopter from landing to fetch ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots will be counted at a central location in Dili starting
Wednesday to minimize fraud and protect secrecy of ballots cast in
each town and village.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, the detained convoy arrived at UN
headquarters in Dili, disgorging relieved election workers who at
one point had to huddle on the floor of their Gleno office to avoid
being shot through the window.

 &HT;    Cause of fatal truck crash may never surface, police say

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two Alabama truckers hauling a load from Birmingham,
Ala., to Charlotte, N.C., died before dawn Tuesday, consumed in an
explosion that engulfed their eighteen-wheeler on eastbound
Interstate 285.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, at what DeKalb County police say is one of the
busiest intersections in the Southeast, closed down I-285 in both
directions. And for five hours spanning the morning rush,
interstate commuters in both directions were forced to merge into
one or two lanes of traffic as they made their way around the
burned-out wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, road crews with the state Department of
Transportation will spend the next three days repairing damage to
the underside of the Ashford-Dunwoody Road bridge, police said.
Crews will repair the bridge one lane at a time in an effort to
ease congestion on the already crowded highway.
</P>
<P>
   James Neal Tinker, 39, of Ashville, Ala., and George Kenneth
Thomason of Lincoln, Ala., died in what one witness described as a
terrible fireball that erupted after their semi-tractor trailer hit
the interstate's median wall, careened across the highway, crashed
into a bridge abutment and leaped a second wall into oncoming lanes
of traffic, DeKalb police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that the truck's diesel fuel tank ruptured,
spilling fuel across the highway and precipitating the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb police found the body of one man in the driver's seat.
The second man was in the truck's sleeping compartment. Tuesday
afternoon, the county's medical examiners were waiting for dental
records that would confirm who of the two was driving the truck
when it crashed about 3:20 a.m., said DeKalb Sgt. Andy Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that police may never know for certain what first
caused the truck to swerve into the right-hand emergency lane and
hit the median wall.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``It's typical of an accident where someone falls
asleep, drifts to the side, hits the wall, wakes up, and
overreacts.''
</P>
<P>
   After striking the right-hand wall, the truck veered across the
interstate into the far left lane and struck an abutment shoring up
the Ashford-Dunwoody Road bridge, Anderson said. Leaking diesel
fuel, the rig's cab leaped the median wall separating the eastbound
from the westbound lanes and burst into flames. ``The trailer was
still driving it,'' Anderson said. ``It probably drove it (the cab)
up and over the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Because both of the truck's occupants are dead, ``We'll never
know what really happened,'' the traffic investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the truckers were team drivers. The practice _
during which one trucker sleeps while the other drives _ allows
truckers to keep their rigs on the road longer because they can
meet federal requirements that limit a trucker's driving hours
without rest.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were hauling a mixed load of seating, metal
fittings, and nuts and bolts, Anderson said. There were no
hazardous materials found in the truck that might have contributed
to the fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing the wreckage from the highway and removing the bodies
was delayed by interstate commuters who jammed into the highway's
single emergency lane in a futile effort to circumvent the
accident, Anderson said. Consequently, state DOT HERO trucks, which
carry traffic cones and other equipment to quickly clear a highway
and re-route traffic around an accident, were themselves caught in
the jam. So was the hearse that transported the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a broom in my hand, sweeping stuff out of the road
because the HERO units couldn't get up there,'' Anderson said.

APPLE SHIPS ITS SPEEDY G4 MACS EARLY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A buoyant Steve Jobs, the interim CEO of Apple
Computer Inc., introduced the latest, most powerful Macintosh on
Tuesday, describing it as a supercomputer for the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   The new Macs, the G4 series, were not expected until next year,
but Jobs, who demonstrated the machines at the Seybold Publishing
Conference here, said shipments of them began Tuesday. Although
they are substantially more powerful than the G3 series they
replace, their price increments are the same: $1,599 for a Mac with
a 400-megahertz processor, available immediately; $2,499 for 450
MHz, available in September, and $3,499 for 500 MHz, available in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delivering several months early, and far more powerful
machines than anyone expected,'' said Jobs, who received repeated
ovations from conference participants. ``We think this is going to
set the whole industry on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple also introduced a 22-inch flat panel display, the largest
ever offered. It will be available in October for $4,000, but only
with the purchase of a 450- or 500-MHz G4 machine and only from the
company's Web store.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Apple rose $3.1875, to $65.25, in Nasdaq trading.
Analysts said the new machines should give Apple a boost at the
high end, where it enjoys greater profit margins than on its
popular but lower-priced iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from the G4 will benefit Apple's current fourth quarter,
which ends in September, and the first quarter of its fiscal year
2000, well ahead of expectations, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple really wasn't expected to have anything new in the pro
line for the December quarter, but now it appears they'll be out
there in substantial volumes,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst
with J.P. Morgan. ``We'll have this and, probably in a month or so,
a new iMac as well.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Seybold conference, which draws graphics professionals
and publishers, Jobs showed the 500-MHz G4 Macintosh running
standard processes in the Adobe Systems Inc. Photoshop application
at least twice as fast as a PC with a 600-MHz Intel Pentium III
processor. Apple has been criticized for selecting demonstrations
that favor its machines, so Jobs also showed results of the new
machine running tests from Intel's own library at speeds that were
on average about three times faster than that of the Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   The G4 microprocessor, which was co-developed by Apple, IBM and
Motorola, uses a circuit called the velocity engine, similar to the
vector processors used in supercomputers, that allows it to process
128 bits of information a cycle, or hertz, compared with 32 or 64
bits in most microprocessors. Doing more bits per cycle enables the
processor to perform one billion floating point operations a
second, a measure of performance known in the computer industry as
a gigaflop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the machines we've seen, these are the fastest running
our applications,'' said John E. Warnock, chief executive of Adobe.
``The wonderful thing about having Apple back is that this industry
is no longer boring.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jobs, computer users need supercomputer power
because so many tasks, from encrypting Internet messages to
processing digital video, slow ordinary PCs to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the G4 machines and the 22-inch monitor, Jobs
demonstrated OS9, the latest version of the Macintosh operating
system, which is scheduled to be shipped on Oct. 1 at a cost of

CONGO'S REBELS SIGN PEACE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to clarify, accord was signed in July.) 
 (DW)

<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia _ The divided rebels in Congo finally signed a
peace agreement Tuesday, a key step toward ending the fighting but
only the start toward reconstructing one of Africa's biggest,
richest and least stable nations.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for a cease-fire within 24 hours. The other
combatants in the war _ Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia
and Congo itself _ signed the far-ranging document in July, and it
now goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the rebel groups signed the accord in a hotel ballroom
here, they continued to squabble about how to carry out its first
main provisions. But Tuesday was significant nonetheless, because
the peace process could go no further until the document was
signed, whatever the coming hardships in putting the plan into
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just get those signatures,'' Patrick Mazimhaka, a top
Rwandan official, said impatiently as reporters asked him before
the signing how difficulties could be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Congo started a year ago, when a group of rebels
who had little in common united to oust President Laurent Kabila,
who had himself taken power in a similar rebellion only the year
before. With the backing of Rwanda and Uganda, the rebels, called
the Congolese Rally for Democracy, captured nearly half of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of tensions, both among the rebels and between
Rwanda and Uganda, the rebel group split in May. Then in July, the
rebels declined to sign the accord because one faction refused to
sign if the other did.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday that disagreement was resolved in a chaotic compromise,
which involved not only the faction leaders but all 50 people who
founded the Rally for Democracy in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As a choir of Congolese refugees sang, the rebels sat in
alphabetical order, in two long rows facing each other, and each
signed copies of the accord. Thus the group's first leader, Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba, was nearly last to sign, while his replacement,
Dr. Emile Ilunga, was among the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a ridiculous way of doing things,'' said Amama Mbabazi,
the top Ugandan official at the ceremony. ``But it's their
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the reasons why Ilunga's faction agreed to the
compromise became clear Tuesday: Of the 50 original founders, 41
follow Ilunga in a faction based in Goma, a city in eastern Congo
that includes most of the rebellion's military might. Only nine
have remained loyal to Wamba dia Wamba, who is based in Kisangani,
in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, members of the Goma faction said, they are entitled to
chose both representatives to a powerful military council being
formed that will administer and monitor the peace. Tuesday night
they named their two choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are just following the simple rules of democracy,'' said
Moise Nyuragabu, vice president of the Goma group. ``We can vote,
do an election.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wamba dia Wamba said he expected to name one person to the
council based on informal agreements among the parties before the
signing. ``There is no way we can't get a seat unless you have
amended the agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The poisonous atmosphere that has preceded the signing seems to
jeopardize long-term prospects for peace. ``I'm not too
optimistic,'' said one European diplomat. ``Knowing the guys we are
dealing with, you can't expect everything to be solved. It's just
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level the disagreement appears to be a continuation of
the two groups' vengeful squabbling. Little held the rebels
together from the start, and only two weeks ago they were engaged
in battles in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   But if the accord holds, Tuesday marks the end of the armed
struggle and the beginning of the political one _ and so the
disagreements among the rebels are partly an early struggle to lead
an opposition to try to topple Kabila in elections.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important deadlines in the agreement is one in 45
days, when the rebels, Kabila and other civic and opposition groups
are to engage in a ``national dialogue,'' as yet ill defined, that
will determine how a new Congo will be structured.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement's other main parts include the establishment of
the military council within seven days; the withdrawal of foreign
troops within 180 days; and deployment of U.N. peacekeepers within
120 days.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Zambia, Frederick Chiluba, who has been the
main force behind the peace talks, said over and again at the
signing that Tuesday was only the beginning, and perhaps the
easiest part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big responsibility that does not end with the
signing,'' Chiluba said. ``It begins with the signing.''

   INSURANCE (Seattle) _ Regence Blue Shield will stop selling
health insurance to individuals and families, leaving only Group
Health as a major insurer offering private plans in King, Pierce
and Snohomish counties. In fact, 25 counties in Washington state
will have no private insurance plans available for individuals or
families and 11 other counties will have only one option. Insurers
blame the rising costs of providing these plans since they're no

 &HT;    
 &HT;    SANTIAGO, Chile _ Chile's recent environmental battlegrounds _
Trillium and Ralco _ are so well known they go by single names like
Brazilian soccer stars.
 &HT;    Another quality the two investments have in common is less
auspicious. After millions spent on planning and tough legal and
political clashes, the logging project and the major new dam remain
in development limbo, neither canceled nor really moving forward.
 &HT;    Yet the final casualty of the political fire fights, which
forged Chile's nascent green movement in the summers of 1996 and
1997, may well be the reputation of the government's own National
Environment Commission, also a locally famous one-namer, Conama.
 &HT;    How well Conama can resuscitate its image as a relevant,
well-run watchdog remains to be seen. Both environmentalists and
business leaders have logged their share of gripes about the agency
and its much-debated mission.
 &HT;    The aftermath of the Trillium disaster eventually pushed the
head of Conama out of office. Vivian Blanlot left in mid-1997
following a successful legal challenge to her commission.
 &HT;    Bellingham, Washington-based logger Savia, Inc., head of the
Trillium project, had planned to log native lenga trees in
Patagonian Chile. The company's US$260 million project included
measures aimed at preserving the environment to gain Conama
approval.
 &HT;    Environmental groups sued, winning a substantial delay on
grounds that the government's failure to fully publish a new
environmental law rendered Conama's approvals moot. Trillium
eventually got the green light it wanted, but with so many
conditions it may never get off the ground.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the Ralco Dam, headed by Endesa of Chile, would block
a portion of the Bio-Bio River to produce much-needed hydroelectric
power. Ralco was besieged by lawsuits from both environmental and
indigenous groups. But the coup de grace was a private letter from
the World Bank _ leaked to the local media _ that was critical of
the project. Ralco remains on track, but work has slowed to a
crawl.
 &HT;    Conama's replacement director, Rodrigo Egana, now two years on
the job, says critics should see the agency for what it is _ a
technical administrative body that responds to the government. In
the past, Egana says, Chile did not put enough energy into caring
for the environment, especially considering the size and complexity
of new investments. Balancing the demands of investors and public
interest is a straightforward matter of policy that is open to
political debate, he adds. ``People complain that we're not
independent. We are, in fact, part of the government. I think it
would be strange if we weren't close to the government on
development issues.''
 &HT;    Conama can't hold the line against big developers whose projects
are important to politicians, environmentalists contend. Miguel
Stutzen, an official with Chile's National Committee for the
Defense of Fauna and Flora, says the Commission is more comfortable
simply setting administrative hurdles and then voting whichever way
suits the minister most affected by the project being considered.
 &HT;    ``There is a political policy to approve all projects,
regardless of their impacts,'' Stutzen complains. ``It's like an
orchestra with no conductor. Each musician just plays whatever he
likes.''
 &HT;    Public hearings are held for each environmental impact study, a
lengthy process patterned consciously after environmental practices
in the United States. Although Chile's non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) take an active role in those forums, their
most concrete success in stopping projects has been in the Chilean
court system.
 &HT;    That once-successful gambit, however, may have run its course.
Chile's latest headline-making development project also goes by a
popular single name: Cascade. The U.S. logging giant Boise Cascade
Corp. teamed with Chile's Maderas Condor S.A. to harvest 925,000
cubic meters of native forest annually in the southern Lakes region
near Puerto Montt. (Other private loggers already working the area
_ one of Chile's most thickly forested _ cut more than 5 million
cubic meters yearly.) At press time, the $180 million joint venture
had wrapped up its Conama paperwork, was awaiting its final
approval and was just 20 days behind schedule.
 &HT;    Cascade realized it had an uphill battle after Trillium. The
company spent $4.5 million and two years on preliminary studies,
partly to prepare for the Conama review, says Italo Zunino,
managing director of Maderas Condor.
 &HT;    From Cascade's point of view, that should be it. But now the
company faces interminable delays in the courts, with some suits
filed against the project and some in favor, specifically eight
separate indigenous groups and local citizens from the nearby town
of Bahia Ilque interested in new jobs in the rural, underdeveloped
south. The plant would provide 250 permanent positions and 700
construction jobs during the two-year building phase. ``Every
environmental permit should not end up in court,'' Zunino says.
``Unfortunately, lawsuits have become normal.''
 &HT;    Cascade is confident it will win eventually, and as time goes
by, precedents set by Cascade and other new investors will make
filing suits against new investments less attractive, Zunino says.
Chile's environmental rules are already demanding, so the NGO
tactic of using a plodding courts system to delay sound projects is
risky business, he contends. ``The funny thing is, our credibility
is worse than theirs,'' he says. ``But if they continue to play
with the truth, they will be discredited in the end.''
 &HT;    As might Conama if it doesn't get some teeth.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SANTIAGO de CHILE _ Los mas recientes campos de batalla
ecologista de Chile, Trillium y Ralco, son tan famosos que se les
conoce por un nombre sencillo, como si fueran astros del futbol
brasileno.
 &HT;    Otro rasgo comun es menos favorable. Tras gastar millones en la
planificacion y en renidas batallas politicas y juridicas, el
proyecto maderero y la nueva represa estan estancados.'
 &HT;    Pero la victima de los enfrentamientos politicos, azuzados por
el movimiento ecologista de Chile en 1996 y 1997 podria ser la
reputacion de la Comision Nacional del Medio Ambiente (Conama), una
entidad estatal.
 &HT;    Queda por ver si Conama logra resucitar su imagen de mecanismo
supervisor bien aceitado. Tanto los ambientalistas como los lideres
empresariales han presentado numerosas quejas contra el organismo y
su polemica mision. Debido al desastre de Trillium, Vivian Blanlot,
ex directora de Conama, perdio el puesto a mediados de 1997.
 &HT;    La empresa maderera Savia, Inc., con sede en Bellingham,
Washington, que encabeza el proyecto Trillium, habia planeado talar
arboles autoctonos, conocidos como lenga, en la Patagonia chilena.
El proyecto, con un costo de US$260 millones, contemplaba medidas
para preservar el medio ambiente, con el fin de recibir la
aprobacion de Conama.
 &HT;    Los grupos ambientalistas presentaron una querella y
consiguieron un retraso sustancial, basandose en que como el
gobierno no habia divulgado plenamente una nueva ley ecologica, la
autorizacion de Conama estaban en tela de juicio. Al final Trillium
recibio la luz verde, pero con tantas condiciones que lo mas
probable es que nunca logre despegar.
 &HT;    Entretanto, la represa Ralco, controlada por Endesa de Chile,
bloquearia una parte del rio Bio-Bio para producir la necesitada
energia hidroelectrica. Grupos indigenas y ecologistas presentaron
litigios contra Ralco. El golpe de gracia fue una carta del Banco
Mundial, que se filtro a la prensa local, en la que se criticaba el
proyecto. Ralco sigue en proceso de construccion, pero a paso de
tortuga.
 &HT;    El director de Conama, Rodrigo Egana, que ya lleva dos anos en
el cargo, dice que los criticos deben entender la verdadera
identidad de la comision: un organismo tecnico administrativo que
responde al gobierno. En el pasado, dice Egana, Chile no dio gran
importancia a la proteccion del medio ambiente, considerando sobre
todo la magnitud y la complejidad de las nuevas inversiones. Egana
agrega que el equilibrio entre las demandas de los inversionistas y
el interes publico es una cuestion de normas abiertas al debate
politico. ``La gente se queja de que no somos independientes. En
efecto, no lo somos: pertenecemos al gobierno. Y seria extrano que
estuvieramos apartados del gobierno a la hora de considerar
proyectos de desarrollo.''
 &HT;    Los ecologistas sostienen que Conama no puede mantener a raya a
las grandes empresas cuyos proyectos son importantes para los
politicos. Miguel Stutzen, funcionario del Comite Pro Defensa de la
Fauna y Flora de Chile, dice que el Comite se siente mas comodo
colocando obstaculos administrativos y luego votando de la forma
que prefiera el ministro mas afectado por el proyecto en cuestion.
``Hay una postura politica de aprobar todos los proyectos,
independientemente de su impacto,'' se queja Stutzen. ``Es como una
orquesta sin director. Cada musico toca lo que se le antoja.''
 &HT;    Por cada estudio de impacto ambiental se realizan audiencias
publicas, un largo proceso establecido a partir de los metodos
ambientalistas de Estados Unidos. Aunque las organizaciones no
gubernamentales (ONG) de Chile participan activamente en esos
foros, donde han tenido mas exito en detener proyectos ha sido en
el sistema judicial.
 &HT;    Pero esa estrategia exitosa tal vez ya este agotada. El proyecto
famoso mas reciente de Chile tambien tiene un nombre simple y
popular: Cascade. El gigante maderero estadounidense Boise Cascade
Corp. se asocio con Maderas Condor S.A., de Chile, para talar
anualmente 925.000 metros cubicos de madera en la region de los
lagos, cerca de Puerto Montt. (Otras madereras privadas que ya
trabajan en la zona cortan mas de 5 millones de metros cubicos al
ano.) Al cierre, la empresa conjunta de US$180 millones habia
terminado el papeleo con Conama y estaba a la espera de la
aprobacion final, con solo 20 dias de retraso.
 &HT;    Cascade comprendio que despues de Trillium, la batalla no seria
facil. La compania gasto US$4,5 millones y dedico dos anos a
estudios preliminares, en parte para prepararse con vistas a la
revision de Conama, dice Italo Zunino, director gerente de Maderas
Condor.
 &HT;    Desde el punto de vista de Cascade, eso deberia bastar. Pero
ahora la compania afronta retrasos interminables en los tribunales,
donde se han presentado pleitos en contra del proyecto y algunos a
favor, especificamente de ocho grupos indigenas y de vecinos del
cercano pueblo de Bahia Ilque, interesados en la creacion de
empleos en la zona del sur, rural y subdesarrollada. La planta
crearia 250 puestos de trabajo permanentes y 700 trabajos durante
los dos anos de la fase de construccion. ``Todos los permisos
ambientales no deberian terminar en los tribunales,'' dice Zunino.
``Desafortunadamente, los pleitos judiciales se han convertido en
la norma.''
 &HT;    Cascade confia en que al final triunfara, y con el paso del
tiempo, el precedente sentado por Cascade y otros nuevos inversores
desalentara las querellas contra las inversiones, afirma Zunino.
Las regulaciones ecologicas de Chile ya son exigentes, de modo que
la tactica de los ONG de utilizar el complicado sistema judicial
para retrasar proyectos responsables es riesgosa, sostiene Zunino.
``Hay algo comico en esto: nuestra credibilidad es peor que la de
ellos,'' dice. ``Pero si siguen jugando con la verdad, al final
quedaran desprestigiados.''
 &HT;    Lo mismo que le puede suceder a Conama si no se sabe defender.

   BALTIMORE _ Stephanie Monteiro spent the month of August in a
college classroom with the likes of Einstein, Newton and Euclid as
she investigated the everyday applications of algebra. She is an A
student. Her math score on the College Board exams, 520, ranks her
above the national average for university-bound seniors.
</P>
<P>
   She is also just 13, and in September she will enter the
eighth-grade at the Ann Street School in Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't ever felt a challenge like this before,'' Miss
Monteiro said on the way to her final presentation on fractals at
Washington College, near Chester River in Maryland. ``I see math
differently now _ it's come alive, almost like music,'' she said,
also marveling that ``grass was everywhere when we went outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Monteiro was plucked from the inner city by the Geraldine
R. Dodge Foundation to join some of the nation's highest achieving
junior high school scholars at Johns Hopkins University's Institute
for the Academic Advancement of Youth, where for up to six weeks
students with stratospheric College Board scores immerse themselves
in everything from calculus to Renaissance art at one of a dozen
campuses nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, which celebrates its 20th anniversary in October,
draws top students from 25 states and 36 countries. More than 8,000
students, 70 percent of them from public schools, take part in the
summer residential program, at which seventh- through 10th-graders
compress a full high school or college course into a three-week
session. Some students master two courses. This year, in response
to criticism of its low black and Hispanic participation _ about 2
percent _ the institute stepped up its search for academic talent
in underrepresented urban areas, particularly school districts in
Newark, N.J., and Brooklyn. Sixty-five New York-area participants,
including Stephanie Monteiro, were awarded full scholarships. The
average income of the families was under $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set our sights on Newark and Brooklyn because of the high
probability that this area would contain a large group of
underserved students,'' said Stephen L. Gessner, the institute's
director of programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, based in Morristown, N.J.,
has contributed about $300,000 over the last two years to find and
foster gifted students, and the institute waives $500,000 in fees
and tuition annually to reach capable students with limited means.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are pioneers in more ways than one,'' said Ann
Wilson, gifted and talented coordinator for the Newark Public
School District.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 21 Newark students in the program in August, it
was their first experience away from home. Adjusting to dormitory
life and enduring the rigors of a year's curriculum crammed into
several weeks is all part of the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The institute scouts middle and junior high schools, primarily
in the Northeast and on the West Coast, for students who score
above the 97th percentile on standardized exams like the California
Achievement Tests or Iowa Tests. The students are then invited by
the institute to take the College Board exams.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-graders scoring in the 500-and-up range in either the
verbal or math part of the College Boards _ numbers comparable to
the national average for high school seniors _ are eligible for the
program. Tenth-graders must score close to 700 in the math or
verbal tests, the average score of seniors bound for Ivy League
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   For chemistry and biology students, the laboratories of a
research complex like Johns Hopkins afford opportunities
unavailable even at the finest private schools. Neuroscience
students examine human brains. Budding biologists inject
genetically altered material from luminescent squid into bacteria
and chart the glowing results.
</P>
<P>
   Although weekdays are crammed with seven hours of class,
laboratory and study time, nights and weekends are full of
supervised bedlam _ a kind of ``Doogie Howser'' meets ``Camp
Run-Amok.'' By the end of the term, pizza boxes and soda cans
avalanche from dresser tops, and most students will have danced,
sung and giggled to exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   That bonding experience is often the most precious opportunity
these academically precocious students take away from the
institute.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Cooper, 11, says he often feels like an outcast back home
in Newark, N.J. ``I fit right in this summer,'' he said, ``but
that's not always been the case.''
</P>
<P>
   During his ``writing and imagination'' course at the program's
site at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., he sailed
through much of a college survey syllabus, examining Hemingway's
demons and the philosophical ideas of 19th-century
transcendentalists like Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that in a world of scarce resources, money is
better spent on less able students, presuming that gifted students
will excel no matter what. But educators note that addiction and
failure rates among highly intelligent students exceed the norm,
and may even be higher in urban areas where outlets for their
educational energies are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not just bright kids who get good grades,'' said
Julian C. Stanley, who founded the program in 1979 to expand on his
work with mathematically advanced children. ``They are different,
and they learn differently,'' Stanley said. ``The rapid pace at
which they learn and their capacity to absorb large amounts of
material quickly must be respected. Yet, I'm sad to say, it's
become politically incorrect to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Levin, 15, who attends the American School in London
and studied genetics and neuroscience this summer on the Johns
Hopkins campus, agrees. ``It's exhausting sometimes, whether the
attention is positive from teachers or negative from other kids,
dealing with it takes a lot of work that is just wasted,'' he said.
``When we are here for the summer we can finally converse in our
native language, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Shennen Bersani of Brockton, Mass., believes that the naysayers
misunderstand the special needs of gifted children. She said her
son was shy and withdrawn before he attended the institute two
years ago. ``He came back very social and confident, so much so he
was auditioning for plays and musicals,'' Ms. Bersani said.
</P>
<P>
   With costs for each of the two three-week sessions at about
$2,500, some parents also look to the institute and similar
programs at Duke University and Northwestern for a competitive edge
to the Ivy League. Some see these programs as pressure cookers into
which aggressive parents push their already stressed children.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley takes issue with that idea. ``You don't push a rolling
bowling ball down the hill, you just get out of its way,'' he said.
``These kids come because they want to, and they thrive.''

RUSSIAN CORRUPTION LEADS TO QUESTIONS FOR WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, pressed by
investigations into money laundering and capital flight out of
Russia, is being forced anew to justify its policies of bold
economic assistance to Moscow over the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   This time the reassessment has raised questions of what the
administration knew about Russian corruption and what should have
been done differently, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some figures inside the administration, as well as outside
critics, said that the indications of corruption were put aside to
ensure President Boris Yeltsin's support for American national
security interests, including the safekeeping of Russia's nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   These officials also assert that the administration played down
what it knew about corruption at the top levels of the Russian
government and chose instead to trumpet success stories as the
country limped toward a free-market system.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, when the administration asked Congress for $18
billion in new contributions for the International Monetary Fund at
a time when the fund was considering increasing its loan program to
Russia, the administration knew about the problem of corruption in
Russia but was reluctant to talk about it on Capitol Hill,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who through his close
relationship with President Clinton is considered the architect of
much of the Russia policy, said in an interview: ``There are
legitimate questions about how much and by what mechanisms the
money left Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that one of the consequences of money's being
secreted out of the country was the impoverishment of many of the
Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   A former American diplomat who served in Moscow until recently
said that the administration failed to consistently criticize the
corruption for fear that doing so would jeopardize Russian
cooperation on national security interests, including Russian
behavior toward Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of explaining this trade-off, he said the administration
tried to oversell the ``success'' of Russian reform and the
``partnership'' relationship that Treasury Department officials and
others boasted about.
</P>
<P>
   An administration economist said his agency was often asked by
the State Department for success stories in Russia that could be
cited to Congress and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Clinton policy was the decision to help
Russia, through loans from the IMF and other sources, to lift
itself out of communism and privatize the economy as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   When a handful of Russians emerged almost overnight as the newly
rich owners of major natural resources and industrial enterprises _
some of them by questionable means _ they were acceptable to the
Clinton administration because they largely backed Yeltsin against
the threat of a Communist comeback.
</P>
<P>
   With the assistance of campaign contributions from these
so-called oligrachs, some of whom are now under investigation in
the West, Yeltsin was victorious in 1996 over a Communist
candidate, Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   The United States recognized the assistance the oligarchs
provided in re-electing Yeltsin, a senior administration
policymaker said, but chose to de-emphasize their dark side and
their maneuvers intended to strip the country of many of its
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of reluctance to face the corruption
problem, Vice President Gore was shown evidence by the Central
Intelligence Agency in 1995 of what it considered the personal
corruption of Russia's prime minister at the time, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, with whom Gore chaired a joint American-Russian
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials said late last year that Gore rejected
their report, a move that these analysts said led them to
understand that Gore was not interested in any further information
on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   One official who worked on economic reform in Russia said that
as it became clear that the IMF's conditions for macro-economic
reforms were not working, it also became clear that efforts by the
Clinton administration to introduce micro-reforms were not working
either.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that the
Central Bank lied to the IMF in 1996 about the level of its foreign
exchange reserves to encourage the fund to continue lending to the
country. The report said that the Central Bank channeled assets
through Fimaco, a company based in the Channel Island tax haven of
Jersey. The first deputy managing direct of the fund, Stanley
Fischer, said after the audit was released that the Central Bank
reserves had been overstated by $1.2 billion in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since the release of the report, several administration
officials said that there was now a serious question of trust with
senior Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   In another reform effort that went awry, Washington tried to
help Russia develop a Russian money-laundering law. Again, experts
from the Comptroller of the Currency and the FBI were sent to
Moscow. They worked on a bill intended to enable prosecutors to
investigate money laundering. The legislation passed the Duma twice
but was twice vetoed by Yeltsin, most recently in July.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the administration had expressed its disappointment
about Yeltsin's veto, Talbott said: ``We did the obvious.'' But he
said he could not provide the details. Talbott asked one of his
deputies, Stephen Sestanovich, ambassador at large for the Newly
Independent States, to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Sestanovich said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had
urged Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to restart the process
of getting the bill enacted. Administration officials have
acknowledged in the past that Ivanov has little influence with
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   As it became clear in 1998 that the Russian government was not
getting the necessary tax revenue, the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission
was used by the administration as a vehicle for trying to deal with
corruption, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An official knowledgeable with the workings of the commission
said that Gore's people raised the corruption issue in 1998 but
could not find any interlocuters in Russia with whom they could
regularly follow up. This effort, too, frittered away, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as the State and Treasury departments and the
National Security Council reviewed yet again their Russia policy,
one irony was already apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The jettisoning of the money-laundering bill by Yeltsin meant
that there is no serious money-laundering law. Thus, American
law-enforcement officials investigating money flowing through the
Bank of New York will not have a legal basis on which to work with
Russian law-enforcement agencies, officials said.

FEDERAL AGENCIES SUGGEST INDEPENDENT HEAD FOR WACO INVESTIGATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to head off any impression of a conflict of
interest, Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis J.
Freeh are strongly leaning toward an outside investigation into
their agencies' failure to disclose the use of incendiary devices
at the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian compound, officials said
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh wholeheartedly backs an inquiry without involvement of the
FBI, a bureau spokesman, Tron Brekke, said Tuesday evening. ``We
would welcome a qualified group of independent investigators to do
that,'' Brekke said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Justice Department official said Reno too had all but
decided that an exhaustive inquiry with total independence is the
best way to find out why the use of the incendiary devices _
heat-generating tear-gas canisters _ during the April 19, 1993,
federal assault on the compound near Waco, Texas, had gone
unacknowledged for six years.
</P>
<P>
   The recent disclosure that two such incendiary tear-gas devices
had been used at Waco _ albeit without success and a good six hours
before flames consumed the cult's compound _ has caused the bureau
and the Justice Department acute embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Reno conceded last week that the disclosure, coming after six
years of statements to the contrary, had caused her to lose
credibility. Officials at the Justice Department and the bureau
have worried aloud that the backtracking would provide grist for
anti-government extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Another signal that the 1993 raid, which ended in about 80
deaths, including that of the cult's leader David Koresh, is still
an explosive issue in Washington was a statement Tuesday night that
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, is weighing a proposal to create a joint House-Senate
commission to delve into the episode.

PLANNED FRENCH MERGER LIFTS MOST EUROPEAN RETAIL STOCKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The planned merger of the French retailers Carrefour SA
and Promodes SA sent shares of other leading European food
retailers sharply higher Tuesday as investors and analysts wagered
on the companies' chances of merging or being acquired. Fourteen of
the 20 largest publicly traded retail stocks surged amid rumor
after rumor that a show-stopping deal was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The Carrefour-Promodes combination is the second big retail
merger in Europe this summer, a deal seen by analysts as a
defensive move against an aggressive push into Europe by Wal-Mart
Stores. In June, Wal-Mart bought Asda Group, Britain's
third-largest supermarket chain, adding to purchases in two other
European retailers, Wertkauf and 74 stores of Spar Handels AG.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the merger might signal the beginning of a
spate of pan-European mergers as retailers try to stave off a
takeover or fail to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a trigger-pulling deal,'' said Miriam Shea,
a food retail analyst with J.P. Morgan here. ``The reality is that
now everyone has to think about doing a deal.'' Ms. Shea said the
merger might make it too hard for companies to stand alone and
compete on price because the bigger companies ``will be able to
strong-arm suppliers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among possible takeover targets, speculation is rampant that
Britain's big three food retailers _ Tesco PLC, J. Sainsbury PLC
and Safeway PLC _ may be ripe for takeovers. Possible deals for the
Dutch supermarket giant Royal Ahold and the German food retailer
Metro have also been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major European food retailer is being assessed
because most European retailers trade at significantly lower
price-to-earnings multiples than what the Carrefour-Promodes deal
values the two companies. Promodes, the smaller of the two, was
valued at 19.5 times its earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization based on Salomon Smith Barney
estimates for 1999, while most of the other European retailers
trade at 9 to 14 times their estimated value.
</P>
<P>
   Several bankers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
that almost every European retailer had ``picked up the phone'' to
talk to one another as the companies try to formulate strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the bankers said a deal was imminent, a thought
echoed by many analysts, who said they thought the market
overreacted Tuesday. Some called it simply a knee-jerk reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a bit wrong on the timing,'' Ms. Shea said, and
adding, ``It's nonsense to think that there is a possibility for
value creation as big.'' Most analysts said that even Wal-Mart
could not create such value in any one deal. Any chance of a
last-minute hostile bid from Wal-Mart to thwart the
Carrefour-Promodes deal seems small, despite the ascent of the
shares of both companies Tuesday on hopes that it might.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult for Wal-Mart to come between Carrefour
and Promodes,'' Ms. Shea said. The two companies are merging to
protect themselves from a potential takeover by Wal-Mart, she said,
and a hostile bid in the retail industry, ``a business based on
people and relationships, is a hard thing to do.''

JUDGE RULES CONTENT OF SPEECHES CANNOT BE USED TO PREVENT HARLEM
RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Khallid Abdul
Muhammad, the leader of the New Black Panther Party, may hold a
youth rally in Harlem on Saturday, saying that city officials had
no right to use the content of Muhammad's inflammatory speeches as
a basis for denying him a rally permit.
</P>
<P>
   In his 31-page decision ordering the city to grant the permit,
U.S. District Judge Judge Denny Chin said it was ``understandable''
that the city would seek to deny Muhammad a platform, given the
``hateful, violent and frightening'' nature of many speeches by him
and other organizers of the rally, called the Million Youth March.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least as frightening as the rhetoric of Muhammad is the
possibility of a society where the right to speak publicly can be
denied on the basis of administrative whim, personal dislike, or
disapproval of anticipated content,'' Chin wrote in a clear rebuke
to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose comments about Muhammad have
ranged from scorn to ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even hateful, racist and offensive speech,'' Chin added, ``is
entitled to First Amendment protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Brooklyn on Tuesday night, Giuliani
angrily denounced the judge's decision as a ``distortion of
reasoning'' and ``totally unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example,'' he said, ``of a judge putting his head
in the sand and somehow being so overwhelmed with the inability to
make a distinction between a proper First Amendment demonstration
and an excuse for violence that he really just can't see the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city immediately appealed the decision to the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, which set arguments
for 9 a.m. Wednesday. But the march organizers celebrated the
ruling, one of several over the last year in which judges have
chided city officials for refusing to grant rally permits to the
Million Youth March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Chin is our brother,'' said Malik Shabazz, a lawyer for
the march.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tuesday's ruling was not a complete victory for the march
organizers. Chin rejected Muhammad's request for a parade to the
site of the rally, scheduled to take place on Saturday afternoon at
the intersection of 118th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined to order city officials to use fewer police
officers than the several thousand who were assigned to last year's
rally, a four-hour event that ended in bloody clashes between
hundreds of participants and platoons of officers in riot gear who
moved in swiftly to enforce a 4 p.m. deadline to end the rally.
</P>
<P>
   With ``two final observations,'' Chin made it plain that he
disapproved of each side's conduct last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``First,'' he wrote, ``the violence that occurred last year
cannot be repeated, and both sides should make every effort to
reduce hostilities. Second, excessive numbers of police officers in
riot gear, rigid enforcement of deadlines, and helicopters swooping
over the crowd can only increase, rather than lessen, tension.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that videotapes of last year's rally, which was also
held on the first Saturday in September, left him ``with the
disquieting impression'' that if the Police Department ``had simply
been patient and given the participants a few minutes to disperse,
the risk of violence would have been substantially reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and other city officials have long contended that
Muhammad incited the violence when, for example, he instructed
rally participants that ``if anyone attacks you, already decide who
will be the one to disconnect the railing where you are and beat
the hell out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the City Corporation Counsel, Michael D. Hess, argued
that these words _ and a slew of equally provocative statements _
constituted ``fighting words'' unworthy of First Amendment
protection. The possibility that Muhammad would make similar
remarks at this year's rally, Hess said, was more than enough
reason for the city to deny a rally permit.
</P>
<P>
   Chin firmly rejected this assertion. First of all, he said, he
did not agree that Muhammad's speech contained fighting words _
that is, words that ``by their very utterance inflict injury or
tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.'' He noted that
Muhammad, the former spokesman of the Nation of Islam, who
routinely refers to Jews as bloodsuckers and whites as devils, was
careful to call for violent resistance only as a means of
self-defense in the face of an attack by the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the contrary,'' he wrote, ``one of the videotapes shows
that at the time the conflict broke out, Muhammad was telling the
demonstrators to `go home to (their) families,' to `go in the word
love,' to `go in the word peace,' and that the crowd had already
begun to disperse. Indeed, the words that the city contends are
undeserving of First Amendment protection had actually been uttered
at some time before the disturbance broke out.''
</P>
<P>
   But even assuming that Muhammad's speech last year incited
violence, that still would not be a proper basis for denying a
permit now, Chin ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `fighting words' doctrine has not been used as a basis for
justifying a `prior restraint' on future speech, and to deny
plaintiff a permit this year based on comments made by the speakers
at last year's rally would constitute an unlawful prior restraint
on speech,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Muhammad has often compared himself to Malcolm X,
another Nation of Islam outcast who rose to national prominence by
insisting upon the right of black people to violently resist white
oppression. Last week, when asked why many black politicians in
Harlem were calling on residents to boycott his march, Muhammad
again linked himself to Malcolm X, saying Malcolm X was also
shunned by ``bootlicking, Uncle Tom'' black politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Chin ordered city officials and march organizers to ``promptly
meet'' to discuss the specifics of the rally, and ``to agree on
measures to avoid the confrontation that occurred last year.'' But
at a news conference Tuesday, Hess said he did not see any purpose
in meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything more to sit down and talk about
at all,'' Hess said. Nor, he said, would the city commit to
reducing the police presence at this year's rally, saying in a
defiant manner, ``The Police Department will do what it sees fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rally leaders have complained bitterly _ and with some merit,
Chin said _ about the Police Department's decision last year to
clear the rally area a few minutes after their permit expired at 4
p.m. Under questioning by Chin, city officials had been unable to
cite a single other rally or parade that was subjected to such a
strict standard.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with Chin's admonition for both parties to be reasonable,
Shabazz and other lawyers for the march again pressed city
officials to be more flexible about this year's event. But Hess
said that if the city loses its appeal, it will not grant a minute
more than the four hours alloted to the Million Youth March under
Chin's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a four-hour event, and that's all it will be,'' he
said.

DOLLAR SLIDES AS ECONOMIES IN EUROPE AND ASIA STRENGTHEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan)  (js) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. dollar has begun to slide against the Japanese yen and
the 11-nation euro as investors turn their attention to rebounding
economies in Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar fell Tuesday below 110 yen, the second time it has
done so since 1996. In January, it briefly pierced that level
before rebounding. Against the euro, which made its debut in
January as Europe's single currency, the dollar is falling after a
15 percent gain in a rally that ended in July.
</P>
<P>
   Though the U.S. economy continues to expand, growth slowed in
the second quarter. And investors now expect higher interest rates
to prove a further drag on it this year. Meanwhile, Asian
economies, many of which fell into recession after the currency
turmoil of 1997, show signs of life, as does Europe. So the
potential for growth in the near term may be just as good or better
outside the United States, investors reason, causing dollars to
flow out of the country and into foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past year or so the dollar has leveled off, and we
are in an environment now in which the dollar should start a
moderate slide,'' said James McCormick, currency strategist at J.P.
Morgan Securities. ``It's not a question of a weaker dollar. It's a
stronger rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick said he expects the dollar to fall about 5.6 percent
against the euro to $1.12 by the end of the year while the yen
could move to 105, a decline of 4.2 percent from current levels.
</P>
<P>
   A weaker dollar means prices of imported goods, from televisions
to toys, will rise, increasing inflationary pressures. It also
makes travel abroad more expensive for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are not worried about this impact because the
falling dollar will also have positive effects. At the same time, a
weakening dollar will make U.S. goods more competitive abroad,
which could aid economic growth here and help America's
manufacturers recover from a slump induced by the global financial
crisis that began two years ago in July. More exports, combined
with a slowdown in imports, would also help reduce the country's
ballooning trade deficit, which set a record in June.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this weakening of the dollar is a policy problem for the
Clinton administration is not clear yet. The former treasury
secretary, Robert E. Rubin, had supported a strong dollar, in part
because it helped restrain inflation. His successor, Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, says he is supportive of that policy
but some analysts wonder how committed he is to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve will also be looking at the dollar because
its weakness could add to inflationary pressures. But other
factors, including consumer spending that is being fed by a strong
stock market and gains in home values, are a bigger concern. The
central bank traditionally has paid close attention to the dollar
only if it is considered to be drastically out of line with where
it should be or if it moves so fast as to destabilize other
financial markets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The big move against the dollar this year has come from the
Japanese yen, which is up 11.8 percent since early July. In trading
Tuesday, the yen finished at 109.59 to the dollar, up from 110.73
Monday. (When the dollar losses value it buys less foreign
currency.) The last time it was below 110 was on Jan. 11, at
108.89.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the move this year has been caused by the rush of
foreign investors into Japanese stocks as they bet that a
turnaround in the Japanese economy will improve corporate
performance and push that moribund stock market higher. McCormick
said that so far this year foreigners have made about $54 billion
in net purchases of Japanese stocks, compared with $17 billion in
all of 1998. To buy the stock, foreigners have to sell their local
currency and buy yen, pushing up its value.
</P>
<P>
   Though the weakening dollar may not be a major problem for the
United States, economists say it could become one for Japan. As the
yen strengthens, Japanese goods become more costly abroad. And if
this cuts into sales by Japanese companies, the long-sought
economic recovery could run into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Japan tried to slow the rise of the yen by
intervening in the currency market to sell yen six times in June
and July. But suddenly last month, Japanese officials indicated
that they were abandoning this policy, at least for now. The policy
shift opened the door for the yen to move below 110.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the government relented is that intervention, without
the participation of the United States, is unlikely to work. In
addition, Japanese officials are hoping that their economy is on
the rebound, which would make the rise in the yen less worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   The test of that economy will come on Sept. 10, when the
Japanese government releases data on growth for the quarter ended
in August. If the data are strong enough to confirm that the
recovery signaled in the first quarter is continuing, worries about
the rally in the yen could subside. Comments from Japanese
officials Tuesday indicated that the growth outlook is still
positive.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the yen is below 110, currency traders will be on
the lookout for any sign that Japanese policy makers are ready to
intervene again. Investors are showing some signs of concern too,
as the stock market rally has stalled.
</P>
<P>
   The euro rose Tuesday to a value of $1.0578, from $1.0471
Monday. Since mid-July, when there were the first sure signs of a
turnaround in the German economy, the euro has risen 4.4 percent.
Yet it is still down 9.3 percent against the dollar for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The relative strength of the dollar against the euro and some
other major currencies suggest that there is no serious dollar
swoon in the making now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Federal Reserve's vigilance against inflation is not
helping the dollar. By moving to raise short-term interest rates,
the Fed aims to slow growth here before the economy overheats to
the point that prices and wages spiral upward. While higher
interest rates can sometimes support a currency, they are negative
for the dollar in this case because investors are betting that a
slowdown here will make U.S. investments a little less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a further rate increase by the Fed when it meets
in October along with comments about rising asset prices made last
Friday by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, also put downward
pressure on stock prices this week as foreign investors fled the
market and hence the currency.

BACK PAIN FORCES SAMPRAS TO WITHDRAW FROM U.S. OPEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A devastated Pete Sampras, unshaved, unhappy and
unable to make sense of the stabbing pain that settled into his
lower back during a Sunday morning practice, announced his
withdrawal from the U.S. Open Tuesday because of a herniated disk
in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Sampras, a four-time Open champion who came into
this event poised not only to tie Jimmy Connors' record of five
Open victories but also to pass Roy Emerson's career Grand Slam
title record of 12, seemed stunned that his history-making mission
had been canceled by an injury he termed ``kind of a fluke thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm obviously very overwhelmed; the way that I'd
been playing the last two months, I liked my chances here,'' said
Sampras, who tied Emerson's record in July by capturing his sixth
Wimbledon crown, compiled a 24-match undefeated streak over the
summer and came into this Open with heady expectations. But he
never got to play a match. ``I'm not saying I was going to win here
or whatever. But to break the all-time record was a dream that I
had, to do it here in New York. As competitive as I am, I was
hoping to do it here, but it's obviously not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said he planned to fly home to Los Angeles right away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disk problem, which requires rest and rehabilitation
treatments twice a day, will keep him off the circuit for six to
eight weeks, an absence that will inevitably cost him the year-end
No. 1 ranking he has held for a record six years.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras was more concerned that his plans for the Open, the
tournament where he made history at 19 by defeating Andre Agassi in
the 1990 final to become the youngest male champion, dissolved
before this campaign, his 12th consecutive appearance at the Open,
even began.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras skipped this year's Australian Open to concentrate on
solving the French Open (the only Grand Slam event he hasn't won),
kept his Wimbledon title a third straight year and ended his Grand
Slam season with his first Open title since 1996, said: ``I'm sure
these next two weeks will be tough emotionally because I want to be
here,'' he said. ``I've been part of the U.S. Open for every year
of my career, and there's no question I'm going to miss playing
here.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who hadn't withdrawn from a Grand Slam tournament since
the 1992 Australia Open because of a shoulder injury and who had no
history of problems with his vertebrae, added: ``I couldn't think
of a worse time for this to happen. I've never had serious back
problems like this one; I've had chronic stuff, and if it was
chronic I'd play tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   He won Wimbledon six years ago despite a shoulder so sore he had
trouble lifting his toothbrush.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Californian sustained the back injury one game
into a friendly Sunday practice session with fifth-seeded Gustavo
Kuerten of Brazil. ``It was on a return of serve,'' Sampras said.
``I didn't hear anything, but I felt something go. I felt my back
just got, you know, stabbed by a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said he went straight to his changeover chair, told
Kuerten he needed to quit, and asked his coach, Paul Annacone, to
find a doctor for him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Hainline, the U.S.Open medical director, initially
dismissed the injury as a minor back strain when he examined
Sampras at the National Tennis Center that same day. But when the
worried Sampras continued to experience overnight discomfort, the
physician reconsidered and scheduled the player for a CAT scan and
magnetic resonance imaging examination on Monday. The results,
Hainline said, showed an injury that, while not career-threatening,
would have posed the danger of chronic future pain had Sampras
tried to play here at his usual level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate in being able to diagnose the herniated disk
very early, before it became anything serious,'' said Hainline, who
located the disk tear between the fifth lumbar vertebrae and the
sacrum. ``When we look at his mri, his disks look very healthy.
There's a very focal tear right in the center; it's not pressing on
any nerves. It's just pressing on a pain-sensitive ligament. It's
really about a month of rest, and then the proper rehabilitation,
then it should heal completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the prognosis was positive, the timing of the injury
was puzzling for Sampras, a believer in destiny. ``It wasn't from
overplaying,'' he said. ``It wasn't from overstress. It was just a
bad move at the wrong time. Everything happens for a reason; these
last couple days I've been trying to figure out that reason.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the last three days had been tough to endure, ``the
worrying about not playing and the stress, then finally getting
some tests done on it. That was the last straw that said, `That's
it. It's over.'''
</P>
<P>
   Annacone said: ``More than anything, he's pretty crushed by
this. He really wanted it to happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' withdrawal stunned the rest of the field, which
suddenly lost its heavy favorite. Even Patrick Rafter, the Open's
two-time defending champion, had referred to Sampras as the man to
beat. Sampras' loss was Mikael Tillstrom's gain. Thursday, the
130th-ranked Swede will face Russia's Marat Safin in the first
round, replacing Sampras in the draw. Kuerten, like Rafter a
possible semifinal opponent for Sampras in the original draw, said
the injury was ``sad for him because he was playing great, but
maybe it's easier for us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi, seeded second and Sampras' victim in two Open
finals (and most recently losing to him in this year's Wimbledon
final), learned the news from his coach, Brad Gilbert, who was
sitting in the tournament director Jay Snyder's office when Sampras
called and confirmed his withdrawal. Agassi then called Sampras to
commiserate, a gesture Sampras called classy.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, whose chances for winning this tournament have now risen
abruptly, said: ``It's sad. It's too bad. It really is. It's tough
for so many people, the fans, myself and ultimately for Pete.''

 &HT;    Cruel killing and careful paperwork
 &HT;    By Alan Judd, Lyda Longa and Jay Croft
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About five hours before embarking on the worst murder
spree in Georgia history, Mark O. Barton conducted one last bit of
macabre business: He changed his will to provide a burial place for
his children, whom he had killed the previous night.
</P>
<P>
   The account of Barton's final morning were among the details
that emerged Tuesday when Atlanta police reluctantly released a
report of their investigation into the nine slayings that the
disgruntled day trader committed before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   The 208-page police file, provided to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution after a lengthy debate over whether it is a
public record, describes the shootings at Momentum Securities Inc.
and All-Tech Investment Group Inc., the two brokerages where Barton
had traded since early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The file includes sketches of both offices after the shootings
and statements made by witnesses, victims and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   It also reveals that police officers discovered several capsules
of the anti-depressant drug Prozac in Barton's car after he
committed suicide, that he carried a stun gun along with other
weapons and that a handcuff key dangled from the key chain in his
car's ignition when he committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in his will provided the most dramatic new
information in the report, however, demonstrating an orderliness in
Barton's life hours before he threw Atlanta into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, July 26, three days before the shootings, Barton went
to his lawyer in Douglasville, Joseph Fowler, to remove his wife,
Leigh Ann, as the beneficiary of his estate, the attorney told
police. Instead, all Barton's property would go to his children,
Matthew and Michelle.
</P>
<P>
   Barton indicated to Fowler that his day trading activities were
causing problems between him and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did mention that day, when I asked how he was doing, that
he had lost money in trading,'' Fowler told the police. ``I don't
know a lot about that, but he did say that his wife was concerned
about the loss of the money. I did the will, he signed it, and
left.''
</P>
<P>
   The following night, Tuesday, according to police reports,
Barton killed his wife in their Henry County apartment. Then on
Wednesday, he killed his children.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Thursday, July 29, Barton called Fowler from
his car phone about 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe, you left something out,'' Barton told Fowler, the
attorney recalled during an interview Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later, Barton arrived at Fowler's office in
Douglasville and said he wanted to make two changes: He wanted his
mother, not his children, to be his beneficiary, and he wanted to
make sure his children would be buried in Douglas County with their
mother, Debra, who was murdered in Alabama in 1993. Barton had been
the prime suspect in Debra's murder, but he was never charged.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a ``relatively unusual provision,'' Barton's
request to provide a burial place for his children ``did not strike
me as being unusual or out of order'' since their mother was
deceased, Fowler said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you ask a question,'' he said, ``but it's not that
big of a question.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Fowler said, he noticed nothing unusual about Barton's
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to my staff and myself that Mr. Barton was fully
aware of what he wanted to do with respect to the relatively minor
change he made,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, he said, Barton's wishes will be followed. His
children were buried where he wanted, and his mother, Gladys
Barton, 76, of Sumter, S.C., is named as the beneficiary of his
estate.

$6.75 MILLION MANSION AWAITS JAILED UKRAINIAN OWNER

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in a state familiar with jaw-dropping displays of wealth, a
mansion set on 18 acres in northern California, is opulent. Once
occupied by the Hollywood star Eddie Murphy, the property in Marin
County boasts two helicopter landing pads, five dog kennels, a
barn-sized ballroom, granite floors inlaid with brass, and
gold-plated doorknobs. It was sold last September for $6.75 million
_ in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The estate's owner is a former Ukrainian prime minister, Pavlo
Lazarenko, who ensconced his wife and children in the 41-room
mansion late last year. But Lazarenko has been unable to join his
family. Federal authorities are detaining him while they consider
requests from Switzerland and Ukraine that he be extradited on
charges of embezzling state funds and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   As federal investigators examine the filtering of billions of
dollars through the Bank of New York from Russia, there is
increased concern in the West that ill-gotten gains from the former
Soviet Union are infiltrating the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent press release Lazarenko denied charges that he
looted money from Ukraine. He said he was a victim of political
intrigue back home where, not surprisingly, his personal wealth has
become an issue. Hardly a thief, Lazarenko is ``fighting to bring
about gradual reform leading to an improved economic climate in his
native country,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But questions have also arisen about how Lazarenko's own
economic position has improved. As a political official who
traversed the line between public authority and private deal
making, Lazarenko made money buying and selling natural gas
contracts when he was energy minister, U.S. authorities say. As
prime minister, he may have pocketed millions of dollars from state
programs, according to Ukrainian and Swiss authorities. In fact,
his wealth led to a falling out with the Ukraine president.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko declined to be interviewed. Michael Handwerker, an
attorney representing Lazarenko, said that his client contests the
charges against him in Europe and dismissed them as politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my position that this is a political witch hunt being
orchestrated by the political powers that be in the Ukraine,'' said
Handwerker. He declined further comment, but Lazarenko has said in
the past that he fears for his life if he is sent back to face
charges in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of Communism, Ukraine, Russia and other former
Soviet Union countries, many of which still share close economic
and political ties, embraced capitalism with a raft of
privatizations, foreign investment and a speculative frenzy that
came to a screeching halt with the financial crisis in Russia last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In Ukraine and in neighboring countries, there were few legal or
regulatory constraints on those with the financial or political
clout to reap the rewards of the rush to capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the industrial sectors that mean anything in Ukraine you
will see many of the same problems as in Russia,'' said a U.S.
government official based in the Ukraine who requested anonymity.
``There's a lot of room for manipulation and diversion of
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko's wealth and power were growing so briskly during 1996
and 1997, his two years as prime minister, that it sparked a rift
with President Leonid Kuchma, who dismissed Lazarenko from his
influential post.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko subsequently formed an opposition party and planned to
run for the presidency until he suddenly fled the country late last
year, only days before prosecutors there charged him with
embezzling and misusing millions of dollars in government funds as
part of a long-running corruption scheme. Before he fled, he told
parliament in a written statement that he was going to Greece for
treatment of a stress-related heart ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Swiss government arrested Lazarenko at the
border when he tried enter on a Panamanian passport and charged him
with laundering millions of dollars through numbered bank accounts
in Switzerland. He was freed on $2.6 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   He turned up in the United States in February, and was taken
into federal custody in Queens after he arrived at Kennedy
International Airport and was judged to have an invalid visa. He
has not been charged with any crime in the United States and, at
his request, federal authorities transported him to California so
he could be near his family while awaiting a court decision on the
extradition request.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of the charges in Ukraine, Lazarenko's
California mansion offers proof that his financial wherewithal
outstrips typical government employees. The multimillion-dollar
estate was purchased last September by a Sausalito, Calif.,
company, Dugsbery Inc., according to real estate records. But U.S.
law enforcement officials said the real buyer is Lazarenko, who
awaits his fate in a Dublin, Calif., detention center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazarenko has definitely diverted a lot of dollars and whether
or not it was billions, it shows you what is possible in Ukraine,''
said the U.S. government official based there.

AIDS RATE 5 TIMES HIGHER IN U.S. PRISONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prevalence of AIDS among prisoners in the United States is
five times that of the general population, and the rates for some
other sexually transmitted disease are even higher, scientists said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on the first comprehensive study of these diseases in
prisons and jails, the lead author, Dr. Theodore Hammett, said the
high prevalence of AIDS among prisoners reflects their widespread
use of drugs before they were imprisoned. He presented the findings
Tuesday at the National HIV Prevention Conference in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Prisons are a critical setting for detecting and treating
sexually transmitted diseases, Hammett said, but the quality of
health care varies widely. About 90 percent of the prisons and
jails say they make the newer combinations of anti-HIV drugs
available, but not necessarily to all inmates, Hammett said.
</P>
<P>
   The high rates of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis,
gonorrhea and chlamydia are particularly alarming, participants
said, because they are adding fuel to the continuing epidemic of
HIV, the AIDS virus. Syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia cause
inflammation and sores that allow more HIV to concentrate in
genital secretions and thus greatly increase the risk of acquiring
and transmitting HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, recent increases in sexually transmitted diseases
signal an increase in HIV because such infections are an indicator
of unsafe sexual practices. On Monday, health officials released
new studies finding that AIDS deaths are no longer declining as
sharply as in recent years and that the rate of infection does not
appear to be declining at all.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings on AIDS in prison highlight not only
inadequacies in prison health care but also the importance of
preventing transmission of the infections after the prisoners
return to the community. Only 10 percent of state and federal
prisons and 5 percent of city and county jails offer comprehensive
HIV prevention programs for inmates, Hammett said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 an estimated 8,900 inmates had AIDS, and 35,000 to
47,000 more were infected with HIV, said Hammett, who works for Abt
Associates, a private research and consulting firm in Cambridge,
Mass. Hammett conducted the study for the National Commission on
Correctional Health Care, a private organization in Chicago that
aims to improve health care in correctional facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials do not know for certain how much HIV is
transmitted in prisons. Although the total prison population is
less than 2 million on any given day, 7.75 million people are
released from jails and prisons during a single year, Hammett said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 907 inmates in state prisons died from AIDS,
representing 29 percent of all deaths in such institutions. Hammett
did not report the number of AIDS deaths in federal prisons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, an estimated 300,000 prisoners had the liver infection
hepatitis C, a prevalence nine times the general population and
nearly one-third of all people infected with hepatitis C in this
country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other studies reported at the meeting in Atlanta suggested
another reason for concern about HIV: that many gay men no longer
view the virus as serious. Newer combinations of anti-HIV drugs
that have given infected people a new lease on life are creating
complacency and a false sense of security because many equate the
new therapies with cures. Others erroneously believe that because
the virus cannot be detected in their blood they cannot transmit
HIV. As a result, many are abandoning safe sex practices, acquiring
sexually transmitted diseases and increasing transmission of HIV,
participants said.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 416 gay men in West Hollywood, Calif., Dr. Sheila
Murphy's team at the University of Southern California found that
the more optimistic the men were about newer anti-HIV drugs known
as protease inhibitors, the less likely they were to use condoms
during anal sex, abstain from anal sex or limit their number of sex
partners.
</P>
<P>
   HIV-infected men who were optimistic about the ability of such
drugs to prevent HIV transmission used condoms 66 percent of the
time they had sex, compared with 80 percent for HIV-infected
respondents who were not optimistic about the therapies. Optimistic
infected men were also less likely to be monogamous.
</P>
<P>
   Although gonorrhea and syphilis are at record lows nationally,
they are on the rise in some communities of gay and bisexual men,
health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kim Fox's team from the CDC, which tracked gonorrhea in
sexually transmitted disease clinics in 26 cities, reported that
gonorrhea cases among gay men tripled over the last decade, rising
to 12 percent in 1998 from 4 percent in 1988.

VENEZUELA'S PRESIDENT PUTS ALLY IN CHARGE OF OIL COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 8th graf, Since its election ... to clarify, election
was in July.) 
 (smw) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ President Hugo Chavez moved to solidify his
control over the powerful state-run oil monopoly Tuesday by naming
an ally as the company's new chief.
</P>
<P>
   The previous leader had resigned Monday, saying that an internal
dispute had made it impossible for him to stay at Petroleos de
Venezuela, which controls the largest reserves of oil outside the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez appointed Hector Ciavaldini to head the company, saying
the move would correct ``the erroneous policy of the previous
government.'' He said he would announce other ``small changes at
the board level'' soon.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate for president last year, Chavez, a former army
colonel who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt, criticized
PDVSA, as the company is known here, as an uncontrollable ``state
within the state.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to eliminate its extravagant ``gold-card culture,'' to
cut production to help drive prices up and to seek closer ties with
other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a process of integrating PDVSA within the economic and
political model of Venezuela,'' Chavez said Tuesday. ``We are going
to strengthen OPEC,'' he also promised, referring to a meeting here
last weekend in which the Venezuelan, Saudi and Mexican oil
ministers resolved to continue production cuts into next year.
Prices of Venezuelan oil have risen from $7 to more than $17 a
barrel since Chavez took office in February.
</P>
<P>
   Ciavaldini takes over from Roberto Mandini, an industry veteran
who led the company for less than seven months. Company officials
said his departure grew out of a dispute over management and
production policies. But it took place at a moment of political and
constitutional crisis that has raised questions about the future of
democracy in this nation of 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Since its election in July, a constitutional assembly dominated
by supporters of Chavez has taken over the court system and
stripped Congress of its power to pass laws. Leaders of the panel
said Tuesday that within days they would begin debate on a related
proposal to declare an emergency giving them authority to dismiss
the governors of Venezuela's 23 states and hundreds of mayors.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped statement shown to employees on Monday and
broadcast on national television Tuesday, Mandini said that his
decision to step down had nothing to do with any discrepancy with
the government over strategy or objectives. Rather, he said, he and
other officials whom he did not identify could not agree ``how to
achieve them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have a commercial corporation divided into
factions, because that is something that inevitably leads to
failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent allusion to the populist economic policies
favored by some members of the Chavez administration, Mandini also
warned against regarding the oil company as ``the goose that lays
the golden eggs or a cash cow.''
</P>
<P>
   The company accounts for 80 percent of all the nation's exports
and one-third of government revenues. It is the largest exporter of
oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A group of employees recently issued a manifesto complaining
that ``people committed to revolutionary change have been
threatened with early retirement, dismissal or demotions'' under
Mandini's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these revolutionary times it is necessary to resolutely and
implacably demolish the control and power of the old PDVSA
establishment,'' their document concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Ciavaldini, in contrast, is said to be a close friend of Jorge
Giordani, Chavez's minister of planning, and has clashed with top
management at the company. In 1995, he was fired from his post as
an adviser to a company affiliate, but appealed the decision,
eventually won his job back after a long court case, and in
February was named the company's vice president for planning. He
was appointed, along with three military officers, to its
seven-member board.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the newspaper Economia Hoy published
Tuesday, Virgilio Avila, a former chairman of the Energy Committee
of the Venezuelan Senate who is now a member of the constitutional
assembly, urged the Chavez government to ``prevent the
politicization of PDVSA, as that would cause terrible harm.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez said such fears were misplaced. ``We will respect the
meritocracy'' that has governed promotions within the oil giant, he
promised.
</P>
<P>
   He added that what is taking place is ``the Venezuelanization''
of the company, to ``bring it in tune with new times.''

EXPLOSION IN MOSCOW INJURES 30, PROVOKES FEARS OF TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to delete map note)  (smw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A powerful explosion rocked Moscow's fanciest shopping
center Tuesday night, bringing the threat of terrorism to the foot
of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people were wounded in the underground Manezh shopping
center, a marble and glass showcase of glitzy stores and a popular
gathering place for teenagers and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion coincided with an upsurge in the fighting in
Dagestan and provoked anxious speculation that Islamic militants
might have begun a series of terrorist attacks against the seat of
Russian power. The latest fighting has left eight Russian soldiers
dead and many more wounded, just days after Russia declared victory
over Islamic rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also possible that the blast was the work of a lone
fanatic, the result of gang warfare or perhaps even a pretext to
justify a ``state of emergency'' that would enable the Kremlin to
suspend the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosion and officials
said there had been no warning.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesmen said initially that they did not know what
caused the explosion. But Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said it was
caused by a bomb, containing about five ounces of TNT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that comes to mind is the situation in
Dagestan,'' Luzhkov said Tuesday. ``But a more serious examination
is needed to make an accusation. Tonight we shall find out what
kind of bomb it was.''
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the Kremlin and near Red Square, the Manezh
complex is a favorite hangout for young Muscovites, who go there to
socialize, window shop and eat at its fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The blast took place near a crowded fountain at 7:59 p.m.,
ripping apart a video arcade and sending shards of glass flying
through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Blood was smeared across the floor of a McDonald's restaurant.
Of the nearly 30 people who were wounded, five were reported to be
in grave condition.
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred amid a new wave of fighting in Dagestan.
Tuesday, the Russian military unleashed artillery barrages and air
strikes near the villages of Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi, close to
the Dagestan capital of Makhachkala.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian attacks took place barely a week after Moscow
declared that it had triumphed over Islamic militants who have
crossed into Dagestan from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The raids Tuesday were directed against the Wahhabis, an Islamic
sect in Dagestan that has been sympathetic to the militants. Some
of the militants are even believed to have hidden in Wahhabi
villages.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wahhabis have also been generally content to govern
their own territory, and some specialists said that the attacks
might further inflame the already unstable Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous Russian policy had been to leave the Wahhabis
alone,'' said Dmitri Trenin, deputy director of the Moscow office
of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ``My own feeling
is that the situation will deteriorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian offensive has already been costly. The Russian
military acknowledged Tuesday that eight of its soldiers had been
killed and 31 wounded. Russian officials said 80 ``militants'' had
been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The ORT television network observed dryly Tuesday night that
``the operation in Dagestan may take longer than initially
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether terrorism will be a part of the conflict is still
unclear. Although contract killings are virtually routine in
Russia, Moscow has generally been safe from terrorists. And Tuesday
evening jittery residents turned to the live news broadcasts from
the Manezh and wondered whether that has changed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Heavily promoted by Luzhkov and opened in 1997 during the
celebrations of the city's 850th anniversary, the Manezh is a
symbol of the nation's new freedoms and excesses. It is also just a
place to people watch and relax.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the explosion spread, television crews and ambulances
raced to the scene. Security forces took up positions in Red Square
and nearby streets.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion could prompt Moscow police to detain more people
from the Caucasus region. Already, dark-skinned people are often
stopped by the police and harassed. The Manezh mall, however, is
managed by Umar Dzhabrailov, an ethnic Chechen, who is close to
Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have often complained that President Boris Yeltsin, who
resides at a government complex outside the city, is out of touch
with events. So Yeltsin's spokesman made a point Tuesday of saying
that the president had been informed about the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, a potential presidential candidate, did better. He
rushed to the Manezh, toured the complex and then appeared before
the television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   With school classes set to resume on Thursday, the fact that so
many young people were among the injured prompted special concern.
The culprits, Luzhkov told reporters, were ``not human.'' No normal
person, he said, could have planted a bomb where children and young
people gathered.

MAYOR DEFENDS POLICE SHOOTING OF HAMMER-WIELDING MAN IN BROOKLYN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOHN KIFNER and MICHAEL COOPER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani Tuesday defended the fatal
police shooting of a mentally disturbed, hammer-wielding man in the
Borough Park section of Brooklyn, which brought hundreds of angry
Hasidic protesters into the streets of the heavily Orthodox
neighborhood late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be every reason to believe that the police
officers acted in accordance with police procedure, and acted in a
responsible way to save human life,'' the mayor said, cautioning
only that the investigation was still in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani moved swiftly to invite City Councilman Noach
Dear and other Jewish leaders from the politically potent Borough
Park neighborhood _ one of his bedrocks of support _ to an early
morning meeting at City Hall, the furor that swelled in the streets
on Monday night, another in a series of controversial shootings by
the police, continued throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who also represents the area and
has frequently been a rival of Dear, was outspoken in his criticism
Tuesday as he had been on the streets Monday night. ``We are told
that the shooting is justified. How? How is a shooting justified.
This is not Dodge City, this is Borough Park, Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Hikind got an unlikely ally in the Rev. Al Sharpton, who also
condemned the shooting, saying ``this city seems to be unable to
deal with people who have medical or mental problems and it seems
to be the policy to shoot first and ask questions later.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Sharpton, who is viewed unfavorably by many Jews in New
York City, attempted to show his support by going to Borough Park,
he had to drive off without getting out of his car, which was
surrounded by a crush of demonstrators shouting `'Anti-semite, go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   As investigators pieced together the deadly encounter _ which
lasted less then 10 minutes from the call to 911 _ a picture
emerged of the dead man, Gidone Busch, as a troubled individual,
frightening to his neighbors, in and out of mental institutions,
who had broken another man's nose with his hammer only last Sunday
and who had been smoking marijuana for hours before he fought with
six police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that the officers followed all standard
procedures for dealing with an emotionally disturbed person _
backing away and calling for help, and trying to subdue him with
pepper spray _ but finally opened fire as a last resort when he
continued to charge them, hitting a sergeant repeatedly with his
hammer and knocking him down.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 of the shots fired by four of the police officers struck
Busch, with injuries to the heart, lungs, liver and intestines, the
autopsy by the Chief Medical Examiner's office found, a
spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove said.
</P>
<P>
   At the City Hall news conference yesterday, Giuliani and Police
Commissioner Howard Safir sought to underscore the danger the
officers faced from Busch's hammer. ``He was in the course of
attacking a police officer with, I think we have a picture of it,
with a hammer _'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   `'A claw hammer,'' Safir interjected.
</P>
<P>
   ``A claw hammer,'' the mayor responded. Although the term ``claw
hammer'' appears to carry a somewhat menacing resonance, it refers
to a standard carpenter's hammer, the ``claw'' part being the two
prongs used to pull out nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``A claw hammer is a very dangerous instrument and had not the
police officers, in my opinion, taken the action, that could have
been planted in one of our sergeant's brains,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did exactly what they were supposed to do, which was to
call Emergency Service and to contain the situation,'' Safir said.
``Unfortunately, Busch came running up the stairs and attacked the
police officers and they had little choice but to defend
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Busch could have been subdued, rather than being shot
to death, Safir replied:
</P>
<P>
   `'When you are being attacked with a claw hammer, you are in
deadly fear of your life. And this isn't the movies. You don't
shoot hammers out of hands, you don't shoot people in the leg. If
you use your weapon...then you shoot to stop the individual who is
exerting that deadly physicial force against you. That's what
happened. Had they not, we probably would have had a dead police
officer.''
</P>
<P>
   In Busch's apartment, along with five bags of marijuana, the
police found cryptic scrawls on the walls, including several in
which he made up new acronyms for law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police,'' was broken down to mean ``Pointedly Off-wing
Litigating Intensely Careful Errend deliverers,'' a police official
said. The police were testing the marijuana to see if it might have
been laced with angel dust.
</P>
<P>
   The police also believe that Busch attacked Tamir Khalifa, 21, a
student at the College of Staten Island, on Sunday. Khalifa had
filed a complaint at the 66th Precinct in Borough Park saying that
a man had beaten on his car with a hammer and, when he rolled down
the window to complain, hit him on the nose, breaking it. After the
shooting, the police said, Khalifa picked out Busch from a set of
photographs as his assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Busch was committed at least three times to mental institutions
against his will, something that until recently was very difficult
to do under New York State law, a high ranking police official said
last night.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent commitment was on Dec. 1, 1997, to Stony Brook
Hospital, when he was still living with his parents in Dix Hill,
N.Y.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he was God's last prophet,'' a police report on the
commitment said, adding that he had kicked two holes in a hospital
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Before that he was involuntarily committed on Nov. 3, 1966. The
report on that commitment said he was suffering from ``severe
paranoia'' and that he had been ``making threats against his
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest involuntary commitment that law enforcement
officials have found occurred on June 30, 1996. A report on that
incident said Busch was suffering from ``paranoid schizophrenia''
and ``depression.''
</P>
<P>
   There may have been other commitments, possibly ones in which he
agreed to seek help, the senior law enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   Busch voluntarily admitted himself in 1997 to a residence for
men with mental illnesses in Brooklyn operated by the Ohel
Children's Home and Family Services, but checked himself out after
a little more than two months, according to David Mandel, the
organization's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He released himself against our advice,'' Mandel said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Busch's apartment Tuesday afternoon, a woman named
Netanya Ullman, 24, told reporters that she and Busch had recently
become engaged. They had first met, briefly, about five years ago
when studying in the northern Israeli city of Safad, an ancient
center of jewish mysticism, and then ran into each other three
weeks ago at the subway stop at 51st Street and Lexington Avenue,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said he called himself Yisroel Baal Tefilah and was, as she
put it, `'a poet and a dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, the first inkling of the trouble to
come in Borough Park was a 911 call at about 5:40 on Monday
afternoon complaining of two naked men smoking marijuana at 1619
46th Street, where Busch, who is also known as Gary, lives in a
basement apartment. A patrol car found nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6:40, another 911 call reported a man on the street at
the same address, menacing children. Officers Daniel Gravitch and
Martin Sanabria were assigned the call.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement apartment, they saw Busch, brandishing a hammer,
and a second man, identified as Percy Freeman, a sometime drug
dealer, whom the police said had a record of more than a half dozen
arrests and convictions. Freeman later told police he had met Busch
about a week ago in Washington Square Park, that Busch had invited
him to move in.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:45, the first two officers called for an Emergency Service
Unit _ a special weapons and tactics outfit _ and a supervisor. At
6:46, a second car, with Sergeant Terrence O'Brien and Officer
Kieran O'Leary arrived, followed by a car with a second patrol
sergeant, Joseph Memoly and Officer William Loshiavo.
</P>
<P>
   The police say they backed out of the apartment as Busch came at
them screaming and swinging the hammer. Gravitch attempted to use
his cannister of pepper spray to subdue Busch, but the police said
it only seemed to enrage him. Officer Gravitch tripped and fell,
and Sgt. O'Brien stepped between them to protect the policeman.
But, the police said, Busch kept hitting the Sergeant with his
hammer on his arm and thigh, until he, too fell down.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Sgt. O'Brien and Officers Memoly, Loshiavo and
Sanabria opened fire, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:49, the police called for an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Chiel J. Tyberg, said Busch had drawn attention to
himself in the neighborhood in recent days by playing loud music
and at one point walking about the streets playing the flute while
wearing a towel as a prayer shawl.
</P>
<P>
   `'He was definitely out of his mind,'' Tyberg said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw the police arrive and repeatedly urge Busch to
put down his hammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was standing on the sidewalk with the hammer in his hand,
swinging it,'' Tyberg said, although he added that from his vantage
point he could not see if any blows landed on the police. ``The
next thing I heard was the shooting.''

JUDGE IN AMIRAULT CASE WANTS HER SENTENCE REDUCED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The judge whose ruling freed Cheryl Amirault LeFave
from prison believes she should not be sent back and was prepared
to ask prosecutors to reduce her sentence and free her, the Globe
has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Had he been allowed to meet this week with both sides in the
Fells Acres child sex-abuse case, Superior Court Judge Isaac
Borenstein planned to ask Middlesex District Attorney Martha
Coakley to consider reducing LeFave's prison sentence to time
served _ eight years _ which would have allowed her to walk out of
prison, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting of the minds never took place, because the
Supreme Judicial Court _ which last month reinstated LeFave's child
abuse conviction _ said Borenstein no longer had jurisdiction in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein's suggestion that LeFave be freed after serving eight
years in state prison is in line with his strong views that LeFave,
her late mother, Violet Amirault, and her brother, Gerald, were
wrongly convicted of abusing children at the family's Malden
day-care center in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It was Borenstein who overturned the convictions of LeFave and
her mother in two decisions in 1997 and 1998, ruling that
over-zealous investigators and prosecutors had coerced and coached
child witnesses, accepting too readily the often-fantastic tales of
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC reinstated the convictions, saying Borenstein was wrong
in ordering new trials for the pair.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of LeFave now rests with whichever judge in Middlesex
Superior Court is assigned her case. It will be up to that judge to
reinstate the original conviction and 8- to 20-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The judge _ as Borenstein has already demonstrated _ would have
the power of persuasion, but little else.
</P>
<P>
   Any move to shorten LeFave's sentence would have to come from
Coakley, who refused to discuss the case Tuesday, or from LeFave's
attorneys, who would need to file a motion to revise or revoke the
original sentence. The only other route to freedom would be a
successful appeal to the Massachusetts Parole Board, which has
previously refused to release LeFave early.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in a somewhat surprising admission, the original
prosecutor in the Amirault case said parents of Fells Acres victims
probably would not insist that LeFave be returned to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if any of the families feel she needs to go back
to prison,'' said Laurence Hardoon, who is now in private practice
specializing in civil suits by sexual abuse victims, ``but I think
everybody agrees that the Parole Board has to resolve it. That's
the appropriate method; it should not be resolved by a judge or the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for LeFave's release, Borenstein intended to ask
LeFave's attorneys to consider dropping any planned appeals to
federal court or seeking clemency from Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   James L. Sultan, a defense lawyer for LeFave, called
Borenstein's suggestion ``a creative solution which we certainly
would have given the most serious consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sultan said he will file a petition Wednesday asking
the SJC to re-hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan said that if LeFave is sent back to prison he would ask
for an early parole hearing. But he said LeFave does not intend to
admit to any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Parole Board requires, as a condition of granting her
parole, that she admit to crimes she didn't commit, then she won't
be paroled,'' Sultan said. ``She's innocent, and she'll never say
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   During their imprisonment, LeFave and her mother, who died of
cancer in 1997, were repeatedly denied parole, apparently because
they refused to admit guilt. An admission of guilt is typically
required for sex offenders to be paroled.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Amirault was convicted in 1986 and is serving a 30- to
40-year sentence. He has lost three appeals of his conviction and
remains in prison.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When she goes out dancing on Saturday nights, Mercedes Rios
often finds herself listening to young women talk about how they
will never get AIDS. It hurts her, she says, because they will
never know by looking at her that she contracted HIV well over a
decade ago, and how vulnerable they really are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them `Hey, girls, be careful, use condoms,''' said Ms.
Rios, 41, who lives in Albany, N.Y. ``They think the only people
who have AIDS have marks in their arms and are skinny. And when you
see me, you would never never think I have this.''
</P>
<P>
   That, it turns out, may be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Death rates from AIDS in the United States are no longer falling
as rapidly as they did from 1995 to 1997, health officials at a
national AIDS conference in Atlanta said this week. New infections
of the virus that causes it were characterized by these officials
as ``dangerously high'' among minority gay men and heterosexual
women, especially minority women.
</P>
<P>
   Health care and policy experts who work with people infected
with HIV said Tuesday that those findings were consistent with what
they have been seeing in their clinics and hospitals, where
swelling ranks of teen-agers and black and nonwhite Hispanic men
and women have been walking through their doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our patient base is about 3,000 patients, and only 70 percent
male and only 12 percent white,'' said Matt Baney, the
administrator of the Comprehensive HIV Center at St. Vincents
Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. Five years ago, he said,
there were about 1,700 patients, and 90 percent of them were male
and nearly 65 percent were white.
</P>
<P>
   After a short period where all the news on the AIDS front
appeared to be optimistic, these figures are sobering to those who
work with people with AIDS. The reasons for the figures are many,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers were too young at the height of the AIDS epidemic to
be able to identify with the disease, they said. Others believe,
erroneously, that the latest drug therapies have turned AIDS into a
manageable disease, like diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are hearing from the kids is that AIDS is an illness
for adults,'' Baney said. ``They think it is finished, or that
there are medications, so what is the big deal? People in their 30s
and 40s remember people dying left and right and a time when it was
impossible not to know someone who was ill or who had died. Kids
just haven't seen that.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many older infected people are finding a
vulnerable audience in these young people. ``Gay boys often don't
fit into their own social background,'' Baney said. ``So they go
into an environment where they feel comfortable and accepted and
that is gay places where older adults take advantage of them. They
are very gullible.''
</P>
<P>
   Another significant factor is that public health campaigns to
promote safe sexual practices have not been directed at the
communities that need them the most, advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become complacent about our prevention messages,''
said Ronald S. Johnson, the managing director for public policy at
the Gay Men's Health Crisis center in Manhattan. ``Most ads were
designed for white gay men. We were very slow over all in targeting
gay men of color and women, and that speaks to the kinds of
differentials in the rates we see today.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, the barriers to AIDS prevention are different for
different groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women tend not to participate fully in their own health
care,'' said Steven Fisher, a spokesman for AIDS Action, a national
AIDS policy organization in Washington with 3,200 members. ``They
are taking care of children, the household, others, and they can't
focus on their own care, which is not the case with gay men.''
</P>
<P>
   Cultural issues that have not been considered in the current
prevention literature prevent other groups from practicing safe sex
or getting tested for HIV, said Michael Saunders, who runs the HIV
prevention program for young adults at Gay Men of African Descent,
an AIDS education organization. Immigrants, Saunders said, may have
no access to information about prevention in their own language.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated drug therapies advanced in recent years are
starting to fail for many users, which has contributed to the
slowdown in falling death rates. AIDS workers are concerned that
the public's interest in the disease may have started to evaporate
already.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important aspect of the story is that the dramatic changes
we saw in the progression from HIV to AIDS has plateaued,'' said
Dr. Victoria Sharp, the director of the center for comprehensive
care for the AIDS programs at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center
in Manhattan. Sharp, who has studied the disease around the world
through a group called Doctors of the World, said, ``We now know
those therapies only work for certain people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that like with so many diseases,'' she said,
``the public attention turns away and therefore funding will not be
there. That is particularly true today looking at these
demographics.''

CAPRIATI OUSTS A MUTUAL OPPONENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The Netherlands, Italy, France, Croatia)   By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At age 14, Jennifer Capriati became the youngest
tennis player to be ranked in the top 10 world ranking. At age 19,
Iva Majoli was seeded ninth in the French Open and became the
lowest-seeded player to win a Grand Slam tournament in the era of
open tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Both players, however, have had trouble dealing with early
success.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati dropped out of the sport for two years while enduring
personal and legal problems. Majoli has suffered through
complacency and injuries. Now these two players _ good friends off
the court _ are seeing their careers move in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   While Capriati is on the upswing, Majoli is still trying to
straighten out her game. Their current level of play was evident
Tuesday when the 23-year-old Capriati and the 22-year-old Majoli
met in Louis Armstrong Stadium in the first round of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati won comfortably, 6-1, 7-5, largely because of Majoli's
40 unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my best friend,'' Majoli said after the match. ``We hang
out together. We have dinner and go to the movies. We talk about
everything: movies, restaurants, boys. In April, we spent a few
days on holiday in Jamaica. Most of the time, there's no friendship
among players.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati is ranked 40th in the world, Majoli 97th. Majoli has
been ranked as high as fourth, Capriati as high as sixth.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Capriati has won a tour tournament in Strasbourg,
France, and the A.&AMP;P. exhibition tournament in Mahwah, N.J. Under
the coaching of Harold Solomon, she feels her game keeps improving
.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just gone up,'' Capriati said. ``I don't think it
could get any lower than where I was at. My game is just getting
better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, at 14, Capriati made her U.S. Open debut, winning her
first three matches before falling to Steffi Graf. Capriati thinks
she is wiser now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a lot younger then,'' she said. ``I think obviously I
would have a different kind of attitude _ I would hope I do _ 10
years later. Maybe I'm not as, like, goofy as I was before. That's
changed. You know, I'm not going to go around saying I'm so excited
after I win a match here.''
</P>
<P>
   Majoli, a Croat, was not excited about losing her match Tuesday.
She is trying to resurrect a career that went downhill because, she
said, of a different kind of immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won the French Open,'' she said, ``nobody expected me
to win. I didn't expect me to win. Then I won and discovered that
every opponent wants a piece of you. I didn't say to myself,
`You're playing good, but now it's going to be much tougher.'
Instead, I let myself be content when I lost. It was no big deal. I
told myself I would win the next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was bad thinking. I have regrets, but I was the one who
did all this. I have talent. I was there. To get to the top is
hard, but to stay on the top is harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when Majoli had straightened out her thinking, her body
betrayed her. Late last year a stress fracture in her right foot
sidelined her for two months. She returned, played three
tournaments and hurt her right shoulder. That put her out for four
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played maybe five tournaments this year,'' Majoli said,
``and this was my fourth straight first-round loss. I've had so
much rehab it's tough to play. I wish I could have played some more
before coming here. Tennis is my life, and when you play bad, it's
so bad you can't express it.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati's second-round opponent will be Seda Noorlander of the
Netherlands, the world's 93d-ranked player. Noorlander is 24 and
uses two-handed forehands and backhands. She beat Laura Golarsa of
Italy, 6-2, 6-1, Tuesday. She also defeated Capriati, 6-1, 6-3, in
the second round at Wimbledon this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The score looked easier than the match was,'' Noorlander said.
``I felt I had nothing to lose and the grass surface suited me
better than her. There's no real pressure on me now. She's an
American and she's expected to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati dismissed any talk of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to look ahead and see what your chances are,
just kind of, like, think about, you know, the rounds ahead and
stuff,'' she said. ``I'm confident I can compete with the best
players. I think I really believe that. I know I really believe
that.'' &QL;

KORDA LOSES FINAL APPEAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland, Britain)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Petr Korda, the 31-year-old Czech player who tested
positive for an anabolic steroid last year, lost his final appeal
Tuesday. The Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne,
Switzerland, ruled that Korda had to forfeit all prize money since
July 1998, when he tested positive for the bodybuilding steroid
nandrolone at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   The court also suspended him for a year and stripped him of
computer ranking points earned since the 1998 Wimbledon tournament.
That was academic because Korda retired last month.
</P>
<P>
   When Korda won the 1998 Australian Open, his world ranking
jumped from seventh to second. Six months later, Tim Henman of
Britain eliminated him in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. Korda's
drug test there proved positive, and the International Tennis
Federation, following its rules, suspended him for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Korda appealed, citing ``exceptional circumstances.'' An
independent appeals panel agreed with him, saying he was unaware
that he had ingested a steroid. Instead of a suspension, the panel
stripped him of his prize money and ranking points from Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Other players were upset by what they considered undue leniency
by the appeals panel. They were also upset by the legal battle in
British courts before the case went to the Court of Arbitration for
Sport.
</P>
<P>
   During the litigation, Korda played, but not well. His ranking
fell so far that it did not get him into this year's Wimbledon.
Tournament officials refused to give him a wild-card berth, so he
entered the qualifying tournament. When he did not qualify there,
he retired.

COMMENTARY: THE 16TH MINUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ I ran into Kato Kaelin the other night.
</P>
<P>
   He was at the premiere of the Showtime movie about Clarence
Thomas and Anita Hill. So, Kato blithely asked a friend, did
Clarence Thomas ever get confirmed?
</P>
<P>
   The shaggy blond pool boy-moocher of the O.J. trial is doing
great. He plays a shaggy blond pool boy-moocher on the new Showtime
series about TV executives in Hollywood, ``Beggars and Choosers.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is developing a TV talk show called ``The 16th Minute,''
about people, much like himself, who keep going after they have had
their 15 minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   It's a unexpectedly brilliant idea. I fear the millennium's
promise of a clean slate may be a mirage. We are in an era when no
one has the sense to know when the moment is over.
</P>
<P>
   Monica, Hillary, Dan Quayle, Marcia Clark, Newt, ``Charlie's
Angels,'' creationists, Viagra-promoting failed presidential
candidates, Dick Morris, Oliver North _ everybody now insists on
having posthumous careers. It doesn't matter anymore if you're a
winner or loser, good or bad, right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Flash the face. Notoriety works just as well as renown. Better,
maybe, because there's no truth to trip you up or talent to get in
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Cable, talk radio and the Internet have created a ravenous maw
that needs to be fed for a society obsessed with celebrities and
survivors _ especially celebrity survivors. There's no such thing
as out of sight in a universe with a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky is taking the route of Seinfeld ex Shoshanna
Lonstein, trying to use her old boyfriend to springboard herself
into a career in fashion. She is selling purses and totes on the
Web, with names like ``Bohemian Baroque'' and ``Garden Patch,''
bearing a ``unique'' rose-bordered label reading ``Made especially
for you by MONICA.'' There are also instructions on each creation
to ``DRY CLEAN ONLY'' from the young woman who changed American
history with her failure to dry-clean.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old _ now a Greenwich Village resident and possible
Hillary Clinton voter _ says in a Marie Claire interview that she
would like to launch her own lipstick line. Conceding that
companies might be put off because ``it seems like there's been a
lot of politics involved,'' she suggests that her sex-based image
has marketable value, citing the ads of Madonna for Max Factor:
``I'd like to have a lipstick. I think it could be a neat thing,
something that would be fun and lucrative and a respectable
decision. Um, I'd like to be using my head again.''
</P>
<P>
   For sheer cringe-worthiness, a Monica lipstick ad, focusing on
those shiny pillow lips, would probably top a Bob Dole erectile
dysfunction ad.
</P>
<P>
   Monica tells Lisa DePaulo, the writer for Marie Claire, that her
friends admire her talent for making her lipstick last through
meals: ``The key, she says, lifting a plastic deli fork to her
mouth, is to never let the utensil or the food touch your lips, but
rather to deliver it straight to your tongue. `But first,' she
instructs, demonstrating, `you have to open really wide.'''
</P>
<P>
   Given that Monica still doesn't seem to appreciate the concept
of a private life, much less that she was the occasion for a gross
constitutional crisis, I suppose we should be grateful that she
isn't hustling her own line of lingerie ``Made especially for you
by MONICA.''
</P>
<P>
   The former intern would fit perfectly into the TV cosmos created
by David E. Kelley, which features neurotic, boy-crazy women who
use sexual wiles to get ahead. On ``Ally McBeal,'' the female
lawyers' skirts come up and their hair comes down. On his new fall
show, ``Snoops,'' Kelley offers retro-jiggle: in a rehashed
``Charlie's Angels,'' three sexy girl detectives do what it takes
to crack cases.
</P>
<P>
   One of the detectives dresses like a hooker to blackmail a
deadbeat dad into handing over his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The boss of the office, played by the sultry Gina Gershon, tells
a new hire about the big case that financed her P.I. firm. ``You
know, there's a rumor about that case,'' the new hire says. ``You
promised to have sex with the kidnapper if he'd tell you where (the
victim) was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gershon smirks: ``Yeah, I give amazing phone.'' Then she
tells the new girl the office philosophy: ``We have fun. Help some
people. Catch a few bad guys. Date 'em. Fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Haven't we been here before? It's 16 minutes and counting.

WILLIAM A. NIERING, EXPERT ON ECOLOGY OF WETLANDS, DIES AT 75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ariz., Pa., N.J., Costa Rica)   By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professor William Albert Niering, an internationally recognized
expert on the ecology of wetlands and tidal marshes, died Monday in
New London, where he had just addressed the incoming class of 2003
at Connecticut College. He was 75 and lived in Gales Ferry, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   He collapsed on the campus, outside Palmer Auditorium, and was
pronounced dead on arrival at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital, the
college said.
</P>
<P>
   Niering, the Lucretia L. Allyn Professor of Botany at the school
and its longest-tenured faculty member, was one of the first small
group of scientists to realize that wetlands play vital ecological
roles and are not something to be drained and filled in. He
contributed to the understanding of the role of marshes in flood
drainage, water filtration and providing a spawning habitat for
fish and other ocean life.
</P>
<P>
   His botanical research varied from the vegetation of
Connecticut's remaining natural spaces to wetlands ecology, from
the dynamics of the vegetation of Pacific atolls to the flora of
the desert Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   He studied plant life from Arizona to the South Pacific. Just
last month he returned from Costa Rica, where he signed an
agreement for the college to plant 10,000 trees on 36 acres of
pasture land to offset carbon dioxide emissions at the New London
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us must realize that he or she is part of a complex
living system that would continue to function quite beautifully
without us,'' he once noted, ``and that our challenge is therefore
to work for a sustainable earth society that mimics the natural
system all around us.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he devoted his attention to ecosystems close to
home, particularly to the region's tidal wetlands. He wrote scores
of papers on the living dynamics of those marshes and the need to
preserve them.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author or co-author of six scientifically
authoritative books on wetland ecology that are accessible to the
general reader as well. Among them is ``Wetlands of North America''
(1991), which explores the main types of wetlands on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the co-author of a series of illustrated volumes on
American wildflowers. Published by the Audubon Society, they remain
in print.
</P>
<P>
   He was the director of the Connecticut College Arboretum from
1965 to 1988 and a founder of the state chapter of the Nature
Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Scotrun, Pa., William Niering graduated from
Pennsylvania State University in 1948. He received his doctorate in
plant ecology at Rutgers University in 1952, the year he joined the
faculty in New London as an assistant professor. He became a full
professor in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 44 years, Catherine Sublett
Niering; a son, William S., of Griswold, Conn.; and two sisters,
Annabelle Peechka of Pennsylvania and Bettina Buchmann of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   A great believer in joint faculty-student research, Niering
could often be found in early morning tramping through a marsh with
his disciples. He also was a judge for Inherit the Earth, a program
created at the college to honor businesses and educators deemed
friends of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Niering, an authority on vegetation management by means of
herbicides and controlled fires, shared his knowledge with
lawmakers, government agencies and conservationist groups as well
as with concerned individual landowners and utilities ready to shun
the use of broad-spectrum herbicides beneath their power lines. He
happily let wild plants multiply in the lawn around his own house.

SHARES END MIXED AFTER MANUFACTURING REPORT ADDS FEAR OF FED RATE
AUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices gyrated sharply Tuesday, ending mixed in
a session that traders said was almost impossible to interpret.
</P>
<P>
   After opening higher, stocks fell sharply along with bond prices
around midday after a monthly survey of the nation's purchasing
managers showed that conditions in the manufacturing sector were
stronger than expected during August, reinforcing worry that the
Federal Reserve Board will again push short-term interest rates
higher.
</P>
<P>
   From its morning high to its low, the Dow Jones industrial
average fell about 200 points, only to recoup all its loss, and
then fall again near the close on computer-generated sell programs.
By the end of the day, the Dow was down 84.85, or 0.8 percent, to
10,829.28. Big declines in stocks like Caterpillar Tractor,
International Paper and Dupont more than offset gains in computer
stocks like Hewlett-Packard and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Strength in technology shares helped limit losses in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index, which closed at 1,320.41, down
3.61, or 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq composite index, which has many
more technology stocks than the S&AMP; P or the Dow, gained 26.66, or 1
percent, to 2,739.35. And the Russell 2000 index of small company
stocks eked out a gain of 0.5, or 0.1 percent, to 427.83.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three main market measures, the Nasdaq composite
performed the best last month, rising 3.9 percent. The Dow average
rose 1.9 percent, but the S&AMP;P 500 fell by 0.5 percent during
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think prices have further to fall, but I wouldn't put too
much emphasis on anything the market does this week,'' said Bill
Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 861.7 million shares changed
hands, partly because of end-of-the-month window dressing. On
Monday trading volume did not reach 600 million. On the Nasdaq
stock market, 964 million shares were traded.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said he expected that by the middle of next week conditions
would seem more normal ``because all of the various players in the
market will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks got a lift early in the day after IBM said it
had agreed to sell $2 billion worth of parts to Cisco Systems over
the next five years and to help maintain computer networks for
Cisco customers. IBM shares rose 1] to 124 9/16. Cisco, an S&AMP; P 500
and Nasdaq composite component, gained 1 1/16, to 67 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems was another big winner, rising 3~ to 79{ after
a Merrill Lynch analyst upgraded his rating on it.
</P>
<P>
   Other big technology issues also did well. Apple Computer gained
3 3/16 to 65\ after it unveiled a new Power Macintosh professional
personal computer, and Computer Associates International, the
computer software designer, jumped 5 5/16, to 56{.
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot, which issued an earnings report late Monday, fell
1/16 to 10 7/16. Its major competitor, Staples fell 3/16, to 21}.

 _ SF CHRON   Bills May Affect Business 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Q: With the end of the California legislative session only a week
and a half away, what bills still are being considered that will
impact my business?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: According to the California Chamber of Commerce, there still are
many bills being considered by the Legislature that would affect
California's small businesses. These are some of the more critical
measures:
</P>
<P>
   _AB633, by Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, would
allow employees, trial attorneys and other third parties to bypass
the labor commissioner's office and sue employers over wage issues.
The bill also includes a ``bounty provision'' that for the first
time makes employers liable for civil penalties in wage disputes.
The California chamber says this bill would increase the filing of
``nuisance suits'' and opposes this measure.
</P>
<P>
   _SB320, by Sen. Hilda Solis, D-La Puente (Los Angeles County),
would increase workers' compensation benefits by $2.7 billion. This
bill contains no offsetting changes that would cut costs, and it is
expected that the $2.7 billion increase would be passed directly to
employers in the form of higher premiums. The chamber also opposes
this measure.
</P>
<P>
   _Health care changes. Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature still
are negotiating the final package that Davis will sign into law.
The California chamber opposes changes that dramatically would
increase the price of health care and force employers, particularly
small businesses, to drop coverage or pass along the additional
costs to employees who might not be able to afford it.
</P>
<P>
   _SCA3, by Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, would let
individual communities raise and control local transportation funds
through a dedicated half-cent sales tax. It is estimated that
California's overall transportation needs will be somewhere between
$70 billion and $80 billion over the next decade. This proposed
constitutional amendment needs approval from two-thirds of the
Assembly and then would need to be voted on by Californians in
November 2000. The California chamber supports this measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature always waits until the last few weeks of the
session to deal with many of the significant bills,'' said
California Chamber of Commerce President Allancq &LR;  Zaremberg. So far
this year, organized business has taken some lumps. In July, for
example, Davis signed a bill that restores overtime rules requiring
employers to pay workers time and a half for the first four hours
after an eight-hour shift, and double time for anything over 12
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you take the chamber side on pending issues or oppose
it, there still is time to contact your state legislators and Davis
and to tell them where you stand. To find out who your state
legislators are and how to reach them, you can visit the California
Chamber Web site (www.calchamber.com) or the state government's
site (www.ca.gov/s /govt/legisca.html).

READER RESPONSE
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _Online marketing. After reading last week's item on ways to
promote an online business without spending big bucks, Chronicle
reader Nicole Kidd recommends another easy-to-read,
resources-packed guide called ``Poor Richard's Internet Marketing
and Promotions _ How to promote yourself, your business, your ideas
online'' by Peter Kent/ Tara Calishain (1999, $29.95). Also check
out Kent's ``geek-free, common sense'' advice at Poor Richard's Web
site (www.poorrichard.com).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Kids 'n contracts. Responding to another item last week, Pillsbury
Madison &AMP; Sutro attorney Steven Saxe notes that although minors can
get out of most contracts until a short time following their 18th
birthdays, adults who enter into agreements with them are legally
bound by the terms of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   If adults are willing to contract with someone under 18, the
minor does not need to obtain a parent's signature before the other
party is committed to the deal it has made. One of the few
exceptions is real estate mortgage contracts, which would not be
binding on either party.
</P>
<P>
   Further, banks can open accounts for minors without the parents'
knowledge or approval. Banks also can make a loan contract with a
minor. But because the minor would not be bound by terms of the
loan, most banks &UR;  &LR; won't loan money to a child without a parent's
signature. However, some lenders do make small loans to minors for
Junior Achievement and similar projects.

<HEADLINE>
BIRD, REVEALING HEART CONDITION, HINTS AT END TO COACHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY AND BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Larry Bird reveals in an upcoming book that he has a
heart problem, one that surfaced occasionally in the offseason
while he was with the Celtics and still requires medication. In an
interview Tuesday, Bird declined to talk about the condition, but
indicated this would be his last season as head coach of the
Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   The heart condition, known as atrial fibrillation, is
controllable with medication, proper attention to diet, exercise,
and moderated alcohol consumption, Celtics team physician Arnold
Scheller said.
</P>
<P>
   Bird never told the Celtics about his heart ``episodes'' while
he was playing, and they occurred only during his sometimes-brutal
summer workouts. It was after he retired in 1992, and well after
the death of Reggie Lewis from a different, more serious heart
problem in 1993, that he finally went to Scheller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Reggie's episode precipitated it,'' Scheller
said. ``Larry and I basically dealt with it as if it was no big
deal. He had been running a lot, 6 miles a day, and he called me up
one day and said he felt lightheaded. I ran him through some tests
and we found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheller said there was never any indication of heart problems
while Bird played.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's episodic. It comes and goes,'' Scheller said. ``But it's
related to alcohol consumption and proper conditioning. It was not
a serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached Tueday night, Bird said he could not talk about the
condition because of his arrangement with his publisher. He
described it in the book, called, ``Bird Watching: On Playing and
Coaching the Game I Love,'' as saying his heart would start
``jumping around . . . I always knew there was something wrong with
my heart.'' The book is excerpted in the current Sports
Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bird did talk briefly about his job situation. When
asked what he thought about rookie Jonathan Bender, Bird said, ``I
don't know. I'm not going to see him play much, anyway.'' He then
said that this was his final season and that he had said as much to
Pacers president Donnie Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bird's comments, Walsh said: ``He didn't say it flat
out. I never expected him to coach beyond the three years, but it's
not like he has come in here and told us that this is it. The idea
was that we'd talk at the end of this season and see what he wanted
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird signed a three-year contract to coach the Pacers with the
expectation that he'd move into the front office after that,
possibly to take Walsh's job. Walsh said the two have discussed
such a move for next season and that Bird has seemed interested in
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with Larry, you never know,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Bird's decision, it will not hinge on his heart
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Atrial fibrillation is a much more common, and much less severe
heart arrhythmia, than ventricular fibrillation, which is what
Lewis had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ventricular fibrillation is an arrhythmia that can be
life-threatening,'' said Scheller. ``Atrial fibrillation is a much
more common type of arrhythmia and related to conditioning and
metabolic changes in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bird was diagnosed, Scheller put him on medication and told
him to moderate his alcohol intake as well as be more vigilant
about his diet and his exercise. He also said there is an ongoing
concern about blood clots, but the medication is designed to deal
with that.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Bird, the conditioned worsened when he was
named coach of the Pacers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little scared because it didn't seem like it was going
away,'' Bird wrote.

   Walsh said Bird told him about the heart situation during the
interview process. Walsh said he was ``nervous at first'' because
doctors found it difficult to determine exactly what dosage of
medication Bird needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once they found that, it was fine,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he was not aware of an episode Bird described in the
book about nearly fainting during a March 17, 1998, game against
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Bird wrote, ``I was standing on the sideline and hoping for a
television timeout because I felt like I was gonna pass out.
Finally, the ref whistled time. Whenever we have a timeout, they
always put a chair on the court for me so I can sit down and talk
to the guys. This time I fell into that chair because I was going
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he has consulted with Bird and the Pacers' medical
staff and is convinced that Bird's condition is not serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't become concerned until he or the doctors become
concerned,'' Walsh said. ``And the doctors all tell me that if he
takes his medication, he'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Bird wrote that, at one point, Pacers cardiologist King Yee used
defibrillator paddles to jolt his heart back to a normal rhythm.
Yee told Bird to be more serious about his condition and
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Dr. Yee was trying to scare me,'' Bird wrote. ``I'm
not going to be stupid about this heart condition, but I'm not
going to live my whole life in fear of this thing, either. If it
goes, it goes.''

Apple yesterday overhauled the high end of its Macintosh computer
lineup, rolling out new desktop models so powerful that it calls
them ``personal supercomputers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the Power Mac G4 line, the machines are built around the
PowerPC G4, a new Motorola microprocessor with special features to
speed up graphics, multimedia and scientific calculations. Apple
also showed off a sleek new flat-panel digital monitor that
measures 22 inches diagonally, the largest liquid-crystal display
ever brought to market.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs, the company's interim CEO, introduced the new
products before an enthusiastic audience of graphics and publishing
professionals attending this week's Seybold San Francisco
publishing trade show and conference at the Moscone Center.
</P>
<P>
   To show what the new Power Mac will mean to such customers, Jobs
showed it whipping a 600-MHz Pentium III, generally by 2-to-1
margins, on a variety of graphics and video operations. He called
on John Warnock, chairman and CEO of Adobe, to attest that the
Apple machine is the fastest Adobe has ever tested with Photoshop,
its widely used image-editing application.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Richard Crandall, a scientist who now works at
Apple, showed off the G4's speed at demanding scientific tasks. For
example, he said, when the machine was set to run a program that
searches radio data from space for patterns that might indicate
extraterrestrial intelligence, it accomplished as much in six hours
as the Pentium III did in 25 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Apple calls the new models ``supercomputers'' because they can
complete 1 billion floating-point math operations per second _ a
level of performance known in the industry as a ``gigaflop.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of performance could open new doors for Apple among
scientists and engineers. A decade ago, the company held a strong
position in technical-computing markets, but in recent years it has
largely abandoned that arena and focused the marketing of its
high-end models mainly on graphics and publishing customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't have hardware that could really compete in that
area,'' Rubinstein said, ``but the G4 is a dream machine for
researchers. You'll see us starting to do some marketing focused on
the scientific, technical and engineering areas.''
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a year ago that Motorola announced its new
chip. Apple said then that it would eventually use it in the Mac
line. Most industry watchers, however, had not expected Power Mac
G4 models to be released until late fall at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new Macs, equipped with a 400-megahertz G4 chip, is
available now at a retail price of $1,599. A version with a 450-MHz
G4 and a $2,499 price tag is due in ``a few weeks,'' according to
Jobs, and a 500-MHz model priced at $3,499 is expected in October.
</P>
<P>
   Apple will also offer the machines through its online store,
where users can have other configurations built to order.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to faster processors, the higher-priced models offer
more memory, bigger disks and faster internal data channels. They
also have special slots where users can add a $99 wireless
networking card, using the same technology Apple recently announced
for the iBook, its upcoming $1,599 portable Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The new monitor, called the Apple Cinema Display, will sell for
$3,499, also beginning in October. Though it is only a few inches
thick, it offers the same viewing area as a 24-inch conventional
monitor. Because supplies will be limited, Apple will sell the
display only through its online store and only with a 450- or
500-MHz Power Mac G4. From the outside, the Power Mac G4s closely
resemble their G3 predecessors, except that gray shades Apple calls
silver and graphite replace the bright blue and white plastics that
distinguished the previous models. ``We got a lot of feedback from
our professional customers that they wanted a more professional
look,'' said Jon Rubinstein, Apple senior vice president of
hardware engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The key new feature in the G4 microprocessor is a technology
that Motorola calls AltiVec, but Apple will market it under the
name ``Velocity Engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Like recent enhancements to Intel's Pentium processors and
Advanced Micro Devices' K6 and Athlon chips, the Velocity Engine is
designed to accelerate operations when the same computer
instruction is applied to multiple blocks of data _ a scenario
that's increasingly common as computers handle more graphics, video
and audio. As with the new Intel and AMD features, the Velocity
Engine works only with software rewritten to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   But with such software, Apple says, the Velocity Engine works
dramatically faster than the PC equivalents. Benchmark tests
downloaded from Intel's Web site, Jobs said, show that the 500-MHz
G4 is 2.9 times faster than a 600-MHz Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   The gigaflop performance of the Power Mac G4s means they will
fall under federal government regulations that limit exports of
high-powered computers to China, Russia and other potential trouble
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Apple plans to capitalize on that situation with a new TV ad,
launched last night, that shows a half dozen Army tanks surrounding
a Power Mac G4 as an announcer intones ``For the first time in
history, a personal computer has been classified as a weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   In other announcements, Apple said Warner Bros. Records and
Rhino Records have created new ``channels'' for streaming audio and
video over the Internet using Apple's QuickTime TV technology. It
also said advance orders for the iBook portable, which is scheduled
to ship later this month, now exceed 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by yesterday's company announcements, investors pushed
shares of Apple up $3.19, to $65.25, in trading on the Nasdaq
market. Almost 5.7 million Apple shares changed hands, compared to
an average volume of 3.7 million shares.

 _ SF CHRON   Sun Offers Free Office Software 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Stein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a strike against Microsoft's stranglehold on desktop computer
software, Sun Microsystems Inc. yesterday confirmed plans to offer
word processing and spreadsheet software applications for free over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, the Palo Alto firm which makes computer workstations,
network servers and software, said yesterday it had purchased Star
Division Corp., a small Fremont company that produces office
productivity software that can be accessed over the Net with a
standard Web browser. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's free office software applications, which also include
presentation software, e-mail and calendar programs, are remarkably
similar to the applications in Microsoft's best-selling Office
Suite, which costs $400 and has be to loaded onto a personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been the undisputed leader in office software. Its
Office Suite has attracted about 100 million customers and accounts
for approximately 40 percent of the company's total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers believe Sun may be making a tactical error by
going after Microsoft in the office software market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Sun will make an impact, because 75 percent of
office software is bought by corporations, not individuals,'' said
Laura Lederman, an analyst with William Blair &AMP; Co. ``Corporations
will stick to Windows-based products because they have made huge
investments in the stuff, and it works.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that technology managers are typically quite
conservative and may be reluctant to embrace the idea of
Internet-based productivity software because of the inherent
bandwidth and reliability issues. ``I don't know if Sun has enough
power on its own to change the office software market,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite clear evidence to the contrary, Sun officials insist
they are not targeting Microsoft. ``We're going after the future,
not (Microsoft),'' insists Brain Croll, a senior director of
product marketing for Sun. ``There is a massive trend toward
Internet applications, and the next logical step is to bring the
office environment into this domain.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, for its part, does not yet have a plan to offer its
software over the Internet. The Sun-Star Division model poses a
dilemma for the company, because if it starts offering its software
for free on the Web, it will lose an important revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   But if the concept of Web-based computing catches on, Microsoft
could be left in the cold and could lose valuable market share.
Microsoft could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Star Division was founded in Germany in 1985, but founder Marco
Boerries later moved the company headquarters to Fremont. It
employs 155 people, and all will be offered jobs with Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the majority of Star Division's workers will
remain in Germany. Meanwhile the 25-odd sales and marketing
employees in Fremont will be integrated into Sun's facilities in
Menlo Park, according to Croll.
</P>
<P>
   Boerries will join Sun as vice president and general manager of
Web-based appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Sun said yesterday that it is creating its own Internet portal
where users can go to access Star Division's office applications on
an as-needed basis. The so-called StarPortal will become
operational in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Sun said users can download desktop versions of
StarOffice for free at www.sun.com/staroffice. The StarOffice
software runs on the Linux, Window, OS/2 and Solaris platforms.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Internet-based computing applications is gaining
steam. To date, high-end software for such tasks as manufacturing
and accounting _ as well as e-mail and calendaring applications _
have been offered over the Web in a hosted environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun-Star Division deal represents the first time that more
 &LR; basic applications like word processing and spreadsheets have
moved to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last holdout, it seems, has been office productivity
software,'' said Sun chief executive Scott McNealy in an open
letter posted on Sun's Web site. ``You might describe today's
announcement as one small step for office software, one giant leap
for the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun is hoping to gain broader acceptance of its Web-based
computing initiative by forging alliances with Internet service
providers and other Web-based companies. Sun is giving these
potential partners StarOffice for free so that they will
incorporate the software into their normal services.
</P>
<P>
   One such partner, Portera Systems Inc. in Campbell, said it will
combine StarOffice with its own line of software. ```We don't
expect our customers to move off of Microsoft Office,'' said
Portera chief executive Gary Steele. ``But if they need to use,
say, a spreadsheet tool, they can now do that within our software,
instead of having to switch out of our program, go into Microsoft
Excel and then transport the data back.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Sun is offering StarOffice for free, it expects to make
money. First, it plans to charge corporations and service providers
for installation, maintenance and technical support.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Web-based applications like StarOffice provide greater
impetus for companies to buy Sun's core server products, which are
needed to run the software.

 _ SF CHRON   Optical Networks has gone the extra mile to import scarce 
 engineers to Silicon Valley 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Most Silicon Valley companies have a hard time attracting talent,
but Optical Networks of San Jose faced a special hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bay Area is loaded with electronics engineers, it
has relatively few fiber optics experts working on the next
generation of technology to increase the capacity and speed of
telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these so-called photonics experts happen to work for
companies like Nortel Networks in Canada, Lucent Technologies in
New Jersey and other companies along the East Coast and a few in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that in Silicon Valley, everything is built on
electronic integrated circuits, while most of the talent in moving
light down fiber is in Canada and the East,'' said Optical Networks
chief executive Hugh Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report, the American Electronics Association said
that while California had 784,000 high-tech jobs in 1997 (more than
Texas and New York combined), New York employed five times as many
workers as California in optics technology.
</P>
<P>
   Optical Networks is hiring both electronic and optical engineers
to create products that metropolitan phone networks can use to
bridge the gap between fast, high-capacity electronic data networks
operated by companies and long-distance telecommunications networks
based on fiber optics technology.
</P>
<P>
   The company did the usual things to attract outside talent. It
offered recruits big pay raises, signing bonuses, help with rent
and private school tuition and, of course, bountiful stock options.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Optical Networks sweetened the pot with perks that
would make recruits and their families not just willing to come,
but happy to stay. The company organizes regular whale-watching,
bocce ball and other outings, sponsors an amateur hockey team and
helps Canadian engineers deal with visa hassles. It even grants
time off for weddings in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 55 of the company's 130 employees are imported
engineers, including 35 from Canada. Over the next year, Optical
Networks plans to grow to 275 employees, including 70 additional
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The company knew that recruiting nonlocal engineers would be a
challenge. In Silicon Valley, the rule of thumb is that about 50
percent of the engineers offered new jobs accept them and within a
year or so half of this group quit to take yet another job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risks, Optical Networks felt it had no other option.
Unlike software companies that often can hire engineers at remote
locations and get work done by computer links, Optical Networks is
developing hardware and needs people on site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't build our products if we couldn't attract people
from outside the area,'' said Human Resources director Lisa
Blos-Johnson, who previously consulted with 20 startups.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who formerly was president of the 3DO video game
software company and headed desktop computer engineering at Apple
Computer, set his No.1 priority as ``recruiting optical talent''
when he became CEO 20 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   That has meant flying out to meet prospective employees and
their significant others as well as flying them in. Last January,
for example, Martin joined his head of human resources and
engineering and a previous Canadian hire on a poaching trip to
Canada to capitalize on Nortel Networks' recent acquisition of
Cambrian Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Martin figured that Cambrian engineers who had left Nortel to
create their own optical technology company might be unhappy about
returning to the corporate fold. At the same time, Nortel engineers
might be worried about having their own research projects canceled.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fruitful trip. Optical Networks interviewed 36
engineers, offered 10 of them jobs and hired all of them, five from
Cambrian and five from Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   The company's efforts to go the extra mile to land talent comes
at a time when business is booming. Telecommunications and
networking companies are rushing to buy new equipment to allow
faster, cheaper transmission of voice, data and video. They also
are gobbling up the companies that are developing innovative
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   No.1 phone equipment-maker Lucent Technologies has made several
acquisitions, including Nexabit Networks and Excel Switching Corp.
Main rival Nortel Networks has bought a bunch of companies, too,
including Santa Clara's Bay Networks.
</P>
<P>
   While Nortel opted to buy Bay to gain some of the electronics
expertise it was lacking, Optical Networks decided to import talent
rather than buy a distant company.
</P>
<P>
   Martin opposes having two research staffs, two cultures and two
locations. ``We have guys working 18 hours a day and don't want to
have them three time zones and 3,000 miles apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Optical Networks has raised $50 million in venture capital,
including $15 million in the next week from Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers, Mohr Davidow and Fidelity Capital. U.S. and
European telecommunications companies will begin testing its
networking products next month.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston analyst James Parmelee calls Optical
Networks one of the ``most interesting acquisition candidates.''
But Martin said the company is not interested in selling out. The
company is expected to go public by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   When Canadians brought up the fact that they could buy a nice
house for $80,000, Martin's pat response was, ``Come to Silicon
Valley. Rent for a while and within two years, you can buy a house
anywhere you want.'' He also was quick to point out that the U.S.
dollar is 50 percent stronger than its Canadian counterpart and
that U.S. income taxes are lower than Canada's flat 50 percent
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of depending on executive recruiters to find talent, and
paying them about 35 percent of the first year's salary, Optical
Networks has relied on referrals to hire seven out of eight
employees. To do this, it offers rich rewards to employees who help
recruit talent.
</P>
<P>
   For simply submitting a referral for a current job opening,
employees can win prizes from concert tickets to digital cameras.
If a candidate is hired for a full-time position, the company pays
a $1,500 referral bonus and also hands out free trips to those who
make the most referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Martin figures Optical Networks has spent about $750,000 more in
hiring expenses than high-tech companies that hire mostly local
candidates. But he believes that it is well worth it. While the
overall acceptance rate for job offers in Silicon Valley is 50
percent or less, Optical Networks says it lands 85 percent of those
to whom it makes job offers and has lost only three employees to
other companies since Janaury 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jalal Habelrih, a transplanted engineer from Tellabs in Canada,
finds it costs as much for a one-bedroom apartment in San Jose as a
penthouse in Montreal. But the senior director of hardware said he
is happy with most everything but California cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mitalas, who calls himself ``a double relo'' because he
relocated from Ottawa to Nortel's facilities in North Carolina
before jumping to Optical Networks, also is gung ho about his new
job, even though he, his wife and three kids are renting a house
that is one-third smaller than his former house.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, an engineer makes a modest income and works toward
retirement,'' said Mitalas, the senior director of software
development. ``But here, I can be in a startup, build something
huge and participate in the glory and goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   Yves Lacroix, another Nortel veteran, also accepted the Optical
Networks challenge early this year after being wined and dined at
Montreal's swank Opus 2 restaurant and flown to the Bay Area for a
visit, including an all-expense-paid weekend with his fiancee,
Nathalie.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix received a TN (transnational) visa, which under the
North American Free Trade Agreement allows certain professionals
from Canada and Mexico to work in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But Nathalie encountered problems with U.S. immigration
officials after repeated visits from Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   After missing one flight because of lengthy grilling over
whether she really was just a tourist, Nathalie and Yves decided to
speed up their wedding plans. Optical Networks provided legal
counseling on visa issues, and at the end of April, the two took
off for a weekend wedding at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Nathalie was a computer project manager for L'Oreal in Canada
but does not have a work permit in the United States. Nevertheless,
she said she currently is content studying English, enjoying the
Bay Area and Optical Networks outings, and occasionally Web surfing
at the company's offices on weekends when Yves is working.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yves Lacroix is paying three times the rent he paid in
Canada, he pays lower taxes, got a good raise and received a bunch
of stock options. ``I call it `the beautiful risk,''' he said.
``The worst case is, I'm a California guy for a year or two.''

BIRD'S HEART AILMENT COMMON, NOT AS DEADLY AS LEWIS'

<P>
   BOSTON -- Atrial fibrillation, the heart condition Larry Bird
says he has, is a far more common and far less serious type of
irregular heartbeat than the one that killed Reggie Lewis, but it
is not a benign condition.
</P>
<P>
   It was once considered a relatively harmless cardiac arrhythmia,
but doctors now know that people with atrial fibrillation have a
fivefold greater risk of stroke than others.
</P>
<P>
   The condition affects about 2 million Americans, but, unlike
Bird, most people don't develop it until they are 50 or older.
</P>
<P>
   When the heart is functioning properly, its four chambers beat
in a well-orchestrated way. A chamber contracts, or beats, when
triggered by an electrical impulse. In atrial fibrillation, the
heart's electrical impulses get out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   This causes the atria (the upper two chambers) to quiver
erratically instead of beating forcefully at a regular rate. As a
result, blood isn't pumped completely out of the atria, and it can
pool and clot. If a piece of a clot breaks off and travels to an
artery that feeds the brain, the blockage of blood flow likely will
cause a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The most common triggers of atrial fibrillation are high blood
pressure, congestive heart failure, and prior heart attack. Other
causes include valvular heart disease, an overactive thyroid,
infections, and excessive alcohol consumption. Sometimes doctors
can find no apparent cause.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, a person experiences heart palpitations, chest
discomfort, shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, fatigue, or
lightheadedness.
</P>
<P>
   Although the condition is usually chronic, in some it occurs
only occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs such as warfarin and aspirin, which prevent blood clots
and thus stroke, are generally prescribed for people with atrial
fibrillation, as are medications to slow the heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   Most people live completely normal lives with the condition. It
is not considered a major cause of sudden death, as is ventricular
fibrillation, which, in addition to causing Lewis's death, killed
two-time Olympic gold medalist Sergei Grinkov, a figure skater who
in 1995, at age 28, collapsed on the ice rink and died hours later.

BAY STATE SAT SCORES RISE; GENDER GAP REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The sweat and angst of studying for the SATs appears
to be paying off for Massachusetts students: Their scores are
better this year than they have been in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Students' scores averaged six points higher overall this year
than last, according to data released Tuesday by the State
Department of Education, and scores have been steadily climbing
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And the news is even better in math, with students tying the
average score of their national classmates for the first time in 12
years. The state also is third in the nation in the percentage of
students taking the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   State officials point to the improvements as a sign that
students are better prepared, parents are more supportive, and
educators are pushing students to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that students, and their parents and teachers are
focused on achievement,'' said State Education Commissioner David
P. Driscoll. ``A six-point increase is statistically significant.
Whether this is a one-time gain or a more fundamental trend, we'll
have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The average scores for Massachusetts students jumped three
points in both the math and verbal categories _ from 508 in 1998 to
511 this year. Nationally, students averaged 505 in verbal and 511
in math.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good news for Bay State students, a troubling gender
gap remains. Girls continue to lag behind boys on the entire exam
and, of the 59 Massachusetts students who scored a perfect 1,600 on
the SAT, only 14 were girls.
</P>
<P>
   Boys continue to out-perform girls on the math portion of the
exam by 43 points, a puzzling difference to educators who say girls
do better than boys in advanced placement math courses and get
better math grades than boys overall.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll called the gender gap ``problematic'' and said the
state will continue to track the data and insist that the number of
programs to attract women to math and science is increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to make extra efforts where we can,'' Driscoll
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists say the test is unfairly designed to favor a
male problem-solving process and has been for years. They say
colleges should place more emphasis on a student's educational
portfolio _ grade-point average, honors courses, extracurricular
activities, sports _ during the admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear there is a good deal of test bias going on with the
SAT,'' said Jeff Rubenstein, senior director of research and
development at the Princeton Review. ``Women take just as much or
more math than men and score just as high or higher on GPAs. So, in
every other way women do just as well as men except on the SATs
There is test bias that favors the way boys typically think.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Griffis, a program associate in gender bias at FairTest
in Cambridge, said her testing watchdog group is trying to get more
colleges to look beyond the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   She said although higher SAT scores may indicate an improved
educational system, it may also prove that more students are taking
SAT preparation courses.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, 78 percent of high school students took the
SAT, nearly double the national rate, placing it third in the
nation behind Connecticut and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to know more specifically who is taking the SAT,
because the scores go up and down depending upon how well coached
students are,'' she said. ``We don't believe the blanket statement
that because students are performing better that the test is fair.
It could mean more students who took it could afford to take
preparation courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Kaplan Education Centers, a national chain of
SAT-preparation stores, said business has increased by 130 percent
in Massachusetts in the last decade and that business is up
nationwide by 30 percent in the past year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Massachusetts, in particular, it seems that more and more
parents and students are becoming aware of the benefits of
prepping,'' said Trent Anderson, executive director for pre-college
programs at Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of advanced placement courses have also not been
lost on Bay State students. The Department of Education reported
Tuesday that advanced placement test scores for Massachusetts
students also are outpacing the national average. Those grades are
reported at five levels, with Level 5 being the highest.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, 71 percent of graduates scored in the top
three levels, nearly eight points higher than the national average
of 63.5 percent. And, 19.6 percent of Massachusetts students had
scores in the highest Level 5, compared to 13.9 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 percent of all state public schools had students who
took the 1999 AP tests compared to 60 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping this is an indication of the result of the
seriousness of purpose we're seeing across the state from parents,
teachers, and administrators that public education is their number
one issue,'' Driscoll said.

 WASHINGTON: the episode.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Autopsies showed that some cult members died of gunshot wounds,
which the authorities have insisted were self-inflicted, and that
others died as a result of a fire that officials said was started
by the members. Examination of the ashes revealed that gasoline,
charcoal-lighting fluid and camp stove fuel had been spread about.
</P>
<P>
   But the few cult members who survived the fire and many of the
victims' relatives have been skeptical of official conclusions,
including a finding after congressional hearings that there was no
evidence that federal agents started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department officials, who spoke on the condition
that they not be identified, said Freeh and Ms. Reno believe that
nothing new will turn up to alter the official conclusions. But the
attorney general and the FBI director are said to be convinced that
the crisis of confidence is serious enough that only a wholly
outside investigation would be palatable to many who have followed
the Branch Davidian case.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said last week that he was ready to assign 40 bureau
agents to re-interview everyone who was at the cult compound on
April 19, 1993, to determine how the use of heat-generating tear
gas canisters was all but buried in the official paperwork despite
its potential to embarrass the bureau and weaken the government's
position in a wrongful-death suit brought in Texas by some of the
victims' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday night whether Freeh had changed his
mind about using the 40 bureau agents or whether he had simply
picked them out early on just in case they were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday whether the director was in conflict with the
attorney general on the Waco issue, one department official
replied, ``God, no!''
</P>
<P>
   Reno was on her way to Panama Tuesday evening on business and is
to return on Thursday. The department official speculated that Reno
might even make a final decision and have an announcement ready
upon her return, rather than waiting until after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman reached at his home
Tuesday night, declined to comment extensively. ``She is still
working through her options,'' Marlin said of Reno. ``She has
pledged to get to the bottom of this, and that's what she will
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general and the FBI director have had policy
differences before, most notably over how to investigate political
fund-raising irregularities arising from President Clinton's 1996
campaign. Freeh strongly favored an independent counsel to conduct
the inquiry but Reno decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department officials who discussed the Waco episode
Tuesday evening emphasized that there was no such friction between
the two this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco controversy has prompted heated reaction in Congress,
as evidenced by Tuesday's signal from Hyde that he might favor a
joint House-Senate commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no final decision'' on the commission, said Sam
Stratman, a House Judiciary Committee spokesman. ``We're trying to
work our way through this and find some solution that might remove
this entire affair from the political fever swamp.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility said to be under discussion was a commission
with subpoena power made up initially of two Republicans and two
Democrats. The four would then pick a fifth, potentially
tie-breaking member.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the staff of the House Government Reform Committee
drew up a new batch of subpoenas Tuesday in its fledgling inquiry
into the Waco matter. A committee spokesman said they would be
served on the FBI, Justice Department and Defense Department. The
committee is said to be interested in what role the Army's secret
Delta Force played in the FBI operation. The Pentagon has said
three Army special forces officers were at the scene but only as
observers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Government Reform Committee subpoenaed records
held by Texas law-enforcement officials related to the use of the
tear-gas devices in question.

PAINFUL TIME FOR SAMPRAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Was it a totally meaningless shot heard by nobody
that is echoing around the world?
</P>
<P>
   Did the wound caused by that scrimmage shot scramble tennis
history yet to be written, and jam the guy who intended to write
it?
</P>
<P>
   The guy's morose face told Tuesday's story at the US Open, and
described the alteration of days to come in the sport he has held
in his right hand for practically a decade. Pete Sampras wouldn't
have had to open his mouth to his inquisitors. The fact of his
disabling back wound still would have been apparent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the face of a guy hemorrhaging all over the place _
emotionally, physically, professionally, financially. No blood
evident. No, but the pain was across his drooping countenance, and
in his wavering, even teary, voice. Sampras was not going to race
victoriously across Flushing Meadow for a fifth time. He was not
going to set the record for major championships, not in this
century, anyway. And maybe never.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras loses this championship on a technical knockout _
herniated disc _ even before he goes into the rectangle. That never
has happened to a No. 1 before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought of even picking up a racket . . .,'' he said, his
voice trailing off.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the money part, though. Sampras won't even notice the
$750,000 he could have won, or the resulting endorsements. No pain
there.
</P>
<P>
   Good health billionaires can't buy, and that suddenly vanished
Sunday afternoon in one flick of a racket, the shock of how quickly
everything changed for him that contorted his handsome face. The
pain is bodily actual _ ``everything I do, even ordinary stuff, and
any bending, is limited and hurts'' _ and brain-straining, too.
``I'm bummed,'' he said. ``It couldn't have come at a worse time,
the way I've been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   He has won 24 of 25 starts, including a sixth Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
   A three-day beard told you both sides. Even the simple movements
of shaving hurt.
</P>
<P>
   It all started during a routine practice session at the Meadow
with Gustavo Kuerten, the Brazilian winner of the French Open a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was good and warm, we'd hit for a half-hour,'' said Sampras.
``No problem there. We started playing points.''
</P>
<P>
   And along came the shot that immediately wrecked the Open for
him and kept 62-year-old Roy Emerson's men's record of 12 major
singles titles from being eclipsed in its 33d year. It may also
prevent Sampras from extending his own pro record to a seventh
successive year of camping on the pinnacle of No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a return of serve, a backhand,'' he said. ``I hit the
ball and I felt something go. The pain _ it was like being stabbed
by a knife. I was scared. I walked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had back spasms that night. I was very sore. But I've had
some back problems before. Spasms. I played through them. I wasn't
too worried. The doctor thought I'd be fine after a couple of days'
rest, ready to go Wednesday. So did I.''
</P>
<P>
   But when there was no improvement, Dr. Brian Hainline wisely
prescribed an MRI and a CAT scan, discovering the slight rip in the
disk.
</P>
<P>
   When a spine carrying a great athlete is stricken, a disk
herniates, a career can hang like a curveball: vulnerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caught it early,'' said Hainline. ``Pete'll be back after
rest and work with a spinal therapist, in one or two months.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the career of a Sampras predecessor on the Flushing
throne, Ivan Lendl, champ in 1985-86-87, was ended by a similar
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fluke,'' said Sampras. ``I've had injuries, but
nothing like this. I'm not unlucky. There's a reason for it, a
reason for everything, and I'll figure it out in a while. I'll be
back. There's plenty of tennis left in me.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a guy who has enjoyed such good fortune at the Meadow _
titles in 1990, '93, '95-96 _ he also has been very unlucky. Never
has a brilliant champion been so brittle. This was his fifth
accident at the Meadow, mishaps that have cost him possibly four
more titles.
</P>
<P>
   Dehydrated by his 1992 semifinal win over Jim Courier, he was
IV'd but didn't have enough juice left for the final, a four-set
loss to Stefan Edberg. Bursting blisters made his feet a bloody
mess in a fourth-round loss to Jaime Yzaga in 1994, yet Sampras
battled gamely for five sets. His famous upchucking quarterfinal
against Alex Corretja in 1996 didn't get him chucked, though, and
he hung on through illness and a match point to proceed to the
title. But a strained thigh last year may have cost him the
five-set loss to champ Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is a fragile champ, but an overcoming one even though he
probably doesn't train as hard as he should. Touched by a genetic
dysfunction, thalassemia, causing anemia, he tires quickly and
fears overextending himself. This may account for his refusal to
play singles in the Davis Cup loss to Australia in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his grittiness is unquestionable and the record shows him
rising through fatigue and injury to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Prime guys, No. 1's, have lost early at other Opens. Stefan
Edberg fell to Russian Aleksandr Volkov in the first round of 1990,
and John Newcombe was beaten at the outset by Jan Kodes in 1971.
But Sampras, a first in so many departments, is the first to fall
before the national anthem. His inability to enter the starting
gate opens the tournament spectacularly, particularly for Andre
Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   After numerous grimaces, Sampras drew the only laugh of a dour
press conference, reporting that Agassi had phoned in his sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a classy act,'' Sampras said, smiling for the only
time. ``And he didn't call to tell me about his first-round win.''

C. ROLAND CHRISTENSEN, 80, PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Mass., Minn. Iowa, South Africa, Ill., Fla.)   By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   C. Roland Christensen, an influential Harvard Business School
professor who helped create the field of business strategy and was
an authority on the use of the case method in teaching, died on
Saturday. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   He died at St. Thomas Hospital in Nashville from complications
after open-heart surgery in June, according to the business school.
He had lived in Nashville since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A faculty member at the Harvard Business School for more than 40
years, Christensen was renowned for his ability to foster student
discussion in class. ``He had a particular gift in engaging each
person in the excitement of this inquiry,'' said Kenneth R.
Andrews, who taught with Christensen at Harvard and is a professor
emeritus at the business school.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as what one of his former students, Ian M. Cumming,
described as an orchestra leader, Christensen would carefully watch
the reaction of his students and then decide on whom to call to
keep the discussion going among the 80 or so in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were remarkably lively classes,'' recalled Cumming, who
is now chairman of the Leucadia National Corp.. Only on the last
day of his course on business policy would Christensen ask the
class for permission to share his own thoughts on the topic,
Cumming recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the mid-1970s, Christensen worked to improve the
quality of teaching throughout the university, offering seminars to
faculty members and working with the medical school to introduce
more discussion in its courses. In 1984, Christensen was named to a
university professorship, the first member of the business school
faculty to hold this university-wide position. He received the
business school's distinguished service award in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Andrews, Christensen was a founder of the study of
business strategy. While previous teaching had focused narrowly on
business problems and possible solutions, this area served as a
kind of ``practitioner's theory,'' according to Andrews. The
intention was to look at the broad issues determining a company's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen wrote or helped write numerous case studies and
books. He also served as a director of numerous companies,
including the Cabot Corp. and Cooper Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tyler, Minn., Christensen grew up in Iowa City, where
his father was a history professor at the University of Iowa. His
mother taught at a small college in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Iowa in 1941,
Christensen earned an MBA from Harvard in 1943. He then served as a
captain in the Army's Quartermaster Corps for three years.
Afterward, he returned to the business school to teach and continue
his education. He earned his doctorate in commercial science in
1953 and was named a full professor in 1958. He retired in 1990,
although he continued teaching and writing.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen is survived by his wife of more than 55 years,
Dorothy; two sons, Philip R., of Pretoria, South Africa, and S.
Eric, of Palatka, Fla.; two daughters, Ann Christensen-Badger, of
Wilmette, Ill., and Joan Beck, of Nashville; and four
grandchildren.

RUTHARDT DECISION COULD BOOST AUTO INSURANCE PREMIUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts auto insurers say a decision last week
by Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt on workers' compensation
shows she made a mistake in computing this year's auto rates that
could pave the way for a hefty increase in auto premiums next year.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance officials and consumer advocates say Ruthardt's
workers' compensation decision took a pro-industry position on
company profits that is sharply at odds with the profit section of
this year's auto rate case.
</P>
<P>
   If Ruthardt sets auto rates for next year using the same profits
methodology she employed in the workers' compensation case,
officials say consumers will have to pay an extra $150 million in
overall premiums. If she takes a different approach, she opens the
door for an industry appeal on the grounds of inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess,'' said Stephen J. D'Amato, a lawyer and consumer
advocate on insurance issues. ``The commissioner is in a bind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt was not available for an interview, but in response to
inquiries from the Globe she left a brief telephone message
indicating she believed the auto and workers' compensation cases
were unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both cases were looked at individually based on the evidence
presented,'' she said. ``They offer very different lines of
insurance. They have in fact different regulations governing how
the hearings are held.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ruthardt in the workers' compensation case, which
resulted in a 20.3 percent reduction in rates (partly because of
reduced claims and less lost work time), rejected arguments put
forth by the State Rating Bureau that she was bound by her earlier
decision on auto insurance profits.
</P>
<P>
   But industry officials say the two conflicting rulings place
Ruthardt in an awkward position. Daniel Johnston, president of the
Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts, said the workers'
compensation ruling shows Ruthardt made a mistake with last year's
auto rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there's any difference between the two lines of
insurance,'' he said. ``The philosophies are the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said the industry, which is seeking a 7.8 percent
increase in auto insurance rates next year, would probably appeal
any Ruthardt ruling on profits that is not consistent with her
latest ruling on workers' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   According to insurance industry officials, state regulators in
the past have always taken the same approach in calculating profits
for workers' compensation and auto insurance. That approach held
that investing in the insurance business is risky and investors
need to be properly rewarded for bearing that risk.
</P>
<P>
   But in her auto rate decision last year, Ruthardt accepted the
argument put forth by the State Rating Bureau that investors in the
insurance industry are willing to accept lower returns because
those investments tend to act as a hedge against stock market
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said Ruthardt's ruling effectively meant that insurance
industry investors were entitled to a lower return than if they
invested in US Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   In the workers' compensation case, the insurance industry argued
that the approach put forth in the auto insurance case lacked
credibility. Ruthardt's ruling effectively endorsed that argument,
although she insists the two cases are unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said the contradictory rulings create the potential for
confusion with this year's auto rate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she rules against the insurers, they can be expected to
claim that the result is inconsistent with the recent workers'
compensation decision,'' he said. ``If she rules in favor of the
insurers, the attorney general can rightfully claim that the result
is inconsistent with the last auto decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, there would be uncertainty and confusion,'' he
said. ``An appeal wouldn't be decided until the middle of 2000 at
the earliest. And insurers would have to make blind decisions about
safe driver and group discounts long before then.''
</P>
<P>
   One way out of the mess would be for the industry, the State
Rating Bureau and the attorney general's office, the three parties
involved in the rate-setting process, to come to an agreement on
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the attorney general's office declined comment.

WALDO COHN, A DEVELOPER OF PLUTONIUM FOR THE ATOM BOMB, DIES AT
89  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Calif. Mass. Ill., Mo., Ore. )   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Waldo Cohn, a biochemist involved in building the world's
first nuclear bomb and later a pioneer in using radioactive
isotopes for medical research, died on Friday at a hospital in Oak
Ridge, Tenn., where he lived. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Cohn worked on the Manhattan Project in Oak
Ridge and helped create plutonium for the bomb dropped on Hiroshima
by using a process known as ion exchange chromatography in the
splitting of uranium atoms.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he founded a symphony orchestra that is still
performing today.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the technique Cohn used to create plutonium was
used to identify the components of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA,
and it became crucial in understanding how genetic material
transferred its information into protein molecules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cohn's method enabled biochemists to clarify the structure as
well as function of the RNA,'' said Dr. Alvin M. Weinberg, a friend
and a former director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. ``In
those days, it was not clear what the functions of nucleic acids
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn was also the first scientist to organize, promote and
distribute radioactive isotopes produced in nuclear reactors for
use in medical research and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The widespread use of these isotopes is perhaps the most
important scientific byproduct of the Manhattan Project,'' Weinberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Waldo Cohn was born in San Francisco. He received bachelor's,
master's and doctoral degrees from the University of California at
Berkeley. He was doing postdoctoral research at Harvard Medical
School in 1943 when he joined the Manhattan Project at the
Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. He moved to
Oak Ridge the next year.
</P>
<P>
   After the atomic bomb was dropped, Cohn joined many other
scientists in calling for the weapon to be controlled by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Cohn was elected chairman of the town advisory council
in Oak Ridge. As chairman, he pushed through a resolution urging
the federal government to include the town and its schools in an
order desegregating military bases that had just been signed by
President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, however, mounted a drive to remove Cohn, and
eventually he stepped down from the post of chairman but served out
his two-year term on the council.
</P>
<P>
   From 1962 to 1997, he was editor of the annual series of
monographs Progress in Nucleic Acid Research, and for many years he
helped name new biochemicals. He also received two Guggenheim
Fellowships and a Fulbright Research Scholarship. He wrote scores
of scientific papers, and he was a fellow of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn retired from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1975 but
continued as a consultant for several years. He is survived by his
wife, Charmian; a brother, Roy, of Berkeley; two sons, Marcus, of
Hood River, Ore., and Dunell, of St. Louis, and four grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn was also an amateur cellist who continued to perform until
two years ago. Shortly after arriving in Oak Ridge, he founded
Tennessee's oldest continuing symphony orchestra, the Oak Ridge
Symphony, which is now 55 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his best known musical accomplishment was the conducting
of the symphony in its 1952 performance of the premiere of the
first serious musical composition inspired by the atomic age:
``Overture to a Dedication of a Nuclear Reactor,'' composed by
Arthur Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The piece was dedicated to Cohn.

HURDLE TO NET GROWTH SEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Poll some of the Internet's top technical gurus and
each might name a different issue as the chief impediment to the
growth of the on-line medium.
</P>
<P>
   But when just such a group was assembled at Harvard University
Tuesday, there did seem to be a near-consensus that one of the
biggest problems isn't technical so much as social: the large
number of people who presently lack the skills to make full use of
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be a big bottleneck, more than any technology,'' said
Leonard Kleinrock, a professor at the University of California at
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Just how to solve the problem was a matter of some dispute _ and
the point of the panel discussion held in Sanders Theatre, part of
a conference sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery.
</P>
<P>
   The technical organization, based in New York, held a special
meeting to review the technical history and outlook of the Internet
and drew some of the chief academic and industry figures whose work
in the 1960s through the 1980s laid the foundations of the
international computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting the outlook for the new medium would seem a
formidable task, in an era when many advances are made by obscure
Internet start-ups rather than in famous university labs.
</P>
<P>
   But conference organizer Lyman Chapin, chief technology officer
of GTE Internetworking in Cambridge, said young entrepreneurs might
gain some insight into the process through which the Internet has
evolved _ a goal that seemed to be borne out by the several hundred
twenty and thirtysomethings who turned out to hear the public
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to think of the people who invented the Internet as
a bunch of graybeards,'' Chapin said. ``But I think there's a lot
of room to combine their energy and ideas with what's happening
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's discussion touched on many technical issues, such as
how to improve current Internet codes to express Asian language
characters, or the most economic ways to connect masses of
individual homes to high-speed data networks.
</P>
<P>
   Some fundamental themes came up as well, chiefly just how much
knowledge designers of new networks and Web sites should assume
among the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Not much, implied Kleinrock, the UCLA professor, best known for
developing ways to move data quickly over high-speed digital
networks. He argued the increasing complexity of software has
already begun to discourage many potential new users. They suffer
from what he called ``feature shock,'' or a disinclination to
relearn fancy new software programs every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of just how much ability humans have to learn
a new technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Kahn, who began a key networking program as a
Pentagon official in 1973, suggested the opposite: that more people
might be trained with programming skills of their own. Such steps,
said former IBM researcher Paul Green, would help bring populations
on line in poorer areas and in the developing countries. The issue
is not more to distribute more expensive hardware, he said, but
rather how much it costs general users to ``get friendly'' with
software and technology in general.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ultimate academic answer came from Dave Clark, a
senior researcher at MIT, who called for more research into exactly
what Internet users want. ``We techies tend to be presumptuous,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of Tuesday's conference featured war stories from
the senior scientists, told in what the conference program
described as ``a collective oral history format.''
</P>
<P>
   One popular speaker was David Walden, a retired engineer who
once helped Cambridge-based BBN Corp. build computers used to send
the first digital messages over a West Coast data network 30 years
ago next month.
</P>
<P>
   The devices were built to the specifications of the University
of California researchers who conducted tests of the system, Walden
recalled. But at the same time, the machines were configured to
specifications set by the US military agencies who paid for the
early research _ and who were wary of curious academics who might
make changes without permission, what would later be known as
``hacking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked very hard at trying to have this thing run in what
they consdered the hostile university environment,'' Walden said.

MANY PARENTS IN DETROIT SUPPORT STRIKING TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ There is nothing like a last-minute teachers strike to
throw parenthood into chaos, but in this heavily unionized city,
many parents lined up Tuesday to support the strike that left them
unexpectedly spending the day with their children.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was supposed to be the first day of school, but instead,
it became the first day of a nasty labor standoff between the
teachers union and the school board appointed this year to fix
Detroit's ailing school system. Across the city, teachers headed to
school as planned. But they picketed outside rather than set foot
in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents applauded them. ``If they get more money, it is all
right with me,'' said Warren D. Wright, 47, a Detroit resident with
three children in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Because Wright was not scheduled to head for his union job at a
nearby Chrysler factory until late afternoon, he spent the morning
watching as his children took turns buzzing around a vacant lot in
a go-cart and talked about why he supports teachers fighting for a
raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to watch all these crazy kids,'' Wright said. ``I
think they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, against union leaders' recommendations, members of
the Detroit Federation of Teachers rejected a 10-day contract
extension that would have allowed negotiations to continue after
Detroit's 178,000 students returned to school. Teachers want
smaller classes, the relaxation of a rigid attendance policy and
raises of 2 percent to 10 percent that would bring Detroit
teachers' pay up to the median for those in the three-county area.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit School Board had offered raises amounting to 95
percent of what the union asked for, which would translate to
salaries of $35,600 to $64,000 a year depending on seniority for
teachers with master's degrees. The board announced Tuesday that
classes would be canceled on Wednesday because most teachers went
on strike.
</P>
<P>
   With classes canceled, Elouise King spent the day watching four
nieces and nephews, along with a neighbor's child. Nonetheless, Ms.
King said, ``I think the teachers deserve more money, and they
shouldn't work without a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who had to go to work scrambled for a place to leave
their children. About 25 children spent Tuesday at Camp Detroit, a
summer cultural arts camp that was scheduled to close last week,
but was kept open because of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those children otherwise would be stuck in front of TV's or
cared for by siblings who aren't really old enough,'' said Njia
Kai, 44, the camp's director.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan A. Blakey, a high school gym teacher who worries about
safety when he takes the 62 students in his class swimming, said
that Detroit teachers are dedicated and care deeply about their
students, but that they are frustrated that the school board has
not agreed to class size reductions and raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not appreciated and we're not given the material to
enhance the students' learning ability,'' Blakey said as he
picketed in front of Osborn High.
</P>
<P>
   Passing drivers honked in support of the pickets, as is the
custom here when striking auto workers picket in front of factory
gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 7,000 teachers, so they're not going to replace
everybody,'' said Blakey, 37. ``It's not like people are jumping
for the jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In this long-troubled school district, where half of all
students do not graduate from high school, nearly a page of the
union contract covers how teachers can be sure to get paid if they
must miss work because a student has assaulted them. Such
provisions are not seen as necessary in most suburban districts,
where teachers are paid more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do their job; can they do ours?'' asked Michael
Casteel, 48, the union's representative at Osborn High, where there
are about 2,300 students and 120 teachers, whose pay ranges from
$32,000 to $59,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Casteel described the special challenges he and other teachers
faced _ beyond the regular annoyance of having roughly one car a
month stolen or vandalized in the teachers' parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get kids that come to us that don't read, that can't do
basic math,'' Casteel said, and there are some students ``that are
out of class because of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers said the strike was the fault of the Detroit School
Board that was appointed in March after the Republican-controlled
state Legislature voted to transfer control from an elected school
board to the mayor and governor. The union had supported the
change. But many strikers accused Republican Gov. John Engler and
the school board's interim leader of trying to bust the union, and
others said the new school board has shown little support for those
on the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are imposing a lot of things on the teacher, but so far
they haven't made any new demands on the administrators or on the
students' parents to get the kids to school,'' said Bernard A.
Sutter, 40, a ninth-grade science teacher at Osborn who last year
won the Detroit-area educator of the year award from the state
science teachers' organization.
</P>
<P>
   The science lab is so poorly equipped that he uses makeshift
equipment. ``The most sophisticated things I used last year were
stopwatches,'' Sutter said.
</P>
<P>
   The school board leader, David Adamany, said emotions are
running high here in part because of Detroit's history as a union
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we have a school district in educational distress,
change is going to be necessary,'' Adamany said. ``I would hope
that the teachers would join in for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question for every big city in the industrial states of
the Northeast is the same: Does being a union town mean you can't
have a quality public school system?'' he said in an interview
Tuesday. ``The answer to that question must be no or the children
in the industrialized, union cities are lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers said they were no more eager for a strike than Adamany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a horrible thing to be on strike _ we all have
mortgages, we all have kids to support,'' said Kathleen A.
McComsey, 49, a fifth-grade language and math teacher at Fleming
Elementary. ``But this is a union town.''

<P>
   Scores on the College Board exams remained roughly constant last
year compared with the previous year, as boys continued to outscore
girls by more than 40 points and white students continued to do
better than underrepresented minorities, according to figures
released Tuesday by the College Board.
</P>
<P>
   Scores for graduating seniors remained relatively flat despite
the larger number of students taking advanced placement courses,
which cover college-level material. The number of students taking
those courses jumped 11 percent, to 704,298, including 349,300
graduating seniors. The number taking the the tests themselves rose
to a record 2 million, including 1.2 million graduating seniors, 4
percent more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Boys who graduated from high school this year received an
average of 509 on the verbal exam and 531 on the math, the same as
in 1998. Girls who graduated this year scored an average of 502 on
the verbal and 495 on the math test. Their verbal score was the
same as a year earlier, but their math score fell a point. (Scores
on each test range from 200 to 800.)
</P>
<P>
   The one-point decline in the girls' math score widened the
difference between girls and boys to 43 points. That is the highest
since 1993, when the difference was 47 points.
</P>
<P>
   College Board officials say that a major reason that boys
continue to outscore girls in math is that boys still take more
math courses. Also, a higher proportion of girls take the College
Board exams than boys, so they represent a broader group of
students with wider-ranging abilities, which tends to pull down
average scores.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board's new president, Gaston Caperton, the former
governor of West Virginia, played down the gender gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differential is so small, and the number of women at
selective colleges is more than the number of men, so I don't think
it has had much of an effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Monty Neill, executive director of Fairtest, an advocacy
group based in Cambridge, Mass., said the gap is ``clearly
significant because college admissions are in part decided on these
tests and a lot of special programs and scholarships are largely
awarded based on test scores.'' ``Our view is that the test itself
is biased,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   White students also continued to do better than most
underrepresented minorities. White students showed a one-point gain
on the verbal test and no gains on the math test over last year's
results. Scores for black students remained the same on the verbal
test and fell four points in math. Overall scores for Hispanic
students were also lower, except for Puerto Rican students, whose
scores were up three points in verbal and one point in math.
</P>
<P>
   The Educational Testing Service, the company that administers
the College Board tests, is in the early stages of developing a
formula to help colleges adjust scores for members of minorities
and other students who have fewer educational advantages, providing
a kind of handicapping system.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts, College Board officials said Tuesday, did not
suggest that the current scores were less valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at SAT scores in a broader context is something
admissions people have done for years,'' said Gretchen Rigol, vice
president for special projects at the College Board. ``Though there
are lots of people interested in this research, it is far from
being operational.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, which reported on the ETS project
Tuesday, said the proposed formula would try to identify
``strivers'' whose scores were significantly above what they might
be expected to score given their education and socioeconomic
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington Tuesday, Caperton
acknowledged that some students have more advantages than others,
which is likely to be reflected in their test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SAT's are a measure of a student's readiness for college
and describes what currently exists,'' he said. ``What currently
exists is a system where people of different races and backgrounds
are not getting the same opportunities, and that is reflected in
the SAT scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Caperton said the College Board had no plans to change the exams
in the way it changed the preliminary College Board tests, which
are used in determining candidates for National Merit Scholarships,
in 1997. At that time, under pressure from the U.S. Department of
Education's Office of Civil Rights, the board added a third section
_ a writing test _ to the math and verbal tests that made up the
exam. The change has resulted in girls winning a larger proportion
of merit scholarships than they had previously.

   Customers, professional Beanie traders and even the company's
own employees were dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Has Ty, led by founder Ty Warner and based in Oakbrook, Ill.,
simply created a gimmick to pump up profits of the pint-sized
stuffed animals, which toy industry experts say have begun to lose
some of their appeal? Or is the company effectively resigned to the
fact that Pokemon now rules and is moving on? No one knows for
sure. But what is certain is that Ty, at least for now, has created
a Beanie buzz that is not likely to be sorted out any time soon, as
company executives remained mum.
</P>
<P>
   As news seeped out, Internet chat rooms went crazy, bids flooded
into online auction houses and parents began to fret over what to
tell their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last half-hour we've had a 50 percent increase in
bids,'' said John Babina, founder of Collectingnation.com, which
operates Beanienation.com, an online auction site that trades
Beanie Babies. Its live chat room, Babina said, ``was filled this
afternoon right after the announcement came out.''
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas, Nev., Pamela Cocherl was trying to figure out what
to tell her 10-year-old. ``I think it will be sad for the kids,''
said Ms. Cocherl, an administrative assistant at a weekly
classified newspaper, whose daughter, McKenzie, has 18 Beanies.
</P>
<P>
   Ty did nothing to clear up the confusion on its own Web site
Tuesday. Customers who turned to the company for guidance were
ignored. One customer who left a message on the site pleaded: ``Ty,
are you ever going to make beanies again after the thirty first of
December. Please reply.''
</P>
<P>
   People who called the company seeking information did no better.
A customer service representative reached at Ty said the staff
members had been told of the ``retirement'' only Tuesday afternoon.
``We were barely informed like a half-hour ago,'' said the
representative, who identified herself only as Laura. ``At this
point we have to get through to our managers and I have no further
information.''
</P>
<P>
   A supervisor at Ty said she also had no idea what the
announcement meant. The manager, who said her name was Denise,
refused to forward requests for an interview with Warner or other
senior-level executives.
</P>
<P>
   Around 3:30 p.m., Ty listed the announcement on its Web site
under a listing of new Beanies, including one named ``The End,'' a
black bear. The posting came several weeks after the company said
that ``a very important newsflash will be made Aug. 31.''
</P>
<P>
   Toy industry experts said it was unlikely the message meant that
Ty would cease to make toys altogether. Rather, they said, the
company will likely introduce new Beanies next year or replace them
with an entirely different product line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine it's a gimmick,'' said Chris Byrne, a toy
industry consultant and editor of the Toy Report, a weekly
newsletter. ``The backlash from Beanie collectors, people who
really invested a lot to build their collections, would be huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Children, who first elevated the toys to must-have status by
buying them with their own money and trading them at school, would
also likely throw a tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could make more,'' said McKenzie, the Las Vegas girl with
18 beanies. If the toy maker is not being honest about its
intentions, McKenzie said, she would be upset because that would be
lying. ``They want you to buy as many as you can before everyone
else,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of Beanie Babies initially was their price of $4 to
$5, which made them affordable to children from families in
virtually every income level. But shortly after their 1993
introduction, parents got in on the fun, making many Beanies
must-have collectibles that went for tens of thousands of dollars
and were off-limits to their children.
</P>
<P>
   But one large collector said Tuesday that the speculation among
dealers is that Ty simply planned to introduce dozens of new
beanies next year and that the retirement was simply manufactured
to help the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secondary market has collapsed the market in the last six
months,'' said George Papania of Georges Video Games and
Collectables in Las Vegas. ``What we did was retaliate for the fact
that they kept these things out too long without retiring them.''
</P>
<P>
   Though dealers in collectibles do not buy from Ty directly,
their purchasing activity directly affects the company's sales
because specialty retailers base their orders in large part on
their resale value in the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
   Ty's move Tuesday was just the sort of stunt dealers had been
hoping for, said Papania, who has about 13,000 Beanies at his
store. ``I will stock up on everything I can get now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Inc., which is a private company, saw revenue soar since the
introduction of Beanie Babies, topping an estimated $250 million
within three years.
</P>
<P>
   An elusive marketing whiz known for attention-grabbing
promotions, Warner rarely gives interviews. The company is also
known for its insular culture. In a blatant display of its
perceived omnipotence, the company last year had its phone number
unlisted. Around the same time, the company angered smaller
retailers by cutting back on their orders without warning and
dropping them as customers if they reduced the prices of the toys.
</P>
<P>
   Now, toy industry experts say, the company may momentarily drive
demand but could anger its most loyal customers. After all, said
Sid Good, president of Good Marketing Inc., which specializes in
marketing to children, ``consumers out in the market give value to
collectible lines in the first place.'' l

SYSTEM FOR A QUICK PASS THROUGH IMMIGRATION AT AIRPORTS HAS FEW
USERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Fla., N.J., Calif., Wash., Hawaii, Ga.,
Mass. Ill, Ohio. Texas, Mich. Minn., Mo.)   By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An automated system at eight airports now allows international
business travelers to bypass long immigration lines and get on
their way more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But the program has not expanded as quickly as federal officials
had anticipated. Part of the reason for that could be that some
eligible travelers may not have enrolled simply because they cannot
imagine that anyone in authority is actually interested in making
life easier for the frequent business traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Some business travelers could well be skeptical of ``the idea of
the government wanting to facilitate'' their convenience, Eyleen
Schmidt, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service, conceded with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   So federal inspectors on duty at the sometimes interminable
immigrations lines at the eight participating airports have begun
handing out packets of information to passengers who appear to be
eligible for the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Automated
Passenger Accelerated Service System, which is known as Inspass.
Passengers can fill out enrollment forms and get their hands
electronically ``profiled'' at Inspass offices at the participating
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Once enrolled, passengers receive identification cards that
allow them to ``zip around the immigrations lines,'' Ms. Schmidt
said. This is done by scanning their cards and passing their hands
through automatic readers that validate identities. Average
processing times are 20 seconds or less, Ms. Schmidt said, though
business travelers have experienced some small delays when an
electronic system is down.
</P>
<P>
   The Inspass program has been rolled out slowly, but since 1995
it has processed more than 300,000 admissions to the United States.
In the last year, enrollment has more than doubled, to about 45,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Some business travelers, seeing fellow passengers hustle through
the automated system while they stand in line, may assume that only
tycoons and the otherwise well-connected are eligible. Ms. Schmidt
said, ``the only requirement for eligibility is that you travel on
business more than two times a year.'' (Those with criminal
records, including tycoons, are not eligible.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides Americans, Canadians and citizens of the 26 countries
participating in the multinational Visa Waiver Pilot Program _ who
otherwise meet the business-travel requirements _ are also
eligible. Among the countries participating in the visa waiver
program are Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Inspass kiosks are now operating at these airports: Kennedy
International (International Arrivals, Terminal 4; American
Airlines, Terminal 8; British Airways, Terminal 7, and Delta Air
Lines, Terminal 2); Los Angeles International; Newark
International; Miami International; San Francisco International;
Dulles International, and at U.S. immigration preclearance sites at
Pearson International in Toronto and Vancouver International.
</P>
<P>
   Given the high satisfaction rates among participants, the agency
was ready to expand the service quickly to 23 airports that serve
significant numbers of Americans returning home from international
business trips. But financing for the hardware to operate the
program was reduced in the last year, so current plans are to
expand the program only to Seattle and Honolulu by the end of this
year. Plans for expanding to Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Cincinnati;
Dallas-Fort Worth; Detroit; Houston; Minneapolis; Montreal;
Orlando, Fla.; Ottawa; St. Louis, and a yet-to-be-chosen location
are now on hold.
</P>
<P>
   The card, which is free, is good for one year at every location.
Users must still carry a passport, in case a technical glitch
required a visit to a live INS inspector at a booth. Travelers must
also still pass through customs.
</P>
<P>
   Enrolling involves filling out INS form I-823, which can be
obtained and processed at the Inspass enrollment offices at the
eight participating airports. The form can also be downloaded from
the Web at www .ins.usdoj.gov/graphics/howdoi/inspass.htm. ``We
estimate that for those who use the system we can get you from the
jet way to the street in a total of 20 minutes or less,'' Ms.
Schmidt said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIDE TRIPS
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of all Americans who make trips of 50 miles or
more attend a sporting event while traveling, according to a recent
survey by the Travel Industry Association of America. Baseball is
the favorite attraction, followed by football, basketball and auto
racing. Business travelers are the biggest spenders. Anyone
spending $500 or more at a stadium or arena is probably traveling
on business, the survey found. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: FANS WILL MISS PETE SOON ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fans scurry around the premises, looking for
upsets, looking for interesting new players, chasing down phenomena
like Alexandra Stevenson suffering a sundown massacre. They can
convince themselves that Master Pete is still in there, whacking
down somebody in three sets, in front of a few thousand die-hards
in Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For now, they can overlook that a bad disk in Pete Sampras' back
forced him to withdraw from this year's U.S. Open, giving Good Old
Emmo, Roy Emerson, at least a few more months with a half share of
the record of 12 Grand Slam championships.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Pete was only a flurry of bad news in the air. Getting
the most from their day-session tickets, the spectators stayed out
in the bright sun and refreshing breeze from 11 a.m. to the dinner
hour. There was always a brisk trade at Louis Armstrong Stadium,
named for the great jazz trumpeter and gravel-voiced singer who
lived in nearby Corona for decades. Once the concert hall of the
World's Fair of 1964-65, it was later converted expediently but
clumsily into the main court of the new National Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong Stadium is where Bjorn Borg played his last match,
where Steffi Graf won her Grand Slam, where Pete Sampras retched
and John McEnroe kvetched and Jimbo Connors mugged opponents and
officials with equal-opportunity gall.
</P>
<P>
   Now with Arthur Ashe Stadium towering just to the west _ too big
to generate any warmth _ Armstrong Stadium has been scaled back to
a human dimension of 10,000 seats, the bulk of them first-come,
first-served. People go there because they want to go there.
</P>
<P>
   Given the country-club roots that tennis is still trying to get
past, it is more than a little cool that the two main stadiums at
the United States Open are named for African-Americans. Now why not
go for the trifecta and name the charming little grandstand, still
attached to the Armstrong, after Althea Gibson, the first great
black female player?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the fans flocked to Armstrong Stadium for an upset loss
by Tim Henman to Guillermo Canas, stayed for Jennifer Capriati's
big victory over Iva Majoli, enjoyed a romp by Gustavo Kuerten over
Bohdan Ulihrach, then cheered Monica Seles' defeat of Barbara
Rittner in the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the sunset smiling obliquely, a few thousand
hard-core fans postponed dinner for the fifth match. The show-court
placement could have been represented as a tribute to Nathalie
Tauziat of France, the 11th-seeded player, but nobody was kidding
anybody. Since Alexandra Stevenson burst into the public domain at
Wimbledon this summer, Open fans have been waiting for a glimpse of
her.
</P>
<P>
   At Wimbledon, while she was blasting her way into the
semifinals, Stevenson became famous through the revelation that her
father is the American basketball star, Julius Erving. Stevenson is
now being inspected for the looks and athletic ability of her
father, while her mother, Samantha Stevenson, who has written for
The New York Times, has been analyzed extensively without receiving
nearly enough attention for rearing an accomplished young woman.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball icon, who has been married since 1972, has been
criticized for denying, at first, his relationship to the young
tennis player; it is just possible that Erving's short public
stonewall was his way to maintain his silent commitment to
providing support for the young woman.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to be a public figure. It is not easy for a
tennis player to have so much height to control. It is not easy to
be 18. The fans who stayed at Armstrong Stadium did not see the
same cannonball serve that glanced capriciously off the pressed
lawns of Wimbledon. Tauziat sliced and diced on Stevenson,
returning her best forehands to the huge gap near Stevenson's
sluggish feet.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fans suddenly remembered they had been outdoors for
seven-plus hours. As famously polite as New Yorkers are, a few of
them even bolted without benefit of change-overs, while Tauziat was
dispatching Stevenson, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost to a tough player,'' Stevenson said, adding: ``Grass is
definitely a different game. My game is great on grass and it will
be great on hardcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fans had come to peer, but they would have also
liked to cheer. One day they will come to watch Alexandra Stevenson
for her forehand. The sooner the better. The Open goes on. Sometime
around Labor Day, the fans will swarm into Ashe Stadium and realize
it's true: Pete is not there.

CALPERS PLANS TO INVEST MORE AGGRESSIVELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California Public Employees' Retirement System said Tuesday
that it would invest as much as $11 billion in hedge funds and
other aggressive investments that have not been widely used by
public pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   Although hedge funds are popular with wealthy people and
endowments, only a handful of large state or other public funds
invest in them. Calpers, the nation's largest public pension
system, said it was doing so to increase returns.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds, with total assets under management estimated at as
much as $350 billion, are partnerships that, unlike mutual funds,
can borrow large sums of money, speculate in foreign currencies and
make big bets that stocks will decline.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Calpers, a $160-billion fund and pioneering
shareholder activist that is closely watched by other institutional
investors, could lead other public pension-fund managers to invest
greater amounts in hedge funds. The move also highlights how much
worries about hedge fund investing have eased in the year since the
near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management L.P. Despite recent
poor returns from managers of some of the biggest hedge funds,
including George Soros and Julian H. Robertson Jr., many funds have
outperformed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-Stock index, which has
returned 8.33 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Calpers board voted on Aug. 16 to raise the ceiling for
hedge funds and other ``hybrid'' investments to 25 percent of the
pension fund's $45-billion actively managed portfolio. The board
also approved the fund's first hedge fund investment, a commitment
of as much as $300 million to Pivotal Partners, a San Francisco
fund, managed by Pivotal Investment Management, that invests in
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Calpers defines hybrid funds as including market-neutral funds,
arbitrage funds and ``corporate governance'' funds that seek to
improve returns by influencing company managements. So far, it has
only $900 million invested in hybrid funds _ all in three corporate
governance funds. Calpers also has $7.5 billion invested in or
committed to alternative investments, including venture capital and
private equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   The pension fund cautioned that it was unlikely to invest
anything close to the full $11 billion anytime soon. ``Clearly,
that's just a ceiling for us,'' said Brad Pacheco, a Calpers
spokesman. ``We're slowly venturing into this.'' The fund will not
invest in highly leveraged funds or ``macro'' funds that make big
bets on currencies or global trends, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco said that Calpers' outlook for stocks and the market's
high current valuations were ``not even a factor'' in the decision.
The pension fund's officials were simply looking to increase
returns, he said. Calpers returned 12.5 percent in the year ended
in June and 16.8 percent annualized for the five years ended in
June, far below returns for the S.&AMP; P. 500 of 22.8 percent and 27.8
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   And while many hedge funds charge fees of 1 percent to 2 percent
of assets annually, and 20 percent of profits, Pacheco said Calpers
would seek to negotiate lower fees.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year by Greenwich Associates found that only 2
percent of public funds used hedge funds, compared with one-third
of endowments and 15 percent of big corporate pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly larger investments in hedge funds by public funds
could be detrimental to other hedge fund investors, said Jim
Hedges, managing director of LJH Global Investments, a hedge fund
consultant in Naples, Fla. ``It means,'' Hedges said, that ``more
of the `A' players will have their coffers filled with capital,''
making the best managers less available.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaders of a committee of business executives who
have endorsed a ban on unlimited campaign contributions said
Tuesday that their members would not be intimidated by an
aggressive letter-writing campaign led by Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., one of the Senate's most ardent opponents of a bill that
would overhaul the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   In the letters, McConnell accused the group of trying to
``eviscerate private sector participation in politics'' by imposing
``anti-business speech controls.''
</P>
<P>
   None of nearly 20 members of an organization called the
Committee for Economic Development planned to resign from the
committee, as McConnell urged them to do in a series of letters
sent in late July, committee leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you will resign from CED,'' McConnell, the chairman of
the National Republican Senatorial Committee, scribbled near the
bottom of one letter sent to an unidentified senior executive of a
telecommunications corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Committee for Economic Development, which
includes executives of General Motors, Xerox, Merck and Sara Lee
Corp., refused to identify the executive or the corporation in the
one letter. But they did say that McConnell wrote letters to
executives who work for companies that have significant issues
pending before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kangas, a co-chairman of the CED committee that studied
the campaign finance system, said Tuesday that McConnell's letters
confirmed for him that the organization, which has enlisted more
than 100 current and retired executives to endorse new campaign
finance rules, was beginning to shape the contentious debate on the
subject on Capitol Hill. McConnell's letter-writing was first
reported on Sunday on the editorial page of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've been doing as a group of business leaders is
obviously beginning to have an impact,'' said Kangas, the chairman
and chief executive of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the accounting and
consulting firm. ``If we weren't having an impact, he would not be
communicating with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In his public statements, McConnell argues that current
campaign-finance legislation would infringe on free speech
protections of the First Amendment. Critics of the Republican
Party's position on the issue, however, say that Republicans are
motivated by the knowledge that they hold a commanding advantage in
raising campaign money from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell also wrote that he was ``astonished'' that the
executive's corporation had ``lent its name, prestige and
presumably financial backing'' to the Committee for Economic
Development, which he said was lobbying on behalf of a ``radical
campaign finance agenda.'' McConnell argued that the executive's
alliance with such a group had consequently damaged the reputation
of the executive's employer.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell wrote the letters in his role as chairman of the
National Republican Senate Committee, the party's major
fund-raising group for Senate candidates. His spokesman, Robert
Steurer, said that McConnell was unavailable for comment, and
referred questions to the National Republican Senate Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Law, executive director of the National Republican Senate
Committee, issued a brief statement Tuesday night, in which he
said: ``Nearly all the companies we contacted had no idea that CED
was throwing their name around in connection with campaign finance
reform and they were outraged that CED had hijacked their corporate
identity to sell a position with which they sharply disagreed.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives on the CED committee are speaking for themselves,
and not necessarily on behalf of their companies. Most of their
corporations still continue to give large sums to political parties
and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Kangas said that none of the executives who had received letters
had resigned and that he did not expect that any would leave the
committee. Indeed, Kangas, and other committee leaders, said they
had already recruited more executives in the past several days.
They said their goal was to have 300 executives endorse their
campaign finance proposals by late autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the people at CED have figured how just how
corrupt the campaign finance system is, and this letter is just an
example of what they already knew,'' Kangas said. ``Actually, we
are broadening the constituency of business leaders who recognize
that the campaign finance system is a real problem. Sen.
McConnell's letter has not had much impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters were seen by some as an attempt to intimidate the
members with the implied message: Resign and keep quiet or don't
count on doing business with Congress. ``The reaction was
interesting,'' Kangas said. ``These guys are running big
enterprises of their own. They are not easily intimidated. They
looked at the letter and most of them just chuckled and filed it
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is a 60-year-old business-led public policy and
research association based in Manhattan. Its leaders pride
themselves that it is fiercely nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kolb, the committee's president, said there was a
growing consensus in the business community that the campaign
finance system is ``out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives on the committee are urging Congress to prohibit
soft money, the unlimited donations that corporations give to
political parties. The committee also advocates increasing the
limit on individual contributions to $3,000 from the current limit
of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community, by and large, has been the provider of
soft money,'' said Kolb. ``These people are saying: We're tired of
being hit up and shaken down. Politics ought to be about something
besides hitting up companies for more and more money.''
</P>
<P>
   For two years, the committee's members studied the campaign
finance system, and said they were horrified at the public
perception that big donors received special favors in Washington.
In a report released in March, the committee wrote, ``The suspicion
of corruption deepens public cynicism and diminishes public
confidence in government. More important, these activities raise
the likelihood of actual corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   In a response to McConell sent last week, leaders of the
committee wrote, ``We know that a majority of the House and the
Senate supports campaign finance reform. That sentiment is also
shared by a growing number of business community leaders. We hope
that you will reconsider your opposition and enable the issue to be
discussed and voted on this fall in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Warren Buffett, the acclaimed value investor and chief
executive of Berkshire Hathaway, and Jerome Kohlberg, a founder of
the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., have tried
on their own to persuade chief executives of businesses to embrace
campaign finance reform measures. But many, though sympathetic,
refused to speak out because they did not want to rankle the
legislators on whom they depend.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the corporations of most of the executives on the
committee continue to give large sums to political parties and
candidates. The American subsidiary of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu,
Kangas' corporation, gave $185,300 to the Republican Party and
$41,725 to the Democratic Party in 1998, according to Federal
Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   Kangas said he disagreed with McConnell's position that campaign
contributions were protected by the First Amendment. ``I was a
little disappointed that he would suggest that freedom of speech
does not apply to us, but it applies to the people who agree with
him,'' Kangas said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Following is a letter that McConnell sent to a business
executive on the Committee for Economic Development, with the
recipient's name deleted by the committee:
</P>
<P>
   I was astonished to learn that ... has lent its name, prestige
and presumably financial backing to the Committee for Economic
Development in its all-out campaign to eviscerate private sector
participation in politics, through so-called ``campaign reform.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Committee for Economic Development joined hands
with Ralph Nader and the Sierra Club in taking out a full-page ad
in The Hill, demanding new campaign finance laws that would ban
corporate political activism and render the Republican Party
powerless to defend pro-business candidates from negative TV
attacks by labor unions, trial lawyers and radical
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   To legitimize its claim to represent the corporate community in
advocating anti-business speech controls, the Web site of the
Committee for Economic Development prominently lists ... as one of
the trustees that is ``engaged in implement(ing) their policy
recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   If you disagree with the radical campaign finance agenda of the
Committee for Economic Development and resent its abuse of your
company's reputation, I would think that public withdrawal from
this organization would be a reasonable response.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for considering my great concern over these
developments.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's letter of reply:
</P>
<P>
   We are responding to your letter of July 28 to several trustees
of the Committee for Economic Development (CED) urging them ``to
resign from CED'' because of our recent policy statement on
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Your letter refers to a full-page ad that CED and other
organizations sponsored urging the Senate to work toward meaningful
campaign finance reform. We make no apologies for expressing our
views and associating with groups such as AARP, the League of Women
Voters, and the Sierra Club. In our view, it is entirely
appropriate for groups with diverse interests to speak out jointly
on an issue that they believe threatens the vitality of our
participatory democracy. In fact, we find it ironic that you are
such a fervent defender of First Amendment freedoms but seem intent
to stifle our efforts to express publicly our concerns about a
campaign finance system that many feel is out of control. Efforts
to secure funding for the Republican Party should not be based on
silencing other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   You also accuse CED of an ``all-out campaign to eviscerate
private sector participation in politics.'' We respectfully submit
that you have misread our report. First, it is disingenuous to
imply that a business organization such as CED wants to silence the
private sector or is anti-business. Second, if CED's
recommendations were enacted tomorrow, there would be more, not
less, money available to finance elections. These funds would come
primarily from individual contributions _ either directly or
through political action committees _ not through loopholes in
existing laws that have created today's unregulated, apparently
limitless, flood of soft money. Our proposal would restore the
principle that campaign contributions should be made by individuals
not corporations or unions.
</P>
<P>
   We know that a majority of the House and the Senate supports
campaign finance reform. That sentiment is also shared by a growing
number of business community leaders. We hope that you will
reconsider your opposition and enable the issue to be discussed and
voted on this fall in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us at CED applaud your many years of public service. We
respect and share your commitment to the First Amendment. However,
many of our trustees happen to disagree with you on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   Frank Doyle, CED chairman
</P>
<P>
   Josh Weston, chair, Research and Policy Committee
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kolb, CED president

<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ As he wanders the nation prophesying a
political apocalypse, Alan L. Keyes, the staunchly conservative
radio talk show host, is the invisible man in the race for the
Republican presidental nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He gets few cameras at his events. Political analysts tend to
forget him in their prognostications. Polls show him receiving one
percent of the vote or less. And when the Log Cabin Republicans, a
homosexual group, issued a news release last week attacking
religious conservatives for intolerance, Keyes didn't even merit a
mention.
</P>
<P>
   But to his small yet devoted cadre of followers, Keyes is the
best kept secret of the campaign. To them, Keyes, a former Reagan
administration diplomat with a Harvard Ph.D., has something his
fellow conservatives lack: mesmerizing oratorical skills twinned
with a messianic vision.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the heart of the Keyes for President campaign.
With little money, name recognition, organization or governing
experience, Keyes is running on his powerful voice, breathlessly
wooing far-right voters with Boschian word pictures of schools that
are ``places of death,'' taxpayers who are ``enchained slaves'' and
children who have fallen into a ``howling moral void.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he is given little chance of winning _ he finished
seventh of nine candidates in the Iowa straw poll _ winning is not
what he promises his followers. What he offers is the chance to
feel morally correct on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion I've reached is that no one is doing what I
believe needs to be done,'' Keyes said in a recent interview,
speaking of the moral issues. ``If I were satisfied that anyone
else was addressing it, I would not run.''
</P>
<P>
   His campaign chairman in South Carolina, Hal W. Stevenson, said,
``If you only care about your chances of winning, you don't back a
guy like Alan. You back him because you like what you hear. You'll
feel better when the election is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes did win the Alabama Republican straw poll last Saturday,
but other than Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who finished second, he
was the only candidate who competed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at a time when several Republican candidates, including
the front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, are trying to downplay
divisive issues like abortion and gay rights, Keyes provides an
eloquently uncomfortable reminder that, to some dedicated
conservatives, ideological purity matters more than victory in
November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a struggle going on in the party,'' said
Keyes, 49, who also ran for president in 1996. ``It's a struggle
between the Money-is-God Republicans and the God-is-God
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Keyes aims the sharpest barbs at Bush, whom he
considers a tepid-tongued pragmatist. In Greenville, he mocked
Bush's slogan of ``compassionate conservatism,'' saying, ``You
don't prove you are compassionate by talking about it.'' He accused
Bush of exploiting moral issues, ``without being seriously
committed to facing the moral challenges.'' And he ridiculed the
Texan for saying he would not demand that all his nominees to the
federal bench share his opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it true we need leaders who will be vague in their response
to the most compelling moral issues we face as a people?'' Keyes,
who is black, asked the virtually all-white crowd in Greenville.
``No!'' many of them responded.
</P>
<P>
   Though his campaign has received little media attention, Keyes
has consistently drawn hundreds of people to his ``Renewing
America'' speeches in South Carolina, Iowa and New Hampshire.
Marietta Kaiser, 72, of Greenville, walked out a convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a breath of fresh air,'' she said following Keyes'
appearance here two weeks ago. ``We've heard the cliches of the
other candidates, and they just don't move the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   But his against-all-odds campaign has drawn questions from some
rivals and analysts, who suggest that he is using the race to draw
attention to his speaking-for-hire business and to gain listeners
for his radio program, which until recently was syndicated to about
75 stations in more than 43 states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, Keyes gave about 20 paid speeches a year,
typically to corporations or college groups, charging between
$12,000 and $15,000 for each, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But the aides scoffed at the assertion that he profits from
running for office. They said that he suspended the radio show
during the campaign and has scaled back his paid speaking
engagements to about 15 this year. They added that most of his
speeches are given free to benefit pregnancy counseling centers and
anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics have asked whether Keyes is living off his
campaign account, as he did during his losing 1992 U.S. Senate race
in Maryland when he paid himself more than $8,000 a month from
campaign donations. Though the practice was legal, it prompted
criticism even from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes says he is not drawing a salary from his campaign fund,
which had raised $1.9 million as of June 30 and had $172,497 on
hand. But he argues that the practice is legitimate and that his
critics are ``wealthy oligarchs.''
</P>
<P>
   In private, Keyes cuts a different figure from the acid-tongued
talk show performer who has amazed even the most combative hosts
with his ability to shout them down. With his goatee and newly trim
build _ he has lost 70 pounds in two years _ he can come across as
a genial academic. An opera buff, he confesses to relaxing with
westerns and action films or ``Star Trek'' re-runs.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, the youngest of five children, is the son of a career
Army officer who moved the family repeatedly through Italy and the
United States. Raised a Roman Catholic, Keyes attended parochial
schools for much of his youth, though he graduated from a public
high school in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, he was already demonstrating his powerful
speaking skills, winning the American Legion's national oratorical
competition and getting elected president of the Legion's Boys
Nation, the first black to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Though his parents were die-hard Democrats who admired John F.
Kennedy, Keyes became a Republican while attending Cornell
University in the late 1960s, where he viewed Vietnam War
protesters as repugnantly anti-American. He transferred to Harvard,
where he earned a doctorate in government.
</P>
<P>
   While serving as a State Department official in India during the
Reagan administration, he met Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, who later
called him ``one of the most dramatically articulate people'' she
had ever met. After she became chief delegate to the United
Nations, Ms. Kirkpatrick made Keyes the ambassador to the U.N.
Economic and Social Council. Reagan later appointed him assistant
secretary of state for international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In India, Keyes also met his wife, Jocelyn Marcel Keyes, who is
Indian. They have three children and live in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Keyes' speeches are aural spectacles, part revivalist sermons,
part Oprah. With a microphone on his lapel, he wanders through the
audience, talking _ sometimes in a whisper, sometimes in a shout _
for an hour or more without notes, weaving incandescent images of
an America going to Hell in a high-speed handbasket.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that a collective loss of faith in God's authority has
caused a panoply of social ills, from the breakdown of
``marriage-based families'' to the Columbine shootings to failing
schools to ``immoral'' military interventions abroad, including in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Without God in their lives or their politics, Americans are
allowing an increasingly authoritarian central government to tax
and regulate them into submission, he says. Likening Americans to a
frog that sits calmly in a pot while the water gets hotter, he
argues that Americans are passively watching their freedoms erode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're past medium rare and headed toward well done,'' he said
in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, he prescribes some strong medicine. He would
eliminate the income tax and finance the government on tariffs,
duties and excise taxes. He would end welfare and outlaw abortion.
He has even endorsed the public paddling of parents who abandon
their children.
</P>
<P>
   But in private conversation, Keyes reveals more nuanced views.
And that makes for some interesting paradoxes.
</P>
<P>
   Though he ridicules targeted tax cuts as ``marionette strings,''
he also endorses federally subsidized mortgages for families and
tax breaks for banks that invest in poor neighborhoods. And while
he warns that ``perpetual war'' is a means by which totalitarian
governments control their citizens, he is not an isolationist,
having strongly supported America's involvement in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Grenada and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   There are interesting nuances in Keyes' views on race as well.
He is an ardent opponent of affirmative action and other race-based
social programs. But he also speaks passionately about the need to
address urban poverty through private investment, and has often
lambasted the Republican Party for not recruiting more blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans vacillate between trying to buy off black
voters with programs, trying to out-Democrat the Democrats, and
just writing them off,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Keyes says, his revulsion for slavery has intensified
his conservatism, not weakened it. As a teenager, he voraciously
read books about slavery, weeping while he wondered why more slaves
did not revolt. Lincoln became his hero. Even his stump-speech
language _ ``We need to strike off our chains,'' is a favorite
phrase _ is drawn from the peculiar institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered, why didn't people resist to the point of
fighting and dying?'' he said. ``Why would human beings let
themselves be oppressed, when they could have said, `give me
liberty or give me death,' and gone out in a blaze of resistance?''

DESPITE RECENT OIL-REVENUE RISE, MEXICO WILL LIMIT SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Despite a jump in crude oil prices, the Mexican
government will reap enough of a windfall this year only to
stabilize its accounts, and it plans no spending sprees, Energy
Minister Luis Tellez said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The international oil market has taken Mexico on a dizzying ride
in 1999. In February, the price of Mexican crude oil for export _
which sells well below London and New York prices _ dropped to less
than $7 a barrel, the lowest real price ever. But by Aug. 19, more
than a year after Mexico joined forces with Venezuela and Saudi
Arabia to curb production, the country's crude oil reached a high
for the year of $19.24 a barrel, a 175 percent rebound.
</P>
<P>
   So far in 1999, Mexico has earned $1.3 billion more from
petroleum exports than budget planners anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in advance of President Ernesto Zedillo's state of the
union address on Wednesday, when he will tell Mexicans what he
intends to do in the coming year, Tellez said the government is
taking a sober view of the upturn in its oil fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of government income comes from levies on
petroleum sales. Increased oil revenue will allow Mexico to meet
its promises to hold the budget deficit to 1.25 percent of the
gross domestic product, but not to give more help to the nation's
poor.
</P>
<P>
   When oil prices were falling, Zedillo cut about $1 billion from
social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the oil boom will only plug holes left in this year's budget
by slow progress in the selling of Mexican airports to private
owners, finance officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico also continues to look warily at the world oil markets,
Tellez said, because much of the inventories that led to the price
collapse last year and early in 1999 still exist. Almost all the
world's producers have reduced their output, bringing about the
steepest and longest-running decline in world oil production ever
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   But even if producers maintain their discipline, the supplies
will come down slowly, Tellez said, dropping by the end of this
year only to the level of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In Caracas last weekend, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico
agreed to maintain current production cuts until April.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way that Mexico is going to jump up and take any
decisions without the other countries,'' Tellez said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects to fix the estimate of the average price of Mexican
crude oil for 2000 at $12 to $14 a barrel, a conservative figure
far below current levels. Mexico's estimate of the average annual
price of its petroleum exports is a cornerstone of the government's
budget projections. Finance officials revised the figure downward
twice when oil prices plunged, and it now stands at $9.25 a barrel.
Each dollar added to the price of a barrel of oil is worth about $1
billion to the Mexican Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders have accused Zedillo of concealing huge
unexpected oil earnings this year in the labyrinth of the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Garcia Sainz, the chairman of the budget committee in
the lower house of Congress, said the government was hoarding money
to spend it without congressional approval on an unpopular bank
bailout and on programs to benefit the ruling party in the coming
election year.

EDITORIAL: HOLBROOKE'S RETURN TO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke chose wisely in starting his new job as
America's delegate to the United Nations with a three-day trip to
Kosovo. Peace and democracy will take root in the province only if
Washington and the U.N. closely coordinate their efforts.
Holbrooke, an experienced Balkan hand, is well suited to help make
that happen. He enjoys President Clinton's full confidence and is
also on good terms with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
organization's chief administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke met with local leaders and international officials and
got a closer view of the violence against Kosovo's Serbian and
Gypsy minorities. His visit to a mass grave of Kosovar Albanians
near Stara Cikatova, where 129 bodies have so far been exhumed,
called attention to the terrible Serbian atrocities that led to
international intervention. But Holbrooke also made clear that the
new Kosovo must move beyond an endless cycle of ethnic retribution.
He pointedly and properly reminded Hashim Thaci, the political
leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, that Washington intends to
hold the KLA to its commitment to demilitarize its forces by Sept.
19 and turn to peaceful competition with other political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Only 25,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo out of a prewar population of
180,000. NATO and the U.N. must protect those who have stayed, and
eventually encourage others to return. Holbrooke recognized that
this will take time, since Serbs and ethnic Albanians cannot yet
easily live alongside each other. Unlike Bosnia, Kosovo is going to
have a single dominant ethnic group, the Albanians. But Serbs and
Gypsies, who have also lived in the province for generations, must
also have a right to reside there in peace.
</P>
<P>
   That can happen if the U.N. moves strongly to establish
democratic institutions and impartial rule of law. The
international war crimes tribunal can also help by bringing more
prosecutions against Serbs responsible for this spring's
atrocities. Punishment of those directly guilty might discourage
collective retribution against all remaining Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that a reluctance to act boldly hindered U.N.
missions in Bosnia and elsewhere, Holbrooke encouraged
international representatives in Kosovo to make decisions on their
own, without referring everything back to lawyers and officials in
New York. The U.N. operation in Kosovo has gotten off to a shaky
start. Holbrooke has pointed it in a more promising direction.

BASEBALL AND THE UMPIRES SAID TO BE CLOSE TO A DEAL

 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A long day in a judge's chambers in Philadelphia brought lawyers
for Major League Baseball and its umpires close to a deal Tuesday
on the status of umpires who face the loss of their jobs Wednesday,
a lawyer familiar with the general outline of the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers were in U.S. District Court for a hearing before
Judge J. Curtis Joyner on the umpires union request for an
injunction that would keep 22 umpires in their jobs beyond
Wednesday. However, Joyner summoned the lead lawyers for both sides
to his chambers, and they spent more than six hours negotiating a
possible settlement of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're done for the evening,'' Joyner said by telephone at 8:30
p.m., ``and there's no further comment with reference to what is
happening.'' He added that a hearing was set for 10:30 a.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the hearing on the umpires' request for an injunction
will take place only if the two sides cannot complete the deal they
worked on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who said the two sides had moved close to a deal did
not attend the sessions in Joyner's chambers and didn't know the
substance of the talks. But the lawyer understood that they had a
general structure of an agreement, needed more time and discussion
to conclude it and had to have it approved by Commissioner Bud
Selig. ``They've talked, and they're close,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers who were involved in the talks declined to comment
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Silverman, the New York regional director of the National
Labor Relations Board, said earlier in the day that he expected to
have a decision Wednesday on the unfair labor practice charges the
umpires union filed with the board Aug. 3. However, an agreement
between baseball and the union could alter that plan.
</P>
<P>
   The union could withdraw the charges, it could agree to let an
arbitrator decide the issues or it could agree to make them part of
the negotiations for a new agreement to replace the current labor
contract, which expires Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   No one was saying, but it was possible that at least one element
of the deal being negotiated under Joyner's watchful eyes involved
baseball's thought of expanding umpiring crews next season from
four umpires to five. Four umpires would continue to work games,
but the extra umpire would give each member of the crew every fifth
week off.
</P>
<P>
   To have five-man crews, baseball would have to hire about eight
more umpires, and they could come from the corps of 22 who are
scheduled to be out of work after Wednesday's games.
</P>
<P>
   Those 22 umpires, 13 from the National League staff and nine
from the American League staff, were among more than 50 umpires who
signed letters of resignation July 14. All of the umpires
ultimately rescinded their resignations, but those who acted later
than others found theirs being accepted by the leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those umpires were in Philadelphia on Tuesday to testify
at the scheduled hearing. Bob Davidson came from Houston, where he
was umpiring the series between the Astros and the Mets, presumably
his last. Rich Garcia flew in from Detroit, and Ed Hickox stopped
there en route to his assignment in Baltimore. Eric Gregg had been
scheduled to work the series in San Francisco but was in
Philadelphia instead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of testifying, the umpires waited as the lawyers talked.
Susan Davis was the lead lawyer representing the union, and Howard
Ganz was the chief lawyer for Major League Baseball. He was joined
by Rob Manfred, baseball's executive vice president for labor
relations.

BUSH SAYS EDUCATION DEPARTMENT SHOULDN'T BE ABOLISHED 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
broke ranks with the Republican right Tuesday by saying he would
not dismantle the U.S. Department of Education if he is elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it should be abolished. It ought to be made more
effective,'' said Texas' governor, who has touted local control of
schools throughout his political career.
</P>
<P>
   All the GOP presidential candidates in 1996 promised to
dismantle the department if elected, and the issue remains dear to
the GOP's right wing. So far this year, only commentator Pat
Buchanan has embraced the issue. Many Republicans see the
department as symbolic of efforts to put the federal government in
control of education nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The education department ought to be a place for sound
science, sound thought, and ought to recognize that passing power
back to the states and local authorities is the best way to lead to
education reform,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his declaration of support for the federal agency as
he previewed elements of his education proposals that will be
included in a major policy speech scheduled for Thursday to the
Latin Business Association in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we ought to federalize education,'' Bush said.
``I trust local people to make the right decisions. But there is a
place for the federal government to make sure people don't get left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who toured the Our Lady of Guadalupe and St. Agnes Mission
School, said a president can set a tone for education standards so
that schools can be held accountable for their success and failure.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1994 campaign for governor, Bush said he wanted to
abolish the Texas Education Agency. He later modified that position
to abolishing only the regulatory functions of the agency after
learning a local agency is a required element of receiving federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   But many social conservatives in Texas have criticized Bush for
not keeping his promise because he backed efforts in 1995 to
increase the power of the agency and the Texas education
commissioner, who is appointed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Tuesday he has worked to increase local control in
Texas by creating charter schools and supporting a pilot private
school voucher program, even though the voucher program died in the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also plans to outline Thursday how he would
overhaul the Head Start preschool program to make it more academic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government spends a lot of money on Head Start.
Head Start does a good job of providing healthy meals. I believe it
ought to be an education program as well,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would like to see Head Start begin teaching
reading, particularly the phonics method. Bush said he wants to see
Head Start aggressively push a reading program included in a law
passed by Congress ``that fundamentally changed Head Start's focus
to become a platform for reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also toured the ConAgra Global Training Facility and later
held a rally in Council Bluffs &UR; ,  &LR; Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The governor declined to confirm a report in The Dallas Morning
News that his presidential campaign has now raised more than $50
million, but said he has raised ``a lot'' since reporting that his
campaign had hauled in $37 million by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are some who are talking about my capacity to
raise money, particularly my opponents. I suggest if you ask them,
they would like to trade places,'' Bush said.

INTEL'S NEW PROCESSOR LINE TO FOCUS ON INTERNET LINKS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SARA ROBINSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Trying to expand its core personal computer
business into a new market, the Intel Corp. will announce a new
family of processors on Wednesday capable of powering the devices
that route data through corporate networks and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement follows an initial public demonstration Tuesday
of Intel's much-ballyhooed Merced chip, designed around a new
64-bit architecture, which Intel has been developing with the
Hewlett-Packard Co. and expects to begin shipping in volume in
mid-2000. All the activity was timed to coincide with the Intel
Developer Forum in Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Both developments reflect Intel's increasing expansion of its
core business _ processors for personal computers and work stations
_ into three new areas, all connected to the Internet: network
processors; servers, computers that manage network resources, and
what Intel calls ``bit factories,'' networks of computers housed
and managed by Intel that power electronic-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are investing heavily in developing all of those efforts,''
said Pat Gelsinger, vice president and general manager for the
Intel Desktop Products Group.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to base its new line of network-oriented
processors on what it is calling the Intel Internet Exchange
Architecture, or IX, an open specification for the design of a
system of hardware components that can be linked together to
provide the framework for Internet devices.
</P>
<P>
   An open architecture allows the system to be connected easily to
devices and programs made by other manufacturers. The blueprint for
the design will be released to enable systems designers to build
products compatible with the Intel products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been the brains of the personal computer; now we want to
become the brains of the Internet,'' said Mark Christensen, vice
president and general manager of Intel's Network Communications
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The flagship component of the new Intel line is a network
processor that, rather than being built for a specific function, is
flexible and can be programmed to perform different tasks.
Christensen said the new processor would make possible a
fundamental shift in networking and communications system design,
an area that has typically relied on a development cycle of one to
two years for custom chips hard-wired for very specific tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The network processor is designed to allow greater flexibility
for manufacturers of devices _ routers, switches and access
concentrators _ that control the flow of information through the
Internet. Companies designing products that work on top of the
Intel framework could add features to networking products after
they have been deployed, Christensen said, thereby speeding the
development process and potentially extending product life.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it was now shipping samples and would be in
production in the fourth quarter, with the network-processor-based
systems costing significantly less than custom-built systems
typically used today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel is saying let's move away from a hardware-intensive
model and move toward something more software intensive,'' said
John Armstrong, an analyst at Dataquest, based in San Jose, Calif.
``The opportunities here are very big.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and officials of other companies said they expected IBM
to announce its own initiative in the network processor field this
week.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Intel will establish a $200 million fund that will
be used in part to invest in companies developing hardware and
software based on the IX architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that Intel said plan to endorse the Intel architecture
or announce specific products that incorporate elements of it are
Broadband Access Systems; Cabletron; CAG; Cisco, and Newbridge
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   One company already in the business of making building blocks
for network systems is the C-Port Corp., a start-up based in North
Andover, Mass. C-Port announced an open architecture for network
processors in February and followed last week with a programmable
chip that fits into their architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're changing the business from being hardware based to being
software and service based,'' said Larry Walker, the company's
chief executive. ``We invite Intel to work with us.'' He said
C-Port would soon announce a collaboration with IBM for a standard
for their architecture so that software compatible with IBM
hardware will also work with C-Port's hardware.
</P>
<P>
   At the Palm Springs conference Tuesday, Intel's president and
chief executive, Craig Barrett, demonstrated the Merced processor,
whose 64-bit chip architecture will process data in longer chunks
than the current standard 32 bits. The chip is intended both for
high-end work stations and for Internet server applications. Intel
said that it had begun shipping engineering samples of the Merced
to computer companies for testing and that it remains on track for
production in mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's stock closed down 6.25 cents Tuesday, at $82.1875.

ASKING ITS VIEWS, LABOR WOOS THE YOUNG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the nation's labor unions struggle to reverse their decline,
they are focusing increasingly on an immense group that they have
long overlooked: young workers.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the labor movement took a new tack in seeking to court
that group, releasing a survey that it had commissioned on young
workers' attitudes toward their jobs, the economy and unions.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the survey of 752 workers from the ages of 18
to 34 showed that those workers were concerned about many of the
same issues unions have been emphasizing.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, conducted in June by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates, workers said their biggest worries were falling behind
the cost of living, lacking time for family responsibilities and
being unable to afford to educate their children.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that only 45 percent of young workers had
employer-sponsored health insurance, while just 43 percent had
pension plans to which their employers contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see today's jobs as failing to meet the most basic needs:
health care, retirement security and time to spend with family,''
said John J. Sweeney, president of the American Federation of Labor
and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO said that in commissioning the study, it was showing
that it listens to young workers and can articulate their concerns
to employers and the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to grow, we obviously have to make young
workers aware that unions are an option for them,'' said Kirk
Adams, the AFL-CIO's organizing director. ``We know they don't know
too much about unions because the labor movement didn't do a very
good job talking to them or to their parents over the last 25
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions are also seeking to improve ties to the young by
working closely with anti-sweatshop groups on college campuses and
by recruiting hundreds of people in their 20s to work as union
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, young workers were less sanguine about the
booming economy than were older workers _ 45 percent said the
economic climate was good, while 58 percent of workers over 35
described it that way. The survey, which had a margin of error of
4.1 percentage points, found that more than 90 percent of workers
under age 35 said big corporations, top management and stockholders
were doing well. But 42 percent said their own situation was ``just
fair,'' ``not so good'' or ``poor.''
</P>
<P>
   With the percentage of workers belonging to unions slipping to
less than 14 percent now from 35 percent in the 1950s, the labor
movement is acting on many fronts to recruit members. In addition
to focusing on the young, it has made special efforts to reach out
to low-income workers, women and minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders see young workers as a fertile ground for
organizing efforts because while there are 45 million people under
age 35 in the work force _ roughly a third of the total _ just 9
percent of them belong to unions. Surveys also show they are more
favorably disposed to unions than are older workers.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO survey found that 54 percent of young workers said
that, if given a chance, they would definitely or probably vote for
a union, compared with 36 percent for workers over age 35.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the labor movement attribute this difference to the
unhappy experience many older workers have had with unions, but
Adams, the AFL-CIO organizing director, had a different
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people,'' Adams said, ``are thinking in terms of what
will be not an immediate fix, but a long-term fix to build a better
future with job security and pensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say there is a misguided perception that most
young workers are entrepreneurs at Internet companies or day
traders making overnight fortunes. The AFL-CIO report found that
often, the three-fourths of young workers who lack college degrees
are just scraping by.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 64 percent of workers without college degrees earn
less than $20,000 a year, compared with 32 percent for college
graduates. And 39 percent of nongraduates have employer-provided
health insurance compared with 67 percent for young college
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   The labor movement is pushing several organizing drives that
would bring tens of thousands of young people into unions, among
them flight attendants, health-care workers, hotel workers and
graduate teaching assistants at schools from the University of
California to New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Johnson, a 26-year-old doctoral candidate in American
studies at New York University, said the school's 1,500 teaching
assistants need a union because ``it would give us some say in
working conditions like pay and health coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found especially tough conditions for young workers
from minority groups. While 39 percent of young white workers earn
less than $20,000 a year, 48 percent of young blacks workers and 52
percent of young Hispanic workers do. The poll found that 51
percent of young white workers were covered by employer-sponsored
health coverage, considerably more than the 36 percent for young
black workers and 39 percent for young Hispanic workers.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 56 percent of workers from 18 to 24 said
opportunities for advancement were more important than job
security, while 63 percent of workers over 35 said job security was
more important.

WHY CLEVELAND AND NOT L.A.?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twelve days before the start of the pagan orgy that is the NFL
season, I have a simple question: Beyond the obvious, what does
Cleveland have that Los Angeles does not?
</P>
<P>
   It must have something that we're not being told about. Los
Angeles is much bigger. We have more TV sets. Take a straw poll of
NFL owners and you'd get a 31-0 resolution that Super Bowl parties
in L.A. are much more fun. The only thing Cleveland has on L.A. is
a lack of pretense.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Cleveland have a NFL team while we stand on the
sidelines for a fifth straight season? Why did Cleveland return to
the fold after only three years in NFL detox, while we're clinging
to narrowing hopes for a team maybe in 2003?
</P>
<P>
   When Art Modell, theretofore a decent enough guy in the mind of
Ohioans, took his black heart to Baltimore and the cash that
accompanied such franchise shifts, the city of Cleveland responded
with murderous intent and the resolve to litigate the NFL for
years. Our hats go off to the Cleveland politicians who turned
their anger into a tangible asset.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles politicians responded to the departure of the Rams
and Raiders with a sense of relief. L.A. didn't step up with the
same vigor as Cleveland because we were worn out from more than a
decade of dirty dealing with Darth Raider and Madame Ram.
</P>
<P>
   And the league bears a burden for that. NFL execs knew we were
saddled with ne'er-do-wells. Georgia Frontiere inherited her team,
and Al Davis has been working a legal con for 20 years. They've
been just as vexing to Paul Tagliabue as they were the Coliseum
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   So it's wrong that the league supported a hurry-up offense for
the return of the Browns while creating obstacle after obstacle in
L.A., to the point where it is now acting predatory when it comes
to public money. Instead of being on the verge of losing an
expansion opportunity L.A. groups have two-to-four weeks left to
bring the NFL a proposal it will accept we should have been offered
the same kind of deal as Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Roski, the Kings owner who with businessman Eli Broad is
bidding for an expansion team, raised the same question early in
his talks with the league. ``At one time, that was the
discussion,'' said Roski, ``how we could use the Cleveland model to
get a team here.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL executive Roger Goodell was on board this idea, albeit later
in the process. ``We were able to take the risk out (in Cleveland),
then determine the value of the franchise and create a valuable
asset. It's important we do things right in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   And then things changed. The league looked at Cleveland and saw
litigation. It looked at Los Angeles and saw apathy. It may be the
first time someone has ever mistaken L.A.'s ``cool'' for a lack of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (the Rams and Raiders) left, there wasn't a public
outcry,'' said Roski. ``We (meaning L.A.) didn't raise the same
concerns as Cleveland did. If we had, maybe we'd be working in the
same position.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodell said the Cleveland model was complicated. The league
stepped in to start and operate a franchise before an owner was
found. But the only real complication was its novelty.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland officials agreed to build a stadium at a cost of $247
million. The league extended a $100 million line of credit to
assist in construction, $60 million of which would go to Cleveland
directly as the new owner's stake in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The city was able to immediately offset its debt through revenue
streams in the stadium (like PSLs). The league hired an investment
broker to study proposals from interested parties and then conduct
an auction.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Instant franchise. Al Lerner was top bidder at $530
million. According to city officials, Cleveland's debt should be
retired in ten years, and Lerner projects an operating profit in
his first season.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine where L.A. might be today preparing for kickoff? if the
league had been proactive in replacing the Rams and Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996, a proposed renovation of the Coliseum including
club seats and luxury suites was pegged at $230 million, and that
included parking upgrades. A private marketing firm projected that
L.A. could raise up to $100 million in seed money from PSL sales
for an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   If the league had agreed to finance half of stadium construction
and get reimbursed on the back end from the new owner, L.A. might
have needed all of $75 million in public money the sale of bonds or
incremental tax money to make the Coliseum new and have revenue
streams in place to offset debt.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the projected cost of building a new Coliseum today
stands somewhere between $350 million and $600 million. The league
has refused to submit a magic number for the franchise fee to the
two interested groups. The ``winner,'' if there is one, may be
looking at a $1 billion investment to refurbish the stadium and own
the team. And the issue of public money now supercedes everything
else.
</P>
<P>
   It may be impossible to use the Cleveland model, but the sense
of cooperation under any terms would be a lot better than the
frayed perspectives that now exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a sorry situation that we can't seem to get off
(the ground),'' said Roski. ``We've taken some real setbacks and it
took us some time to get moving again.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski, as dogged a sports owner as you'll ever meet, remains
optimistic that he and Broad can secure a franchise in the
Coliseum. Since Governor Gray Davis' emissary, Bill Chadwick,
excused himself from the fray after the league trashed his parking
plan, Roski has been working with a Davis-appointed consultant on a
plan to use incremental tax money bed and car rental taxes to meet
the league's wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a challenge,'' he said. ``But the Coliseum is still
the most logical site. We're a lot further along there than
anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodell, who has been one of the league's point men in the L.A.
talks, is in Los Angeles today to talk to all of the interested
parties, like Roski, Michael Ovitz, Coliseum officials and
officials from other potential sites, like Carson and Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's expansion committee will meet on September 9, and then
convene another meeting with L.A. representatives Sept. 13, two
days before the league-imposed deadline. But chances are the
deadline will be extended to Oct. 6, which is the next time all 31
owners are scheduled to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles has been through a lot,'' Roski said, noting
Frontiere and Davis, ``and there's a high degree of frustration.
It's why we've taken a PR (public relations) hit. That's why we
have to do this right.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``right way'' would have been the Cleveland way, and it
should have happened three years ago, when the tracks from the
moving vans were still fresh, and the costs a lot cheaper.

FBI CHIEF BACKS INDEPENDENT INQUIRY ON WACO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 1st take to recast lede and rewrite to clarify previous text.
No changes in 2nd take. Subs hed to reflect new lede.) (js) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to head off any impression of a conflict of
interest, Director Louis J. Freeh of the FBI wholeheartedly
supports an outside investigation into the bureau's failure to
disclose the use of incendiary devices at the 1993 siege of the
Branch Davidian compound, a bureau spokesman said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official said Attorney General Janet Reno,
too, had all but decided that an exhaustive inquiry totally
independent of the Justice Department was the best way to find out
why the use of the incendiary devices _ heat-generating tear-gas
canisters _ during the April 19, 1993, federal assault on the
sect's compound near Waco, Texas, had been denied for six years.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI spokesman, Tron Brekke, said Freeh believed that the
bureau's credibility was at stake and that the best way to restore
it was by submitting to outside scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would welcome a qualified group of independent
investigators to do that,'' Brekke said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent disclosure that two incendiary tear-gas devices had
been used at Waco _ albeit without success and a good six hours
before flames consumed the cult's compound _ has caused the bureau;
its parent agency, the Justice Department, and Ms. Reno herself
acute embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the devices came to light as agents were being
interviewed in Texas in preparation for a lawsuit arising from the
raid, which ended in about 80 deaths, including that of the cult's
leader, David Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   Reno conceded last week that the disclosure, coming after six
years of statements to the contrary, had caused her to lose
credibility. Officials at the Justice Department and the bureau
have worried aloud that the backtracking would provide grist for
anti-government extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Another signal that the 1993 raid is still an explosive issue in
Washington was a statement Tuesday night that Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is weighing a
proposal to create a joint House-Senate commission to delve into
the episode.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies showed that some cult members died of gunshot wounds,
which the authorities have insisted were self-inflicted, and that
others died as a result of a fire that officials said was started
by the members. Examination of the ashes revealed that gasoline,
charcoal-lighting fluid and camp stove fuel had been spread about.
</P>
<P>
   But the few cult members who survived the fire and many of the
victims' relatives have been skeptical of official conclusions,
including a finding after congressional hearings that there was no
evidence that federal agents started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department officials, who spoke on the condition
that they not be identified, said Freeh and Ms. Reno believe that
nothing new will turn up to alter the official conclusions. But the
attorney general and the FBI director are said to be convinced that
the crisis of confidence is serious enough that only a wholly
outside investigation would be palatable to many who have followed
the Branch Davidian case.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said last week that he was ready to assign 40 bureau
agents to re-interview everyone who was at the cult compound on
April 19, 1993, to determine how the use of heat-generating tear
gas canisters was all but buried in the official paperwork despite
its potential to embarrass the bureau and weaken the government's
position in a wrongful-death suit brought in Texas by some of the
victims' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday night whether Freeh had changed his
mind about using the 40 bureau agents or whether he had simply
picked them out early on just in case they were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday whether the director was in conflict with the
attorney general on the Waco issue, one department official
replied, ``God, no!''

<P>
   Reno was on her way to Panama Tuesday evening on business and is
to return on Thursday. The department official speculated that Reno
might even make a final decision and have an announcement ready
upon her return, rather than waiting until after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman reached at his home
Tuesday night, declined to comment extensively. ``She is still
working through her options,'' Marlin said of Reno. ``She has
pledged to get to the bottom of this, and that's what she will
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general and the FBI director have had policy
differences before, most notably over how to investigate political
fund-raising irregularities arising from President Clinton's 1996
campaign. Freeh strongly favored an independent counsel to conduct
the inquiry but Reno decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department officials who discussed the Waco episode
Tuesday evening emphasized that there was no such friction between
the two this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco controversy has prompted heated reaction in Congress,
as evidenced by Tuesday's signal from Hyde that he might favor a
joint House-Senate commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no final decision'' on the commission, said Sam
Stratman, a House Judiciary Committee spokesman. ``We're trying to
work our way through this and find some solution that might remove
this entire affair from the political fever swamp.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility said to be under discussion was a commission
with subpoena power made up initially of two Republicans and two
Democrats. The four would then pick a fifth, potentially
tie-breaking member.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the staff of the House Government Reform Committee
drew up a new batch of subpoenas Tuesday in its fledgling inquiry
into the Waco matter. A committee spokesman said they would be
served on the FBI, Justice Department and Defense Department. The
committee is said to be interested in what role the Army's secret
Delta Force played in the FBI operation. The Pentagon has said
three Army special forces officers were at the scene but only as
observers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Government Reform Committee subpoenaed records
held by Texas law-enforcement officials related to the use of the
tear-gas devices in question.

 &HT;    Restored Maddux wins 8-2
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Greg Maddux helped make Monday's loss look like a
freak occurrence and the chipped bone in his wrist like a figment
of everybody's imagination, as he and the Braves answered a blowout
with a blowout in an 8-2 win over the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching for the first time since Aug. 21 after skipping a start
in St. Louis, Maddux pitched seven shutout innings on the way to
his seventh consecutive win. He's now 17-6 on the year, one win shy
of last season's total.
</P>
<P>
   He's still one win behind Jose Lima for the National League
lead, but that was working in his favor, too, as Lima and the
Astros beat the Mets 6-2 on Tuesday for Lima's 18th win.
</P>
<P>
   So the Braves, whose 11-3 loss on Monday snapped a 10-game
winning streak on the season and a seven-game winning streak over
the Reds, were right back where they started this series _ with a 3
1/2 game lead on the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hurt,'' Maddux said. ``I'm not a macho, he-man, stud
muffin. It didn't hurt. ... I was kind of worried more about
swinging the bat than pitching to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux didn't allow a run for the first time in 11 starts, which
prompted him to answer whether it was just a normal start this way:
``It wasn't normal because I didn't give up any runs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the best movement he had the whole year,'' said
catcher Eddie Perez, who did his part offensively with a two-run
homer for a 4-0 lead in the fourth. ``He was throwing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had won his last four starts against the Reds going back
to 1996. For his fifth, he had to outpitch Juan Guzman, winner of
four in five starts since he was traded from the Orioles on July
31.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman had shut out the Braves in a 5-0 win when he was with the
Orioles on June 12 in the middle of the most disastrous weekend of
the Braves season. But these Braves are playing with a lot more at
stake, and they proved it by taking a 5-0 lead on Guzman this time,
the last on the second of three consecutive hits to end his night
in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones chipped in with his 35th home run, which gave him
a new career-high, on a 436-foot two-run shot off Stan Belinda to
give the Braves an 8-0 lead in the seventh inning. That gave the
Braves their most runs scored since the 9-7 14-inning win in
Colorado on Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Guzman) tried to do the same things to us,'' Jones said. ``I
just think maybe the first time we faced him he was on with his
pitches and we were a little bit off. It's a little bit of a
different story when you face somebody the second time.

MAYOR DEFENDS POLICE SHOOTING OF HAMMER-WIELDING MAN IN BROOKLYN 
</HEADLINE>

from Dear; subs graf 23 bgng `Busch was committed...' to change
`last night' to `TUESDAY night'; in last graf before optional end,

 By JOHN KIFNER and MICHAEL COOPER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani Tuesday defended the fatal
police shooting of a mentally disturbed, hammer-wielding man in the
Borough Park section of Brooklyn, which brought hundreds of angry
Hasidic protesters into the streets of the heavily Orthodox
neighborhood late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be every reason to believe that the police
officers acted in accordance with police procedure, and acted in a
responsible way to save human life,'' the mayor said, cautioning
only that the investigation was still in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani moved swiftly to invite City Councilman Noach
Dear and other Jewish leaders from the politically potent Borough
Park neighborhood _ one of his bedrocks of support _ to an early
morning meeting at City Hall, the furor that swelled in the streets
on Monday night continued throughout the day. The killing of the
man, Gidone Busch, was the latest in a series of police shootings
that have put the department under a cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Dear said that the information about the shooting provided by
the Police Department had led him to believe the officers acted
appropriately in the shooting. ``This is something that is very
unfortunate which happened,'' Dear said. ``But we would also like
to thank the Police Department for working together with the
community in containing the situation that happened last night as
best they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the community is asking for is an investigation and at
the end of the investigation, hopefully, we will be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who also represents the area and
has frequently been a rival of Dear, was outspoken in his criticism
Tuesday as he had been on the streets Monday night. ``We are told
that the shooting is justified. How? How is a shooting justified.
This is not Dodge City, this is Borough Park, Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Hikind got an unlikely ally in the Rev. Al Sharpton, who also
condemned the shooting, saying ``this city seems to be unable to
deal with people who have medical or mental problems and it seems
to be the policy to shoot first and ask questions later.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Sharpton, who is viewed unfavorably by many Jews in New
York City, attempted to show his support by going to Borough Park,
he had to drive off without getting out of his car, which was
surrounded by a crush of demonstrators shouting `'Anti-semite, go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   As investigators pieced together the deadly encounter _ which
lasted less then 10 minutes from the call to 911 _ a picture
emerged of the dead man, Gidone Busch, as a troubled individual,
frightening to his neighbors, in and out of mental institutions,
who had broken another man's nose with his hammer only last Sunday
and who had been smoking marijuana for hours before he fought with
six police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that the officers followed all standard
procedures for dealing with an emotionally disturbed person _
backing away and calling for help, and trying to subdue him with
pepper spray _ but finally opened fire as a last resort when he
continued to charge them, hitting a sergeant repeatedly with his
hammer and knocking him down.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 of the shots fired by four of the police officers struck
Busch, with injuries to the heart, lungs, liver and intestines, the
autopsy by the Chief Medical Examiner's office found, a
spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove said.
</P>
<P>
   At the City Hall news conference yesterday, Giuliani and Police
Commissioner Howard Safir sought to underscore the danger the
officers faced from Busch's hammer. ``He was in the course of
attacking a police officer with, I think we have a picture of it,
with a hammer _'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   `'A claw hammer,'' Safir interjected.
</P>
<P>
   ``A claw hammer,'' the mayor responded. Although the term ``claw
hammer'' appears to carry a somewhat menacing resonance, it refers
to a standard carpenter's hammer, the ``claw'' part being the two
prongs used to pull out nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``A claw hammer is a very dangerous instrument and had not the
police officers, in my opinion, taken the action, that could have
been planted in one of our sergeant's brains,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did exactly what they were supposed to do, which was to
call Emergency Service and to contain the situation,'' Safir said.
``Unfortunately, Busch came running up the stairs and attacked the
police officers and they had little choice but to defend
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Busch could have been subdued, rather than being shot
to death, Safir replied:
</P>
<P>
   `'When you are being attacked with a claw hammer, you are in
deadly fear of your life. And this isn't the movies. You don't
shoot hammers out of hands, you don't shoot people in the leg. If
you use your weapon...then you shoot to stop the individual who is
exerting that deadly physical force against you. That's what
happened. Had they not, we probably would have had a dead police
officer.''
</P>
<P>
   In Busch's apartment, along with five bags of marijuana, the
police found cryptic scrawls on the walls, including several in
which he made up new acronyms for law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police,'' was broken down to mean ``Pointedly Off-wing
Litigating Intensely Careful Errend deliverers,'' a police official
said. The police were testing the marijuana to see if it might have
been laced with angel dust.
</P>
<P>
   The police also believe that Busch attacked Tamir Khalifa, 21, a
student at the College of Staten Island, on Sunday. Khalifa had
filed a complaint at the 66th Precinct in Borough Park saying that
a man had beaten on his car with a hammer and, when he rolled down
the window to complain, hit him on the nose, breaking it. After the
shooting, the police said, Khalifa picked out Busch from a set of
photographs as his assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Busch was committed at least three times to mental institutions
against his will, something that until recently was very difficult
to do under New York state law, a high ranking police official said
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent commitment was on Dec. 1, 1997, to Stony Brook
Hospital, when he was still living with his parents in Dix Hills,
N.Y.

SOWARD PUTS IN EXTRA WORK 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC wide receiver R. Jay Soward is determined to
start the season with a breakout performance against Hawaii on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   So in an uncharacteristic move Tuesday, Soward stayed late after
practice and caught extra passes from quarterbacks Carson Palmer
and Mike Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   Soward needed the extra work, because he has been frequently
dropping passes in the Trojans' past two practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I'm being lazy. As far as my hands, I'm dropping them too
low,'' Soward said. ``I'm not getting my hands up to my eyes. I'm
catching it at my worst point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm catching the easy balls. The long balls I'm going to have
to accelerate and go get it. I've got to get my hands up.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward would like to have a big game to help silence criticism
over his missing summer workouts.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett also has been concerned about Soward's
drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we know about R. Jay is the concentration level
has to be better so he can play with consistency,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Kickers struggle: Another day of kicking competition between
David Bell and David Newbury accomplished little. Kicking from
between 35-40 yards, the pair went 1 for 6. Newbury converted one
of his three attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been going on all camp,'' Hackett said. ``There's nothing
new. We'll doit again (Wednesday). Yeah, I'm concerned. Real
concerned. We've got to get this resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul on poll: Hackett was perplexed that USC dropped from 19th
to 21st in the Associated Press poll, even though the Trojans don't
play until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you drop two spots without playing a game?'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's ready: Freshman defensive tackle Bernard Riley said his
left ankle is about 80 percent recovered, and he expects to play
Saturday. Riley will play behind sophomore Ryan Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a little weak, but I'm getting there,'' Riley said.
``I feel I'm back where I left off.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie making move: There still has been no decision made at
No. 2 tailback, but Malaefou MacKenzie continues to impress Hackett
as he increases his workload while recovering from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting my stride back right now,'' MacKenzie said.
``I'm just making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux has tests: Freshman cornerback Darrell Rideaux underwent
tests Tuesday for back spasms that kept him out of practice over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the injury also bothered Rideaux at the state track
championships last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be very cautious,'' Hackett said. ``I think he's
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Where's Brooks? Perhaps the most intriguing player on Hawaii's
roster is 6-5 receiver Attrice Brooks, a highly touted transfer
from City College of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm curious about this Brooks fellow that they're saying can
be the next Randy Moss,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is not listed on Hawaii's depth chart, according to a
Hawaii spokesperson, because he is still learning the offense.

 NEW YORK: Dix Hills, N.Y.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He thought he was God's last prophet,'' a police report on the
commitment said, adding that he had kicked two holes in a hospital
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Before that he was involuntarily committed on Nov. 3, 1966. The
report on that commitment said he was suffering from ``severe
paranoia'' and that he had been ``making threats against his
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest involuntary commitment that law enforcement
officials have found occurred on June 30, 1996. A report on that
incident said Busch was suffering from ``paranoid schizophrenia''
and ``depression.''
</P>
<P>
   There may have been other commitments, possibly ones in which he
agreed to seek help, the senior law enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   Busch voluntarily admitted himself in 1997 to a residence for
men with mental illnesses in Brooklyn operated by the Ohel
Children's Home and Family Services, but checked himself out after
a little more than two months, according to David Mandel, the
organization's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He released himself against our advice,'' Mandel said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Busch's apartment Tuesday afternoon, a woman named
Netanya Ullman, 24, told reporters that she and Busch had recently
become engaged. They had first met, briefly, about five years ago
when studying in the northern Israeli city of Safad, an ancient
center of jewish mysticism, and then ran into each other three
weeks ago at the subway stop at 51st Street and Lexington Avenue,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said he called himself Yisroel Baal Tefilah and was, as she
put it, `'a poet and a dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, the first inkling of the trouble to
come in Borough Park was a 911 call at about 5:40 on Monday
afternoon complaining of two naked men smoking marijuana at 1619
46th Street, where Busch, who is also known as Gary, lives in a
basement apartment. A patrol car found nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6:40, another 911 call reported a man on the street at
the same address, menacing children. Officers Daniel Gravitch and
Martin Sanabria were assigned the call.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement apartment, they saw Busch, brandishing a hammer,
and a second man, identified as Percy Freeman, a sometime drug
dealer, whom the police said had a record of more than a half dozen
arrests and convictions. Freeman later told police he had met Busch
about a week ago in Washington Square Park, that Busch had invited
him to move in.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:45, the first two officers called for an Emergency Service
Unit _ a special weapons and tactics outfit _ and a supervisor. At
6:46, a second car, with Sergeant Terrence O'Brien and Officer
Kieran O'Leary arrived, followed by a car with a second patrol
sergeant, Joseph Memoly and Officer William Loshiavo.
</P>
<P>
   The police say they backed out of the apartment as Busch came at
them screaming and swinging the hammer. Gravitch attempted to use
his canister of pepper spray to subdue Busch, but the police said
it only seemed to enrage him. Officer Gravitch tripped and fell,
and Sgt. O'Brien stepped between them to protect the policeman.
But, the police said, Busch kept hitting the Sergeant with his
hammer on his arm and thigh, until he, too fell down.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Sgt. O'Brien and Officers Memoly, Loshiavo and
Sanabria opened fire, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:49, the police called for an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Chiel J. Tyberg, said Busch had drawn attention to
himself in the neighborhood in recent days by playing loud music
and at one point walking about the streets playing the flute while
wearing a towel as a prayer shawl.
</P>
<P>
   `'He was definitely out of his mind,'' Tyberg said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw the police arrive and repeatedly urge Busch to
put down his hammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was standing on the sidewalk with the hammer in his hand,
swinging it,'' Tyberg said, although he added that from his vantage
point he could not see if any blows landed on the police. ``The
next thing I heard was the shooting.''

   ANOTHER LOW-PRICE PLAYER JOINS LONG-DISTANCE FRAY
</P>
<P>
   Undercutting the telecommunications giants, IDT, a small company
based in Hackensack, N.J., plans to begin offering domestic
long-distance calls for 5 cents a minute at any time with a flat
monthly fee of $3.95.
</P>
<P>
   The offer comes a day after AT&AMP;T said it would offer consumers
domestic long-distance calls for 7 cents a minute with a $5.95
monthly fee, intensifying a price war with MCI Worldcom, Sprint and
other companies in the $80 billion long-distance industry.

   APPLE INTRODUCES FASTER MACINTOSH
</P>
<P>
   Steven P. Jobs, the interim chief executive of Apple Computer,
introduced the latest, most powerful Macintosh, describing it as a
supercomputer for the desktop. The new Macs were not expected until
next year, but Jobs said shipments of them had begun. Investors
signaled their approval by sending the company's shares up $3.1875,
to $65.25.
</P>
<P>
   DOW FALLS, BUT NASDAQ POSTS GAINS
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices declined after a purchasing managers' report
heightened fears that the Federal Reserve might raise interest
rates again. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 84.85 points,
to 10,829.28. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.61
points, to 1,320.41. But the Nasdaq composite index, thanks to
strength in technology stocks, gained 26.66 points, or 1 percent,
rising to 2,739.35.
</P>
<P>
   CALPERS TO INVEST IN HEDGE FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Employees' Retirement System, seeking to
enhance investment return, plans to put up to $11 billion in hedge
funds and what it called other riskier ``hybrid'' investments.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO NOT SPENDING OIL PROFITS
</P>
<P>
   Despite a jump in petroleum prices, Mexico will reap only enough
of a windfall to stabilize its accounts this year and plans no
spending sprees, Energy Minister Luis Tellez said. Although Mexico
has earned $1.3 billion more from petroleum exports than budget
planners anticipated, Tellez said, the government is taking a sober
view of the upturn in its oil fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN STRUGGLING WITH PUBLIC DEBT
</P>
<P>
   Japan has some of the worst public accounts in the
industrialized world. The debt situation is so precarious that as
talk of new stimulus plans heats up this fall, there are growing
doubts about how long Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi can continue to
spend furiously in hopes of reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
   MANUFACTURING GROWTH REPORTED
</P>
<P>
   A survey of the nation's purchasing managers, inadvertently
released a day early, showed that the manufacturing sector
continued to grow in August. Manufacturers paid higher prices for
goods and materials, and employment continued to gain.

   NEW YORK _ The U.S. Open Tuesday extracted its usual emotional
baggage from the combatants who took to the wind-blown hardcourts
at the National Tennis Center: frayed nerves, gray hairs, stage
fright and the mean streak that sets in when a defending Grand Slam
champion finds a friend blocking her passage to the second round of
a title defense.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the tournament came down with a case of the blues
after a back injury forced the four-time champion Pete Sampras to
abandon his bid for a record-setting 13th Grand Slam title, his
fellow Americans and even his sixth-seeded British buddy, Tim
Henman, who suffered an atrocious 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 6-3 loss to
Guillermo Canas of Argentina, seemed to experience repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Martin, seeded seventh, noticed that his gray hairs had
multiplied after four hours and five sets on the Arthur Ashe
Stadium across from the cramping but tenacious Stephane Huet, the
154th-ranked qualifier from France.
</P>
<P>
   The unseeded Michael Chang, a 1996 Open runner-up whose record
in the tournament has since been in steep recession, also needed to
toil through a five-set match to avoid the embarrassment of a
first-round exit against Marcelo Fillippini of Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   Chang soldiered through, 3-6, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2. But another
American veteran, Jim Courier, never got to test his mettle in a
fifth set. The 1991 Open runner-up, now struggling to maintain his
ranking of 36th, was upended, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), by 95th-ranked
Slava Dosedel.
</P>
<P>
   An edgy Lindsay Davenport, the second-ranked defending champion,
had to put her compassion on the back burner and throttle her own
doubles partner, Corina Morariu, 6-0, 6-3, to kick off her title
defense and reactivate the focus and fire that helped her win
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Like Davenport, seventh-seeded Serena Williams waltzed through
her opening-round match against Kimberly Po, completing a 6-1- 6-0
victory in 49 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Where Davenport and Williams succeeded, the 18-year-old
Alexandra Stevenson, who gained celebrity status as the first woman
qualifier to crash through to a Wimbledon semifinal, did not.
</P>
<P>
   Burdened by the attention that descended on her after Julius
Erving, the former National Basketball Association star, admitted
that he was her father, Stevenson has lost three straight
opening-round matches and failed to pass last week's qualifying
event in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Stevenson was administered a 59-minute hardcourt lesson
by 11th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat, who hammered out a 6-2, 6-2
victory without cracking a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that her footwork on this surface tends to be a liability,
Stevenson had to rely on her booming serve, but Tuesday even that
weapon failed to stabilize her. Tauziat's four aces equaled
Stevenson in the ace stakes, and Stevenson lost her serve four
times while converting neither of the break opportunities allotted
her by the Frenchwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an American at the U.S. Open, there's nothing better than
that, except when you lose,'' the 43d-ranked teen-ager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost to a tough player. I just need to learn some more. I'm
not regretting anything,'' Stevenson said about her tumultuous
tennis coming-out party. ``I would've liked to have kept my private
life private, but some people thought that should have been
discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   After the loss, Stevenson skipped over to the stands and,
exhibiting the sunny body language of a winner, began signing
autographs for a legion of pint-sized fans. For this day, at least,
she proved to be a better actress than player.
</P>
<P>
   Despite emerging on the positive side of his 6-4, 6-3, 6-7
(2-7), 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-3) epic with Huet, Martin was disgusted
with his Open attitude. He was bothered by the wind, bothered by
his tournament-issue freebie haircut, which accentuated his gray
hair, and annoyed that he frittered away four match points in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an adventure,'' said the usually mild-mannered Martin,
who admitted to cursing his way through the final set's tie
breaker, where he finally ended matters with an ace out wide. ``I
didn't say anything except things that shouldn't be in print.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Henman, who later described his straight-set loss to
Canas as ``an all-time low for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm five in the world at the moment, the highest ranking I've
ever been, and I couldn't be more dissatisfied with my game,'' said
Henman, who called this Open yet another missed moment and
unwelcome proof that he is not yet in the class of the players
ranked just ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   They are Sampras, Andre Agassi, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Patrick
Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't start knocking on their door, knocking on these
sort of tournaments, then I'm wasting something,'' Henman said.
``My game hasn't changed. I think it's probably _ it's between my
ears. You look at the top four guys at the moment and you're not
going to put me in the same sentence with the way I'm playing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Spain's 13th-seeded Alex Corretja, who reached the final of his
Open tune-up on Long Island on Sunday at the Hamlet Cup, could not
sustain that momentum beyond the first round Tuesday and was upset
by 91st-ranked Wayne Arthurs of Australia, 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 4-6, 7-6
(8-6). . . . It took only two days for the losers to start griping
about the surface. ``These courts are way too fast,'' said Jim
Courier, who also cast some aspersions on the fans _ Tuesday's
attendance of 28,095 set a record _ in the courtside boxes.
``People in the players' box, two of them, on the cell phone
midmatch. That's pretty cheesy.'' &QL;

   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ An Argentine Boeing 737 airliner
carrying more than 100 people crashed on takeoff here Tuesday
night, slamming into a golf driving range and catching fire,
officials said. Early reports estimated that as many as 80 people
were killed and at least 23 injured, including motorists and
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that at least 10 people survived the crash of
LAPA flight 3142 as it took off at 8:30 p.m. for the city of
Cordoba. LAPA is a private airline that provides domestic service
within Argentina and flies to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told local television that one of the engines
exploded, disabling the plane before it could pick up sufficient
speed to lift into the air from Jorge Newberry Airport, which is
situated along the La Plate River on the northeast side of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that 99 passengers were on board, along with
seven crew members. The aircraft exploded only 150 feet from a
gasoline station on the outskirts of the airport, after
successfully veering away from automobile traffic and a restaurant
at a golf range.
</P>
<P>
   Local television reports said the flight had been delayed for
about 20 minutes for repairs on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the turbines giving it speed,'' a survivor, Fabian
Nunez, was quoted as saying by Reuters. ``It rose half a yard into
the air, then all I heard was silence.'' He added: ``Most people
were on fire. Only one door opened.''
</P>
<P>
   An air force spokesman said the plane bounced along the runway
onto a road and dragged passing cars in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injured people have been taken to hospitals, so there are
survivors,'' Mayor Fernando de la Rua told reporters at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the accident could have easily been far worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormous tragedy,'' said Defense Minister Jorge
Dominguez, who arrived at the scene of the crash with President
Carlos Saul Menem and most of the Cabinet. ``We are very, very
concerned. We still have to figure out the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said that several cars were struck by the crashing
aircraft, ``causing various other deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   City hospitals confirmed receiving 23 injured survivors and two
bodies, accord to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Television images showed bodies on the ground and burning
wreckage at the golf range, adjacent to the airport. The plane
apparently skidded across a busy main road at the end of the runway
and dragged cars in traffic with it to its resting place on the
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five ambulances and 15 fire trucks rushed to the site,
and television reports said the black box was retrieved. Local
hospital officials said many of the survivors suffered major burns
in the crash, while a few people apparently walked away from the
crash with only minor wounds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the flight's pilots reportedly survived the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Identification of the victims and survivors came slowly, as
family members rushed to the Buenos Aires and Cordoba airports
seeking information. Jorge Newberry Airport was closed soon after
the crash, and local flights were forced to land at the Ezeiza
international airport on the outskirts of the capital.
