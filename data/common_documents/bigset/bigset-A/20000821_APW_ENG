Verizon, Unions Make 'Tentative' Deal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Verizon Communications and unions representing 50,000
workers reached a tentative agreement Sunday on a new three-year-contract as a
two-week strike affecting 25 million phone users in the East neared an end. The
agreement was struck with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
and one of two bargaining units for the Communications Workers of America
covering employees in New York and New England. Negotiations with another
bargaining unit for the CWA -- covering more than 35,000 workers in the Middle
Atlantic states -- continued.

<P>
   RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- King Mohammed VI said Sunday that a large field of oil
and gas had been discovered near Morocco's eastern border. The king said the
find ''was good-quality and abundant,'' but he did not specify the amount
discovered near Talsint, about 60 miles from the border with gas-rich Algeria,
the official MAP news agency reported. Morocco has had no important oil or
natural gas reserves, importing virtually all its fuel.

Polls: Salazar Leads in Chiapas
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) -- Supporters of a candidate allied to Mexico's
president-elect celebrated in the streets after early results showed their
favorite ahead in Sunday's gubernatorial election. Pablo Salazar is seeking to
end the long domination of Mexico's impoverished Chiapas state by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, pledging to step up efforts to end
the six-year-old Zapatista rebellion there. The election is seen as a major test
of the PRI's ability to rebound after Vicente Fox won Mexico's presidency on
July 2 and ended the PRI's 71-year reign in Mexico. By 10:30 p.m., Salazar, head
of an eight-party coalition including Fox's party, had a lead of 56 percent to
43 percent over the PRI's Sami David, with 48 percent of the vote counted.

Rescuers Cannot Get In Russian Sub
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Norwegian divers found no sign of life Sunday, after
struggling unsuccessfully to open the escape hatch on a nuclear submarine that
sank with 118 men aboard, . Russian officials said most of the vessel was
flooded in minutes when it went down and the country's navy has all but ruled
out hope that any of the crew remains alive nine days after the Kursk sank,
crippled by a massive explosion. The divers, working 350 feet below the surface
of the Barents Sea, found signs that some of the 118 crewmen may have tried to
get out but were unable to open the escape hatch.

N.M. Pipeline Explosion Kills 10
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- An explosion of a natural gas pipeline just before
dawn Sunday swept flames down the river's banks and through the tents where two
families had been camping, killing 10 people, five of them children. The only
survivors, a man and his daughter-in-law, were in critical condition Sunday at a
Lubbock, Texas, hospital. Officials described the ruptured pipeline as a massive
flame-thrower that showered burning fuel on the victims. The explosion generated
heat so intense that sand melted into glass and concrete turned to powder, a
federal investigator said Sunday. Investigators say it likely will take several
months to determine what caused the rupture in the 30-inch-diameter pipe.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Three moderate earthquake shook central
Taiwan Monday, a day after a series of temblors rattled the area.
No injuries or damages were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The three earthquakes -- from 4.0 to 4.6 in magnitude -- struck in
succession at about 3 a.m. around Taoyuan city, about 125 miles
south of the capital, Taipei, the Central Weather Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, five earthquakes shook central Taiwan. The strongest
was a 4.6-magnitude temblor about 8.4 miles southeast of Hualien
city at 10:17 p.m., the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is often hit by tremors as it sits atop two tectonic
plates, huge, moving slabs of the Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of minor tremors and aftershocks have rattled Taiwan
since a 7.6-magnitude quake devastated parts of central Taiwan in
September, killing about 2,400 people and destroying thousands of
homes.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Salazar Leads in Chiapas  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) -- A candidate allied to Mexico's
president-elect defeated Mexico's long-governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party on Sunday, sending supporters into giddy
celebrations in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Pablo Salazar has vowed to step up efforts to end the
six-year-old Zapatista rebellion there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want our state to begin a new stage of reconciliation and
peace,'' Salazar said at a victory celebration. ''Now no more
rancor or attacks. Now no more oppression of the manifestation of
ideas. Now no more jail and burial in response to social demands.''
</P>
<P>
   The election was a blow to the ruling party, known as the PRI,
which was trying to rebound after Vicente Fox won Mexico's
presidency on July 2 and ended the party's 71-year reign in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 11 p.m., the state electoral commission said
Salazar had apparently won with 57 percent to 43 percent for Sami
David of the PRI, based on exit polls. Salazar, head of an
eight-party coalition including Fox's party, had a lead of 56
percent to 43 percent over David with nearly half the vote counted.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar's supporters began to celebrate shortly after polls
closed when the TV Azteca network reported an exit polls showed
Salazar had defeated David by 53-46 percent, with a margin of error
or three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the National Actional Party, a coalition member,
said that exit polls by four independent organizations show Salazar
ahead by seven to 17 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   PRI officials immediately questioned the polls' validity and
said their surveys showed David ahead in the vote for governor of
Chiapas. ''We have different information,'' David told state
television.
</P>
<P>
   The TV Azteca report sent Salazar supporters into the streets of
Tuxtla Gutierrez, honking car horns, waving flags and screaming in
joy from the back of pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Fox issued a statement saying the vote ''confirms the will of
the citizens to propel changes ... by way of democracy, legality
and peace,'' a reference to the still-unresolved revolt by the
Zapatista National Liberation Army that began on Jan. 1. 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Fox repeated his promise to pass an Indians rights law and
reduce troops in Chiapas, steps the Zapatistas have demanded.
</P>
<P>
   The past six years have seen four governors in Chiapas, three of
them emergency replacements for men driven from office by crises
linked to the Zapatista revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar, who had been shown leading in pre-election polls, has
vowed to aid federal peace talks between the rebels while cracking
down on paramilitary groups he says have been encouraged by the
current state and federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Zapatista revolt led to only two weeks of open
warfare, the guerrilla presence in the state's jungle canyons has
led to repeated clashes between emboldened dissident groups and
pro-government forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's voting, electoral officials and observers had
reported only scattered problems.
</P>
<P>
   For some, however, voting was an act of courage.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of a 1997 massacre of 45 people in the village of
Acteal marched for four hours through the mountains to vote in Los
Chorros, the town that had expelled them and home to many of their
paramilitary attackers. There were no polling places for absentee
voters in the towns where the refugees are sheltered.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest fear the people have in coming to the polls is
suffering an attack by the paramilitaries along the way,'' said
Agustin Vasquez Ruiz, spokesman for the Las Abejas group of
refugees from the Los Chorros area.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 polling places were scattered throughout Mexico's
poorest and most rural state, one where disputes over land,
religion and Indian rights have often erupted into violence. It is
a tough place to govern.
</P>
<P>
   In 176 years, the state has had 166 governors -- despite Mexico's
practice of six-year terms over the past six decades.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar is a former PRI senator who quit the party last year. As
senator, he was a member of a commission that negotiated a partial
peace deal with the Zapatistas rejected by the federal government.
He says his election would be a key element in bringing peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not friends'' with the Zapatistas, he said in a recent
interview. ''I know them from the negotiations. I am not a
Zapatista. But they have a great advantage with me: I am not
anti-Zapatista.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to give the Zapatistas ''the dignified out they
have been fighting for a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Verizon settles contract with thousands of workers  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Verizon Communications and unions representing
50,000 workers reached a tentative agreement Sunday on a new
three-year-contract as a two-week strike affecting 25 million phone
users in the East neared an end.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was struck with the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers and one of two bargaining units for the
Communications Workers of America covering employees in New York
and New England.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with another bargaining unit for the CWA - covering
more than 35,000 workers in the six Middle Atlantic states and the
District of Columbia - continued into early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Company and union officials expressed optimism that a tentative
accord there would be reached soon. Verizon said it expected CWA
workers in New York and New England and all IBEW members to begin
returning to their jobs Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But without a pact covering the mid-Atlantic, picket lines could
still be up Monday in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, once ratified by the unions, would replace
contracts that expired Aug. 6. Company officials said it would
provide workers a 12 percent increase in wages over the life of the
three-year contract, along with improvements in benefits and job
security protections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposed agreement gives Verizon the flexibility we need
to thrive in a highly competitive national marketplace,'' said
Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., vice chairman and president of Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, the nation's largest local phone company and wireless
carrier, was born of the summer marriage between Bell Atlantic and
GTE. After the strike, it faces a large backlog of phone repairs
and installations.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon said it would not provide further details of the
contract until the remaining bargaining unit also had reached an
agreement. But the issues that fueled the strike and dominated the
protracted negotiations centered on union concerns about shifting
work to areas of cheaper labor and mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations also became a forum for unions to push for
greater ease in trying to organize workers in Verizon's largely
non-union wireless division. The unions won concessions on that
front, with the company agreeing to allow workers to indicate their
desire to unionize by signing a card - a quicker process than
holding a secret ballot election.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were able to win a fair agreement that protects our
members' job security and gives nonunion workers an opportunity to
join our union,'' said Myles Calvey, chairman of IBEW's council
representing some 13,000 Verizon workers in five New England
states.
</P>
<P>
   IBEW officials said the company agreed to limit to slightly less
than 1 percent the number of jobs in any local that can be moved to
another area in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just what we wanted. It's great,'' said Martha Pultar, a
negotiator from IBEW, New England chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they also agreed this weekend to union
demands on who will perform high-speed Internet connection work.
The new contract also allows workers for the first time to get
stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30,000 managers have been filling in for the striking
workers, but the company still faces a running tally of about
92,000 requests for repairs. Storm damages over the past two weeks
have added to the repair load, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of orders for new phone service and high-speed
Internet access also have piled up in the 12 states in the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions that are the company's primary
service areas.
</P>
<P>
   Picketing CWA members were to have begun receiving their first
strike benefit checks Sunday - $200 a week. The strike began Aug. 6
and the benefit check would have risen to $300 weekly if the
walkout continued beyond 28 days.
</P>
<P>
   Those affected by the strike were Verizon customers in Delaware,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia
and the District of Columbia - all formerly Bell Atlantic
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA struck Bell Atlantic for two days during the last
contract negotiations in 1998. In 1989 workers remained on strike
for more than four months before reaching terms with Nynex, the New
York-New England phone company that later merged with Bell
Atlantic.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's President Faces Congress  </HEADLINE>
By LISA J. ADAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Vicente Fox achieved what some considered the
impossible by knocking the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes another daunting battle: dealing with the most
independent Congress in Mexico's history. For the first time, no
party will have a majority in either house of Congress, meaning the
incoming president will have to wheel and deal like no other.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, presidents from the Institutional Revolutionary
Party -- known by its Spanish initials as the PRI -- simply passed
down legislative initiatives to be rubber stamped by the
party-dominated Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That had already begun to change some.
</P>
<P>
   Under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, elected in 1988, a
reform was enacted prohibiting any party from having a two-thirds
majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997 elections, the PRI lost its majority in the Chamber
of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo has had to
tussle with Congress on issues ranging from bank bailouts to
budgets -- and was probably the first president to be defeated on a
major piece of legislation, failing in his effort to reform the
electricity industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Zedillo has held a trump card that Fox won't
possess when he takes office Dec. 1: a majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With no such advantage, Fox will be forced to use his veto power
on some legislative issues, while facing potential battles on
matters requiring Senate approval, such as the appointment of
Supreme Court justices, ambassadors and attorney general, said
Benito Nacif, an analyst at the Center of Economic Investigation
and Instruction in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ''This president will be subjected to the most checks and
balances in Mexico's history,'' Nacif said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox won't even have the unquestioned support of his center-right
National Action Party. Contrary to a Mexican tradition in which the
ruling PRI has been synonymous with the government, Fox is
insisting that National Action operate separately, and as a check
on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PAN is a different animal,'' Nacif said. ''There will have
to be more negotiations with the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rodolfo Elizondo, a political affairs coordinator on Fox's
transition team, notes the president-elect already is opening the
way for negotiations with his messages of plurality, the naming of
a multiparty transition team and the inclusion of opposition party
leaders on a recent trip to South America.
</P>
<P>
   He says Fox's government will have something else going for it:
the popular clamor for change that swept the blunt-talking
candidate into office. If the PRI and the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party, which will be the two main opposition parties,
oppose reforms, ''they are going to have to pay a price for that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI may be inclined to cooperation rather than confrontation
in ''fear of being perceived as an obstacle to progress,'' said
analyst Delal Baer at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   That's the face the PRI is showing now. ''The attitude of the
PRI faction will be one of openness and disposition to dialogue,''
said Beatriz Paredes, who will lead the PRI bloc in the new House.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its defeat in the presidential race, the PRI remains a
force. It will have the largest number of lawmakers in both houses
of Congress and still controls numerous state and city governments,
so there isn't likely to be any large-scale defection of PRI
legislators to National Action or other parties, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Revolution, which finished third in the presidential
election and lost 74 of the 126 congressional seats it had won in
1997, also has promised to establish a relationship with Fox's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Like Zedillo, however, Fox is unlikely to form any permanent
congressional alliances, and will instead seek out new allies issue
by issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see a test of his negotiating skills, his ability to
build consensus and bridges,'' Baer said. ''It's no accident that
every day the word consensus seems to slip out of his mouth.''

Divers Find No Sign of Life on Sub

<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Norwegian divers on Monday forced open the escape hatch on a
sunken Russian submarine, but found no sign of life, a navy spokesman said. The
divers were checking to see if they could penetrate further into the hull of the
nuclear submarine Kursk to check for any possible survivors, said navy spokesman
Vladimir Navrotsky. The breakthrough came after the Norwegian divers labored
through the day Sunday to get the hatch open. A British mini-submarine was
lowered into the water Monday and was preparing to descend to assist the rescue
operations 350 feet below the surface of the Barents Sea, officials said. The
LR5 was to try to latch on to the escape hatch and try to get rescue personnel

of the PRI's ability to rebound after Vicente Fox won Mexico's presidency on
July 2 and ended the PRI's 71-year reign in Mexico. By 10:30 p.m., Salazar, head

first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one year. Both made
five birdies, two sensational par saves and had a 31 on the back nine. Woods
outlasted May by taking only three putts in the three-hole playoff, the last one
a 2-foot par putt for his third consecutive major.

<HEADLINE> Russian Navy Faces Financial Crunch  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) -- While Russian sailors struggled to try
to reach a sunken submarine, some of the navy's best rescue vessels
sat disabled in their docks, underlining the disrepair afflicting
the country's once-powerful fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Government financing for the armed forces has melted away since
the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and the Russian navy has been
plagued by theft, aging equipment it can't afford to repair, and
rusting ships it is unable to replace.
</P>
<P>
   The severe funding shortage has weakened the navy to the degree
that it is unable even to combat poachers in Russia's waters,
government officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,000 ships have been decommissioned in the past 10 years
because the navy couldn't afford maintenance, according to navy
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   One Russian commander, Rear Adm. Nikolai Konorev, even said in a
recent newspaper interview that if the funding shortages continue
at the current level, the navy could go out of existence by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Northern Fleet headquarters in the Arctic port of
Murmansk, the coastline has turned into a giant marine junkyard,
with hundreds of ruptured and rusting ship hulls littering the
shore.
</P>
<P>
   The military bars visitors from the naval facilities and ship
junkyards, but the mounds of rusting metal can be seen from boats
that cross Kola Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Sand and silt has partly buried some of the ships. Residents
rummage among the wreckage, ripping off pieces of metal to sell for
scrap.
</P>
<P>
   Even the ships that are officially still in service often cannot
leave port. Navy officials say that 70 percent of their vessels
need major repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the lack of government funding, the navy's emergency rescue
service has been working under commercial contracts with private
firms to earn money for repairing its ships, toiling at oil
terminals of Russia's Lukoil giant, said the chief of the Northern
Fleet staff, Vice-Adm. Mikhail Motsak.
</P>
<P>
   ''We earn money wherever we can,'' Motsak told reporters in
Murmansk.
</P>
<P>
   As the navy has little money to pay its officers, some turn to
selling off equipment, further aggravating the fleet's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a nuclear submarine in Russia's Northern Fleet was
disabled after thieves pilfered vital equipment. In February, a
submarine in the Pacific Fleet was looted of radioactive fuel. Four
sailors and a retired officer were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The navy's disrepair hit home Aug. 12, when the nuclear
submarine Kursk went down in the Barents Sea with 118 sailors
aboard, and two of the Northern Fleet's most lauded rescue vessels
-- the Titov and the Pamir -- were unable to sail out to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Titov has been out of commission for a long time as it is
undergoing repairs,'' Motsak said. The Pamir was recently
renovated, but the navy's doesn't have enough money to make it
seaworthy and it remains stranded in the naval facility of
Severomorsk.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers at the Northern Fleet's Emergency Rescue Department say
they pool their personal funds to buy instruments, when they
receive their monthly pay of $535.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of rescue vessels are stranded at bases, some with minor
breakdowns because the navy cannot find a few hundred dollars to
fix them, said one officer who worked at the rescue service for six
months before quitting last month.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of funds also led the government to disband Murmansk's
deep-sea divers' service in 1995 -- a unit that some say might have
been able to rescue at least some of the Kursk sailors if it had
been deployed right away.
</P>
<P>
   According to some Russian media reports, the funding shortage
has been so acute that the Kursk apparently lacked reserve
batteries to generate power in case of emergency. The navy has
refused to answer specific questions on the submarine's condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Kursk tragedy has shown that it's not only wrong but
criminal to develop unfounded illusions about our combat
readiness,'' the daily newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote in a
front-page commentary last week.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Gather For Mattau Tribute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Five hundred Hollywood insiders packed the
Directors Guild theater for a memorial to Walter Matthau that
turned out to be as much a laugh-fest as a Friars Club roast.
</P>
<P>
   The tone Sunday was set by an invitation that specified
''cheerful attire'' and, except for some tears from Matthau's
longtime buddy Jack Lemmon, it captured the comedy of Matthau on
the screen and off.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon, whose collaboration with Matthau began with ''The
Fortune Cookie,'' told of taking his friend to a preview of a film
in which Lemmon starred.
</P>
<P>
   ''The exodus of the public began after the first reel,'' Lemmon
recalled, ''and by the end of this movie there were two rows of
people left -- probably from the studio. I asked, 'Walter what do
you think of the picture?' He said, 'Get out of it!'''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon concluded tearfully: ''He was my best friend. One thing
is a constant, when I was with Walter in a film or personally, it
was always magic time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the mourners were Diane Keaton, Neil Simon, Lauren Bacall,
Sophia Loren, Gregory Peck, Angie Dickinson, Carl Reiner and
producers Walter Mirisch and Howard W. Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau, who died of heart failure July 1 at age 79, won a
supporting actor Academy Award for ''The Fortune Cookie,'' and
cemented his stardom as Oscar Madison in ''The Odd Couple.''

<HEADLINE> Dolly Parton Visits Old High School  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVIERVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Dolly Parton appeared at her former
high school to congratulate the football team on its first-ever
state championship and announce plans for a scholarship
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it ain't just dreams that earn'' a state title, she
said Saturday at Sevier County High School, presenting a gleaming
gold trophy to the team captains at the season's first game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dollywood Foundation, which raises money for education in
her native Sevier County, will match any individual contributions
to the high school alumni association. It hopes to build a fund
large enough to award scholarships to every graduating senior.
</P>
<P>
   Parton graduated from Sevier County High School in 1964.
Although she moved to Nashville to pursue a country music career,
her parents and other relatives still live in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Parton has since boosted the county financially with ventures
such as her Dollywood theme park and she continues to pump money
into its education system. A $500,000 gift from her foundation in
1992 was the largest grant the school system had ever received.

   BARSTOW, Calif. (AP) -- What was supposed to be a simple
autograph signing session turned into a festival for Erin
Brockovich, whose battle against a California utility was turned
into a hit movie.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people turned out to see Brockovich, the legal
assistant played in the movie by Julia Roberts, at Silver Screen
Video to sign copies of the ''Erin Brockovich'' video and DVD last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just wanted a small signing out in front,'' Silver Screen
Video owner Roberta Walker said. ''Then Universal got wind of it
and said, 'Why don't you let us do a little more for it?' It's more
than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor even proclaimed Aug. 15 Erin Brockovich Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to tell you from the bottom of my heart that I hope
that all of you are proud of you,'' Brockovich said to the crowd
after accepting the proclamation. ''You inspire me. You are my
heroes.''

<HEADLINE> Gates Competes in Bridge Tournament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates put his
cards on the table as he played in the final rounds of the North
American Bridge Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman John Pinette confirmed that Gates was
participating Sunday, but said he didn't know how he had fared.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' partner, Sharon Osberg of San Francisco, and teammates
Sheri Weinstock of Toronto and Howard Weinstein of Chicago just
managed to reach the finals on Saturday, garnering a total of 27
points in qualifying sessions. The cutoff score was 26.5.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is the first time he has played in a national
championship, Gates is a longtime online bridge player and his
performance in the finals has been impressive, tournament officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gates has done remarkably well in this tournament,'' said
American Contract Bridge League spokesman Michael Calhoun. ''His
partners have enjoyed his passion for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The game is so deep,'' Gates said in a statement. ''There's
always something you can learn.''

<HEADLINE> Zoo Celebrates Panda's Birthday  </HEADLINE>
By JUDY LIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- No ties are required, but this birthday party
at the San Diego Zoo will be strictly black and white.
</P>
<P>
   As the zoo prepares an elaborate party for their 1-year-old
giant panda, the cuddly cub was expected to spend the day as she
usually does -- ignoring humans.
</P>
<P>
   While zoologists celebrate what they've learned about panda
behavior by presenting her with a special ice cake, the birthday
girl will likely stick with her daily routine of sleeping, eating
bamboo, lounging on her favorite tree branch, or hiding in her den.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's birthday bash, visitors can sign a huge card,
sing ''Happy Birthday,'' and expect longer that the usual hour-long
waits to be lucky enough to get a peek at the 60-pound fuzzy Hua
Mei and her panda parents.
</P>
<P>
   As the first surviving Ailuropoda melanoleuca born in the United
States, Hua Mei has taught scientists a lot about the way these
solitary and endangered species live.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the San Diego Zoo's pandas -- Hua Mei, and her
parents, Bai Yun, 9, and Shi Shi, 21 -- are on loan from China. The
contract expires in 2004 but the zoo is hoping for an extension.
</P>
<P>
   When Bai Yun became pregnant in April 1999 through artificial
insemination, zoologists immediately turned their attention to
parenting and panda development.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, 1999, Bai Yun delivered her furless baby weighing 4
or 5 ounces. To the zoo's relief, Bai Yun immediately began
cradling the tiny pink cub after delivery and devoted all of her
time to nursing the infant.
</P>
<P>
   Zoologists were nervous during the first few months, the most
critical for a panda cub because they are underdeveloped at birth.
But Mom took to her baby, cuddling her newborn in her arms during
feedings.
</P>
<P>
   Hua Mei's growth since then has been typical, opening her eyes
on day 45, taking her first steps at 3 months and finally venturing
out on her own at 5 months.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the cub stands about 2&AMP;frac12; feet and has attracted about 3
million visitors to the zoo. Although still dependent on her
mother's milk, Hua Mei has teeth to gnash bamboo, carrots, apples
and biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Pandas generally survive 20 years in captivity and Hua Mei is
expected to live a healthy life. She shows it everyday by climbing
to her favorite resting spot on a tree branch 12 feet up where
everyone can see her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the baby the most because it's smaller and more
fluffy,'' said 13-year-old zoo visitor A.J. Mughni, who was on
vacation last week with his family from New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Washington Lauds Eisenhower Building  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the North Lawn of the White House the
building bulks like a giant aircraft carrier, a prodigious,
gray-granite ship of state burdened with pillars, ornament and
history.
</P>
<P>
   Once denounced as an unfit architectural companion to the
chastely simple White House just across the way, the newly renamed
Eisenhower Executive Office Building has survived the whims of
architectural fashion and, ironically, even an Eisenhower-era
recommendation that it be demolished.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want it torn down; I think it's the greatest
monstrosity in America,'' former President Truman proclaimed in
1958.
</P>
<P>
   When the building was approved in 1869 as a new home for the
State, War and Navy departments, its design was seen as
state-of-the-art architecture, not a monstrosity. Architect Alfred
Mullet designed it in the florid, mansarded-roof, chimney-potted
style of the French Second Empire, including some 900 exterior
columns.
</P>
<P>
   Construction took 17 years, beginning in 1871 when U.S. Grant
was president, and it was quickly put to work.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four secretaries of state practiced diplomacy there, from
Hamilton Fish in the days of gaslight to George C. Marshall at the
opening of the nuclear age.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven future presidents walked the marble-tiled
corridors. One, William Howard Taft, was among the 21 secretaries
of war to use the building. Both Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt
served there as assistant secretaries of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight D. Eisenhower knew the building well during his long
service as a military aide in the War Department in the 1930s, long
before he rose to five-star general and became the 34th president.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, workmen erected bronze plaques bearing his name,
carrying out a congressional directive to change its identity as
the Old Executive Office Building, or EOB.
</P>
<P>
   The EOB shorthand stuck even after a new executive office
building was built nearby several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Every vice president since Lyndon Johnson has had his principal
office in the EOB; three of them -- Johnson, Gerald Ford and George
Bush -- have become president.
</P>
<P>
   The building has provided office space for presidential staffs
since the State, War and Navy departments moved elsewhere, leaving
a legacy of a thousand treaty signings and recollections of the
Spanish-American War and World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In Room 208, on Dec. 7, 1941, Secretary of State Cordell Hull
applied muleskinner profanity as he received ambassadors from Japan
just hours after Japanese forces had attacked Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   In Room 474, on Jan. 19, 1955, Eisenhower conducted the first
televised presidential news conference and set a precedent for a
new age of White House communications.
</P>
<P>
   President Nixon spent much time isolated in his EOB hideaway as
the Watergate scandal erupted. It was there, he said in his
memoirs, that he decided to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North spent a late night shredding papers
in the building as the Iran-Contra scandal threatened to engulf the
Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   A grinning President Clinton rode a bicycle down some of the
nearly two miles of corridors in a humorous video shown earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents no longer see the Old EOB as a candidate for the
wrecking ball, but in the post-World War II years the opulent old
pile seemed like an embarrassing monument to wretched
overindulgence.
</P>
<P>
   ''People with the gift of taste were ashamed of it,'' E.J.
Applewhite wrote in ''Washington Itself,'' an informal guide to the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   What appeared to be a death sentence came in 1957 when an
Eisenhower administration commission recommended the building be
demolished ''in view of its recognized faults and deficiencies of
design.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower said that while he'd leave the decision to the
experts, he did have a personal opinion. ''I worked nine years in
this building, and so from sentiment's sake, I would probably say I
wouldn't want to see it torn down,'' he said at 1957 news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The first signs of the historic preservation movement were
beginning to stir. In the Kennedy administration, a new Commission
of Fine Arts recommended the building be spared and restored.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration began in the 1980s, removing World War II
blackout paint from stained-glass domes, replacing thousands of
windows, fixing the slate-tiled roof and preserving the 4,000 brass
staircase balusters.
</P>
<P>
   Also preserved were the 26 outdoor flowerpot urns installed in
1913 during the six-month reign of Capt. Douglas MacArthur, another
future five-star general, as building superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Public tours, by reservation only, showcase the refurbished
Indian Treaty Room, two jewel-case libraries with cast-iron
balconies and the vice president's ceremonial office, restored to
its appearance in 1900 when it was the office of the secretary of
the Navy.

<HEADLINE> Divers Find No Sign of Life on Sub  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Norwegian divers on Monday forced open the escape
hatch on a Russian nuclear submarine that sank nine days ago, but
found no sign that any of the 118 crewmen were alive, a navy
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The divers were seeing if they could penetrate further into the
shattered hull of the submarine Kursk to check for any possible
survivors, said navy spokesman Vladimir Navrotsky.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came after the Norwegian divers labored through
the day Sunday to get the hatch open.
</P>
<P>
   A British mini-submarine was lowered into the water Monday and
was preparing to descend to assist the rescue operations 350 feet
below the surface of the Barents Sea, officials said. The LR5 was
to try to latch on to the escape hatch and get rescue personnel
into the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian divers had looked into a chamber below the escape
hatch, but had not gotten into the main body of the submarine,
Navrotsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy said earlier there was almost no chance of
finding survivors and it appeared that most of the Kursk was
flooded after being shattered by a massive explosion when it sank
Aug 12.
</P>
<P>
   The first scan of the inside of the section below the escape
hatch did not reveal any bodies, Navrotsky said. Russian officials
said Sunday that there was at least one body trapped below the
escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy said the Norwegian divers were looking at ways
to open an internal hatch below the escape entrance. But Russian
Adm. Vyacheslav Popov told Russia's RTR television network that the
inner chamber appeared to be flooded.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue operation continued to be surrounded by conflicting
reports from Russian and Western officials. The Russians had
insisted for days that the escape hatch could not be opened, but
the Norwegians had said they were confident of success and refused
to give up.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials earlier had played down expectations over the
capability of the British submarine, noting that its own
mini-submarines had failed in days of anguished efforts to connect
with the hatch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The British submarine is similar to ours, so we believe that
it will be unable to dock either,'' Deputy Prime Minister Ilya
Klebanov said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin, widely criticized for his slow and
low-key public response to the crisis, pledged Sunday that ''until
the last minute, we will do everything to save everyone who could
be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not appear optimistic. ''Regrettably, sometimes it's
not us but circumstances which determine how the situation
develops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New details emerged Sunday of how severely the Kursk was
shattered when it sank during naval exercises on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''Water almost instantly flooded the submarine's hull up to the
fifth or sixth compartments. The crew in those sections died almost
instantaneously and the submarine became uncontrollable,'' Klebanov
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the crew might have survived for a time in the three aft
compartments. Norwegian officials said Sunday that the divers found
indications that some air pockets may remain in the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   RTR showed Russian and foreign naval experts aboard a control
ship intently watching video monitors on which the divers could be
seen moving slowly in a ghostly light around the hatch.
</P>
<P>
   One diver grabbed a shattered fragment of the hull, about the
size of a loaf of bread, and showed it to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have said the Kursk's nuclear reactors
apparently switched off in the accident, but the new evidence of
how the submarine was torn apart raised concerns that they could
have been damaged in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said Sunday a Second World War mine or a collision with
a foreign submarine were possible scenarios. The U.S. and British
navies, which often have submarines in the area, denied their
vessels were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said there were up to three foreign submarines in the
area when the Kursk was lost and that requests for information from
foreign countries which he did not specify had not been answered.
</P>
<P>
   A probable scenario was that a torpedo in the Kursk's forward
compartment exploded, setting off a much bigger explosion. U.S. and
Norwegian authorities detected two explosions in the area at the
time the Kursk was lost.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Denounces U.S. Migration Law  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLON, Cuba (AP) -- Daisy Bueno watched her only two sons walk
out of their simple wooden home two weeks ago, lured by what she
calls a ''cruel'' promise of residency in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She choked back tears explaining why she never saw them again:
their shark-torn bodies appeared a day later in the Florida
Straits.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of the two young men on Aug. 9 -- less than two months
after Cuba won a standoff over the custody of 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez -- highlight the island nation's next battle: U.S.
immigration policy on Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   A billboard in Havana shouts ''Down with the Cuban Adjustment
Act,'' the U.S. law that guarantees refugee status to Cubans -- if
they can make it across a shark-infested stretch of ocean to
America.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government newspaper, Granma, called it ''The Killer
Law,'' in a Friday editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans who have been unable to obtain a U.S. visa to emigrate
see the law as their only chance for economic advancement after
living in a country where most jobs are low-paying government
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Castro complains that the law not only puts the lives of Cubans
at risk, it serves as a means for his political enemies to
characterize all people leaving Cuba as political refugees fleeing
repression.
</P>
<P>
   For Daisy Bueno, the mother of Alexei Rodriguez, 20 and Juan
Carlos Rodriguez, 23, the law has been a tragedy for many Cuban
families.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's cruel,'' said Bueno, as she sat in her tiny,
four-room house in this small town 100 miles east of Havana, her
sons' beds neatly made, their clothes still carefully hung in the
closet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very dangerous, and it has destroyed many families,
especially mothers,'' Bueno said. Her sons' boxer dog, Chester,
gazed expectantly toward the door.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the U.S. policy, Niobel Gonzalez, Bueno's only
surviving child, said, ''I think what all Cubans think, that it's
unfair. The majority (of those who try the crossing) don't get
across the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no moves in Congress to change the law, which Havana
says violates U.S.-Cuba migration accords.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans believe the United States should adhere to the
principle established by the 1966 Cuban adjustment act,'' the party
said in a platform document approved at its convention earlier this
month. That document says Castro's government -- not U.S. policy --
''forces Cubans into the sea in a desperate bid for freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, have committed the party ''to continue to
press for human rights, the rule of law and political freedom'' in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Bueno and Niobel say their family has received clothing and
medicine from relatives who made the journey to Miami in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Bueno said it might have been their success that inspired Alexia
and Juan Carlos to set off on their perilous journey without
telling her. ''I would have told them not to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The government here sees the new battle against the Cuban
Adjustment Act as a continuation of the fight over Elian, who was
returned to Cuba June 28 after a seven-month custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans have been asked to sign an oath that formalizes the
government's opposition to U.S. laws meant to isolate Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''The combat for the return of the kidnapped Cuban boy has
become the first episode of a much more prolonged struggle,'' the
oath reads, adding that the Elian case has ''unleashed a great
battle ... to end the causes which have led to so cruel and sad an
event.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Bueno household, the debate over the Cuban Adjustment
Act has ended.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would ever try to emigrate to the United States --
even legally -- she gives an emphatic ''no.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm staying here. I think that if they tried and didn't make
it, I don't want to have anything to do with that place.''

<HEADLINE> China To Search For Tax Violations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China will audit all government and Communist
Party officials when they leave office, intensifying efforts to
combat corruption that is eroding public support for communist
rule, state media said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The government's National Audit Office will extend the reach of
current investigations by bringing ministry-level officials under
scrutiny -- a ''new iron fist'' in the fight against graft, the
official newspaper China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted Li Jinhua, the office's auditor-general, as saying the
aim was to make routine a system in which every official is checked
upon leaving or retiring from their post.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest step in China's campaign to stop corruption. The
highest-level politician caught so far was Cheng Kejie, 66, a
former deputy chairman of the legislature who was sentenced to
death July 31 for amassing $4.9 million in bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials approaching retirement are thought to be
especially vulnerable to corruption, with some amassing funds to
support themselves after they leave office.
</P>
<P>
   The China Daily said the new auditing system has already been
applied to officials at the county-level and below, the heads of
state-run firms and provincial government bureau chiefs in eastern
Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the Communist Party on Sunday
announced a 10-year plan to reform the civil service. Among the
changes will be new regulations to curb corruption in promotions of
government and party officials, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
said.

Divers Find No Sign of Life on Russian Sub
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Norwegian divers on Monday forced open the escape hatch on a
Russian nuclear submarine that sank nine days ago, but found no sign that any of
the 118 crewmen were alive, a navy spokesman said. The divers were seeing if
they could penetrate further into the shattered hull of the submarine Kursk to
check for any possible survivors, said navy spokesman Vladimir Navrotsky. The
breakthrough came after the Norwegian divers labored through the day Sunday to
get the hatch open. The Norwegian divers had looked into a chamber below the
escape hatch, but had not gotten into the main body of the submarine, officials
said.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Slowly, the digital divide is narrowing. Fifty

last year. The increase makes low-income households the fastest growing segment

<HEADLINE> Timber Companies Follow Old Rules  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA COOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- In the battle to save dwindling salmon
populations in the West, Washington state's 50-year deal with the
timber industry that limited logging near streams was heralded as a
momentous victory.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government began using the ''Forest and Fish''
agreement -- meant to protect trees shading salmon streams -- as a
model for other Western states.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke praised it. And the timber industry
ran full-page ads trumpeting the ''landmark effort initiated by
Washington State's private forest landowners.''
</P>
<P>
   But lost amid the hurrahs was the fact that the law allows
timber companies and other landowners to continue logging under old
rules for up to two years. And at least some companies are doing
just that.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules took effect March 20. In the week before the
deadline, the state Department of Natural Resources was flooded
with 592 logging applications. The permits slowed to a trickle the
next week, when only 55 were submitted.
</P>
<P>
   As long as timber companies submitted applications before the
rules took effect, they are free to log under the old rules until
those permits expire in two years.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis of state records by The Associated
Press, about 800,000 acres of Washington forest could still be
harvested under the old rules. That's an area about the size of
Rhode Island, or 2 percent of Washington's total land area.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in the rules is that loggers must leave 20
percent more trees standing beside streams. Salmon need cool, clean
water to survive. When trees are cut near streams, runoff can cloud
the water and the lack of shade makes the streams too warm for
salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Timber companies acknowledge they are cutting some trees under
the old regulations, even while they pay for ads praising the new
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not perfect,'' said Bill Wilkerson, president of the
Forest Protection Association, the timber industry group that paid
for the newspaper ads.
</P>
<P>
   But it is legal, as Wilkerson noted: ''The federal agencies
never asked us to change the state law allowing the permits to be
grandfathered in.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson said many companies are voluntarily implementing the
new standards. Other timber managers say the rules are complex and
will take time to implement. Environmentalists say gradual change
won't save salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone knows and acknowledges that the old rules harm
salmon,'' said Becky Kelley, program coordinator for the Washington
Environmental Council. ''For them to be continuing along that path
and trying to convince the public that they've changed is very
dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating the rules took two years of negotiations, during which
the timber industry complained the rules would be too strict and
environmentalists said they wouldn't be strict enough. Similar
talks are now taking place in Oregon and California.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists eventually dropped out of the Washington
negotiations and denounced the final result. But the federal
government has tentatively approved the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules are part of a multimillion dollar effort to save
salmon from extinction. The West Coast salmon population is just 10
percent of what it was in the 1800s, and 26 runs of Pacific salmon,
steelhead and trout are listed as threatened or endangered under
the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Ken Jacobsen, a key player in the Forest and Fish
Act, said he was surprised that timber companies aren't adopting
the new regulations quickly.
</P>
<P>
   If companies are continuing to log under the old rules, Jacobsen
said, ''They certainly didn't stick with the spirit of Forest and
Fish.''

<HEADLINE> S.Koreans See Another Side of North  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- At the height of the Cold War, many
South Koreans were taught in school that North Koreans were a
shifty, aggressive lot who might be lurking in their midst as
spies. Cartoons often depicted them as wolves and monsters.
</P>
<P>
   That image has faded since North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, head
of a communist state once synonymous with menace and mystery, began
communicating with the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   Conciliatory events from the reunions of separated families last
week to the performance of a North Korean philharmonic orchestra in
Seoul this week are helping humanize a country deemed dangerous,
unpredictable and even weird since the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   During the reunions, 100 North Koreans and an equal number of
South Koreans, separated from relatives for half a century, met
with family members in Seoul and Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans watching live television footage saw neatly
dressed North Koreans at their most vulnerable: sobbing, kneeling
and bowing before infirm parents and reminiscing over photo albums
with long-lost relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past, we thought that the strange North Koreans had
horns on their heads. The current exchange of visitors should serve
as an occasion to correct that,'' said South Korean novelist Lee
Ho-chul, part of a Red Cross team that traveled with family members
to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   There were awkward, even chilling moments, as when North Korean
family members intoned praise of Kim Jong Il, who commands a
personality cult in the North and is revered as ''Great Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean relatives, more accustomed to criticizing their
democratic politicians, usually waited in silence for these
monologues to end, although a few argued.
</P>
<P>
   In the North, some South Koreans were alarmed at their
relatives' shabby clothes and often scrawny appearance, and slipped
them U.S. dollar bills. Most of the Northerners who came South were
dapper, hand-picked luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   There is still uneasiness about North Korea's reasons for
opening up, and questions about how far it will go, because change
inevitably will weaken the government's control over its people.
Desperation for economic aid from the South and elsewhere is
considered a key motive.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il still commands a huge military, and has rejected
U.S. appeals to stop developing missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet South Koreans seem fascinated with the plump leader, whose
jovial nature is at odds with his country's dour image.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans feed their interest, telling visiting South
Korean media executives this month that he sleeps four hours a
night, prefers French wine over any other and reads fewer
newspapers these days because of fading eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have become a film critic or filmmaker if I had not
become a politician,'' confessed Kim Jong Il, who became leader in
1994 on the death of his father and national founder, Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
   The peacemaking process began in June, when Kim Jong Il met
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung at a summit. Before that, South
Korean officials said Kim Jong Il's voice had been broadcast only
once. In accepting a post as North Korea's military commander in
1991, he said at a rally of army officers: ''May glory be with our
revolutionary armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   After the summit, South Korean President Kim said he thought his
North Korean counterpart seemed sincere about reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''(He) was not very logical, but he had an intellectual capacity
and sharp judgments,'' the president said. ''He listened to other
people and once he was persuaded, he embraced their ideas with
boldness. I could talk common sense with him.''

<HEADLINE> Dame Judi Dench Toots Her Own Horn  </HEADLINE>
By MATT WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Judi Dench is hardly one to blow her own horn, but
that's exactly what she does -- the tenor sax, to be precise -- in
the new TV movie ''The Last of the Blonde Bombshells.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people gave me a funny look,'' says the legendary
British actress, whose illustrious career has never before required
such an assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Dench has spent more time of late playing big-screen queens --
Victoria in ''Mrs. Brown'' and Elizabeth I in ''Shakespeare in
Love.'' But ''Blonde Bombshells'' allowed her to forsake royalty to
work alongside a friend and colleague, Sir Ian Holm, whom Dench,
now 65, has known for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''What attracts me is that a script should be totally different,
so you can get your teeth into it,'' she says, adding deadpan, ''No
more queens for a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Last of the Blonde Bombshells,'' which HBO airs Saturday
(Aug. 26) at 9 p.m. EDT, is directed by Gillies Mackinnon, the Scot
whose feature films include ''Hideous Kinky'' and ''The Playboys.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's the cast -- veterans all -- that is its undeniable
calling card. Joining Dench as the Blonde Bombshells, an all-girl
World War II swing band reconstituted for one final hurrah, are
Olympia Dukakis and Leslie Caron, alongside beloved Britons such as
Billie Whitelaw, Dame Cleo Laine, Joan Sims and June Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   Holm plays the aging roue Patrick, who was the Bombshells'
drummer all those years ago -- appearing in drag so as to become one
of the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a joyous event, really,'' says Holm, London's recent,
and much celebrated, stage and TV King Lear.
</P>
<P>
   The twinkly-eyed actor, mustachioed for the occasion, could be
found one brisk afternoon in a trailer adjoining Dench's.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wonderful to be working again with Dench, J.'' -- as Holm
refers to his co-star -- ''because we go back a long way.''
Specifically, their friendship dates back to a 1962 theater revival
of Chekhov's ''The Cherry Orchard,'' when Holm played the student
Trofimov to Dench's lovesick Anya.
</P>
<P>
   As for this latest role, Holm says of his character's
cross-dressing past, ''that's a first.'' He adds with a laugh,
''I've always wanted to play a camp Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and the ladies are learning some fancy fingering.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us can play any instruments at all,'' he acknowledges
with a smile. ''I'm on the drums, so I'm kind of lucky; they're in
the back anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Dench, ''I learned to play a scale. That was pretty
hairy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bombshells'' requires Dench to strut her stuff on tenor sax
while her colleagues field the alto sax (Whitelaw), double bass
(Caron), trombone (Whitfield) and trumpet (Dukakis), among other
instruments. Their material embraces standards such as ''It Don't
Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)'' and ''Mairzy Doats.''
</P>
<P>
   The performers are scarcely less nervous than their characters.
As Alan Plater's script has it, Dench's widowed Elizabeth has to do
some fairly deft persuading -- not to mention traveling the length
of Britain -- to reassemble the Bombshells for one last, roisterous
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''All she's after is a kind of life,'' Dench says of the wistful
free spirit that is Elizabeth, ''the kind of life she once had.
That's why the younger generation think she's gone mad -- she's
regaining something she thought was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Dench's own life has changed enormously in the two years since
''Mrs. Brown'' -- a BBC venture originally intended purely for
television -- brought her an Oscar nomination. John Madden's
small-scale movie introduced an exalted theater actress to that
large, international public who might otherwise only have known her
as James Bond's tart-tongued boss, M.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Dench's eight minutes in ''Shakespeare in Love''
brought her the supporting actress Oscar, followed 10 weeks later
by the best actress Tony Award for her return to Broadway in
''Amy's View.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she is smitten with New York, as is her 27-year-old
daughter, Finty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time Finty and I even see a picture or a film of New York,
it catches my heart terribly,'' she says. ''Finty and I have
completely gone bananas; I love it so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Broadway, Dench has narrated ''Into the Arms of
Strangers,'' a documentary opening in the United States on Sept.
15, and filmed a supporting role in ''Chocolat,'' a Lasse Hallstrom
movie set in rural France in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, she will star in a film biography of novelist Iris
Murdoch, who died last year of Alzheimer's at age 79.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a lot of natural energy, the energy my mother had,''
Dench says of her appetite for work. ''I'm very lucky: It's no good
in this business if you're tired.''

<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates six times in the past 14
months in an effort to slow the economy and stave off inflation.
The strategy appears to be working, as a number of economic
indicators released in recent weeks have indicated that the economy
is still growing but inflation hasn't reached dangerous levels.

<HEADLINE> Gates Competes in Bridge Tournament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Microsoft chairman Bill Gates may be king
of software, but he'll need a bit more practice before ruling the
world of bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' four-member team finished 50th Sunday during the 52-team
finals of the North American Bridge Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the showing, Gates remained upbeat about his first
appearance in the tournament, which included some of the top bridge
players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said it was a blast to play against really good company,''
tournament spokesman Paul Linxwiler said. ''He said he will be back
bigger and better, and he was laughing all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates is a longtime online bridge player, and his performance in
the finals was impressive, tournament officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game is so deep,'' Gates said earlier in a statement.
''There's always something you can learn.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock moved higher Monday on optimism that the
Federal Reserve Board will leave interest rates alone Tuesday.

   In midmorning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial

<HEADLINE> Briton Lands Harry Potter Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The big screen has found its Harry Potter:
11-year-old British actor Daniel Radcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel will play the boy wizard in the movie adaptation of
''Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone,'' due in theaters next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel portrayed young David in a recent BBC adaptation of
''David Copperfield.'' He also appears in the upcoming John Boorman
movie ''The Tailor of Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Chris Columbus and producer David Heyman said Monday
they also have cast two British newcomers to play Harry's best
friends at Hogwarts school. Ten-year-old Emma Watson will play
Hermione and 11-year-old Rupert Grint will play Ron. Both have
acted in school plays.
</P>
<P>
   The casting call for Harry and other characters from J.K.
Rowling's best-selling books had children from Britain and
elsewhere sending in audition tapes to Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw so many enormously talented kids in the search for
Harry,'' Columbus said in an announcement on Warner's Harry Potter
Web site. ''The process was intense and there were times when we
felt we would never find an individual who embodied the complex
spirit and depth of Harry Potter. Then, Dan walked into the room
and we all knew we had found Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Potter books follow the exploits of an 11-year-old boy who
discovers he inherited magical powers from his parents, a pair of
wizards killed by a powerful enemy.

   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Rescue crews battling strong wind on
Monday recovered the bodies of 14 victims, including six children,
who died in an army plane crash in southern Chile two weeks ago,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Commandos reached the area by land and cleared a spot for the
landing of an air force helicopter, which brought out the bodies,
air force Col. Alejandro Salas said.
</P>

   The Spanish-made Casa T212 crashed Aug. 6 while flying in a
storm near Chaiten, 890 miles south of Santiago. The wreckage was
located Sunday night. Salas said the aircraft was ''badly

</P>
<P>
   The aircraft was carrying two crew members and six children ages
2 to 13, all relatives of army personnel.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Chief of Staff Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Angry door-slamming in the prime minister's
office and Monday's sudden resignation of a top aide, the second
within a week, are highlighting Ehud Barak's growing political
woes.
</P>
<P>
   With his coalition in a shambles and early elections apparently
inevitable, Barak is now being taken to task for his high-handed
leadership style, with former allies complaining that he often
ignores advice and fails to delegate responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli leader's counteroffensive -- an announcement that he
is launching a major secular rights crusade for a constitution and
civil marriage laws -- was dismissed as a clumsy attempt to win back
disappointed voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is desperate,'' political commentator Hanan Crystal said of
the ex-army chief once widely admired for his cool under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's political survival depends largely on whether he will be
able to conclude a peace agreement with the Palestinians before the
Knesset, or legislature, reconvenes in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Barak wraps up a deal, which at this stage remains
doubtful because talks are deadlocked over control of Jerusalem, he
would not be able to ratify it. The prime minister lost his
parliamentary majority before leaving for last month's Mideast
summit at Camp David, with three of six parties quitting his
coalition. His efforts to lure the ultra-Orthodox Shas party back
into his government failed for good over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a treaty, Barak is expected to call early
elections that would serve as a referendum on the terms of
Palestinian statehood. If peace talks collapse, Barak may not be
able to cling to power: Former allies, including Shas and Israel
B'Aliya, a faction representing Russian immigrants, are now siding
with Likud, the hawkish leading opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's announcement over the weekend that he plans to launch
nothing short of a ''secular revolution'' -- an open challenge to
the powerful religious parties -- was widely seen as an attempt to
boost his re-election agenda in case he has to face voters without
a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister apparently hopes to win back the support of
immigrants from the former Soviet Union. They have deserted him in
droves, both because he reneged on promises to stand up to the
religious parties and because they oppose land concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal said the gamble could pay off. However, the prime
minister's plan was largely met by scorn and skepticism Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A situation in which a prime minister with 42 (of 120) votes
in the Knesset announces his intention to pass a constitution is
similar to Albania declaring war on the United States,''
commentator Shahar Ilan wrote in the Haaretz daily.
</P>
<P>
   Others criticized him for not consulting with his advisers
before launching an undertaking of such magnitude. Barak is now on
the record as the first prime minister who wants to try to turn
Israel into a secular state, but he never consulted leading members
of his Labor Party or senior aides before going public with the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   His go-it-alone style has angered his closest advisers,
including Haim Mendel-Shaked, who resigned Monday as the chief of
staff in the prime minister's office. Only a week ago,
Mendel-Shaked's deputy quit in anger. Both men served under Barak
when he commanded the army's elite commando unit, Sayeret Matkal.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper reports said the rivalries in Barak's office were so
intense that Israel's security was at risk. The Yediot Ahronot
daily said Barak's senior security adviser, Danny Yatom, was barely
on speaking terms with the heads of the two major security
services, the Mossad and the Shin Bet.
</P>
<P>
   ''With his (Barak's) chaotic style ... this explosion was just a
matter of time,'' political commentator Emanuel Rosen said of the
name-calling in Barak's office.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Trial Start Seen Next Week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian ex-President Suharto's
trial on corruption charges is expected to start next week, with
the exact date and venue to be announced on Wednesday, court
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta Judge Lalu Mariyun, who will oversee the trial as part
of a five-judge panel, met police and officials from the Attorney
General's Office on Monday to discuss logistics, officials at the
South Jakarta Court said. Mariyun would hold a news conference on
Wednesday, they said.
</P>
<P>
   One court official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Aug. 31 had been penciled in as the starting date.
</P>
<P>
   He said a building belonging to Ministry of Agriculture in the
south of the capital had been chosen as the venue. Hearing rooms at
the South Jakarta Court are too small to accommodate the trial,
which is expected to attract hundreds of journalists and
spectators, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Student protesters, who have repeatedly gone into the streets
demanding Suharto's prosecution, are also expected to stage
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 79, ruled Indonesia for three decades, but was forced
from power two years ago by pro-democracy protests. His prosecution
is regarded as a crucial test of the 10-month-old government of
President Abdurrahman Wahid, who has vowed to clean up the endemic
corruption that riddles the world's fourth most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors have charged Suharto with siphoning off at
least $570 million in state funds through a complex network of
charities under his control. The former dictator, who like many
Indonesians uses one name, has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   If he is convicted, he could spend the rest of his life behind
bars, although Wahid has offered a pardon in exchange for the
return of any ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's attorneys have said he should not be forced into a
courtroom because a series of recent strokes damaged his brain.
They claim his memory and ability to answer questions have been
badly affected.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians have examined Suharto on several occasions recently,
and he has undergone a number of brain scans. Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman says medical tests show that Suharto is fit to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto had been under house arrest since May. His detention
status was changed recently to allow him to travel around, but not
outside of, Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Losers Can Still Win  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- So ''Survivor's'' triumphant survivor picks
up a million bucks Wednesday? Big deal. There's more coconuts than
that to go around for the other players, the show's producer and
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the network: 30-second commercial spots on the two-hour
''Survivor'' finale went for up to $600,000, CBS Television
president Leslie Moonves happily divulged. And the No. 1 summer
program provided a ratings transfusion to CBS' struggling ''The
Early Show,'' which features ousted ''Survivor'' contestants each
week.
</P>
<P>
   Series producer Mark Burnett has emerged as the king of reality
TV, especially since CBS' hapless ''Big Brother'' proved that not
just any format -- even those that worked in Europe -- can make it in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett's ''Survivor'' sequel, set in the Australian outback,
will debut after the Super Bowl on Jan. 28, and then he sets his
sights higher: a trip to outer space, the grand prize for his next
series.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody already knows who the winner is ... Mr. Burnett and
CBS,'' joked ''Survivor'' contestant Gretchen Cordy last month.
</P>
<P>
   As for the $1 million winner, the four remaining players will be
whittled down to two Wednesday, with the champion then picked by
the seven last castoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists are Kelly Wiglesworth, 23, a river guide from Las
Vegas; corporate trainer Richard Hatch, 39, of Newport, R.I.; Rudy
Boesch, 72, a retired Navy SEAL from Virgina Beach, Va., and truck
driver Susan Hawk, 38, of Palmyra, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the other ''Survivor'' contestants, who endured
roasted rat entrees but will miss out on the big bundle of cash?
</P>
<P>
   They're not necessarily losers. Any measure of fame can be a
liquid asset in this media age.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest coup so far, ex-''Survivor'' and New York
physician Sean Kenniff signed on as a medical correspondent for the
TV magazine ''Extra.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco attorney Stacey Stillman and B.B. Andersen, a
retired contractor from Mission Hills, Kan., filmed Reebok ads.
Jenna Lewis, a Franklin, N.H., college student and mother of twins,
is considering a reported $500,000 offer to pose for Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may hinder some of my other career moves. But it would also
take care of me and my daughters for many, many years to come,''
Lewis told the Toronto Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Haskell, a student from Miami Beach, reportedly rebuffed
Playboy but could have a radio job in the Miami area. Biochemist
Ramona Gray of Edison, N.J., will be a Miss Teen U.S.A. judge;
substitute teacher Dirk Been of Spring Green, Wis., endorsed an
herbal cold remedy, Airborne; and Philadelphia youth coach Gervase
Peterson is appearing on ''The Hughleys'' sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flurry of offers, the contestants have to face
reality: Their window of opportunity is about as large as a TV
screen, and we don't mean a big-screen model.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most instant celebrities do in fact have 15 minutes of fame.
That will be true of virtually all of them,'' said Alfred Geller,
head of New York-based Geller Media Management, Inc. ''It's a
limited shelf life and it's a limited range.''
</P>
<P>
   A scant few thrust into the public arena manage to make it a
permanent home. Where's John Wayne Bobbitt, the domestic violence
victim-turned-porn actor, now?
</P>
<P>
   Talent is the prerequisite for ''Survivor'' contestants trying
for a serious run at show biz.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last analysis, you have to have the goods,'' Geller
said. Dr. Kenniff, for example, can succeed ''if he has any natural
ability and they ('Extra') can help him grow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants who showed charisma in the ''Survivor''
universe, such as the crusty Boesch, may not shine in Hollywood,
according to Geller. ''Is Rudy going to become a star on 'As the
World Turns?' Is he going to have a television career? It's very
unlikely. And what do you do with the woman truck driver?''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, the Machiavellian contestant many viewers love to hate,
is articulate enough to take a stab at television and already has
been deluged with offers for appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking with his current profession and possibly writing a book
might be his best option, Geller suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could become a bigger celebrity in the corporate training
field as a result of this and will be able to capitalize like crazy
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Contestants aren't completely on their own. CBS gets to weigh in
on their post-show activities because of the contract each signed.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to ''protect the 'Survivor' brand,'' CBS spokesman
Chris Ender said, adding: ''We're very fond of these 16 people and
what they went through for us, and want to make sure they're not
taken advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   Been, 23, and his family worry about that and more, said mom
Diane. Even as Dirk races between Pat Robertson's ''700 Club'' and
a photo shoot with singer Gloria Gaynor, he is torn between his
Christian faith and dreams of acting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been fun. It's been crazy. It's been wild. Who knows how
long it will last?'' Diane Been said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Khmer Head Had Heart Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- The most prominent Khmer Rouge
leader, who is jailed and awaiting creation of a Cambodian genocide
tribunal, suffered two heart attacks last week, his lawyer said
Monday. A senior court official denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok, 74 -- dubbed ''The Butcher'' for his ruthlessness as the
group's military chief -- survived consecutive heart attacks
Thursday night and is in serious condition, said the lawyer, Benson
Samay.
</P>
<P>
   Samay said guards noticed Ta Mok was very ill Thursday night and
contacted a doctor, who visited the cell. Ta Mok's condition has
improved since the attacks but it is still serious, the lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ta Mok will continue to receive treatment at the
Military Court prison in Phnom Penh where he is being held.
</P>
<P>
   Military Court director Ney Thol told The Associated Press that
as far as he knew, Ta Mok was fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''My clerk saw him this morning and says that there is no
indication that he is sick,'' Ney Thol said.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok, once a top lieutenant of late Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot, is one of two senior Khmer Rouge figures in detention pending
a planned trial of leaders of the communist regime. Under the
regime's 1975-79 rule, about 1.7 million Cambodians died by
execution of from starvation or overwork.
</P>
<P>
   The other leader to be tried is chief executioner Kaing Khek
Iev, known as Duch. Most of the Khmer Rouge's aging leaders have
died or defected to the government side and live free in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok, who lost a leg in a land mine explosion in the early
1980s, was the last top rebel at large. He was arrested in March
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia,
which collects evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities, said he doesn't
think the prison where Ta Mok is being held has adequate health
care facilities. He voiced concern that Ta Mok could die before the
genocide tribunal convenes.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok's 64-year-old sister, Ung Poun, was allowed to visit him
in July, perhaps indicating that his health is deteriorating, Youk
Chhang said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came as a surprise to us because we thought no one could

<HEADLINE> Ex-Spy Returns to UK to Clear Name  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Former British spy David Shayler has stopped
running.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three years in exile in France, the man who
infuriated Britain's spy agencies with his allegations of
incompetence and illegal plots arrived home Monday and walked into
police custody.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had he been charged with disclosing state secrets than
the burly, blunt-speaking former agent was vowing to dig further
into his revelations -- particularly claims that Britain was
involved in a plot to assassinate Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good to be back in my own country. I feel good to be
free again and as soon as possible I'm going to pursue the Gadhafi
plot,'' Shayler told journalists after he was released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler, who had worked for Britain's MI5 internal security
agency since 1994, fled to France after an August 1997 article in
London's Mail on Sunday newspaper with his disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting he revealed the information out of patriotism, he has
since accused the British government of trying to silence him with
criminal charges and a lawsuit last year. The British government
has denied the Gadhafi claims.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler returned by ferry from the French port of Calais in a
high-profile crossing accompanied by reporters, TV crews and his
girlfriend, Annie Machon. Police confronted him as he stepped off
the boat in Dover.
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels that he needs to come back and vindicate himself,''
an emotional Machon told reporters. She said it was ''scandalous''
that he should be arrested when ''all he's done is tell the truth
about a very secretive government organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Shayler was charged with two counts of breaking the Official
Secrets Act and released after surrendering his passport.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were not connected to the Gadhafi allegations, but
to disclosures published in the 1997 Mail article. In that article,
Shayler said MI5 kept files on politicians, including Home
Secretary Jack Straw and former Conservative Prime Minister Sir
Edward Heath. The article also said MI5 tapped the telephone of
Peter Mandelson, now Britain's Northern Ireland secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The charges carry a maximum jail sentence of four years. Shayler
is to appear before a Bow Street Magistrates Court on Friday for a
preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate civil suit filed in December by the British
government, Shayler is accused of breach of copyright and breach of
contract for releasing secret documents.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler told reporters that by not charging him over the Gadhafi
claims, the government is ''quite clearly backing down from what a
very was a very draconian and very repressive position.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder whether this is an attempt to prevent the jury from
hearing the whole story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. aired in
1998, Shayler alleged that Britain's external intelligence agency,
MI6, had been involved in a plan to kill Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook dismissed Shayler's
allegations as ''pure fantasy.'' The Foreign Office, which is
responsible for MI6, offered no comment on the charges against
Shayler.
</P>
<P>
   In exile, Shayler wrote a novel, ''The Organization,'' which he
described as ''a gritty thriller'' about spies, sex and soccer.
</P>
<P>
   He was required to submit a manuscript to the government to
comply with a 1997 injunction barring him from disclosing any
information he obtained while working for MI5. Last month,
government censors accepted the manuscript unchanged, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler spent four months in Paris' La Sante prison in 1998
after being arrested on a British warrant. A French appeals court
rejected an extradition bid.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler said Monday he hopes to use European human rights laws
to challenge any charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an absolute nonsense that in this day and age in Britain
we have a law which makes it a crime to report a crime,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 28; Nasdaq Is Up 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher Monday on optimism that the
Federal Reserve Board will leave interest rates alone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 28.57 at 11,075.05.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also were higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.20 at 1,495.92, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 7.66 at 3,938.
</P>
<P>
   Trading has been light during recent sessions as traders look
ahead to Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say most investors believe the Fed is finished with its
credit-tightening campaign and will leave interest rates alone for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what's been driving the markets for the past three
weeks,'' said Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at
Advest Inc. ''The market is pretty much convinced that the Fed will
do nothing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates six times in the past 14
months in an effort to slow the economy and stave off inflation.
The strategy appears to be working, as a number of economic
indicators released in recent weeks have signaled that the economy
is still growing but inflation hasn't reached dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
   Technology issues, led by chip maker Intel, fueled Monday's
gains, extending a rally in the tech sector that began last week.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's shares rose $1.25 to $71.813 after an analyst raised his
future earnings forecasts for the number one maker of computer
chips. The analyst said Intel's third quarter inventory is already
sold out, news that bodes well for the entire computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications parts makers also remained strong, following
up on last week's gains. Ciena Corp. rose $4.125 to $180.813, and
Copper Mountain was up $4.813 to $68.813.
</P>
<P>
   And Clearnet Communications, which operates a digital telecom
network, rose $13 to $44 after Canadian phone company Telus Corp.
agreed to buy the wireless service provider for $4.48 billion in
cash, stock and assumed debt. The announcement boosted wireless
stocks across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 493.65 million shares, well
below Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.09 at 516.60.

<HEADLINE> US: Retaliation for Congo Expulsions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The United States is considering ''an
appropriate and commensurate response'' to the Congolese
government's expulsion of two U.S. diplomats, the State Department
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Congo ordered press officer Denise Burgess and
political counselor Roger James Moran to leave for making
statements it contended were inconsistent with their diplomatic
role.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday the two
have since returned to Washington. U.S. Ambassador William Swing
called Congolese President Laurent Kabila on Saturday to protest
the expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese officials said the two were ordered home for
objectionable statements made to civil society leaders at a
diplomatic function.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher had no comment on the precise nature of the statements
except that some allegations by Congolese officials were
''outrageous and false.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Teens Back Gun Regulation  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A huge majority of high school students favors
gun-control measures such as licensing and mandatory trigger locks,
according to a survey released Monday that finds guns and related
violence prominent in the lives of teens.
</P>
<P>
   About nine out of 10 students said they favored completing a
required safety course and obtaining a license before buying a
handgun. The same number favored criminal background checks. And 96
percent supported registering the weapons when purchased, so they
could be traced if necessary, said Dennis Gilbert, a sociology
professor at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., who designed the
survey with his students.
</P>
<P>
   ''American high school students have a shockingly high level of
exposure to guns and gun violence,'' Gilbert said in an interview.
He said the study is the first to question a national sample of
high school students on gun issues.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of the students said they or someone close to them had
been shot in a situation unrelated to military combat. That
proportion rose to nearly half for students living in cities with
populations greater than half a million.
</P>
<P>
   One junior at an urban high school in the Midwest said a close
friend had been shot dead while playing basketball, the study said.
Others reported hunting accidents and other firearm mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Zefferino, 17, a high school senior from Martinsville,
N.J., said she hasn't experienced gun-related violence, but the
shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado and other schools
inspired her to start a gun-control awareness campaign at her
school.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to learn about ways to prevent these things before
they happen,'' said Zefferino, who didn't participate in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The polling firm Zogby International conducted the nationwide
telephone survey during three days in June by calling 1,005 high
school sophomores, juniors and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   National Rifle Association spokeswoman Trish Gregory criticized
the poll for not asking questions about existing regulations given
in previous adult surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of these students may not be aware of the fact that there
are already tens of thousands of gun laws on the books in the
United States,'' she said. ''If that information had been included
with the questions we may have seen very different results.''
</P>
<P>
   Students in the East and South were most likely to support gun
control, followed by those in the West and Midwest, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
   While four out of five students said the government should keep
guns away from criminals even if it becomes harder for everyone
else to buy them, the same number said Americans have a
constitutional right to own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said the students were more likely than adults to
support both increased regulation and the right to own a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe in their world there's just a lot more guns around, and
it seems more compelling to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the students said they thought it would be easy for
someone their age to get a gun in their neighborhood, but only 6
percent described their schools as unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found:
</P>
<P>
   --More than 80 percent of high school students have discussed gun
control in school, at home or with friends.
</P>
<P>
   --Of girls questioned, 79 percent favored stricter gun laws,
compared with 52 percent of boys. Girls also were more likely to
have become involved in gun-control activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Justice, a pro-gun control coalition of
advocacy groups perhaps best known for monitoring federal judicial
nominations, released the study as part of a campaign against gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, financed by Hamilton College's Arthur Levitt Public
Affairs Center, had an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Networks Winning With Tiger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tiger Woods keeps winning, and so do the
networks that televise golf's major tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' duel with Bob May at the PGA Championship drew the
event's highest preliminary TV ratings on record.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's coverage of Sunday's final round, when Woods finally put
away May in a three-hole playoff, got a big-market rating of 10.0
with a 23 share. That means about 10 million homes tuned in, and 23
percent of TVs that were on during the broadcast were tuned to CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The rating was 30 percent higher than it was for last year's
PGA, when Woods beat Spanish sensation Sergio Garcia by a single
stroke. The 1999 rating had been the best for a final round PGA
since at least 1986.

replace her pacemaker last year.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died in 1998 at age 86.

   MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- On the surface, they seem like an odd pair
-- conservative Rep. Bob Barr and long-haired rocker Ted Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   But Barr and Nugent are both board members of the National Rifle
Association and outspoken defenders of the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent made his point as loudly as one of his guitar solos
Sunday during a fund-raiser for Barr.
</P>
<P>
   ''The right to life means not dying,'' Nugent told a crowd of
mostly hunters and sportsmen. ''What does that mean? When someone
wants to take your life, shoot him.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 people paid $25 apiece for a barbecue dinner and an
archery demonstration from Nugent, who took aim at foam replicas of

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Ex-Spy Seeks Repatriation  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A convicted North Korean spy claimed
Monday that the South Korean government is using an oath he signed
under pressure to deny him the right to return home when other
spies are repatriated next month.
</P>
<P>
   Chung Sun Taek, 79, signed an oath disavowing communism in 1989
so he could be released from prison after more than three decades.
He declared the oath invalid Monday and accused the Seoul
government of using it as a pretext not to send him back.
</P>
<P>
   At a historic summit of the two Koreas, the Seoul government
promised to repatriate all convicted Northern spies who want to
return. Last week, South Korea notified the North of the names of
62 ex-spies, who served 18 to 45 years in prison, it plans to
repatriate on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul says signing an oath is a legal matter that binds
signatories to honor South Korea's political and social systems, so
keeping them in the South does not violate the summit agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Chung and a female North Korean guerrilla, who signed an oath in
1985 under similar conditions and now wants to go home, are not on
the list. Seoul officials said the two are among about two dozen
ex-spies who were released in return for the oath.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I can't go home because of the oath, which I had to sign
under unbearable conditions, what is the purpose of seeking
reconciliation between the North and South?'' Chung asked in an
appeal to President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   Chung read the appeal at a news conference arranged by
supporters. On hand were 30 ex-spies who will be repatriated. The
67-year-old female guerrilla, Chung Sun Duk, who was hospitalized
because of a serious illness, was not present.
</P>
<P>
   Chung Sun Taek, who spent 31 years and five months in a
12-square-foot prison cell, was arrested the day after he arrived
in Seoul in 1958 on a mission to win over a college friend who
worked as a television drama writer. He said he signed the oath on
the recommendation of doctors who said his health would improve if
he left the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Chung said he confirmed through a friend in Germany in 1998 that
his four children, ranging in age from 43 to 52, were alive in the
North. He said his wife had died several years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After taking office in 1998, the Kim Dae-jung government
unconditionally released all communist spies from prison but barred
them from leaving the country without government approval.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu said that the
repatriation of South Korean prisoners of war living in North Korea
might be discussed at a high-level inter-Korean meeting in
Pyongyang Aug. 29-31.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should return North Korean spies and have the POWs sent
back home,'' a ministry spokesman, Chung Kang-kyu, quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul officials say some 40,000 South Korean prisoners of war
never returned home after the 1950-1953 Korean War and that,
allowing for defections, 300 POWs are believed to be living in the
North today.

<HEADLINE> British Boy Lands Harry Potter Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The big screen has found its Harry Potter:
11-year-old British actor Daniel Radcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel will play the boy wizard in the movie adaptation of
''Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone,'' due in theaters next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel portrayed young David in a recent BBC adaptation of
''David Copperfield.'' He also appears in the upcoming John Boorman
movie ''The Tailor of Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Chris Columbus and producer David Heyman said Monday
they also have cast two British newcomers to play Harry's best
friends at Hogwarts school. Ten-year-old Emma Watson will play
Hermione Granger and 11-year-old Rupert Grint will play Ron
Weasley. Both have acted in school plays.
</P>
<P>
   The casting call for Harry and other characters from J.K.
Rowling's best-selling books had children from Britain and
elsewhere sending in audition tapes to Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw so many enormously talented kids in the search for
Harry,'' Columbus said in an announcement on Warner's Harry Potter
Web site. ''The process was intense and there were times when we
felt we would never find an individual who embodied the complex
spirit and depth of Harry Potter. Then, Dan walked into the room
and we all knew we had found Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Potter books follow the exploits of an 11-year-old boy who
discovers he inherited magical powers from his parents, a pair of
wizards killed by a powerful enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having seen Dan Radcliffe's screen test, I don't think Chris
Columbus could have found a better Harry,'' Rowling said in
Warner's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth installment of Harry's adventures, ''Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Fire,'' led to long lines of fans at bookstores when
it was published last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks prices retreated Monday, erasing earlier
gains as most investors stayed out of the game one day ahead of the
Federal Reserve Board's decision on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 5.86 at 11,040.62.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed.

</P>
<P>
   Trading has been light during recent sessions as traders look
ahead to Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said most investors stayed on the sidelines Monday, not
willing to gamble one way or the other on whether the Fed will
increase rates or leave them stable.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, conventional wisdom holds that the Fed is finished
with its credit-tightening campaign and will leave interest rates
alone for the time being.

</P>
<P>
   Technology issues, led by chip maker Intel, extended a rally

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Steps Up Drug Raids  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Security forces raided houses,
businesses and farms in a remote Venezuelan jungle Monday after
intercepting a record five tons of cocaine and arresting at least
14 people in an international drug bust, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard said it could recover more cocaine on a
jungle island in the middle of the Orinoco River of eastern Delta
Amacuro state. It also said more arrests are possible as efforts to
disband the international drug ring Los Mellizos continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this very moment we are raiding a business in Delta
Amacuro. We could have more results tomorrow or the day after. We
are only in the middle of the operation,'' Gen. Antonio Alizo, head
of the National Guard's anti-drug unit, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The drug bust Friday was the largest in Venezuela's history in
terms of cocaine seized. Press reports said the five tons of
cocaine are worth $400 million, but Alizo said the value was
probably much higher.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's peanuts. Authorities put a value on the stash but the
street worth is generally much higher,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was a result of an eight-month investigation, known as
''Orinoco 2000,'' that used telephone bugging equipment, more than
200 anti-drug officers, three planes, three helicopters and eight
boats. Colombia, France, Britain, Italy, Greece, Panama and the
United States helped out.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is a key trafficking route for Colombian cocaine en
route to the United States and Europe. The U.S. Embassy called the
raid ''an example of excellent cooperation over a period of several
months,'' between the United States and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ''The organization targeted was a major cocaine trafficking
organization based in South America with operations in the
Caribbean and Europe. They were responsible for major shipments of
cocaine both to the United States and Europe,'' the embassy said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Two people in Italy and one person in France were among those
detained in the international operation, carried out with financial
assistance from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Alizo
said prosecutors released six of the 14 people initially arrested
Friday after determining they were not involved in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   A search continues for five drug traffickers who escaped into
the jungle and for the cargo ship that was intended to transport
the cocaine to Italy. The National Guard sent a reinforcement unit
to the island on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The terrain is very difficult. There are high tides and low
tides and there is swamp water everywhere,'' Alizo said, adding
that international authorities have the search for the cargo ship
''under control because there are satellites monitoring it.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard is also searching for Los Mellizos
ringleaders in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, in the western city of
Maracaibo and in eastern city of Puerto Ordaz, Alizo said.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Rebels Name New Leader  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- The leader of Sierra Leone's
brutal rebel movement has been replaced by his top field commander,
a switch regional leaders welcomed Monday as a sign the rebels may
be willing to end a nine-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Foday Sankoh, the now-imprisoned mercurial leader and spiritual
guide of the rebel Revolutionary United Front, was informed of the
change during a Monday meeting with Sierra Leonean President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Mali's
President Alpha Oumar Konare.
</P>
<P>
   A joint statement released by the three presidents said the
rebel high command had elected Gen. Issa Sesay, the rebel's top
field commander, to replace Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sierra Leone government hopes the new RUF leadership will
cooperate fully with the government'' in disarming, freeing its
captives and proving that ''it is determined to fulfill its
commitments'' under last year's peace agreement, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement, which brought the rebels into a power-sharing
with the government and gave them amnesty for past crimes, has been
widely seen as abandoned since the rebels started fighting again in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Under Sankoh, the rebels seized large swaths of the country and
have waged a campaign of terror against the populace that has left
tens of thousands of civilians -- including small children -- killed
or maimed.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, who has been in prison since the RUF broke the peace
agreement in May, met with the three leaders at Freetown's Lungi
Airport. There they showed him a letter signed by rebel field
commanders, telling him about their decision.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Sankoh then wrote a letter back to the field
commanders, saying he understood their decision and would stand by
it.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels apparently decided to change leadership after meeting
with a group of regional leaders in neighboring Liberia in late
July, who pressed the rebels to abandon Sankoh in hopes of moving
Sierra Leone toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   In an additional gesture toward ''achieving sustainable peace,''
the Sierra Leonean president said he had ordered the release of 171
imprisoned rebel fighters and said he may free more.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh is not among those to be released. He is widely expected
to be put before a special tribunal that the U.N. Security Council
voted to create last week to prosecute those responsible for the
killings and maimings of civilians.

<HEADLINE> State cemeteries agency urges fight against West Nile mosquitoes  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Pataki administration is seeking to
choke off possible breeding grounds for mosquitoes which carry the
West Nile virus at cemeteries around the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Division of Cemeteries said it wants the 2,000
cemeteries it regulates across the state to make sure that
fountains, reflecting pools and flower vases filled with water are
not allowed to become the stagnant breeding habitats for
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the division, Richard Fishman, said cemetery
operators have been ''very receptive'' so far to his agency's
efforts to reduce the risk of disease-bearing mosquitoes breeding
at cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   The division said it started working with officials in New York
City in April when the West Nile virus re-emerged this year in the
five boroughs. Cemeteries have been one of the focuses of spraying
to kill mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   With state Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia Novello acknowledging
that it is probable the West Nile virus has spread throughout the
state - as reflected by dead birds with the virus now being
discovered in most counties - the cemeteries division said
anti-mosquito steps should be taken by cemeteries throughout New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making sure no stagnant water is allowed to stand in
monuments or elsewhere on cemetery grounds, the division is also
urging that only artificial or dried flowers be used to adorn
gravesites so that flower pots with water will not proliferate in
graveyards. It also recommended that people only visit cemeteries
during daylight hours, when mosquitoes are less active, and that
they wear proper clothing and use insect repellant.
</P>
<P>
   The administrator of the historic Oakwood Cemetery in Troy, near
Albany, said Monday he is unaware of any directive from the
cemeteries division warning against stagnant water and West
Nile-mosquito breeding grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Vogel said his cemetery has few water monuments like
fountains or pools, but people do frequently mark gravesites with
flowerpots with water in them.
</P>
<P>
   Among others buried at Oakwood are Civil War Gen. George Thomas,
the industrialist and humanitarian Russell Sage and Sam Wilson, the
Troy meatpacker whose supplies were thought to have initiated the
nickname ''Uncle Sam'' for the American government during the War
of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   The cemeteries division regulates non-denominational,
not-for-profit cemeteries in New York state.

<HEADLINE> Salvaging Sub Seen Risky But Doable  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Raising a sunken nuclear sub is a
highly precarious endeavor, but experts said Monday there's a good
chance the 14,000-ton Kursk can be lifted safely from the floor of
the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Norwegian divers have peered into the flooded vessel
and found no trace of survivors among the 118 crew members, what is
left is a salvage effort. Moscow is seeking international help in
funding the operation, expected to cost in excess of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine, lying about 350 feet under water, was ripped open
by two powerful blasts on Aug. 12 during naval exercises off the
Norwegian coast.
</P>
<P>
   Although salvage crews would be hampered by the extensive damage
believed caused by the blasts, the Kursk's accessibility could work
in their favor, experts said. The Oscar II-class sub is resting in
an upright position on the flat bottom of the continental shelf,
noted Richard Sharp, who captained a British nuclear sub in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be surprising if they do not salvage it,'' he said.
''Three hundred fifty feet of water is not that deep.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk is the sixth nuclear sub to sink since the
introduction of underwater nuclear propulsion revolutionized naval
warfare in the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the sunken subs were American, the other three Russian --
buried at depths of up to 16,000 feet. Most of them have been left
on the seabed because of the huge expense of lifting them, said
Sharp, now editor of Jane's Fighting Ships.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Kursk could be a different story: It ''is sitting
in the middle of the Russian Northern Fleet's exercise area and
they will also want to know exactly what happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although they never confirmed it, the Soviets salvaged a nuclear
sub that went under in the 1970s near the Northern Fleet's base in
Murmansk, according to Dutch navy reserve officer and nuclear
expert Hugo van Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Another covert operation, mounted in 1974 by Washington and
involving the CIA and industrialist Howard Hughes, tried to raise a
Russian sub that sunk 750 miles northwest of Hawaii in 1968. The
CIA later confirmed that the submarine cracked in two and half of
it slipped away as it was pulled to about 5,000 feet with a giant
claw from the Glomar Explorer rescue ship.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Kursk sinking, the shallowest wrecked nuclear sub was
the Komsomolets, which caught fire in 1989 and sank north of
Norway, killing 42 of the 69 sailors aboard. A team of
international experts established that the Russian sub could be
salvaged from 4,900 feet under water, but the cash-strapped Russian
government was unable to finance the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said possible methods for raising the Kursk include
sawing the wreckage into pieces to be hoisted individually or, if
it is reasonably intact, strapping balloons along the hull and
pumping air into the vessel to achieve flotation.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the operation could exceed $100 million, according
to Daan Koornneef of Wijsmuller Salvage in the Dutch port of
Ijmuiden.
</P>
<P>
   ''It won't be a simple task, but it is certainly doable,'' said
Van Dam, who was part of the Komsomolets investigation team.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov was quoted by the
ITAR-Tass news agency in Moscow as indicating it would take weeks
just to draw up plans for a salvage operation. ''Not a single
country on its own can handle such an operation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Offers by the Clinton administration to assist in the rescue
effort have been turned down.

<HEADLINE> Demand for food aid growing after welfare reform  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Stephanie Smith placed her nursing
textbook down on a table at House of Bread Monday afternoon and ate
a bologna sandwich, peas, carrots and macaroni salad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hungry,'' said Smith, 45, who is completing a 13-week
course to become a certified nurses' aide, hoping to earn more
money than she does working as a home health aide.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the mother of two daughters ages 11 and 27, was among
more than 230 people who came to the soup kitchen for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is outrageous today,'' said Rick Riccitelli, client
advocate. ''All of a sudden we have this crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the state, soup kitchens, food pantries and shelters are
seeing longer lines as welfare reform leaves women with jobs that
don't pay enough to feed their families and more people live longer
on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a real problem,'' said Rep. Jack Thompson,
D-Manchester. Being among the poorest in the nation's richest state
is a growing concern, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that among families with young children
the incidents of poverty have increased,'' Thompson said. ''What
we're (also) learning is that more elderly people are using food
services.''
</P>
<P>
   From October 1996 to October 1999, food stamp participation
dropped 22 percent in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are unaware that the program is for low-income,
working families, not welfare recipients, said Deidra Ierardi,
director of the Connecticut Association for Human Services'
anti-hunger coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The elderly also don't apply for food stamps out of pride,''
said Ierardi.
</P>
<P>
   The Meals on Wheels Program of Stamford/Darien Inc. has seen
about a 12 percent growth in clients over last year, now serving
about 130 meals each weekday and 165 on Saturdays and Sundays, said
Grace Mall, executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're serving more people now than ever before,'' said Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Daniels, 77, started coming to House of Bread a few
months ago. On Monday, she ate baked chicken, string beans and
''plenty of cranberry sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, a great-grandmother, retired from her job as a
housekeeper about 10 years ago to care for her terminally ill
daughter. Friends told her about the soup kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should thank the lord for the food they get,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Food Bank Inc. of East Haven, which now serves 535
programs in New Haven, New London, Windham, Middlesex, Fairfield
and Litchfield counties, is seeing about a 10 percent growth in
food distribution this year, said executive director Nancy
Carrington.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the agency distributed about 7.3 million pounds of
food, compared with about 6.5 million pounds in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army's Hartford Temple in the Frog Hollow
neighborhood distributes bags of food containing one- or two-week
supplies of groceries to 15 to 20 people, four days a week, said
Yazmin Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's mostly families with small children,'' she said. ''It's
very hard.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Discuss Statehood Date  </HEADLINE>
By SARAH EL-DEEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The Palestinians are trying to determine
when is the best time to declare statehood, Egypt's foreign
minister said Monday after a day of intensive Middle East
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shuttled to Egypt for talks
with President Hosni Mubarak before returning home, where he is to
meet later with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, who is trying to push ahead
talks after last month's failed Israeli-Palestinian peace summit.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said the Palestinians
were working on when to declare a state -- a move Arafat had earlier
set for Sept. 13 but he has since said he was reconsidering the
date. The United States and Israel have warned him against the
move.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is absolutely no change concerning the state or
Jerusalem, but the date of declaration is still subject to
discussion,'' Moussa told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Syria's foreign minister met Mubarak in the
Mediterranean city of Alexandria and demanded Israel hand over to
the Palestinians all of east Jerusalem -- the main issue that
wrecked the July Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa called on Israel to make ''a
complete withdrawal'' from east Jerusalem, saying it was an
integral part of occupied Arab territories. ''The issue in our view
requires a firm and principle-based position and does not need a
great deal of beating about the bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had reportedly
offered the Palestinians limited control over parts of
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. The Palestinians rejected the
offer, demanding that the entire area, which includes sites holy to
Muslims, Christians and Jews, must be under full Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, King Abdullah prepared to visit Israel on Tuesday to
meet with Barak, following up talks the two leaders held in Amman
last week. In the earlier talks, Abdullah had rejected any Israeli
sovereignty over Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa said Mubarak and al-Sharaa had focused on how to
coordinate Arab positions concerning the Middle East peace process.
Syria's new president, Bashar Assad, begins on Saturday his first
visits in the region with trips to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations broke off in January because
of differences over what land would be included in an Israeli
withdraw from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, a key regional peace mediator, has warned that a
collapse in Middle East peace talks could lead to renewed violence
in the region. He is due to meet with Israel's acting foreign
minister, Sholomo Ben-Ami, later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Foreign Ministry officials say they are working with
the Palestinians to develop a plan for Jerusalem that will be
submitted to the United States and Israel. They declined to reveal
any details.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Questioning Date Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- The judge handling the case against Gen.
Augusto Pinochet on Monday set Oct. 9 as the date to question the
former Chilean dictator and decide whether he will be tried on
human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Juan Guzman did not immediately specify where and how
the hearing will take place. As a retired army general, Pinochet
has the right to respond to questioning in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman has said he would rather interrogate the embattled
84-year-old former ruler in person. If Pinochet agrees, the
questioning could take place at his house, or at a military
facility, such as the army hospital.
</P>
<P>
   According to a government report, 3,197 people were killed or
disappeared for political reasons during the Pinochet years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the Supreme Court, at Guzman's request,
stripped Pinochet of the immunity he enjoyed as a senator-for-life
--a post he created for himself in the constitution written by his
1973-90 regime.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman is handling 165 criminal complaints against Pinochet, the
latest of which was filed Monday by the National Association of
Social Workers for the deaths of two members.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman wants to try Pinochet in one of the earliest criminal
complaints, one involving ''the caravan of death,'' a military
squad that summarily executed 72 political prisoners shortly after
the 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   He still faces legal hurdles before trying Pinochet, including a
required mental exam. Chilean law exempts from trial only those
that are pronounced mad or demented. Pinochet's relatives and
associates have insisted he will not sit the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Rodriguez, Pinochet's lawyer, said a mental exam ''would
stain his image before history.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman declined to detail how he will respond to Pinochet's
refusal to sit for the tests.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Attacks Continue; 13 Dead  </HEADLINE>
By BINOO JOSHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMMU, India (AP) -- Guerrillas used booby traps and rockets to
kill five Indian soldiers in troubled Kashmir on Monday, while
Indian security forces killed at least eight people believed to be
part of the separatist movement, the Indian military said.
</P>
<P>
   Indian troops fired artillery across the frontier dividing
Kashmir between India and Pakistan, raining down shells on villages
Monday, Pakistani police said. The shelling killed a man and an
8-year-old girl, and injured eight people, including four children,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan says Indian shelling has increased in past weeks across
the frontier -- a frequent scene of artillery exchanges. Meanwhile,
in Indian-held Kashmir, Islamic separatist guerrillas continued
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   An improvised explosive device instantly killed a brigadier
general and a colonel in a jeep in Jachil Dhara, a village 30 miles
north of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, an
officer said on condition of anonymity. Three soldiers were injured
in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, guerrillas fired a rocket at an army transit camp
from a hide-out in the thickly forested mountains about 120 miles
north of Jamma, the state's winter capital. Three soldiers were
killed and 15 wounded, said Maj. Gen. P.P.S. Bindra.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had positioned themselves on the mountains overlooking
the National Highway,'' Bindra, who heads the army's northern
command in Udhampur city, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the two attacks,
but the Indian military blamed them on Islamic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks came as government forces killed at least five
militants on Monday in an encounter in a forest near Kunzelwan
Gurez, a town 70 miles northeast of the city of Srinagar, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated incident 60 miles south of Jammu, Indian
security forces killed three people who the army said were trying
to cross into India from Pakistan through the international border.
</P>
<P>
   The border dissolves into a cease-fire line farther north in
Kashmir, where India says hundreds of Pakistan-based Islamic
militants sneak into its territory to fight the 11-year-old
separatist war against Indian rule in the Kashmir Valley.
</P>
<P>
   India accuses Pakistan of arming and funding the insurgency in
Kashmir. Pakistan says it supports the Kashmiris but denies
providing material aid to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25,000 people have died since the Kashmir insurgency
began in 1989. During the past month, nearly a dozen attacks blamed
on the guerrillas have left more than 120 civilians dead -- most of
them Hindus.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, the largest of around a dozen militant
groups in Kashmir, declared a cease-fire last month and said it was
ready to talk peace with the Indian government. But it ended the
cease-fire two weeks later when New Delhi refused to include
Pakistan in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their
independence in 1947 and the two countries have twice gone to war
over the territory.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Warn on Crowded Classes  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Renewing its fight for smaller class sizes and
new school construction, the Clinton administration reported Monday
that the nation's public and private schools will open to more than
53 million children this fall -- the fifth straight record number.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting overflowing schools into the next century, President
Clinton and Democrats used the annual projection of fall enrollment
to blast congressional Republicans for resisting government
proposals to help hire more teachers and build more schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our children deserve no less,'' Clinton said while traveling
in upstate New York. ''We need to build new schools and modernize
existing ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department report said 53 million children will
enter kindergarten through 12th grade this fall, up from 52.8
million last year. The new figure is considered a record because
the department had lowered its estimate of last year's enrollment
to 52.8 million from 53.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   College enrollment for fall 2000 also set a record of 15.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the department report predicted school
growth through the next century. Officials said that by 2100, the
nation's schools will have to find room for 94 million students --
nearly double the number of school-age children, ages 5 to 17, the
nation has now.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers will grow, officials say, because of increasing
immigration to this country and a second American baby boom, coming
two generations after the record births in the middle of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The report came as Democrats renewed their call for funds they
say would thwart a school-crowding crisis in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to figure out where we will put these children,''
Education Secretary Richard Riley said during a school tour in Las
Vegas, which has seen school enrollment double to 200,000 since
1990. ''Many communities need to be building more schools now.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley called on Congress to pass a $24.8 billion tax proposal to
help states raise money to build new schools and fix old ones --
particularly in urban cities where buildings have reached the
100-year-old mark and communities are too poor to get the money
from property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of 226 House members stands ready to vote for
the plan, said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the highest-ranking
Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, the tax law panel.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., who heads education lawmaking in the
House, said the $792 billion tax package vetoed by Clinton last
year would have included measures to help schools raise money for
repairs and construction: ''Now, he is perfectly willing to
criticize Republicans for something for which he has only himself
to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again this session, House and Senate leaders have blocked
Clinton's education proposals, which include dedicating federal
money for states to hire more teachers and raise construction bonds
for new schools. Republicans, who are pushing $1.8 billion in state
grants, say the Democratic plans are too costly and don't address
the growing populations of all schools.
</P>
<P>
   Figures show suburban schools also are bursting. Some of the
counties surrounding Atlanta and Washington, D.C., have nearly
doubled their school enrollments over the decade.
</P>
<P>
   California, Texas and New York expect to enroll the most
children this year. Nevada, Arizona and Florida have posted the
highest rates of student growth over the last decade. There are no
state-by-state figures available for the century projections.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the education debate, now taking center stage in
the presidential campaign, is more partisan that it's ever been --
since the first major federal education laws were enacted in 1965.
The current renewal of that law remains bogged down in both the
House and Senate; Clinton has threatened to reject any bill that
doesn't include his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Educators said Monday the enrollment figures should push
lawmakers past the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eventually they are going to have parents tugging at their
sleeves,'' said John Jennings, a Washington-based education
researcher who spent two decades working on education policy for
congressional Democrats. ''Maybe these numbers are going to push
them into reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just immigration,'' he said. ''There are more kids
everywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 33; Nasdaq Gains 13  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher Monday on optimism that the
Federal Reserve Board will leave interest rates alone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 33.33 at 11,079.81,
according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.15 at 1,496.87, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 12.89 at 3,943.23.
</P>
<P>
   Trading has been light during recent sessions as traders look
ahead to Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said most investors stayed on the sidelines Monday, not
willing to gamble one way or the other on whether the Fed will
increase rates or leave them stable.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, conventional wisdom holds that the Fed is finished
with its credit-tightening campaign and will leave interest rates
alone for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what's been driving the markets for the past three
weeks,'' said Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at
Advest Inc. ''The market is pretty much convinced that the Fed will
do nothing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates six times in the past 14
months in an effort to slow the economy and stave off inflation.
The strategy appears to be working, as a number of economic
indicators released in recent weeks have signaled that the economy
is still growing but inflation hasn't reached dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
   Technology issues, led by chip maker Intel, extended a rally
that began last week.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's shares rose $1.50 to $72.063 after an analyst raised his
future earnings forecasts for the number one maker of computer
chips. The analyst said Intel's third quarter inventory is already
sold out, news that bodes well for the entire computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications parts makers also remained strong, following
up on last week's gains. Ciena Corp. rose $5.375 to $182.063, and
Copper Mountain was up $5.313 to $69.313.
</P>
<P>
   And Clearnet Communications, which operates a digital telecom
network, rose $13 to $44 after Canadian phone company Telus Corp.
agreed to buy the wireless service provider for $4.48 billion in
cash, stock and assumed debt. The announcement boosted wireless
stocks across the board.
</P>
<P>
   The retail sector continued to show weakness on fears that
second-half profits may be hurt by the cooling economy. Dow
component Wal-mart Stores was down $1.437 at $49.063.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation stocks were also hammered, falling on the ongoing
woes of the airline industry, which announced a summit meeting to
discuss delays that have plagued air travelers all summer. UAL
Corp., parent of United Airlines, fell 93.70 cents to $48.938.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 726.38 million
shares, well below Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.66 at 516.17.

<HEADLINE> Commissioner: Water is safe at Washington, other county fairs  </HEADLINE>
By REAGAN HAYNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, N.Y. (AP) - The state's health commissioner gulped
down a glass of water at the opening of the Washington County Fair
Monday and promised that last year's E. coli tragedy need not be a
worry.
</P>
<P>
   ''That water was good,'' Dr. Antonia Novello told Mike Grottoli,
whose maple sugar candy booth provided the commissioner with the
drink.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing ... is that we've gotten together and
converted something from a tragedy into positive change,'' Novello
said of changes implemented for all fair water systems in New York
since last year's outbreak, the worst in state history.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-year-old girl and an elderly man died and an estimated 1,000
people were sickened after drinking fair water that had been
contaminated with E. coli. The exact source of the contamination in
fairgrounds well water was not determined, but it was suspected
that it either originated from cow manure leaching into the ground
or from a leaking septic system in a fairground dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Novello required all fairgrounds in New York state
without access to a public water supply to chlorinate or otherwise
disinfect their water systems before holding public events.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Washington County Fair operators dug two new wells and
permanently sealed all but one of eight old wells, Washington
County Fair spokesman Pete Gregg said. The old well is only being
kept operable for fire emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said the treatment systems for the new wells, located at
opposite ends of the fairgrounds, include regular chlorinations and
''microfilters,'' which screen out microorganisms not killed by
chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   Water will be tested three times a day for the seven days of the
fair, Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington County Board of Supervisors Chairman Don Cummings
said his wife was hospitalized for five days due to E. coli from
the fair last year. But on Monday, he urged people not to stay
away. His wife only missed the fair because she had recently
cracked her hip, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want you to listen to my voice when I am saying that she
shows no ill will toward this fair,'' Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara and Michael Bade said they returned to the fair this
year without any worries of contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was an extremely isolated case that unfortunately
turned catastrophic,'' Michael Bade said, adding: ''We had no
problems last year and we don't anticipate any this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Janine Reuter said they brought bottled water for
their daughters, a 9-month-old and a 2-year-old they pushed in
strollers, because children are most succeptible to E. coli.
However, they said they were drinking fair water without worry.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the fair's been around for so long, and they've only had
one instance in 110 years, that's pretty good,'' Scott Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of lawsuits were brought against fair operators last
year by people sickened from E. coli in the fair water. The
lawsuits charge that operators were negligent for not properly
testing, chlorinating or treating the well water, and for locating
wells near barns.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Benjamin, attorney handling the cases, said in a
telephone interview that his clients are not upset that the
111-year-old fair continues.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tracey Weaver, whose father Ernest Walker died from the
E. coli contamination, said she thinks the fair should have been
canceled this year out of respect for her father.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver has filed a lawsuit against the fair. She said her
father's death continues to take a toll on her family.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the lawsuit,'' she said. ''I'd like someone from the
fair to call and say, 'We're sorry this happened.' Not one person
from Washington County called,'' Weaver told the Post-Star of Glens
Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Following the outbreak, Novello issued emergency orders
prohibiting the use of untreated water at seven agricultural
fairgrounds: Chenango County; Genesee County; Madison County;
Washington County; Wyoming County; Orleans County and and Tioga
County.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said Monday all fairs with wells have complied with a
state directive that their drinking water be treated with
anti-bacterial agents or have hooked up their systems to town water
supplies.

<HEADLINE> Basque: Separatist Violence History  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILBAO, Spain (AP) -- They are an ancient people who speak a
linguistic enigma. Through the centuries, they've mastered
everything from whaling to banking. Their most famous son is a
prominent saint.
</P>
<P>
   But the distinguished history of the Basque people includes an
undercurrent of separatist violence that has produced Europe's
longest-running regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
   This summer has been a terrifying one of bullets and exploding
cars: The Basque separatist group ETA has launched a nationwide
offensive, making a 14-month truce it halted in December seem like
a distant memory. The cease-fire ended after a round of stillborn
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people have been killed since the cease-fire ended, and
since early July alone ETA has staged 14 attacks. But Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who survived an ETA car bombing in 1995,
has ruled out Basque independence or any other concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say ETA's latest spasm of violence is designed to show
that Aznar's policy is futile and to force him to go beyond the
current system, which grants the Basques broad autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be that ETA is paving the way for a second truce in
more advantageous conditions than the first,'' political scientist
Ramon Cotarelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnaldo Otegi, leader of Euskal Herritarrok, a political party
linked to ETA, said Basques are just like any other people waging a
legitimate fight for sovereignty. He compared them to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should we be any different?'' he asked a Bilbao rally
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Spaniards who welcomed the first cease-fire as a
breath of fresh air after decades of strife hunker down and wait
for the next gunshot or bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
   The tension is thick here in Bilbao, the largest and richest
city in the Basque region of northern Spain.
</P>
<P>
   A screech of tires is enough to make heads turn. When a stranger
with a parcel walks into a neighborhood tavern, the regulars stare
holes through him. People talk politics in whispers, if at all. You
never know who may be listening, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is madness,'' said Carlos Zabaleta, a 35-year-old engineer,
as he strolled through a park and watched his 2-year-old son, Ivan,
feed the ducks. ''We were all so happy with the cease-fire. And
now, here we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is one of Spain's most industrialized regions and one
of its most beautiful. Home to 2.1 million people, the three Basque
provinces run from the western end of the Pyrenees about 100 miles
across Spain's northern coast.
</P>
<P>
   The neighboring Navarra region to the south also has a large
Basque population, and just across the border in France are three
other Basque provinces. ETA is fighting to turn all seven into an
independent homeland called Euskadi.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Basque provinces are a land of jagged green hills,
postcard-pretty hamlets and elegant seaside cities like San
Sebastian.
</P>
<P>
   Bilbao, a once-mighty steel and shipbuilding center, has
undergone a painful reconversion triggered by globalization. These
days it's best known abroad for the curvy silver walls of the
Guggenheim Museum, a resurgent city's pride and joy.
</P>
<P>
   The Basque country is also one of Spain's wealthiest regions,
with a per capita gross domestic product of $32,300 -- 22 percent
higher than Spain's national average.
</P>
<P>
   Basques were living where they do now long before King Ferdinand
and Queen Isabel fused their own and other lands of the Iberian
peninsula -- including Basque country -- in the early 16th century,
laying the foundation for what became Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Residing in quiet mountain reducts and speaking a language
called Euskera -- linguists say it's unrelated to any other
Indo-European tongue -- the Basques spent centuries battling,
tolerating or cutting deals with Romans, Visigoths, Moors and other
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   One Basque knight, wounded while fighting French invaders in
1521, underwent a spiritual awakening and founded the Society of
Jesus, the Roman Catholic order known as the Jesuits. Ignatius of
Loyola was canonized in 1621.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty, emerged in
the late 1960s when Spain was ruled by military dictator Francisco
Franco. He cracked down brutally on groups with distinct languages
and cultures, including the Basques.
</P>
<P>
   ETA is blamed for nearly 800 killings. One of the most
spectacular came on Dec. 20, 1973, when -- after spending weeks
tunneling under a street in one of Madrid's poshest neighborhoods --
commandos detonated a bomb just as a car drove by carrying Luis
Carrero Blanco, Franco's second in command and widely expected
successor. The blast was so thunderous the car ended up on top of a
building, and Blanco was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Under Franco's repressive rule, ETA may have enjoyed at least
the sympathies of non-Basques, if not their support. But Franco
died in 1975, Spain is now a prosperous, stable democracy and the
Basque region has much say in running its own affairs. Most
Spaniards see ETA not as a national liberation group, but as a gang
of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   People in the Basque region itself are divided roughly in half
between those backing mainstream status-quo parties and supporters
of Basque nationalist parties. And many Spaniards take pains not to
lump all Basques together: A standard slogan at anti-ETA rallies is
''Basques, yes. ETA, no.''
</P>
<P>
   But there has been across-the-board fury over the recent
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone lines to radio talk shows are jammed with people in
tears, proposing everything from severing the Basque country from
the rest of Spain and setting it afloat in the Bay of Biscay to
calling a binding referendum on its future. Many of the talk show
calls urge fearful people living in Basque country to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''Come join us in the rest of Spain,'' said one caller. ''We'll
set another place at the table.''

<HEADLINE> Germany's Schroeder Slams Neo-Nazis  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLAUEN, Germany (AP) -- On his first extended trip Monday through
a region blighted by neo-Nazi violence, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder called on citizens to stand up to the extreme right
following attacks that have left three people dead so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's two-week bus trip is a high-profile break with
Germany's political routine -- an attempt to connect with people and
problems in a region where alienation and a lack of jobs play out
most terribly in a growing number of neo-Nazi attacks on foreigners
and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Many eastern Germans feel disadvantaged and frustrated a decade
after German unification, which wiped out much of the region's
industry and left it with joblessness about twice the national
average. It is just this sense of dissatisfaction that caused a
spike in neo-Nazi violence in the first two years after
reunification and is contributing now to a resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder emphasized Monday that in 1989, when their protests
brought the Berlin Wall down, East Germans displayed the sort of
civic courage that political leaders are now trying to foster.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder met with some of the former democracy activists during
his stop in Plauen and held them up as an example for all Germans --
east and west. He urged citizens to defend democracy by standing up
against ''far-right rowdies'' he said were giving the region a bad
name.
</P>
<P>
   ''On this trip, I want to make it clear that extreme-right ideas
are not purely eastern German,'' he said at an earnest meeting with
local officials in this town near the Czech border. ''Without a
civic response against right-wing extremism, we won't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder promised to continue the federal aid that has topped
$470 billion to the region since unification, but he insisted that
funding and tough responses from authorities were only part of the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's 21-stop trip is the most attention any German leader
has paid to the east outside an election campaign. Tanned from his
summer vacation in Spain, he was at turns jovial and serious during
Monday's stops.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 people on Plauen's cobblestoned market square cheered
as the chancellor arrived at the 14th-century town hall. Mayor Rolf
Magerkord led him through an exhibition documenting the 1989
peaceful democratic revolution in Plauen.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's trip is a highwire act between denouncing extremist
attacks, listening to eastern Germans' problems and boosting their
morale. He specifically chose smaller towns that his predecessor
Helmut Kohl, the ''father of unification,'' never visited.
</P>
<P>
   At Plauen City Hall, he urged eastern Germans to take pride in
their economic achievements despite high unemployment and the
legacy of 40 years of isolation and dictatorship under communism.
</P>
<P>
   Magerkord welcomed Schroeder's trip as an attempt to break down
mental barriers separating Germans on both sides of the former Cold
War divide. He also asked for continued aid and the construction of
a high-speed train link into this relatively remote corner of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wish is that you bring east and west closer together, take
out some of the strains and make conditions more equal,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the east's dark side will be on display again Tuesday when
three men from the region -- two 16-year-olds and a 24-year-old -- go
on trial, charged with beating and kicking to death a Mozambican
father of three in the city of Dessau. Authorities say the
defendants were motivated by hate of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying is among the worst in a recent series of right-wing
extremist attacks. The violence has unsettled civic leaders and
prompted the government to examine whether to ban the far-right
National Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's itinerary reflects the region's successes as well as
its demons.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, he visited the spa town of Bad Elster, which has
mastered the transition to capitalism thanks to Germans' love of
state-subsidized spa visits. He also dropped by a family of
clarinet makers, underlining the revival of family businesses after
the fall of communism. In Plauen, a town of 70,000 with a
lace-making tradition, he stopped at a curtain factory.
</P>
<P>
   Other stops before Schroeder returns to Berlin on Sept. 1
include the former Nazi concentration camp Mittelbau Dora and an
anti-extremist police task force at Wittenberge, north of Berlin.
He also will visit a computer school, take a bicycle tour of a wine
region and kick off a soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear even after the first day, however, that it will
take more than one trip by the chancellor to convince many of the
disaffected that their lot will improve.
</P>
<P>
   ''This trip was necessary, definitely,'' said Bernd Kranz, 41, a
jobless bus driver who stood outside City Hall to see Schroeder.
''But I don't think it's going to change much even though it's a
good sign.''

<HEADLINE> Cold shoulders: Record lows hit parts of the Northeast  </HEADLINE>
By GREG SUKIENNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) - Summer is giving people the cold shoulder in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Record or near-record low temperatures have been reported in
cities across the region, spurring some people to dig into their
fall wardrobes early and turn the heat on.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Avery was surprised to get nearly a dozen calls from
customers Monday asking to have heating systems installed. He got
only one call about air conditioning.

   ''Typically, people don't start thinking about that until they
have to, in September,'' said Avery, president of Avery Services
Inc. in Westbrook, Maine. ''I don't doubt that it was so chilly
this morning that it got people thinking a month early about
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The mercury dropped to 43 in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Monday
morning, tying a record low for the date set in 1908. At Bradley
International Airport near Hartford, Conn., the temperature hit 45,
matching a record low set in 1984. Elmira, N.Y., hit a statewide
low of 37 degrees early Monday. And low temperatures across
northern New England hovered in 40s over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, the early-morning chill had employees at Killington
Resort joking about making snow in August. It's nearly cold enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been in the low 40s and upper 30s on the mountain,'' said
Amy Phalon, a spokeswoman for Killington.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Farmer, co-owner of Farmers Garden Center in Elmira, N.Y.,
said the cool weather is keeping corn and other vegetables from
ripening.
</P>
<P>
   ''Corn needs hot, muggy nights,'' she said. ''People growing
tomatoes in the gardens are having trouble. Everyone is loading up
on green tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The cool weather is no problem for crops such as beets, lettuce
and leeks, said Rich Bananno of Methuen, a past president of the
New England Vegetable and Berry Growers Association. What's more,
''it's fine weather to work in.''
</P>
<P>
   The cooler weather has decreased demand for electricity in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last year, there had been at least 10 days when
demand rose above 21,000 megawatts; this summer, that has happened
only five times, said Ellen Foley of ISO New England, which
oversees the region's power grid.
</P>
<P>
   The cooler weather has made it tough for those who make their
livelihood off summer cruises. Massachusetts Bay Lines has seen
ridership on its whale watch cruises dip along with the
temperature, which is usually about 10 degrees cooler at sea than
it is on land.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public cruises are down 35 percent,'' said Shane Lemay, the
cruise line's marketing manager. ''There's been a lot of northeast
wind. That kicks up a lot of spray and makes the seas rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the temperatures neared 70 at midday in Boston, some
people still chose to dress warmly. Molly Bronitsky wore a cardigan
sweater as she walked along Boston Common.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like it a little warmer,'' she said. ''It's good
weather for September, but for right now it's cold.''

<HEADLINE> Albright, CIA Discuss Declassifying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked
with CIA Director George Tenet on Monday about the prospective
release of thousands of secret documents on activities of South
American military dictatorships in power near the close of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said a conflict has arisen at the CIA
over whether to release a small number of documents pertaining to
the 17-year rule of Chilean President Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   The question of secret U.S. documents was a centerpiece of
Albright's visit to Argentina and Chile last week.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has set a Sept. 14 deadline for release of
documents. Human rights groups in Argentina and Chile want the
material to shed additional light on abuses committed by the
Pinochet government, which ruled from 1973-1990, and military
governments that ruled Argentina from 1976-83.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the United States wants to be ''as helpful as
possible'' in shedding light on that grim period in both countries.
She briefed Tenet on her discussions in the two countries, where
some activists doubt that the United States will release all
relevant documents.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday the goal
is ''the maximum possible release of documents consistent with the
need to protect sources and methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official, who asked not to be identified, said the
conflict at the Central Intelligence Agency concerns the release of
about 20 documents that some officials contend should be released
and others that they remain classified to protect information on
sources and methods.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to declassify documents on a mass scale was made by
President Clinton last year. A substantial amount of material was
released in two stages last year.

<HEADLINE> Manhunt Ends in 'RealityRun'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The mysterious fugitive's mission was to avoid
being spotted for 24 days, but the latest twist in reality
entertainment, ''RealityRun,'' ended Monday after only a week when
a reporter spotted him in Berlin's main public library.
</P>
<P>
   The fugitive, a Dutch athletics teacher identified only as
Roger, was given $2,500 spending money by the game's organizers and
set loose in Berlin on Aug. 14. As he roamed the area, would-be
bounty hunters were able to visit a Web site -- www.realityrun.com --
for tips about his whereabouts and watch as his portrait was slowly
revealed day by day.
</P>
<P>
   Roger-hunters were vying for a $10,000 bounty, which the
25-year-old winner will collect, said the Berlin-based organizers,
ExtraMile AG. If Roger had evaded being spotted for 24 days, he
would have kept the bounty himself.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are already holding a vote on their Web site for the
next city to stage a manhunt. They are hoping the event will attain
cult status and attract the interest of TV and film producers
looking for another show like ''Big Brother'' or ''Survivor.''

<HEADLINE> Study: World's Arm Spending Rising  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reversing a downward trend, the United States
and most other nations are spending more on weapons despite a sharp
decline in Russia and Eastern Europe, a State Department study
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is by far the biggest arms exporter with
shipments more than four times greater than runner-up Britain's.
Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, is the leading importer of military goods,
buying more than 2&AMP;frac12; times as many as China, ranking second.
</P>
<P>
   On the average, the world spent $145 a person for military
forces in 1997, the most recent year covered in the study. That was
a sharp drop from the peak of $271 per person in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. spending comprised 33 percent of the world's total in 1997,
compared to 27 percent a decade earlier. Overall, world military
spending rose to $842 billion in 1997, an increase of $32 billion,
or 2 percent, from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may represent the beginning of an upturn in the world
trend following a 1995-96 low,'' the report issued Monday said.
</P>
<P>
   Spending in developed countries rose slightly, to $610 billion,
while it climbed to a historic high of $232 billion in 1997 among
developing countries. Their share of world arms spending rose to 28
percent, up from 17 percent in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The world's top military spenders in 1997 were the United
States, $276 billion; China, $75 billion; Russia and France, $42
billion; Japan, $41 billion; Britain, $35 billion; and Germany, $33
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The world's arms trade rose to $54.6 billion, up 23 percent from
1996 but far below 1987's all-time high of $81.5 billion. These
State Department calculations are based partly on estimates of U.S.
commercial licenses, a recently adopted method that significantly
increased the American total.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia was the biggest importer, with $31.3 billion. China
and Taiwan, combined, were next with $12.5 billion, followed by
Japan with $6.8 billion and Egypt with $5.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A separate report by the Congressional Research Service, which
uses actual contracts, showed a steadier trend, with arms contracts
worldwide totaling $34 billion last year. This compared with $35.4
billion in 1998, $40.6 billion in 1997 and $34.8 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Developing nations, generally among the world's poorest,
continued as the primary focus of arms merchants, accounting for
68.3 percent of all arms purchases from 1992 through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The United States made $25.7 billion in arms agreements with
developing countries, or more than one-third of the world total,
from 1996 through 1999. Russia was second, with $14.3 billion, and
France third at $9 billion.

<HEADLINE> Detainees Claim Yugoslav Beatings  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Two Canadians and two Britons
arrested on suspicion of terrorism told their attorneys Monday that
they had been beaten by their Yugoslav captors, though the
detainees said the mistreatment was not severe enough to be called
torture.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats demanded that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
government offer an explanation. Canadian diplomat Angela Bogdan
told reporters that the men confirmed reports over the weekend that
they had been beaten by Yugoslav army soldiers in the first days
following their Aug. 1 arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We bluntly asked them about their treatment and yes -- they
have been roughed up,'' she said. ''We have asked for an official
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lawyer representing the Canadians, Ivan Jankovic,
sought to reassure the families of Shaun Going and Liam Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''They both confirmed it wasn't anything they would describe as
torture,'' Jankovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the trial of the four faced further delays as the
Yugoslav army prosecutor in charge of the case demanded Monday that
more witnesses be questioned, said Djordje Djurisic, the lawyer for
the two Britons, Adrian Prangnell and John Yore.
</P>
<P>
   The additional testimonies would likely include those of a hotel
employee who would be asked to confirm that the four spent time in
one of Montenegro's coastal resorts and a border policeman who
could testify about the time of their arrival there.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the (investigative) judge decides to follow up, this will
likely delay the case even further,'' Djurisic said.
</P>
<P>
   British and Canadian diplomats in Belgrade have already
complained about the length of the proceedings. None of the men,
held at a Belgrade military prison, have been formally charged,
three weeks after being arrested in Montenegro, Serbia's junior
partner in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The four have said they were on holiday on the Montenegrin coast
and were en route back to Kosovo, where the two Britons trained
local police for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe and the two Canadians worked in construction.
</P>
<P>
   An army patrol stopped the four close to the border with Kosovo
and arrested them after discovering explosives-related material in
their car trunk. The military launched the investigation based on
this material, which Going claimed was leftover from his work as
contractor in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   British media have quoted the two Britons as saying they were
punched, intimidated and deprived of sleep by their captors during
the first days of detention in Andrijevica, a small town where they
were held before transfer to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Yore told the Mail on Sunday: ''It's cleverly done, slaps to the
stomach, kidneys, that sort of thing. There are no marks.''
</P>
<P>
   Prangnell said when they were apprehended, Yugoslav soldiers
paraded them to crowds as spies and terrorists and they thought
they were going to be shot or lynched.

<HEADLINE> Mario Cuomo: I think son will run for governor  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Former Gov. Mario Cuomo said Monday he
thinks his eldest son, federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, will
run for governor of New York in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But the elder Cuomo said that ''unless Andrew is lying to me,''
his son has not yet completely committed to running.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks to me like he would run, but he has not committed and
he is smart not to,'' the former governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the elder Cuomo said, ''We're doing everything
possible to get him ready for when he says it. I'm talking to
people about money (for a governor's race) and that's coming fairly
well. ... We're doing that kind of thing and he's moving around.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Cuomo's comments came in the wake of a report in Monday's
New York Post, quoting unidentified sources, that said Andrew Cuomo
has told people he will run for governor. His father lost the job
in 1994 to Republican George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokeswoman, Andrew Cuomo refused Monday to talk about
the Post report.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while attending the Democratic National Convention
and trying to drum up support for a possible gubernatorial bid,
Cuomo told reporters he had made a decision about running, but
wouldn't tell them what it was.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo's father was also known for keeping people guessing,
primarily about whether he would run for president. He never did.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defends S. Korean Exercises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- In the face of North Korean criticism, the
State Department defended U.S.-South Korean military exercises,
noting that the North has carried out exercises of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The annual exercise was launched on Monday following a warning
by Pyongyang that improving relations on the peninsula could be
jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a provocative exercise,'' State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said. ''We would note that the North Koreans have
also been conducting military exercises this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that despite the improved atmosphere for cooperation,
there has been no significant change in the military situation on
the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea said the annual exercise was defensive, so North
Korea should not be alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea scaled back the 12-day Ulchi Focus Lens exercise in
an attempt to placate North Korea, which condemned the maneuver as
a rehearsal for an invasion of the North.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a tight security posture to ensure peace. But we must
also make efforts not to ruin the reconciliatory mood,'' President
Kim Dae-jung said.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise is focussing on improving ways of dealing with
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean military canceled amphibious landing and
river-crossing drills as well as mock air raids on Seoul. The
government has already instructed municipal governments to cancel
all combat drills that involve students and army reservists.

<HEADLINE> Ford stops production at three plants to shift 70,000 tires to replacements </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. will idle three truck plants to
shift 70,000 tires from new vehicles to be used as replacements in
a recall of 6.5 million tires.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. has recalled P235/75R15 ATX and ATX
II tires, and only Wilderness AT tires in the same size made at a
plant in Decatur, Ill. The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration is investigating the tires in connection with 62
deaths and over 100 injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The plants in Minnesota, New Jersey and Missouri will close from
Aug. 28 to Sept. 8 so that 15-inch tires used in production of Ford
Explorer/Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicles and Ford Ranger
pickups will be diverted to Ford and Lincoln/Mercury dealers. The
plants employ about 6,000 workers who will be paid during the
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Ford CEO Jac Nasser was scheduled to explain the announcement in
a TV ad running Monday night during ABC's ''Monday Night
Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You have my personal guarantee that all of the resources of
Ford Motor Company are directed to resolve this situation,'' Nasser
says in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have previously said their complaint data shows
that the tires under recall are the source of hundreds of
complaints about treads separating while vehicles are in motion,
sometimes at high speeds. Most of the 15-inch tires were installed
on Ford trucks, including the popular Explorer sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Inglis, vice president for Ford North America, said the
plant shutdown would cut about 25,000 vehicles from Ford's
production - 10,000 Rangers and 15,000 Explorers/Mountaineers. Not
all of those vehicles would have received P235/75R15 tires that can
be used as replacement tires under the recall, but Inglis said
there was no way to schedule production without them.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis also said the move would affect Ford's earnings, but
declined to say by how much. He said by mid-September, the tire
industry should have ramped up production enough to provide more
replacement tires.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing this to make the most tire replacements into the
market now where we know there's a shortage,'' Inglis said. ''The
action will help us close the gap between supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ford plant in Edison, N.J., makes Rangers and employs about
1,500 workers, of which 140 are salaried, Ford spokeswoman Kathleen
Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some will remain at the plant during the shutdown, but the
remainder will get 95 percent of their straight-time wage, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the 2001 Rangers had already started, she said.
The vehicle is also made at the St. Paul plant in Minnesota, which
is also closing.
</P>
<P>
   The recall of Bridgestone/Firestone tires has created an
apparent nationwide shortage of 15-inch tires, even as Ford has
authorized more than 30 brands to replace recalled Firestone tires,
most of which were installed on Ford trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone has said it was doubling its production of
same-size tires - it had planned to build about 180,000 tires a
month in that size before the recall, increasing imports and
authorizing its Firestone stores to use other manufacturers' tires
as replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone has said it would ship between 325,000 and
350,000 tires this month, and would up production to 500,000 tires
a month by January. At that rate, it would take the company over a
year to produce enough replacement tires to satisfy the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone now says anyone in the country with the
recalled tires can get them replaced - but the tire maker and Ford
will direct their limited supply of replacement tires at southern
states where most of the complaints have originated.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, a safety group filed a lawsuit to force
Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford to widen the recall beyond the
original 6.5 million tires. The Center for Auto Safety contends
that all Firestone radial ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires are
defective and should be recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The center's director, Clarence Ditlow, said the group filed
suit because it believed it could move faster than the federal
government to force a wider recall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Firestone and Ford managed to pull the wool over the
government's eyes for 10 years,'' Ditlow said. ''We need to take
all possible actions to get this defect remedied.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone contend that only the models
recalled have been linked to problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd be happy to review the data, if any, that Mr. Ditlow used
in determining that other tires should be recalled,'' said Ford
spokesman Jon Harmon. ''All the data Ford, Firestone and NHTSA has
seen indicates the recalled population of tires are the ones
needing to be recalled, and the other tires are performing very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditlow said limiting the recall to one size and one plant did
not make logical sense. He said if the problem is with the Decatur
plant - where Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone have said many of the
recalled tires were made - then other tire lines made at the plant
should also be recalled. If the problem is a design defect, as the
Center believes it to be, all the sizes in that design should be
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The center, a consumer-advocacy group founded by Consumers Union
and Ralph Nader in 1970, pushed for 1970s recalls of the Ford Pinto
and 14.5 million Firestone 500 tires, the latter nearly bankrupting
the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to broadening the recall, the center wants Ford and
Bridgestone/Firestone to do more to replace consumers' tires. The
companies have said they were moving as fast as possible to get
replacements, including using tires from other manufacturers and
reimbursing owners for replacements done outside Ford or Firestone
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Ditlow said the companies were moving in the right direction,
but that a court order would force them to answer to an outside
authority for any delays.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone were ''moving heaven
and earth to get compatible tires of all makes to customers all
over the U.S. as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be irresponsible to recall perfectly good tires,
because it would delay getting safe tires to customers who need
them,'' Harmon said. ''Safety advocates should advocate for safety,
not lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.
Several attorneys around the country have filed attempted
class-action lawsuits seeking to represent consumers hurt by the
recall. Attorneys general in several states have also said they
were investigating the tires and the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Ford told analysts in a conference call Monday that Explorer
sales had slowed slightly since the recall began, and would likely
be down for the month.
</P>
<P>
   George Pipas, Ford's director of sales analysis, said the recall
might be a reason for the decline, but new incentives on SUVs from
other automakers might also contribute. He also noted that Explorer
was at 97 percent of its sales objective for the month - better
than other Ford cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible to tease out the impact of one factor versus
another,'' he said. ''It's still doing very well, but the sales
pace has declined somewhat since earlier this month.''

<HEADLINE> BPU takes comments on how to ensure utilities for needy households  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - With electric and gas service no longer
operating as monopolies in New Jersey, the question remains on how
to provide heat and light to needy households.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities and citizens' groups provided a number of answers
Monday to the state Board of Public Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The BPU has the task of determining how a ''Universal Service
Fund'' should operate, according to the state's deregulation law
enacted in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the board heard a variety of suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the state's largest utility, Public Service
Electric &AMP; Gas Co., wants the fund to be part of an existing state
agency and ''serve as an umbrella or clearinghouse of energy
assistance programs for the needy to help them meet essential
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The company ''emphasizes that the public utilities and
ratepayers of this state should not be held responsible for
providing permanent or pervasive financial assistance to consumers
who are in a chronic or pervasive situation that requires such
assistance,'' PSE&AMP;G rate counsel Frances I. Sundheim said in
written comments to the board.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons, however, suggested
that ratepayers foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   AARP contended the cost would be largely covered by the money
utilities would save by reducing debt-collection efforts and the
130,000 annual shut-off of electric and gas service to people who
have not paid their bills.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Fair Share Payment Plan'' proposed by AARP requires
families to pay a percentage of their monthly income toward their
utility bill and it covers the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Like a plan suggested by the state's ratepayer advocate, it
forgives existing debt owed by poor customers.
</P>
<P>
   The advocate, Blossom A. Peretz, suggests a fund that assists
households with incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   The advocate's consultant on universal service, Roger Colton,
told the BPU that the three energy assistance programs now
available to New Jersey residents do not address the affordability
of service.
</P>
<P>
   The existing programs include the federal Low-Income Home Energy
Assistance Program, which provides aid for heating. Last winter, it
provided aid to 50,000 of the 400,000 low-income utility customers
in New Jersey, Colton said.
</P>
<P>
   The BPU will hear further comment 7 p.m. Tuesday at the
Jamesburg Municipal Building.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Targeting Flight Delays  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to a summer travel season marred by
thousands of flight delays, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater
on Monday announced formation of a task force to monitor airline
service.
</P>
<P>
   Slater acted after summoning airline industry leaders to a
meeting that he said was ''a necessary first step in resolving some
of the challenges'' faced by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some 670 million Americans will fly this year, up 20 million
from a year ago and an increase that is taxing the system and could
not have been foreseen, Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   At the session, participants from airlines, unions, airports and
other groups discussed ways they could better cooperate, said
Slater, who added that Monday's gathering ''will result in improved
service'' in both the short and long term.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said the newly formed task force on airline service
performance will monitor the carriers and report back to him in 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the difficult and busy summer season is
nearly at an end. That could help matters by reducing the demand
for service.
</P>
<P>
   Increased numbers of people traveling, a spate of bad weather
and -- at least at one airline -- labor disagreements have made this
summer a time of air travel discontent for millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration reported more than 44,000
flight delays in July alone, and that was an improvement from June.
</P>
<P>
   Following the meeting, Slater said the airlines agreed to
improve their notification of the FAA when they have flight delays
or cancellations so air traffic controllers can better use
available air space.
</P>
<P>
   He said several choke points in the air traffic control system
have been identified and efforts are being made to solve problems
at those points.
</P>
<P>
   Slater also said he has asked the airlines to develop
contingency programs for extremely busy periods such as the
upcoming Labor Day holiday and the Thanksgiving and Christmas
travel seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the president of the American Automobile
Association offered suggestions for improving air travel.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Atlanta Rotary Club, Robert L. Darbelnet called
for privatizing the air traffic control system and urged Congress
to fully fund aviation improvements. He also proposed expanding the
system with new airports or better use of regional airports and
said airlines should be required to collaborate with the FAA and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is the time to act,'' said Darbelnet. ''We must work
together -- quickly, creatively and cooperatively.''
</P>
<P>
   While this has been a summer of extraordinary air travel
problems, the issue isn't new.
</P>
<P>
   Beset with complaints about delays and poor service, the
airlines staved off congressional action last year by promising to
treat customers better and to be more forthright with passengers
all the way through their travel experience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when Transportation Department inspectors checked earlier
this year to find out whether the airlines were living up to that
pledge, they found varying degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   ''Airlines are making a clear and genuine effort at
strengthening the attention paid to customer service, but
bottom-line results to date are mixed,'' the department's inspector
general said in a preliminary report to Congress. ''The airlines
have a way to go to restore consumer confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when flight delays reached record numbers in June, the
airlines blamed the air traffic control system, the FAA blamed the
weather, and delayed passengers blamed everybody in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Things improved somewhat in July but, as FAA official Peter
Challen admitted, ''if you're a passenger who is delayed, these
numbers don't mean anything to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall performance gain is clouded by ongoing problems at
United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, where the
combination of a dispute with pilots and bad weather has resulted
in scores of flights delayed or canceled.

<HEADLINE> More than 300 people apply to FEMA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) - The Federal Emergency Management Agency has
received more than 350 applications for assistance from residents
and businesses damaged by last week's flooding in northwestern New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA, which set up an office in Sparta over the weekend, will
probably start distributing some grants in a few days, spokesman
Mike Beeman said. But he cautioned residents not to expect a grant
to replace everything they have lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a high expectation and hope from the people that the
federal government's going to come in and make them whole and pay
for what they lost,'' Beeman said. ''That's what insurance
companies are for.''
</P>
<P>
   The average FEMA grant to New Jersey victims of Tropical Storm
Floyd, which caused much more damage in the state, was $2,900,
Beeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the applicants who called FEMA's toll-free numbers were
in between Sparta and Stanhope in Stanhope in Sussex County, with
others in Jefferson Township in Morris County, Beeman said.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA officials inspected many homes over the weekend, mostly
finding waterlogged basements and damage outside the home, Beeman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sussex County officials have begun restoration work on one of
four bridges deemed critical because they cut off isolated
populations, County Emergency Management Director Skip Danielson
said. Construction on the Morris Lake bridge in Sparta began last
week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danielson said most people have returned to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's two dozen, I'd be surprised,'' he said of people who
still haven't returned.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Colombian kingpin faces U.S. drug charges  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A man identified as one of Colombia's most
powerful drug lords was hauled into a U.S. court for the first time
Monday to face cocaine-trafficking charges carrying a possible life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Orlandez Gamboa had arrived in New York under tight
security Saturday after Colombian President Andres Pastrana and his
cabinet approved his extradition, despite death threats by drug
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the short,
balding Gamboa, 44, sat impassively as prosecutors portrayed him as
the mastermind of a decade-long international scheme to smuggle an
estimated eight tons of cocaine worth more than a billion dollars.
They alleged that he continued to run his ring from behind bars in
Colombia, where he was arrested in 1998 on murder and kidnapping
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Frank Maas ordered Gamboa held without bail until
Thursday, when he was expected to enter a plea. He faces 10 years
to life in prison if convicted on federal conspiracy, drug
smuggling and money laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Gamboa told reporters their client was a
''legitimate businessman'' who ran taxi and bus companies in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is simply not guilty,'' attorney Martin Schmuckler said
outside court.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Gamboa, nicknamed ''Caracol'' - Spanish for
''The Snail'' - is the first drug kingpin to be extradited to the
United States since Colombia lifted its ban on extradition in 1997.
Pastrana supports extraditing accused drug traffickers to the
United States, where stiffer penalties often await them.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White thanked
Colombian officials for their ''courage and cooperation'' in making
Gamboa ''face American justice for his alleged crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa's extradition comes one week after a band of drug dealers
in Colombia took out a newspaper ad threatening to assassinate
supreme court judges and government officials there unless they
reversed their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't allow the immoral American drug addicts to try us,''
said the ad, published in Cali, a city located 185 miles from
Bogota, in drug-producing southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The group behind the threats claimed to be an offshoot of the
notorious 1980s drug-financed terrorist faction ''The
Un-extraditables.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an indictment filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan last year, Gamboa's ''Caracol Organization'' smuggled
cocaine into the United States through Puerto Rico and other
Caribbean points. Since 1996, federal agents have intercepted
thousands of kilos in New York City, Philadelphia and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine often was packaged in sawdust, mustard and cough
medicine to try to hide the drugs' odor, authorities said. It then
was shipped in crates with corn oil, engine parts and bananas.

<HEADLINE> Love Bug Virus Charges Dropped  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID THURBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A lack of applicable laws forced
prosecutors to dismiss all charges Monday against the man accused
of releasing the ''Love Bug,'' a computer virus that caused
billions of dollars in damages worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice said the charges filed by
investigators either did not apply to computer hacking or that
there was insufficient evidence to back them up. President Joseph
Estrada signed a new law in June covering electronic commerce and
computer hacking, but it could not be applied retroactively in the
''Love Bug'' case, which happened in May.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had charged Onel de Guzman, a former student at
the Philippines' AMA Computer College, with traditional crimes such
as theft and violation of a law that normally covers credit card
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department ruled that the credit card law does not
apply to computer hacking and that investigators did not present
adequate evidence to support the theft charge.
</P>
<P>
   Computer attacks are still not universally recognized as
criminal, and the many countries that do not have computer hacking
laws could potentially become safe havens for would-be attackers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a whole lot you can do about it,'' said James
Butler, an attorney who teaches international law at Georgia
Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He said cases like the ''Love Bug'' will only prompt companies
to strengthen their defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Love Bug'' virus, unleashed May 4, rapidly replicated
itself via e-mail, overloading corporate e-mail systems in many
countries and causing damage estimated at up to $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman has acknowledged that he may have released the virus
by accident but refused to say whether he was the author of it.
</P>
<P>
   The National Bureau of Investigation had waited more than a
month to file the charges against de Guzman while it attempted to
find applicable laws.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman and his lawyer were not available for comment Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman failed to graduate earlier this year after AMA
professors rejected his thesis proposal for a program which steals
Internet passwords, a feature of the Love Bug virus.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman became a suspect after AMA professors noticed
similarities between his thesis proposal and the virus, and
Internet service providers traced the virus to a telephone line in
his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Reonel Ramones, a boyfriend of de Guzman's sister, was also
arrested in a May 8 raid on de Guzman's apartment, but was released
a day later because of insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Justice Department officials were trying on Monday to learn
on their own the exact reasons for dropping the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Charges dropped because the Philippine law does not cover
hacking, presents an obstacle to extraditing the former defendant
to the United States to face possible charges. The U.S.-Philippine
extradition treaty, like most others, provides extradition only for
activities that the extraditing country itself also criminalizes.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Civil War Letters, Bjt,620  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODBURY, N.J. (AP) - Homesick, scared and dejected while
fighting in the Civil War, Second Lt. Benjamin F. Young wrote
letters describing the bloodshed and his thoughts to his niece,
Lizzie Brick, in Hurffville.
</P>
<P>
   ''I often set in my lowly tent and reflect on my past life and I
like many others can point to actions which I would gladly have
wiped out,'' he wrote on Nov. 26, 1862. ''I have stood on the field
of battle and seen death being hurled in all directions. I seen my
fellow comrades fall by my side and their blood sprinkled over me.
I seen some crippled for life some killed instantly. others calling
on their freinds in their dieing moments with agony and great
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Yellowed and brittle, Young's letters and those of dozens of
other soldiers have been preserved under protective coverings in
special boxes in a vault at the Gloucester County Historical
Society here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the help of an $11,000 State Library grant, the 202
letters are being copied onto microfilm and also transcribed.
Copies will be stored in the New Jersey State Library and the State
Archives in Trenton and at the Gloucester County Historical Society
in Woodbury. By next year, they will be available for researchers
across the country through interlibrary loans.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Niederer, director of the State Archives, said the
microfilmed letters will be stored in a climate-controlled, secure
vault.
</P>
<P>
   He said the letters and diaries of Civil War soldiers have
proven to be valuable for research by scholars and by those
studying local history.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the letters were sent to Lizzie Brick, a faithful pen
pal to several of her relatives and friends at war. One of Brick's
descendants gave her letters to the Historical Society, said Edith
Hoelle, library director.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were probably in someone's attic in a trunk someplace,''
Hoelle said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have stood on the very brink of death,'' Young, who was in
the 56th Regiment of the Pennsylvania Volunteers, wrote to his
niece, ''yet God in his mercy has spared me through all. and why is
it so is a question which often occurs in my mind. It is a mystery
I cannot solve. it must be because you and others who love me
intercedes in my behalf when you send up your humble prayers to him
who does all for the best. ... Oh how i wish this horrid war was
over ... there has been enough bloodshed already by far too much.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, 1863, Young wrote: ''Dear neice, When I returned to
my regiment I found many of my former comrades missing, our
regiment now numbers 72 men, my company has only 6 men in it. Oh
Lizzie only think that about two years ago we came out with over
900 men and they have dwindled down to seventy two. Two thirds of
the missing have been killed or crippled for life it is awful to
think of have I not reason to be thankful for my good luck,
sometimes I think my guardian angel must hover close around me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas D. Clark wrote to Brick from a camp near Falmouth, Va.,
on March 20, 1863:
</P>
<P>
   ''Friend Lizzie, I now take the present opertunity to write you
a fiew lines. Hopeing they will find you well. ... I received your
welcom letter and was very glad to har from you &AMP; to hear that you
are a Solger's friend and like to hear from them. I know there is
folks at home that never thinks of Poor Solger. ...
</P>
<P>
   I think we are fighting for a good cos &AMP; that cos is to montane
one of the Best Governments thats in whole world. ... I don't think
the day is far off when Pees will be declared &AMP; the old Stars &AMP;
Stripes will Proudly wave over our land &AMP; nation one mor.''

<HEADLINE> Economists: No Rate Hikes Soon  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is widely expected to pass
up the chance to boost interest rates this week, and the most
optimistic economists believe Fed policy-makers are close to
declaring victory in their 14-month campaign to engineer a soft
landing for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, comprising Fed
board members in Washington and regional bank presidents, meets
privately Tuesday before releasing a midafternoon statement of its
decisions on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Most private economists said Monday they expect the central bank
to repeat its July decision to hold rates unchanged while issuing a
statement that tells markets they still worry about inflation
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pretty confident that they are not going to raise rates
this week,'' said Christopher Wolfe, an equities market strategist
for J.P. Morgan in New York. ''We haven't seen any signs in the
economic data that would cause concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks finished higher on Monday on optimism that the Fed will
leave interest rates unchanged. The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 33.33 to close at 11,079.81.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1999, the central bank has raised rates six times,
trying to bring about a soft landing in which growth slows enough
to keep inflation under control without dragging the economy into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Those rate increases have pushed short-term borrowing costs for
millions of Americans to their highest levels in nine years. The
prime rate, the benchmark rate for many consumer and business
loans, is now at 9.5 percent, up from 7.75 percent where it stood
before the Fed started raising rates 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed passed up the chance to raise rates a seventh time at
its last meeting, June 27-28, and economists believe there are more
reasons for the central bank to remain on hold this time around as
evidence of a slowdown grows.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe the economy, which grew at a surprisingly
strong 5.2 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, has
slowed to growth of around 3.5 percent to 4 percent in the current
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the current Fed tightening cycle is over,'' said
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are not so optimistic. Many believe the Fed will
remain on hold at the August meeting and the following meeting on
Oct. 3, which would be only five weeks before the Nov. 7
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   If it has the option, the Fed prefers to lay low during
presidential campaigns to avoid accusations that its decisions on
the economy are being made to help or hurt a particular candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe, however, that the meetings after the
election, on Nov. 15 and on Dec. 19, are likely targets for further
Fed rate moves.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fed is not done tightening, ... but any moves are going to
be gradual,'' said Tim O'Neil, chief economist at Harris Bank in
Chicago. He predicted quarter-point increases at both the November
and December meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has the luxury of waiting because few signs have
appeared that inflation might be getting out of hand, economists
believe.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding energy, which has shown a big jump, and food, the
underlying inflation rate has been rising by just 2.6 percent this
year, only slightly worse than last year's 1.9 percent increase in
core inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Major factors in the benign inflation picture have been strong
gains in productivity, or increased output per hour of work, which
allows pay increases without accompanying increases in product
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The good news on productivity and expectations that the economy
is slowing already have helped reduce pressure on long-term
interest rates which are set in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The national average for a 30-year mortgage, which hit a
five-year high of 8.64 percent in mid-May, fell to 7.96 percent
last week, the first time it has been below 8 percent since last
December.
</P>
<P>
   David Wyss, chief economist at Standard and Poor's DRI, said it
is appearing more likely that the Fed has achieved something no
other central bank has been able to pull off -- two consecutive soft
landings for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994-95, the Fed raised interest rates seven times in a
successful effort to keep inflation under control and give new life
to an expansion that is now in a record 10th year of uninterrupted
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like a new record. Alan Greenspan will go down as the
Tiger Woods of Fed chairmen,'' Wyss said.

<HEADLINE> Judge orders prison's mental health reports made public  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Progress reports from an outside doctor
hired to review the state's treatment of mentally ill prisoners
should be made public, a federal judge ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Humane treatment of prisoners is a public concern, and the only
way for the public to ensure that interest is to have access to
such reports, the judge said in his 36-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials agreed to keep the reports secret after
settling a lawsuit last year. An advocacy group claimed mentally
ill prison inmates were poorly treated and subjected to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch went to court claiming it had a right to know
how these prisoners were being treated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way for the public to know of the state of affairs of
our prisons is to have access to documents that chronicle both the
prison system's deficiencies and improvements,'' wrote U.S.
Magistrate Judge John Hughes
</P>
<P>
   ''Moreover, it is important that entities, both public and
private, doing the government's business be held accountable for
their actions, and answer to its citizenry, whose taxpaying dollars
support the prison establishments,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch plans to include these reports in its review
of prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to look at the before and after. At least now we'll
know what the 'before' is from these reports,'' said Bruce Rosen, a
lawyer representing Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully now some of this information will become
available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office plans no appeal, said spokesman
Paul Loriquet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will obviously comply with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state is pleased that the judge allowed for some changes in
the expert reports before they are made public, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections department officials can withhold inmates names to
protect the privacy of their medical treatment, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The original lawsuit was filed by the Inmate Advocacy Clinic at
Seton Hall University Law School, which sought better treatment for
mentally ill state prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners whose illnesses caused outbursts or other behavioral
problems were disciplined, not treated, the lawsuit alleged.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials last year agreed to almost all demands in
the lawsuit, promising changes at every level in the system
treating mentally ill inmates. The Department of Corrections said
it would hire more staff, offer better training, build treatment
facilities and rewrite disciplinary procedures to consider an
inmate's illness.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said a forensic psychiatrist would visit state
prisons four times a year, interview inmates and review procedures.
According to court documents, his reports determine if the state is
complying with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration paid $16 million this year for
improvements ordered by the settlement and budgeted $17.7 million
for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the inmates' condition is more and more improved, then
these reports will show that,'' Rosen said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 33; Nasdaq Gains 23  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher Monday on optimism that the
Federal Reserve Board will leave interest rates alone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 33.33 at 11,079.81.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 7.76 at 1,499.48, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 22.81 at 3,953.15.
</P>
<P>
   Trading has been light during recent sessions as traders look
ahead to Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said most investors stayed on the sidelines Monday, not
willing to gamble one way or the other on whether the Fed will
increase rates or leave them stable.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, conventional wisdom holds that the Fed is finished
with its credit-tightening campaign and will leave interest rates
alone for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what's been driving the markets for the past three
weeks,'' said Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at
Advest Inc. ''The market is pretty much convinced that the Fed will
do nothing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates six times in the past 14
months in an effort to slow the economy and stave off inflation.
The strategy appears to be working, as a number of economic
indicators released in recent weeks have signaled that the economy
is still growing but inflation hasn't reached dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
   Shaughnessy said Fed policy makers set out last summer to fix an
economic imbalance in which demand for products had outstripped
productivity. But productivity growth soared in the second quarter
of 2000 versus the first, while consumer demand has eased, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fed has achieved their goals of a soft economic landing
with stable growth and low inflation,'' Shaughnessy added.
</P>
<P>
   Technology issues, led by chip maker Intel, extended a rally
Monday that began last week.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's shares rose $1.50 to $72.063 after an analyst raised his
future earnings forecasts for the number one maker of computer
chips. The analyst said Intel's third quarter inventory is already
sold out, news that bodes well for the entire computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications parts makers also remained strong, following
up on last week's gains. Ciena Corp. rose $5.375 to $182.063, and
Copper Mountain was up $5.313 to $69.313.
</P>
<P>
   And Clearnet Communications, which operates a digital telecom
network, rose $13 to $44 after Canadian phone company Telus Corp.
agreed to buy the wireless service provider for $4.48 billion in
cash, stock and assumed debt. The announcement boosted wireless
stocks across the board.
</P>
<P>
   The retail sector continued to show weakness on fears that
second-half profits may be hurt by the cooling economy. Dow
component Wal-mart Stores was down $1.437 at $49.063.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation stocks were also hammered, falling on the ongoing
woes of the airline industry, which announced a summit meeting to
discuss delays that have plagued air travelers all summer. UAL
Corp., parent of United Airlines, fell 93.70 cents to $48.938.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 909.04 million
shares, well below Friday's pace of 993 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.94 at 516.45.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.5 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.02 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel Finds AWOL U.S. Army Officer  </HEADLINE>
By JASMINA KELEMEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETAH TIKVA, Israel (AP) -- A U.S. Army Reserve intelligence
officer AWOL from his base in Texas turned up Monday at a youth
hostel in Israel, where police said they were talking to him but
had no plans to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Jeremiah Mattysse was picked up by plainclothes police
in Mitzpeh Ramon, a desert town famed for its crater and its hippie
culture, and brought to Israel's international crimes unit in Petah
Tivka, near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   American military officials said they're especially concerned
about Mattysse's absence because of his background in U.S.
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Hanley, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Reserve Command in
Atlanta, said last week that it would be logical for an
investigation to include ensuring that nothing was missing from
offices where Mattysse worked.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse smiled as he got into the car Monday, wearing the
knitted skullcap typical of Orthodox Jews and a T-shirt with a
floral motif.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to ''review the case,'' a police statement said.
Israeli law has no provision for arresting someone who deserts a
foreign army, and Mattysse could leave the station when he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Late into a session that stretched over two hours, U.S.
diplomats joined the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Until February, Mattysse commanded the Army Reserve Intelligence
Support Center at Camp Bullis in San Antonio, Texas, as a full-time
reserve officer. The unit's primary mission was to train reservists
in intelligence work.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse, 50, failed to report to duty on Aug. 8 after a
vacation, making him AWOL, or absent without leave.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse had been reassigned to the 90th Reserve Support Group
in San Antonio after an investigation began into his wife's
allegations that he had an extramarital affair. The San Antonio
Express-News reported that his wife, Vanda Mattysse, filed a
divorce complaint March 7 in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Rivka Artzi-Nir, a woman who lives in Israel and identified
herself as Mattysse's girlfriend, has told Israeli newspapers he
had become devoted to helping Israel since he converted to Judaism
10 years ago. Artzi-Nir staked out the police station, carrying
religious instruction books she said Mattysse would want for
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Artzi-Nir, 48, has said Mattysse sent her classified material
through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Mattysse case has drawn widespread public attention. Yoram
Sheftel, best-known for successfully defending Cleveland autoworker
John Demjanjuk against charges he committed crimes against humanity
while serving as a World War II concentration camp guard, said he
was ready to defend Mattysse and accused police of kowtowing to
American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kleiner, a right-wing legislator, also turned up at the
police station and compared Mattysse to Jonathan Pollard, the U.S.
intelligence analyst sentenced sentence to life in prison in the
United States for giving secret documents to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want another Pollard case,'' Kleiner said. ''Hundreds
of Israeli soldiers are in the United States who fled the army, no
one arrested them. We're not a banana republic, but we're acting
like one.''
</P>
<P>
   The police could deport Mattysse once his tourist visa runs out
-- such visas are usually issued for three to six months -- but, as a
Jew, Mattysse would be eligible for automatic citizenship. Interior
Ministry officials said Mattysse has asked to immigrate to Israel.

   Police say 18-year-old Adam Shoop of Dunkirk, 33 miles southwest

<HEADLINE> Taiwan President Seeks U.N. Status  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANJUL, Gambia (AP) -- Taiwan's president ended a two-day visit
to the small West African country of Gambia on Monday, reiterating
his resolve to get Taiwan re-admitted to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is extremely unfair for a nation of 23 million people to be
denied the right to sovereign existence,'' said President Chen
Shui-bian, who is on his first trip abroad as president. He thanked
the Gambian government for backing a U.N. resolution to have Taiwan
re-admitted to the world body.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan was a charter member of the United Nations, but gave up
its seat in 1971 after the U.N. accepted the Communist government
in Beijing as the sole legitimate ruler of China. Beijing opposes
Taiwan's entry to the United Nations and regards it as a rebellious
province.
</P>
<P>
   For the eighth year, some of Taiwan's diplomatic allies are
proposing that the United Nations consider Taiwan's plea to rejoin.
Taiwanese officials have said the United Nations would make an
ideal forum for helping to resolve differences between their
government and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Only 29 nations, mostly small developing countries, have
diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Six of them will be part of Chen's
trip through the Caribbean, Central America and Africa. He also
made a brief stop in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chen denied accusations that Taiwan uses financial assistance to
win support from poor African nations, while ignoring their human
rights record. ''We expect each state to live up to expectations
regarding respect for human rights, economic development and the
social needs of its people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Gambian President Yahya Jammeh has harassed
and arrested opponents, including journalists and politicians.
Jammeh seized power in July 1994 and was elected to office two
years later in voting that was widely questioned by international
observers and opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   Chen left for nearby Burkina Faso after ending his Gambia visit.

<HEADLINE> 23 Arabs Arrested in Terrorism Link  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian security forces have
arrested 23 Arabs who planned major attacks to disrupt the peace
process, including at least one suspect reportedly linked to Osama
bin Laden, the United States' most wanted terror suspect, a senior
Israeli security official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, who include 20 Palestinians and three Israeli
Arabs, all belong to militant Islamic groups, said the official.
Israel's Shin Bet arrested 10 Palestinians and the three Israelis.
Yasser Arafat's security forces arrested another 10.
</P>
<P>
   An official in Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office confirmed the
arrests and said the prime minister saw the act as a ''very
important step'' in combatting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not
say when the arrests took place. Israeli radio reports said the men
were arrested over a period of months, some dating back to April.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Col. Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security
chief in the West Bank, said he was abroad and unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory
warning Americans living in Israel and the Palestinian areas to be
alert for attacks. U.S. embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said he
did not know if there was any link between the arrests and the
advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli radio reports said attacks planned by those arrested
included launching a missile at a Jewish settlement in the West
Bank and abducting soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Israel radio identified one of the ringleaders as Nabil Okal, a
resident of the Gaza Strip. The radio reported that Hamas, the
largest militant Islamic group operating here, sent Okal to
Pakistan three years ago to study terror techniques with bin
Laden's organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi militant who is on the U.S. wanted list for
the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which
claimed 224 lives, is believed to be based in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the arrests comes amid intense diplomatic
efforts in the region to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
after the failure of last month's Camp David summit. That summit
collapsed mainly over the fate of Jerusalem, particularly of the
holy sites in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Israeli police and Palestinian guards scuffled at the
ultra-sensitive al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City. Two
Palestinian guards were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the fighting erupted when a Palestinian tried to
force his car onto the mosque compound, the third holiest site to
Muslims. Two Palestinians felt ill, fainted and were evacuated to a
hospital, Jerusalem spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians who witnessed the scuffle said it began when two
guards had escorted security chief Rajoub, who was in Jerusalem in
the morning, off the site and tried to return, but were prevented
by Israeli police, who demanded they show identification.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian witnesses said police began beating one of the
guards when he refused to show identification, saying his status as
a guard exempted him. That drew other Palestinians into the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''They beat our people for no reason,'' said the director of the
mosque, Adnan Husseini. ''This is a clear message that this city
won't be quiet unless the Israeli occupation will end.''

<HEADLINE> Turnpike troopers trained as emergency technicians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOORESTOWN, N.J. (AP) - The next New Jersey State Police trooper
to pull you over may also be able to perform lifesaving first aid.
</P>
<P>
   Three troopers assigned to Moorestown have been trained as
emergency medical technicians as part of a pilot program to equip
police to respond to medical emergencies on the New Jersey
Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ''The effort is geared to save lives by allowing the trooper to
offer more than just first aid to seriously injured motorists and
turnpike visitors,'' State Police Superintendent Col. Carson J.
Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers I. Frank Babinchock, Joseph Shanahan and Louis Bucchere
have completed courses to learn how to administer CPR and treat
people injured in car accidents, suffering from heart attacks,
choking, respiratory failure, epileptic seizures, drowning, burns
and other injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The program, funded by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority,
includes three specially marked patrol vehicles equipped with
defibrillators and emergency medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the three troopers will still notify emergency
medical teams and ambulances to come to accident scenes, but may be
able to stabilize the injured until other emergency medical help
arrives.

<HEADLINE> Two Atlantic County brothers charged in killing on Lindenwold train platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Two Atlantic County brothers were charged
with murder Monday in the killing of a man they fought with on a
train platform in Lindenwold, Prosecutor Lee A. Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   A third suspect was being sought, Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   The three had a fight Thursday with the victim, Wayne Biscardi,
and another man at the NJ Transit train platform, Solomon said.
Biscardi, 33, of Atlantic City, was beaten, kicked and knocked off
the platform to the tracks below by the three men, Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered serious head injuries and was admitted to Kennedy
Memorial Hospital in Stratford, where he died Saturday, Solomon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Marzano, 28, of Pleasantville; and his brother, David S.
Marzano, 26, of Egg Harbor Township, were arrested Thursday and
charged with aggravated assault. Those charges were upgraded to
murder Monday, Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   They are being held in the Camden County Jail in lieu of $75,000
bail.
</P>
<P>
   The third suspect, also of Atlantic County, is being sought.
Solomon declined to identify him.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was with Biscardi received minor injuries in the
fight. Solomon did not identify him.

<HEADLINE> More Bloodshed in Kashmir Attacks  </HEADLINE>

   JAMMU, India (AP) -- Guerrillas used booby traps and rockets to
kill five Indian soldiers in troubled Kashmir on Monday, while
Indian security forces killed at least eight people believed to be
part of the separatist movement, the Indian military said.
</P>
<P>
   Indian troops fired artillery across the frontier dividing
Kashmir between India and Pakistan, raining down shells on villages
Monday, Pakistani police said. The shelling killed a man and an
8-year-old girl, and injured eight people, including four children,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan says Indian shelling has increased in past weeks across
the frontier -- a frequent scene of artillery exchanges. Meanwhile,
in Indian-held Kashmir, Islamic separatist guerrillas continued
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   An improvised explosive device instantly killed a brigadier
general and a colonel in a jeep in Jachil Dhara, a village 30 miles
north of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, an
officer said on condition of anonymity. Three soldiers were injured
in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, guerrillas fired a rocket at an army transit camp
from a hide-out in the thickly forested mountains about 120 miles
north of Jammu, the state's winter capital. Three soldiers were
killed and 15 wounded, said Maj. Gen. P.P.S. Bindra.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had positioned themselves on the mountains overlooking
the National Highway,'' Bindra, who heads the army's northern
command in Udhampur city, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the two attacks,
but the Indian military blamed them on Islamic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks came as government forces killed at least five
militants on Monday in an encounter in a forest near Kunzelwan
Gurez, a town 70 miles northeast of the city of Srinagar, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated incident 60 miles south of Jammu, Indian
security forces killed three people who the army said were trying
to cross into India from Pakistan through the international border.
</P>
<P>
   The border dissolves into a cease-fire line farther north in
Kashmir, where India says hundreds of Pakistan-based Islamic
militants sneak into its territory to fight the 11-year-old
separatist war against Indian rule in the Kashmir Valley.
</P>
<P>
   India accuses Pakistan of arming and funding the insurgency in
Kashmir. Pakistan says it supports the Kashmiris but denies
providing material aid to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25,000 people have died since the Kashmir insurgency
began in 1989. During the past month, nearly a dozen attacks blamed
on the guerrillas have left more than 120 civilians dead -- most of
them Hindus.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, the largest of around a dozen militant
groups in Kashmir, declared a cease-fire last month and said it was
ready to talk peace with the Indian government. But it ended the
cease-fire two weeks later when New Delhi refused to include
Pakistan in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their
independence in 1947 and the two countries have twice gone to war
over the territory.

<HEADLINE> Pataki signs pesticide neighbor notification law  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYOSSET, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki on Monday signed the
nation's first law aimed at protecting New York residents against
possible harmful effects of pesticide spraying by neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires companies that use pesticides to give at least
a 48-hour warning to neighbors living within 150 feet of any
spraying site. It also requires schools and day care facilities to
provide parents and staff with a notice before pesticides are
applied on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every neighbor will now know to take in the wash, close the
windows, and not have the kids roll around in the yard,'' Pataki
said at the bill signing ceremony in the Willets Elementary school
yard.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was first suggested by Neal Lewis, head of the
Nassau-Suffolk Neighborhood Network. In 1992, Lewis heard about a
woman whose child suffered an allergic reaction to spraying at a
neighboring home.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Nicole Hudson of Farmingville, was gardening when she
saw a worker spraying trees in the neighbor's yard.
</P>
<P>
   As a white cloud with a noxious odor floated toward an open
bedroom of her house where her newborn slept, she called over to
the worker who was clad in protective gear. ''Don't worry about it
lady, I'm done already,'' he yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   In horror, she raced upstairs to find her baby, who was crying.
The child was later treated for the allergic reaction to a toxic
chemical. Hudson was instructed to destroy the linens and other
belongings in the baby's room.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great victory for the health and safety of our
residents,'' Lewis said, adding that support from Long Island's
breast cancer action groups and other environmental organizations
statewide boosted the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor notification law goes into effect March 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Notices must contain information regarding the date and location
of applications and the name of the product being applied. The law
allows exemptions for more than 30 specific types of pesticides
with a low toxicity, such as boric acid and horticultural oils, and
for pesticide applications to cemeteries and spot treatments of
less than nine square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said at least seven states allow residents to register
with the state if they want to be notified about pesticide spraying
near their home. But he said that New York is the first to require
residents of adjacent properties to be warned ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that this bill will set the standard for states
throughout the country,'' said State Sen. Carl Marcellino
(R-Plainview), who co-sponsored the bill with Assemblyman Tom
DiNapoli (D-Thomaston).

<HEADLINE> Virginia still faces horseshoe crab moratorium  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW BARAKAT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - An interstate fishing commission on
Monday failed to recommend a reprieve for Virginia from a pending
moratorium on horseshoe crab fishing.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Pruitt, Virginia's representative to the Atlantic
States Marine Fisheries Commission, said he remains optimistic the
feds will postpone the moratorium, scheduled to take effect in
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   If no reprieve is granted, Virginia will sue to stop the
sanction, Pruitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, a 15-state compact sanctioned by Congress to
regulate Atlantic fishing, has required all states to cut back
harvests of horseshoe crabs, a 350 million-year-old evolutionary
oddity that plays a key role in the East Coast ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Migratory birds feed on horseshoe crab eggs. Conch fishermen use
horseshoe crabs as bait. And the biomedical industry uses horseshoe
crab blood to produce a product that's used to test drugs and
medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that horseshoe crabs have been overfished in recent
years, the commission ordered Virginia to cut its quota from
710,000 crabs to 152,495. Similar cutbacks were imposed on other
states.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia is the only state to reject the quotas. In July,
the Virginia Marine Resources Commission cut its quota in half to
355,000, but says further cuts are not warranted scientifically and
would harm the states $7 million conch fishing industry, the
largest of any Atlantic state.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all being done for political reasons. That's the
reality,'' said Jack Travelstead, a VRMC member.
</P>
<P>
   ''The livelihoods of Virginia's conch fishermen hang in the
balance here,'' said Pruitt, also a VMRC member.
</P>
<P>
   At Virginia's urging, the commission agreed to review a proposal
to allow states that don't fill their quota to transfer the
difference to states that need it.
</P>
<P>
   Travelstead said Virginia could easily comply with the
commission's order if such quota transfers were permitted, although
he did not cite any states that would be willing to transfer their
allotments to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Pruitt said the idea of quota transfers was warmly received by
the Department of Commerce in a recent meeting. He expects the
department, which has final authority on the issue, to delay the
moratorium until the commission can review the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Perra, who represented the federal government at
Monday's meeting, said there's no reason to postpone the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point I don't see a reason to change course,'' Perra
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Plumart, a policy adviser with the National Audubon
Society, said Virginia is ''still in open defiance of the plan''
agreed to by the other states.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, the commission recommended a five-year time
limit on a pending safe harbor zone for horseshoe crabs in a
30-mile radius around the mouth of Delaware Bay, the creature's
prime spawning ground.

<HEADLINE> Liberty Buys Into Game Show Network  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Liberty Digital Inc., the new media unit of
AT&AMP;T's Liberty Media Group, will take a 50 percent stake in Sony
Picture Entertainment's Game Show Network. The stock and cash deal
is valued at $275 million.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will create a 24-hour interactive games
network using interactive television technology to allow viewers to
play along with game shows using their computers or set-top boxes,
such as Microsoft Corp.'s WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty has been taking stakes in a variety of technology and
content companies as it prepares to deliver programming to AT&AMP;T's
cable subscribers. In 1998, Liberty Media and Sony Pictures
Entertainment entered into a 50-50 partnership to buy the
Spanish-language network Telemundo.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fleming, president of the Game Show Network, said the
Telemundo deal began a series of discussions between Sony and
Liberty on future partnerships that led to Monday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty will buy its stake with $225 million in cash and $50
million in Liberty Digital stock. The deal is expected to close in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like a strong deal for them,'' said James Penhume,
an analyst at The Yankee Group. ''They're assembling the components
for what is likely to be the interactive television offering on
AT&AMP;T's cable system.''
</P>
<P>
   Penhume said the value of offering games on interactive
television is that it gets people acclimated to the blend of
television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are applications consumers really understand and see
through quickly,'' he said. ''They're easy and fun. Then you can
work your way up to the other stuff,'' including making purchases
using a remote control or wireless keypad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Games are intrinsically interactive,'' said Fleming. ''It
doesn't take a lot of explanation to get consumers to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Game Show Network is seen by 29 million cable and satellite
television subscribers. It runs classic television game shows,
including episodes of ''What's My Line,'' ''Beat The Clock'' and
''Match Game.''
</P>
<P>
   The network already airs one interactive game show. Viewers of
''Inquizition'' can play along in real time using a telephone or on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The technology works in the same way as the ''enhanced
television'' version of ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' which
airs on the ABC Television Network.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retaliates for Diplomat Expel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States ordered the expulsion of two
Congolese diplomats Monday in retaliation for Congo's decision to
expel two American diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the two
diplomats must leave the country by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have taken this step reluctantly, but the Congolese
government's unjustified expulsion of two American diplomats left
us with no choice,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, asking not to be identified, said
the Congolese are minister counselor Nestor B. Wawa and political
counselor Paul Ruhamya Chikaza.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Congo ordered press officer Denise Burgess and
political counselor Roger James Moran to leave for making
statements it contended were inconsistent with their diplomatic
role.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the two have since returned to Washington. U.S.
Ambassador William Swing called Congolese President Laurent Kabila
on Saturday to protest the expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese officials said the two were ordered home for
objectionable statements made to civil society leaders at a
diplomatic function.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher had no comment on the precise nature of the statements
except that some allegations by Congolese officials were
''outrageous and false.''
</P>
<P>
   He reaffirmed the State Department's complete confidence in the
''professionalism, integrity and prudence'' of the two U.S.
officers.

<HEADLINE> Greeks Feel Snubbed by Medals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Even before they've been awarded to a
single competitor in the Sydney Olympics, the medals have become a
source of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Australians of Greek heritage are outraged the medals depict a
coliseum, symbolic of ancient Rome, instead of a Greek
amphitheater. They claim such a move is insulting to Greece, the
birthplace of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek-language Australian newspaper O Kosmos ran a story
attacking the medals last week under the headline, ''The Ultimate
Ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Olympic officials stressed the image on the front of the
medals first appeared on medals for the 1928 Amsterdam Games and is
a depiction of a generic coliseum -- not necessarily the famous one
in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Olympic officials said the International Olympic
Committee told them to use the image of the coliseum -- which has
been included on Olympic medals every time since 1928, except for
the 1992 Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The coliseum image dates back to 1928, and we were asked to
uphold the tradition of portraying the image on the medals by the
IOC, which we have duly done,'' said Ric Birch, director of
ceremonies for the Sydney Games. ''The medals initially contained
an image of the Opera House, but the IOC preferred the design first
seen in the 1928 Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Wojciech Pietranik, designer of the medals, said he had to
change his design last year and move his depiction of the Sydney
Opera House to the back of the medals.
</P>
<P>
   IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said the design for the
face of the medals was created by an Italian, Giuseppe Cassoli, who
won a design contest in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's probably why the stadium looks more like (Rome's)
Colosseum rather than the Parthenon (in Athens),'' he said. ''As
far as we are concerned, it's not important if it's the Colosseum
or the Parthenon. What's important is that it's a stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The design features a stadium in the background, the number of
the Olympiad, the city where the games are held, the date, a
Grecian urn and Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, holding a
floral wreath.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important to keep the design element on that face of the
medal to continue the tradition,'' Servan-Schriber said.
</P>
<P>
   The design for the reverse side of the medal remains at the
discretion of the local organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it depicts the Opera House amid the waves of
Sydney Harbor, plus the Olympic flame and the IOC's five-ring logo.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Mint and the Perth Mint produced 3,100 Olympic
medals, including spares, although only 650 gold, 650 silver and
670 bronze medals will be presented to athletes. The remainder will
be destroyed after the games according to strict IOC rules.

<HEADLINE> Lions' Tomczak Placed on IR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions placed quarterback Mike
Tomczak on injured reserve Monday, three days after the 16-year
veteran broke his leg in an exhibition loss to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Tomczak started at quarterback in the Lions' 23-17 loss to the
Raiders on Friday night and broke his leg during the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He was subbing for Charlie Batch, Detroit's top quarterback, who
recently resumed practice after recovering from a broken bone in
his right knee, but is being held out of games.
</P>
<P>
   Tomczak was 6-of-12 for 37 yards before he was knocked down by
Oakland linebacker Greg Biekert and stayed on the ground, curled up
in pain and grasping his shin.
</P>
<P>
   Tomczak was carried off the field by trainers and later carted
from the sidelines. The team's only healthy veteran quarterback is
Stoney Case.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the team released wide receiver Henry Douglas,
linebacker Scott Fields and safety Ryan Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions, who now have 80 players on their roster, need to get
down to 65 by Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Ford halting production at three plants to shift tires for recall  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. will halt production at three
truck plants for more than a week to free up 70,000 tires for use
as replacements in a recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   The plants in St. Paul, Minn.; Edison, N.J.; and Hazelwood, Mo.,
will close from Aug. 28 to Sept. 8 so that 15-inch tires used in
production of Ford Explorer/Mercury Mountaineer sport utility
vehicles and Ford Ranger pickups can be sent to Ford and
Lincoln/Mercury dealers. The plants employ about 6,000 workers, who
will still get paid.
</P>
<P>
   Ford CEO Jac Nasser was scheduled to explain the announcement in
a TV ad running Monday night during ABC's ''Monday Night
Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You have my personal guarantee that all of the resources of
Ford Motor Company are directed to resolve this situation,'' Nasser
says in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone has recalled all P235/75R15 ATX and ATX II
tires as well as 15-inch Wilderness AT tires made at a plant in
Decatur, Ill. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is
investigating 62 deaths and more than 100 injuries that could be
linked to those tires.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented move by a major automaker came even as a
safety advocacy group filed a lawsuit to force
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and Ford Motor Co. to widen the recall
beyond those 15-inch truck tires.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Auto Safety, which successfully pushed for 1970s
recalls of the Ford Pinto and 14.5 million Firestone 500 tires,
contends 12 million more Firestone tires - all ATX, ATX II and
Wilderness ATs still on the road - should be recalled, and that the
recall should be overseen by a judge. A Ford spokesman said the
range of the recall was sufficient and the companies were ''moving
heaven and earth'' to replace tires.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Inglis, vice president for Ford North America, said the
plant shutdown would cut about 25,000 vehicles from Ford's
production - 15,000 Rangers and 10,000 Explorers/Mountaineers. Not
all of those vehicles would have used 15-inch tires, but Inglis
said there was no way to schedule production without them.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis also said the move would affect Ford's earnings, but
declined to say by how much. He said by mid-September, the tire
industry should have ramped up production enough to provide more
replacement tires.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing this to make the most tire replacements into the
market now where we know there's a shortage,'' Inglis said. ''The
action will help us close the gap between supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ford plant in Edison, N.J., makes Rangers and employs about
1,500 workers, of which 140 are salaried, Ford spokeswoman Kathleen
Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some will remain at the plant during the shutdown, but the
remainder will get 95 percent of their straight-time wage, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Auto workers playing cards Monday behind the UAW Local 980 hall
near the sprawling Ford assembly plant in Edison, N.J., reacted to
the news.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dockery, of Woodbridge, a 30-year plant worker, was upset
at the tire company.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to mess up our profit-sharing, our overtime, our
production,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said most workers are putting in at least 50 hours and
sometimes 60 to 70 hours a week. The company payment during the
shutdown is based on a 40-hour week.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Lockhart, 48, of New Brunswick, a welder who started at
the plant in 1969, was not critical of the tiremaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Firestone wouldn't put a tire out that they knew was faulty,''
Lockhart said. ''These things happen and they have to be
corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Production of the 2001 Rangers had already started, she said.
The vehicle is also made at the St. Paul plant in Minnesota, which
is also closing.
</P>
<P>
   The recall of Bridgestone/Firestone tires has created an
apparent nationwide shortage of 15-inch tires, even as Ford has
authorized more than 30 brands to replace recalled Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   But the Center for Auto Safety contends the recall is not broad
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Ditlow, director of the center, said the group filed
suit because it believed it could move faster than the federal
government to force a wider recall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to take all possible actions to get this defect
remedied,'' Ditlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone maintain that data on complaints
filed by consumers suggest that only the tires under recall have
shown a spike in problems with treads separating while vehicles are
in motion. Most of the recalled tires were installed on Ford
trucks, including the popular Explorer sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting the recall to one size and one plant made no sense,
Ditlow said. If the problem is with the Decatur plant - where Ford
and Bridgestone/Firestone have said many of the recalled tires were
made - then other tire lines made at the plant should also be
recalled, he said. If the problem is a design defect, as the center
believes it to be, all the sizes in that design should be recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ford said the company would look at the group's
data, but reiterated that the companies' data shows only the models
recalled have been linked to problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd be happy to review the data, if any, that Mr. Ditlow used
in determining that other tires should be recalled,'' said Ford
spokesman Jon Harmon. ''All the data Ford, Firestone and NHTSA has
seen indicates the recalled population of tires are the ones
needing to be recalled, and the other tires are performing very
well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be irresponsible to recall perfectly good tires,
because it would delay getting safe tires to customers who need
them,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.
Several attorneys around the country have filed lawsuits seeking
class-action status to represent consumers hurt by the recall.
Attorneys general in several states also have said they were
investigating the tires and the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ford told analysts in a conference call Monday that
Explorer sales had slowed slightly since the recall began, and
would likely be down for the month.

   George Pipas, Ford's director of sales analysis, said the recall
might be a reason for the decline, but new incentives on SUVs from
other automakers might also contribute. He also noted that Explorer
was at 97 percent of its sales objective for the month - better
than other Ford cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible to tease out the impact of one factor versus
another,'' he said. ''It's still doing very well, but the sales
pace has declined somewhat since earlier this month.''

<HEADLINE> Burundi's President Warns Tutsis  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYNE SAMBIRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- In a remarkable admission of
vulnerability, Burundi's President Pierre Buyoya warned opponents
Monday not to attempt a coup ahead of talks aimed at ending his
country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya, a Tutsi, apparently directed his warning at radical
Tutsi opposition parties that are behind recent anti-government
protests. He is scheduled to meet this weekend in South Africa with
Nelson Mandela, the former South African president and mediator in
talks aimed at settling Burundi's seven-year civil war with Hutu
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who want to overthrow the government so that the
president will not be there to sign the peace agreement should know
that their actions will come to no good,'' Buyoya told a meeting of
more than a thousand local administrators and civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Buyoya's request for a delay, Mandela wants to see the
power-sharing agreement that would establish ethnic balance in the
army, government and parliament signed Aug. 28. Tutsis, who
constitute a minority, dominate the military and government. The
Hutus are the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela has already invited President Clinton and other world
leaders to witness and support the agreement. On Saturday, Mandela
will go to the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha to prepare for the
signing, his office said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems as if the mediator (Mandela) is reluctant to postpone
the signing of a peace agreement,'' Buyoya said. If he doesn't
sign, Mandela will see it as ''a sign of disrespect'' and think
Burundians do not want peace, he added.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the agreement among Buyoya's government, Hutu
rebels and opposition parties would end a war that has killed at
least 200,000 people. Violence erupted after Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated Melchior Ndadaye, the first democratically elected
president and a Hutu, in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya, a retired army major, appealed Sunday for support from
the Army High Council, which put him in power in a 1996 coup, and
the Tutsi parties and interest groups negotiating in Arusha,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, Bujumbura, where middle-class Tutsis are
Buyoya's main constituency, protests are on the rise against
negotiations with leaders of the three Hutu factions, seen as
responsible for the killings of Tutsis. A declining economy adds to
the pressure on Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, 6,000 students at the University of Bujumbura, most
of them Tutsis, boycotted classes over the government's failure to
end the violence. Their lecturers, backed by a trade union, joined
the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Grenades exploded in two suburbs where soldiers briefly clashed
with anti-government protesters.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Buyoya delivered his speech, a huge fire
engulfed an open market at Jabe, burning wooden stalls and houses
in one of Bujumbura's busiest suburbs. The fire turned the night
sky orange over the unusually quiet capital. It was not clear,
however, what caused it.
</P>
<P>
   Police and soldiers set up checkpoints in the area and people
stayed indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The two main Hutu rebel groups link a cease-fire with the
closing of all ''regroupment camps,'' where the army had herded
some 350,000 Hutu civilians to separate them from rebels who depend
on them.
</P>
<P>
   The government says most of the camps have been closed under
international pressure and in spite of worsening security.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mandela asked United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to send a three-person team to investigate camp closures.

<HEADLINE> Couch, Browns Offense Struggling  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns haven't run the ball or
passed it very well. However, they're doing a nice job of
protecting quarterback Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   On and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, Cleveland's second-year QB, hasn't been sacked in three
exhibition starts behind the first-team offensive line. However, he
has taken some hard hits in newspapers, on television and radio
talk shows for his sub-par play.
</P>
<P>
   ''You feel bad for the guy,'' said Ty Detmer. ''I've been there
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Detmer was at Browns' practice for the first time Monday since
undergoing season-ending surgery after tearing his right Achilles'
tendon two weeks ago while scrambling at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody needed a pep talk it was Detmer, whose leg is in a
cast from the knee down for the next six weeks. He drove around the
practice fields on an electrical scooter before hopping over to a
bench to meet reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer talked about the disappointment of being out for the
season, and how strange it was watching his teammates on TV. But
mostly Detmer, a nine-year veteran and team leader, said he's been
hurting for Couch, whose struggles have led some Browns fans to
call him ''Tim Slouch.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure once the regular season starts he'll pick it up and
you'll see him playing with a lot more fire and cutting it loose,''
Detmer said. ''In the preseason he's just been afraid to make
mistakes. You feel for the guy because we've all been there at one
time or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch hasn't looked good, and neither has the Browns' offense,
which managed just 156 yards on 50 plays in a 24-0 loss to
Washington on Saturday night. When the starters were on the field,
the offense had no play longer than 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   There are other, uglier numbers for Cleveland's offense:
</P>
<P>
   -- Zero points in the past eight quarters.
</P>
<P>
   -- Six points in the last six periods.
</P>
<P>
   -- 18 yards rushing in 13 attempts behind the first-team line.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed in the offense,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer
said. ''The execution has to improve. Our timing on offense isn't
good. We need to practice that and continue to grow. We've got to
get better.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some excuses for the offensive doldrums, though.
</P>
<P>
   Couch has been without wide receiver Kevin Johnson -- his main
target last season -- the past two games. Johnson has missed almost
three weeks of practice with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   And Errict Rhett, expected to be Cleveland's starting running
back this season, missed the Washington game with a broken nose.
</P>
<P>
   The last two weeks, Couch has been throwing to three new
receivers. JaJuan Dawson and Dennis Northcutt are rookies and David
Patten is in his first year in Cleveland after signing as a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Couch is still getting comfortable running new
offensive coordinator Pete Carmichael's system. One of the new
wrinkles is Couch using more three-step drops to get rid of the
ball quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dismal stats from Saturday, Couch saw some
positives.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were some opportunities there that we could have taken
advantage of,'' Couch said. ''A guy messing up here, a guy messing
up there. We just have to work to clean that mess up. The positive
sign is there were opportunities to make plays. We've just got to
go out and make them.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch admits the onslaught of criticism has effected his play
and said he has sought out others to help tune it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've talked to my brother quite a bit and some guys on the
team that I'm good friends with,'' he said. ''You just have to get
some stuff off your chest now and then and have somebody to talk
to. I've definitely got those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them is cornerback Corey Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the criticism of Tim has been very harsh,'' Fuller
said. ''It takes time. There's not a potion that can make you go
out there and have Joe Montana's success. ... I told him, 'Look,
fans are like the weather. If you win, they're with you. Lose,
they're like a hurricane. Don't let them get to your psyche.''

<HEADLINE> Blood Clots Sideline End  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) -- Pellom McDaniels, a reserve defensive
end for the Atlanta Falcons, will miss the 2000 season because of
small blood clots on his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniels, 32, first experienced shortness of breath Aug. 8 at
the Falcons' first practice after returning from an Aug. 5
exhibition in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a fumble recovery in the game, and when I fell on the
ball I bruised my rib cage and my hip,'' McDaniels said Monday.
''They said these kinds of problems can develop when you take a
hard blow like that and then spend a long time, in my case over 12
hours, at very high altitudes in a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 295-pound McDaniels did not miss a game or a
practice, but his breathing problems persisted. The clots were
discovered Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniels indicated doctors might advise him to stop playing
football altogether. He is being treated with blood-thinning
medication and will remain hospitalized through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know. It was something that was unexpected, to say the
least,'' he said. ''It's terrible because this is the first
preseason I've been through with no injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   After first telling Falcons trainer Ron Medlin of his difficulty
breathing, McDaniels underwent several X-rays over the next two
weeks that were inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't know what was wrong, and that bothered me because
I knew I shouldn't be having those kinds of problems if I was
healthy,'' McDaniels said. ''Now that we look back at it, you can
say I took a great risk by playing with this condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told me if these (clots) aren't discovered soon after
they form, they can break off and go to other parts of your body.
Then you're really in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniels is Atlanta's only reserve defensive end with NFL
experience. He joined the Falcons as a free agent April 18, 1999.
He was entering his eighth NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons already have starting right end Brady Smith nursing
a groin injury. Smith was able to jog lightly Monday, but is
expected to be sidelined for Thursday's preseason finale at
Jacksonville.

<HEADLINE> Daily News to release evening edition.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)- The New York Daily News announced Monday that it
will release an evening edition next month geared for the commuter
market.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 12, the ''Daily News Express'' will be
distributed for free from 4 to 7 p.m. on weekdays at key commuter
points such as Penn Station, Grand Central Terminal, the Staten
Island Ferry, and the Port Authority, said Ken Frydman, Daily News
Director of Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Combining short, faced-pace articles with eye-catching graphics
and heavy ad content, the paper will be designed to be read in the
40 minutes to an hour that it takes for many commuters to get home,
Frydman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Daily News Express fills a major void in the city's journalism
marketplace,'' Daily News chairman and co-publisher Mortimer B.
Zuckerman said in a statement. ''It's been a long time since New
Yorkers had a real evening paper with fresh content.''
</P>
<P>
   The Express' editorial staff will be led by Brian Moss, a
20-year veteran of the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Express will have an entirely separate editorial
staff from the daily paper, it will also draw on the editorial and
advertising sales resources of the daily paper.

<HEADLINE> No Retirees on Olympic Ball Team  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Tim Raines won't be on the U.S. Olympic
baseball team, leaving it to minor leaguers to try to win a medal
in Sydney next month.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, the last former major league player still under
consideration for the team, has been rejected by the selection
committee. The roster will be announced later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, who turns 41 on Sept. 16, has been playing in the
independent Atlantic League as a way of getting back into shape and
auditioning for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appreciate Tim's desire and effort,'' selection committee
member Bob Watson said Monday. ''He sacrificed both physically and
mentally to try to make this squad. It just didn't pan out, but we
do thank him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines had battled lupus at the end of his 21-year major league
career, which included two World Series championships with the New
York Yankees. He had a career .295 average with 964 RBIs and 807
stolen bases, the fifth-highest total in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of several former major leaguers who came out of
retirement to try out for the U.S. team. They either got hurt, quit
again or were turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Watson declined to say why Raines was rejected. The U.S. Olympic
Committee wants to limit discussion of the roster pending the
announcement later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It did not work out for some various reasons,'' Watson said.
''We will get into some of the particulars later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said the roster wasn't final Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The roster is likely to include Cincinnati Reds minor league
shortstop Gookie Dawkins, who was on the Pan American Games team
last year that qualified the United States for the Olympic
tournament. The Reds have given permission for Dawkins to play.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals will be used in the Olympic baseball tournament
for the first time in Sydney. It was restricted to amateurs in the
first two medal tournaments in Barcelona and Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Officials Reach To Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) -- Zapatista rebels in Chiapas
state once took up arms against Mexico's ruling party. Although
recent elections have eroded the party's power, it won't be easy to
convince rebels to give up their guns, the state's governor-elect
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Salazar, who defeated a PRI candidate in Sunday's voting,
says the rebels will likely wait to see action from the new state
and national governments. The victory came several weeks after the
PRI lost its hold on the nation's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way to gain credibility with the Zapatistas ... is with
acts,'' not words, Salazar said in a radio interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year lull since peace talks stalled in 1996 has
complicated efforts to end the long-simmering rebellion, which
flared in 1994 as rebels took up arms to demand greater rights for
Mexico's Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conflict is going through a situation much graver than in
'94 ... because one must rebuild all the bases and conditions of
the peace process,'' Miguel Alvarez of the Chiapas-based Advisory
Services for Peace told a news conference on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With 95 percent of the vote counted from Sunday's election,
coalition candidate Salazar had 52 percent, a lead of 6 percentage
points over Sami David of the ruling PRI, or Institutional
Revolutionary Party. That ended the PRI's seven-decade rule in the
region. Salazar duplicated Vicente Fox's feat in the July 2
presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Zapatista National Liberation Army in the
Lacondon jungle told The Associated Press over the weekend that
they remain skeptical of any government and were waiting to see
proof of goodwill, not mere promises.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels encouraged people to vote on Sunday, but insisted
they were neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Though open warfare lasted only two weeks in 1994, armed
pro-government villagers have repeatedly clashed with Zapatista
supporters in the mountains and canyons of rural Chiapas since
then, aggravating mistrust between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Local land disputes have turned bloody, as in the village of
Acteal, when pro-government gunmen massacred 45 Zapatista
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks stalled in 1996 after the only significant accord,
on expanding the rights of Indian communities. A commission of
federal lawmakers -- which included Salazar -- drew up a proposed law
to enact it. The Zapatistas endorsed it. The federal government
balked, claiming it would compromise national sovereignty
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Fox repeated his vow to present that proposed law
to Congress ''at the start of my term'' and said he would meet
another Zapatista demand, to pull back troops, ''as soon as the
state of law is re-established.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fox and Salazar say they are ready to meet the rebels
face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar's experience in negotiations with the Zapatistas has
raised hope that he will know how to deal with them. He has
promised to crack down on paramilitary groups and remove government
support for them.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar also promised to consult the Zapatistas on political
reforms rather than imposing them -- something that would respect
the sense of pride and power the impoverished Indian guerrillas won
in taking up arms.
</P>
<P>
   The government will have to find a peaceful way to let them keep
that pride while also settling the grievances of other communities
who have conflicts with the Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   Another rebel movement based in nearby states, the Revolutionary
Army of the Insurgent People, has already vowed that despite Fox's
victory, it will continue its armed struggle against free-market
economic policies it says hurt the poor.

   SPRINGFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Jeff Wilson, who stood side by side
with Tiger Woods during the U.S. Open awards ceremony as the low
amateur, shot a 4-under-par 67 to share the first-round lead in the
100th U.S. Amateur on Monday.
</P>

   Lucas Glover of Clemson and David Miller of Georgia also had 67s
on a mild, sunny day in which the Upper and Lower courses at the

field of 312 players.
</P>
<P>
   James Driscoll of Virginia, a quarterfinalist last year, was
alone at 68, a shot ahead of a group of eight that included Georgia
Tech teammates Bryce Molder and Carlton Forrester, and Luke Donald
of England, the 1999 NCAA champion for Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Byrd, a member of the 1999 U.S. Walker Cup team and a
teammate of Glover, headed another large group at 70. John Harris,
the 1993 U.S. Amateur champion; Danny Green, the current U.S.
Mid-Amateur champ; and Andy Miller, the son of former PGA Tour star
Johnny Miller, also were in that group.
</P>
<P>
   Glover of Greenville, S.C.; David Miller of Daphne, Ala.; and
Wilson, a reinstated amateur from Suisun, Calif., who pretty much
gave up golf in 1994, all played on the somewhat easier Upper
Course. The par-71, 6,887-yard layout will be used when match play
starts Wednesday for the 64 survivors of stroke play.
</P>
<P>
   Molder, Forrester and Kevin Warrick, a sophomore at the
University of West Florida, were the only players to break par (70)
on the 7,116-yard Lower Course, which has been the site of four
U.S. Opens since 1954, including the Jack Nicklaus-Isao Aoki
showdown in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of notable players are going to have to hustle to make
the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kuchar, the 1997 Amateur champion, shot a 77 on the Upper
Course.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Curtis, the winner of the recent Players' Amateur and a
semifinalist in this event a year ago, shot a 73 on the Lower
Course.
</P>
<P>
   On a day in which college golfers dominated the leaderboard,
Wilson carried the banner for the 30-something crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old who played without any success the PGA Tour in
1990 had six birdies and two bogeys in one of the final pairings of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I can play as well as anybody out here, I guess,''
said Wilson, a car salesman who had got his amateur status restored
in 1997 so he could play in some best-ball tournaments. ''I don't
compete that much, so that would be the one thing that would be my
drawback. But I have played a lot of competitive golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament that Wilson likes to recall is the U.S. Open, the
one that Woods won by 15 strokes at Pebble Beach. Wilson finished
35 shots behind him, but that was enough to earn him the gold medal
and a chance to stand by Woods at the awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just blown away,'' Wilson said. ''Here was a guy who had
just made one of the best performances in any sport and he
congratulated me on being the low amateur. I was sitting there,
''What are you talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the greatest performances of all time and he took time
out to congratulate me for shooting 20-over par,'' Wilson said. ''I
think that guy is something special. That was something to
behold.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has competed in three other amateurs, 1982, '85 and '99.
</P>
<P>
   Glover, who failed to qualify for match play in his two other
appearances in the Amateur, had six birdies and two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   David Miller, who also played late Monday, had five birdies and
one bogey in a round in which he had 10 one-putt greens.
</P>
<P>
   David Gossett turned professional recently, so he is not
defending his title.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Makes Paus Starting QB  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cory Paus, who started seven games for UCLA
last year before breaking his collarbone and undergoing
season-ending surgery, will open the season as the Bruins' No. 1
quarterback again.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Toledo gave Paus the nod over fellow sophomore Ryan
McCann.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cory, at this point, operates the offense better and that was
the whole key,'' Toledo said Monday. ''Ryan is still learning and
he's made great strides and he's closed the gap a little. He just
doesn't have the total knowledge of the offense that Cory does at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann came off the bench to spark the Bruins to a 23-20
overtime victory over Washington late last season, but was less
impressive the following week in a 17-7 loss to Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Scott McEwan is listed as the No. 3 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, unranked in the preseason, opens the season Sept. 2
against preseason No. 3 Alabama at the Rose Bowl.

<HEADLINE> AWOL Lt. in Israel: 'I'm Not a Spy'  </HEADLINE>
By JASMINA KELEMEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETAH TIKVA, Israel (AP) -- A U.S. Army Reserve intelligence
officer who alarmed the American military when he went AWOL turned
up Monday in Israel, saying he hasn't revealed any government
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Jeremiah Mattysse met with U.S. diplomats and Israeli
police for more than three hours on the understanding he was free
to go when he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a spy,'' Mattysse told reporters after leaving
Israel's international crimes unit in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah
Tikva. ''There's been many things said about me which aren't true.
I didn't give any classified information to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse said he had ''not decided yet'' how long he would stay
in Israel. He left the station in a police car, not saying where he
was headed.
</P>
<P>
   American military officials said they're especially concerned
about Mattysse's absence because of his background in U.S.
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Hanley, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Reserve Command in
Atlanta, said last week that it would be logical for an
investigation to include ensuring that nothing was missing from
offices where Mattysse worked.
</P>
<P>
   Police located Mattysse, 50, at a youth hostel in Mitzpeh Ramon,
a desert town famed for its crater and its hippie culture. He wore
the knitted skullcap typical of Orthodox Jews and a T-shirt with a
floral motif.
</P>
<P>
   Police emphasized that he was cooperating of his own free will.
Israel has no provision for arresting someone who deserts a foreign
army.
</P>
<P>
   Until February, Mattysse commanded the Army Reserve Intelligence
Support Center at Camp Bullis in San Antonio, Texas, as a full-time
reserve officer. The unit's primary mission was to train reservists
in intelligence work. Mattysse failed to report to duty on Aug. 8
after a vacation, making him AWOL, or absent without leave.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse was reassigned to the 90th Reserve Support Group in San
Antonio earlier this year after an investigation began into his
wife's allegations that he had an extramarital affair. The San
Antonio Express-News reported that his wife, Vanda Mattysse, filed
a divorce complaint March 7 in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Rivka Artzi-Nir, a woman who lives in Israel and identified
herself as Mattysse's girlfriend, has told Israeli newspapers he
had become devoted to helping Israel since he converted to Judaism
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Artzi-Nir went to the police station, but said police told her
Mattysse had no interest in seeing her and denied a relationship
with her. Artzi-Nir, 48, has said Mattysse sent her classified
material through the mail. She showed reporters a photo of the two
sitting on a porch, arms linked.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Yoram Sheftel, who successfully defended Cleveland
autoworker John Demjanjuk against charges he committed crimes
against humanity while serving as a World War II concentration camp
guard, said he was ready to defend Mattysse and accused police of
kowtowing to American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kleiner, a right-wing legislator, compared Mattysse to
Jonathan Pollard, the former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst
sentenced to life in prison in the United States for selling
secrets to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hundreds of Israeli soldiers are in the United States who fled
the army, no one arrested them,'' Kleiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The police could deport Mattysse once his tourist visa runs out,
but as a Jew Mattysse would be eligible for automatic citizenship.
Interior Ministry officials said Mattysse has asked to immigrate to
Israel.

<HEADLINE> State says city's infighting symptom of government breakdown  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Public infighting between Camden's City
Council, the mayor and his administration illustrates the collapse
of local government there and ''underscores the need'' for a state
takeover, Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Jane M.
Kenny said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see that there are just some fundamental things that just
don't work in the governance there,'' Kenny said. ''There are some
underlying problems. The center doesn't hold in Camden.''
</P>
<P>
   Days after the council asked indicted Mayor Milton Milan to
resign, Kenny said she will continue lobbying legislators to
approve a takeover of the state's poorest city. Part of her pitch
is to show them just how bad Camden's administration is, Kenny
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the City Council unanimously approved a resolution
asking Milan to resign. Earlier in the week, city attorney John A.
Misci Jr., 36, resigned claiming the council had created an
''unhealthy, openly hostile, racist and retaliatory workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan also recently directed city department heads not to talk
to council members. Instead, council members must go through
business administrator Preston Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   But Camden's problems go beyond these public battles, Kenny
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly is chaotic and it's clearly something that
underscores the need for stability,'' Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   State management teams now have the power to supervise city
spending and hiring. But the state needs more power to correct the
underlying problems, Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny and her staff have been meeting with legislators since the
Whitman administration proposed the takeover legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators worried publicly about the takeover's impact on
the traditionally strong policy of letting individual
municipalities govern themselves without direct state intervention.
Others claimed a takeover subverts the democratic process by
removing elected leaders from power.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal is passed, Camden would become the first city to
have its operations fully assumed by state government.
</P>
<P>
   A version of the bill was introduced in the Senate before the
summer recess and no committee hearing is scheduled. No action has
been taken in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In her sessions with lawmakers, Kenny said she addressed those
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a very superficial concern, an immediate
concern,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny said a prime concern should be providing public services
to Camden residents. Lawmakers should also be looking to hold city
administrators accountable for the state aid, she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 cents of every dollar Camden spends comes from state
relief funds, Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   The first public step in the state's control of Camden came the
day after Milan was charged in an indictment with extortion, money
laundering and mail fraud. Federal authorities said Milan accepted
payoffs and gifts from city contractors and took bribes from
organized crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   The state gave Milan two weeks to correct long-standing
problems. The state finance board said he didn't and on April 14
voted to place the city under supervision. That prompted the state
attorney general's office to file a lawsuit that asked a judge to
approve the control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Milan threatened to place the city in bankruptcy last year
before he accepted a deal to allow a state financial review board
some oversight of operations. But despite that monitoring, the
state alleges, Camden officials continued to ignore the problems.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the state said Camden filed annual audits more
than two years after they were due. When the audits were filed,
some contained a notice from the auditor that the examinations
could not be done because Camden kept no records of its
expenditures. Camden also overspent its budget by nearly $500,000
in 1998, according to the state's legal brief.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Cut Farris, Conrad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Bill Cowher made some tough decisions Monday
by waiving tackles Kris Farris and Chris Conrad. The Pittsburgh
Steelers coach still hasn't decided on his starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll continue to take a look at it,'' Cowher said when asked
if Kordell Stewart will start the regular-season opener Sept. 3
against Baltimore. ''We'll take it week to week and go from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's 24-23 loss to Indianapolis in Mexico City, Stewart
had perhaps his best outing of the preseason, completing 8 of 18
passes for 82 yards. He did, however, throw an interception late in
the first half, ending a drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had my opportunities and missed a couple,'' said Stewart,
who isn't surprised by his coach's indecision as the start of the
season approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, and I'm not concerned about it. We still have one more
exhibition game to play and I have to perform, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowher expects Stewart will start the final preseason game
Friday at Washington, leaving challenger Kent Graham without a
preseason start.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I would have (started), but obviously coach has to make
those decisions,'' said Graham, who completed 8 of 10 passes for 83
yards and one touchdown in the loss to the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's quarterback rating is 99.6, compared to 38.6 for
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   While he struggles with his decision on who starts at
quarterback, Cowher did not have a difficult time making roster
moves Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Farris, the 1998 Outland Trophy winner at UCLA, and Conrad, a
former starter, were among 10 players waived as the Steelers cut
their roster to 70.
</P>
<P>
   Farris and Conrad both were third-round draft choices, Farris in
1999 and Conrad, from Fresno State, the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Farris was trying to come back from a stress fracture in his
left foot that sidelined him all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt like we got enough opportunity to see him play and we
had to make the decision accordingly,'' Cowher said.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, the starting right tackle a year ago, became expendable
after the Steelers drafted tackle Marvel Smith and signed backup
linemen Roger Duffy and Tom Myslinski.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Fraley, an undrafted rookie from Robert Morris, also has
played well during the preseason and might win a roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad was moved to guard last spring, but has been bothered
much of training camp by what might be a career-ending neck injury.
He was told by doctors last week he probably cannot play again
unless he has surgery to fuse two vertebrae in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad said it's unlikely he'll undergo such surgery.
</P>
<P>
   If he is not claimed by another team, the Steelers might have to
reach an injury settlement with Conrad, who lost his starting job
after three games last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers also assigned wide receiver Will Blackwell (knee)
to the physically-unable-to-perform list, a move that will sideline
him for at least the first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Also waived were offensive lineman Todd Burger and wide receiver
Shawn McWashington.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies waived were tight end Jason Gavadza, a seventh-round
draft pick; fullback Joey Goodspeed; kicker Kyle Atteberry;
cornerback Tim Strickland; linebacker Jonathan Foster, and
defensive end Johnny Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Kevin Henry practiced Monday for the first time
since training camp started. He had arthroscopic knee surgery just
before camp opened.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers must make four more moves by 4 p.m. Tuesday to
reach the 65-man limit. They currently receive a roster exemption
for defensive lineman Ernie Brown, who played in NFL Europe.

<HEADLINE> Md. Rail Operator Fired After Crash  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN BIEMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Mass Transit Administration said Monday it
fired the operator of a light rail train that crashed last week at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Dentis Thomas was driving the train Aug. 15 when it failed to
stop at the end of the line, plowing into a protective bumper. The
collision lifted the front car off the tracks, injuring all 22
people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 48, told MTA investigators he blacked out at the end of
the final curve that approaches the station, about a quarter-mile
from the airport stop.
</P>
<P>
   He had returned to work the day before from a medical leave for
a back condition, and told his supervisor he was taking
prescription drugs as required under MTA policy, union officials
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   A urine test on Thomas showed he was not under the influence of
illegal drugs. The results of blood and breath tests were still not
available, agency spokesman Anthony Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA said it was firing Thomas, a 26-year employee, as a
''result of the severity of the accident.'' Brown declined to
provide any additional comment.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang unanswered at the Amalgamated Transit Union Local
1300, of which Thomas is a member.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is continuing to
investigate the crash, which a spokesman has called a ''carbon
copy'' of a light rail crash at the airport six months earlier that
injured 24 people.
</P>
<P>
   The driver in that crash was also fired. He admitted using
cocaine and a prescription painkiller before the accident and was
charged with reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had been fired in 1994 after testing positive for
cocaine, but returned to his job after union officials intervened
on his behalf, The Sun reported. He completed a drug rehabilitation
program in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   MTA Administrator Ron Freeland said last week that Thomas has
been drug free since then.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had been involved in three other light rail accidents in
the past year. He was cleared of blame in two of the incidents. He
was disciplined for the third accident, a derailing which occurred
July 7, 1999, with no passengers aboard.

<HEADLINE> Walker Heads Back To DL  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Larry Walker barely had time to dry himself off
when he received the all-too-familiar news. He was returning to the
disabled list and could possibly miss the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies placed the two-time defending NL batting
champion on the 15-day DL on Monday, hoping the time off will help
Walker's chronically ailing right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was in the hot tub before Colorado's game against the
Atlanta Braves when he was summoned by manager Buddy Bell. He did
not take the news well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to the ballpark with my game face on, ready to play and
now I'm on the DL,'' Walker said. ''I've gone from one extreme to
the complete opposite. I'm still dumbfounded by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker was hitting .309 with nine homers and 51 RBIs in 88
games. He also was second in the NL with 11 outfield assists.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to the disabled list was the second for Walker this
season and the sixth since 1996. He has played in more than 140
games just twice in 11 full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm quite aware of the reputation that follows me as far as
getting hurt,'' Walker said. ''If I could shake it and never get
hurt, I'd do anything for it. Unfortunately, I'm not Cal Ripken.
I'm more like Jose Canseco, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker went on the disabled list in May after team doctors
diagnosed the onset of a stress fracture in his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He was cleared to play four weeks later, but his productivity
has dropped off from recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not playing up to my capability. I know that,'' he said.
''I'm aware of the season I'm having. You don't have to tell me.
You don't have to write it down all the time. It's been real
frustrating for me trying to find out what's wrong and how to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, in the first year of a six-year, $75 million contract,
said the pain in his elbow has neither increased nor diminished.
Despite his desire to play through his struggles, Bell said he did
not want Walker to risk further damage to his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to see him go into the winter with no health
issues,'' Bell said. ''It seems like he's got to rehab something
every winter. It would be nice if he could go in and take care of
normal stuff and get ready for spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell and Rockies officials began pondering the DL several weeks
ago, and serious consideration began when Walker went 1-for-5
against Florida last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was ordered not to throw or hit for 10 days, and he will
remain in Denver when the Rockies leave town Thursday for a
six-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible Walker could be done for the season, but he was
not eager to consider that option while sitting in the Rockies
clubhouse with the USA Today crossword puzzle in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't ask for this,'' he said. ''I didn't complain. I
didn't give anybody any reason except for my bad swing. I guess
maybe they saw something. I don't know. When my time's up, I'll
come back and we'll see where we're at.''
</P>
<P>
   To take Walker's place on the 25-man roster, the Rockies
recalled utility player Adam Melhuse from Triple-A Colorado
Springs.

<HEADLINE> Angels Protest Game Over Umps Call  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels filed a protest over an
umpire's call in the fourth inning of Monday night's game against
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The bases were loaded when Ben Molina hit a popup to short
center field.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett slid for the ball trying to catch it, but it landed
safely. Second baseman Jose Offerman picked up the ball and threw
it to third; although the ball beat Tim Salmon to the bag, third
baseman Lou Merloni was not standing on the base, so Salmon should
have been safe.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that third base umpire Jerry Meals had gone into
the outfield to make a call on Everett's play. After a short delay,
second base umpire Derryl Cousins called Salmon out.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia came out to argue, then returned to
the dugout. He came out again to say that he was protesting the
call.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Put Moore on IR  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- With five players trimmed from the roster, the
Denver Broncos need to make two more cuts by the Tuesday afternoon
deadline as they prepare for their preseason finale Friday night in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Shanahan insisted on Monday that the remaining two
roster casualties haven't been determined.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't made them,'' he said. ''We don't know yet. We have
to make them before 2 o'clock tomorrow. We will do that by then,
but not before then.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan confirmed that the Broncos placed rookie wide receiver
Muneer Moore, who injured his leg in the preseason opener, on
injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Released by the team were defensive linemen Jerome Davis and
Nathan Davis, cornerback William Hampton, offensive guard Allen
DeGraffenreid and fullback Ryan Christopherson.
</P>
<P>
   Two more cuts will reduce Denver's roster to the league-imposed
65 players.
</P>
<P>
   The final round of cuts will be next Sunday, when teams must get
down to 53 players.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan had good news Monday on three of Denver's injured
players.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Terrell Davis, who exited Saturday night's game
against Dallas with a sore left hamstring as a precaution, likely
will be recovered this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to him Sunday and he said it wasn't bad,'' Shanahan
said. ''Until we actually go out and practice, I don't want to say
one way or the other. But if it was a regular-season game, he
believes he could have gone back in there and played, so that's a
good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Players had Monday off.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard Mark Schlereth, who had his left knee drained of
fluid twice since having arthroscopic surgery less than a week into
training camp, is expected to resume practicing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been looking good,'' Shanahan said. ''He's been running
and strengthening the knee. The true test will be when he goes
through practice.''
</P>
<P>
   If Schlereth has no setbacks, he is expected to play about 20
plays in Friday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker John Mobley, who had reconstructive knee surgery
early last season and arthroscopic surgery two weeks ago to remove
a bone chip and loose cartilage in the same knee, should resume
running this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The doctors feel he's way ahead of what they thought it would
be, at least a week ahead,'' said Shanahan, who added that the
training staff will have a better idea of Mobley's progress by this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Will Mobley play in the regular-season opener, Monday, Sept. 4
in St. Louis?
</P>
<P>
   ''My gut feeling is not to play him regardless, because we're
playing on Astroturf,'' Shanahan said. ''But he may change my mind
if he comes back quicker than we think.''

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)- Central Park was scheduled to be re-sprayed with
pesticide early Tuesday morning as part of the city's continuing
battle against the West Nile virus.

<HEADLINE> Sunken Norwegian Ferry Wreck Raised  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- A Norwegian salvage team on Monday raised
the battered wreck of a high-speed passenger ferry that ran aground
in November and sank, killing 16 people.
</P>
<P>
   The 138-foot twin-hulled vessel went down with 85 people aboard
during a nighttime run between the cities of Stavanger and Bergen
on Norway's west coast, near Boemla Island 250 miles west of the
capital Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian Ministry of Justice ordered the wreck raised to
find out why the new vessel, which had the latest in navigation and
rescue aids, ran aground and why some of its life rafts failed to
deploy.
</P>
<P>
   Salvage crews worked through the weekend to place a frame under
the wreck, which lay under about 330 feet of water. Crews moved the
wreck into shallower waters on Sunday and lifted it onto a barge
Monday for transport to a nearby shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian-built ferry was among the most modern serving
Norway's long coast. An investigating commission has postponed its
conclusions until its experts can examine the wreckage.

<HEADLINE> Daily News to release evening edition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)- The New York Daily News announced Monday that it
will release an evening edition next month geared for the commuter
market.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 12, the ''Daily News Express'' will be
distributed for free from 4 to 7 p.m. on weekdays at key commuter
points such as Penn Station, Grand Central Terminal, the Staten
Island Ferry, and the Port Authority, said Ken Frydman, Daily News
Director of Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Combining short, fast-paced articles with eye-catching graphics
and heavy ad content, the paper will be designed to be read in the
40 minutes to an hour that it takes for many commuters to get home,
Frydman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Daily News Express fills a major void in the city's journalism
marketplace,'' Daily News chairman and co-publisher Mortimer B.
Zuckerman said in a statement. ''It's been a long time since New
Yorkers had a real evening paper with fresh content.''
</P>
<P>
   The Express' editorial staff will be led by Brian Moss, a
20-year veteran of the Daily News.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebels: No Clinton Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By CESAR GARCIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels who
oppose growing U.S. ties to Colombia's military promised Monday not
to stage attacks to disrupt President Clinton's upcoming visit to
the South American country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not impede (the Aug. 30 visit) with guerrilla
actions,'' Andres Paris, a commander and spokesman of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia told The Associated Press in
an interview in this southern ranching town.
</P>
<P>
   But the insurgents known as FARC are ''calling on the Colombian
people -- the labor unions, student groups, organizations of the
unemployed and others -- to protest Clinton's visit,'' Paris added.
</P>
<P>
   Paris said a $1.3 billion U.S. anti-narcotics aid package for
Colombia recently approved in Washington is ''just a smokescreen to
promote imperialist interests,'' and that the U.S. government aims
to exert control over the Andean region's oil and mineral wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's planned one-day visit is intended as a show of support
for President Andres Pastrana and his so-called ''Plan Colombia'' --
a strategy to revive Colombia's economy and stem the country's
booming cocaine and heroin trade to the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Security is expected to be extremely tight for Clinton's brief
visit and meeting with Pastrana in Cartagena, a Caribbean port. The
president is only scheduled to stay a few hours and will not spend
the night in Colombia, one of the world's most violent countries.
</P>
<P>
   Paris said FARC rejects Clinton's visit ''cause he is coming as
the head of an empire to shore up Plan Colombia, which is only
going to intensify the armed confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid package will provide battle helicopters and Green
Beret training to support a military push into southern jungles
where FARC rebels and the militias take payoffs to protect peasant
drug plots and traffickers' airstrips and laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Increased bloodshed is widely expected in the conflict that
already claims thousands of lives a year. The rebels, whom the
State Department considers a terrorist organization, have claimed
repeatedly that they are the real target of the U.S. aid plan.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials insist that Washington is not becoming
involved in Colombia's 36-year civil conflict. They concede,
however, that U.S.-trained troops and equipment will be used
against any guerrilla units who try to block stepped up efforts to
eradicate drug crops and destroy labs.

<HEADLINE> McCain Declared Cancer-Free  </HEADLINE>
By ALISA BLACKWOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Tests on lymph nodes and tissue removed during
Sen. John McCain's skin cancer surgery confirmed that his skin
cancer didn't spread, his office announced Monday as McCain went
home from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The former GOP presidential candidate underwent more than five
hours of surgery on Saturday to remove melanoma, the most dangerous
form of skin cancer, from his temple and upper arm.
</P>
<P>
   Pathologists completed the final review of the tissues around
the cancers and found no sign the melanoma had spread, said Todd
Harris, a McCain spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   If the cancer had reached one or more of the lymph nodes,
treatment would have been more complicated and less likely to cure
the cancer, experts had said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, 63, was released from the Mayo Clinic Hospital and was
resting comfortably at his Phoenix home, a statement released by
his Senate office said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors found the melanomas after McCain left the Republican
National Convention to have biopsies performed at Bethesda Naval
Hospital near Washington on Aug. 4. He also had a melanoma removed
from his shoulder in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is usually caused by exposure to the sun. People with
fair skin have a higher risk of skin cancer. McCain spent hours in
the harsh Arizona sun campaigning for Congress in 1982 and
subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's friends have said he is religious about wearing SPF 45
sunblock when outdoors and about seeing his doctor three or four
times a year to check for new lesions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain canceled about a dozen campaign events with GOP
congressional candidates since learning of the skin cancer
diagnosis. Spokeswoman Nancy Ives said McCain hopes to return to
campaigning by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Bush, McCain's opponent in the GOP primaries, said
in a statement: ''Laura and I are grateful for the good news that
John McCain is cancer-free. Our prayers have been answered. We know
that John will now be able to return to a healthy lifestyle marked
by service to others.''

   MOSCOW (AP) -- The effort to reach the crew aboard a sunken Russian submarine
ended as divers announced Monday that none of the 118 sailors aboard could have
survived. Norwegian divers who finally opened the escape hatch and forced their
way into the hull of the Kursk after working in the Arctic depths for more than
24 hours said the submarine was completely flooded. There was no sign that any
of the crew had survived for long inside the mangled warship 350 feet below the

Pipe Blast Could Spur Safety Bills

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New Mexico pipeline explosion that killed 11 campers may

while these bills sit in committee,'' said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., a sponsor
of one of the bills. A man died today in a Lubbock, Texas, hospital, the 11th
victim of a Saturday explosion in a buried natural gas pipeline near Carlsbad,
N.M. Five children were among those killed after the pre-dawn explosion swept

US Envoy: Mideast Progress Blocked

   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- President Clinton's top Mideast envoy, on a

month's Camp David summit, said differences are still blocking a deal after
meeting Monday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Last month's
U.S.-sponsored summit made some progress, Dennis Ross said, but ''there is also
no question about the differences that remain, and those differences have to be
overcome if we want to reach and agreement.'' Ross, who met Friday with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, said he would hold another round of talks with the
two leaders and their negotiating teams.

<HEADLINE> Notes from Monday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Rangers-Yankees:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXAS: RHP Brian Sikorski added two more scoreless innings to
raise his total to nine at the start of a career, second in team
history to Jeff Zimmerman, who began his Texas career with 11 2-3
scoreless innings. ... Gabe Kapler was 1-for-4 and is now 4-for-21
since his 28-game hitting streak ended last Wednesday. ... Rafael
Palmeiro's homer off Orlando Hernandez was the 14th of his career
at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Reliever Jeff Nelson, who feuded with Yankees manager
Joe Torre before the All-Star break, reiterated his unhappiness to
several reporters after the game, saying he felt he had made only
''one bad pitch'' in his relief failure that helped the Yankees
lose two games in the four-game set with Anaheim over the weekend.
... OF David Justice was a late scratch from the starting lineup
when he reported a stiff neck from what Torre said was ''sleeping
wrong.'' ... In his first day of throwing in rehabilitation, RHP
Ramiro Mendoza threw 50 pitches at 60 feet in Florida and reported
no problems with his arm. ... 2B Chuck Knoblauch continued his
rehab in Florida with his regular workout and also did not report
any problems with his sore right elbow.
Angels-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Before the game, a plane circled the field pulling a
banner that said, ''Welcome Back, Foxy Lady.'' The Providence,
R.I., strip club was a favorite hangout of Anaheim first baseman Mo
Vaughn when he was with Boston. ... OF Darin Erstad, who left
Saturday's game against the Yankees with muscle spasms in his left
ribcage, missed his second consecutive game. He has 84 RBIs and is
14 behind Nomar Garciaparra's 1997 record for most RBIs by a
leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox signed second-round draft choice RHP Manny
Delcarmen of Boston. ... 2B Mike Lansing was out of the starting
lineup, mired in a 4-for-31 slump. ... Nomar Garciaparra entered
the game in a 4-for-21 slump, his worst since opening the season
4-for-22.
Athletics-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Both 1B Jason Giambi (strained left shoulder) and 2B
Randy Velarde (neck spasms) were once again out of the lineup
Monday night at Detroit. They're still considered day-to-day. ...
INF Olmedo Saenz took batting practice prior to Monday's game. He
has been on the disabled list since Aug. 1 with a torn left
hamstring and could start a rehab at Triple-A Sacramento this
weekend. ... LHP Mark Mulder entered Monday's start at Detroit with
the highest road ERA, 7.59, in the AL. He was 2-6 in 11 road
starts. ... OF Terrence Long made his second straight start in the
leadoff position Monday. Prior to Sunday, he hadn't batted leadoff
since Aug. 11. ... RHP Gil Heredia (13-8) will make his fourth
attempt at a career-best 14th win when he starts Tuesday's series
opener at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: RHP Dave Mlicki, out since undergoing sinus surgery in
late July, is hopeful of returning to the Tigers' rotation in early
September. He may make a rehab start for Class A West Michigan this
weekend. ... RHP Jeff Weaver, who beat Seattle in his last start,
will try for his third straight win Tuesday night against the
Mariners. ... OF Juan Gonzalez was 5-for-13 during the first three
games of the home series with Oakland, but he's still batting just
.253 at Comerica Park opposed to .335 on the road. Gonzalez hasn't
hit a home run at Comerica Park since a May 17 game-winner against
Cleveland.
Devil Rays-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: RHP Bryan Rekar was with the team after being
arrested early Sunday on charges of domestic abuse. Manager Larry
Rothschild said Rekar is on schedule to start Wednesday at
Minnesota. Rekar has an Oct. 6 court date. He refused to comment
Monday. ... OF Jason Tyner, acquired July 28 from the Mets, made
his third start Monday. ''I'd like to be able to set the table at
the bottom of the order for Gerald (Williams),'' Rothschild said.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Veteran RHP Ken Hill returned home to Texas to attend
his son's birthday Monday and had yet to sign a contract with the
White Sox, but could start as soon as Thursday for the team. ''It's
a little rebirth,'' GM Ron Schueler said of Hill, who was released
earlier this month by Anaheim. ''Not only does he get a chance to
win but a chance to pitch in a pennant race.'' ... RHP Jon Garland
will be placed on the disabled list Wednesday and RHP Sean Lowe
activated so he can start against Baltimore. Garland has some
discomfort in his right forearm after being hit by a line drive
Friday. ... RHP Cal Eldred, who has been sidelined with an
irritated nerve in his right elbow, threw again from the mound
Monday and reported no pain. ... Schueler said RHPs Jon Rauch and
Matt Ginter were both selected to be on the U.S. baseball team that
will compete in the Summer Olympics.
Royals-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Mark Quinn leads all AL rookie outfielders with
seven assists, even though he made only his 51st start in the OF
Monday. ... Jermaine Dye is the ninth Royals player to hit 30
homers in a season. He hit No. 30 on Sunday to move within six of
the team record set by Steve Balboni in 1985. ... After going
without a homer from Aug. 1-6, the Royals hit 16 in 13 games since.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: LF Brady Anderson returned to the starting lineup in
the leadoff position after missing 10 straight games with a
sprained right wrist. ... The father of RHP Pat Rapp died Sunday.
The pitcher is scheduled to pitch Thursday in Chicago, but is not
required to show up. If he doesn't, rookie Jay Spurgeon will take
his place. ... The Orioles have won only 10 of 32 series since
April.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Phillies-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Kent Bottenfield's five-hit shutout in St. Louis
on Sunday made him the third Phillies pitcher to throw a shutout
this season. The last time they had three pitchers throw a shutout
was 1993. ... Bobby Abreu, who batted leadoff for the first time in
his career Sunday and went 2-for-3, hit leadoff again Monday. ...
Scott Rolen was in an 0-for-15 slump. ... Travis Lee is a .143
career hitter at Cinergy Field (6-for-42).
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Ken Griffey Jr. and Philadelphia's Doug Glanville,
Mike Lieberthal and Pat Burrell were on the field early to film a
segment for a movie tentatively called ''Summer Catch.'' It's about
a pitcher who makes it to the big leagues and has Griffey hit a
homer off him in his first appearance. ... 2B Pokey Reese missed
his fourth straight game with a stiff hamstring, which was
bothering him even more Monday. He has missed 14 games, his total
for all last season.
Cubs-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Ricky Gutierrez returns to Houston for the second time
since he was allowed to leave via free agency last off-season. In
his first trip back April 25-27, Gutierrez went 7-for-12 with two
home runs and nine RBIs. ... Over the last nine games, Sammy Sosa
has seven home runs while the rest of the Cubs have had none.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Ken Caminiti, on the disabled list since June 16 with
wrist surgery, took grounders for the first time over the weekend
and is scheduled to take some soft-toss batting practice Tuesday.
Caminiti, who has missed 60 games after rupturing the tendon sheath
in his right wrist, says he plans to beat projections that he would
not return before mid-September and promises to be back by Sept. 1
... During the past 16 games, the Astros are batting .327 (185 of
565) as a team with 39 doubles and 34 home runs, and have climbed
from 12th in the National League to a tie for third with St. Louis
at .273.
Braves-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: The Braves optioned 2B Steve Sisco to Triple-A Richmond
and recalled RHP Gabe Molina from Richmond. During 19 games with
Atlanta, Sisco hit .174 with a home run and two RBIs. Molina was
obtained July 31 from Baltimore along with B.J. Surhoff. With
Baltimore, Molina appeared in nine games and had an 0-0 record with
a 9.00 ERA. With Triple A Rochester, he was 1-2 with a 4.94 ERA and
five saves. At Richmond he was 1-0 with a 3.60 ERA and three saves.
... Going into Monday's game in Denver, Braves manager Bobby Cox
was three wins away from tying Hall of Famer Tommy Lasorda for 14th
on the all-time managerial win list at 1,599. ... Coors Field fans
backed up an aisle 12 rows deep to get autographs from 1B Andres
Galarraga before Monday's game. Galarraga played for the Rockies
from their inaugural year in 1993 through 1997 and remains a
favorite among Colorado fans.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Colorado placed OF Larry Walker on the 15-day disabled
list with a sore elbow Monday and called up Adam Melhuse from
Triple-A Colorado Springs. It was the second time Walker has been
on the DL this season. ... Rockies catcher Brent Mayne missed his
fourth straight start Monday night with an injured left hand and
could be placed on the disabled list. ''He's made some progress,
but the progress hasn't been enough where he could catch and hit at
this point,'' manager Buddy Bell said. Ben Petrick started behind
the plate Monday.
Pirates-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Entering Monday night's game, Jason Kendall and
Brian Giles had combined to score 24 of the Pirates' last 45 runs.
Kendall then tied his career high with his 12th home run, a two-run
shot, in the first inning off Garrett Stephenson. ... 2B Warren
Morris had gone 44 games without an error after committing 11 in
his first 64 games. ... Pirates pitchers didn't allow a home run

<HEADLINE> Court Backs Farmers in Water Rights  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KRAVETS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The state Supreme Court on Monday sided
with a group of farmers that challenged an agreement between
farmers and cities to limit water use in the parched Mojave River
Basin.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, which is sure to make it more difficult for
California's booming cities to get the water they need to grow, the
court upheld a ruling that invalidated part of the carefully
negotiated 1993 water pact.
</P>
<P>
   The court said agreements between cities and farmers cannot
automatically supersede the state's 150-year-old water policy,
which favors landowners with the oldest water rights. In
California, the farms were generally there first, and depend on
irrigation to grow crops on eight million acres of otherwise arid
land.
</P>
<P>
   ''This preserves the farmers' position at basically the top of
the water chain,'' said Robert E. Dougherty, who represented the
seven alfalfa and dairy farmers who refused to join in the Mojave
water pact. ''Cities do take a back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision could make it nearly impossible for farmers
and municipalities to agree on wide-reaching water-restriction
measures during a drought, said Frederick A. Fudacz, a lawyer for
the Apple Valley Ranches Water Co. who argued for the cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's going to make it much more difficult to solve
these water-right lawsuits,'' Fudacz said.
</P>
<P>
   The dissident farmers argued that they should be entitled to
keep using the amount of water they've enjoyed for decades on and
under their land as long as it's not sold or wasted. The high court
agreed, saying the pact's restrictions failed to take into account
the farmers' legal water rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Mojave River, which flows mostly underground, is the only
natural source of water for Barstow and most high desert
communities in San Bernardino County. But the water has been pumped
out faster than rainfall can replenish it in recent years, causing
the water table downstream to plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Water officials in the growing desert communities of Adelanto,
Apple Valley, Barstow, Hesperia, Victorville and other outlying
areas forecast that the basin might dry up altogether without use
restrictions, so they came up with a broad plan.
</P>
<P>
   Litigation between several Mojave-area cities and about 1,000
farmers and other landowners was put on hold. Two years later, in
1993, they reached an accord that required each city and farmer to
reduce usage a certain amount in accordance with water
availability.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge signed off on the deal in 1996, saying
that allocating water based on legal priorities would be
''extremely difficult, if not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   But seven of the farmers objected and kept litigating.
</P>
<P>
   An appellate court reversed the lower court judge and the
California Supreme Court agreed with that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The impacts for California are enormous,'' Scott Slater, a
Santa Barbara lawyer and water expert. ''This case suggests that
farmers cannot automatically lose their rights.''

<HEADLINE> Police officers on trial, accused of killing 11 people  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The former police chief of Haiti's
capital and five other officers went on trial Monday in the
killings of 11 people - the first time members of Haiti's new force
have faced trial.
</P>
<P>
   The trial comes amid fears the new police force could turn out
to be like the trigger-happy army it replaced in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people are angry. We need justice to build the country,''
dozens of protesters chanted outside the Palace of Justice. They
said they were themselves victims of army officers never brought to
trial and held up photographs of the other victims.
</P>
<P>
   The killings occurred on May 28, 1999, while police were
investigating a shootout between rival gangs. Police at the time
said gangsters started shooting at officers, who returned fire,
killing 11 gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said police rounded up 11 unarmed people and shot
them, some in the head as they lay face down in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   After national and international protests, arrest warrants were
issued for 20 officers. Thirteen were arrested, including Police
Chief Jean Coles Rameau, 31, who had fled to neighboring Dominican
Republic. Seven are fugitives and seven were released for lack of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who gave the orders and why? Those are the questions we hope
will be answered in this groundbreaking trial,'' said Jean-Claude
Bajeux, director of the Haitian Ecumenical Center for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The police force has been criticized for excessive force.
Hundreds of officers have been fired for crimes including drug
dealing and murder. But none has been tried. In 1999, police killed
66 people, twice the number in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''This trial has an important meaning for us: to stop police
from acting like the military,'' said Simon St.-Hubert of the
Haitian Human Rights Platform.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian army killed and maimed up to 4,000 civilians in
1991-94.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was adjourned after a jury was chosen. It is expected
to resume Tuesday and take several days.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Derails; No Serious Injuries  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE CITY, S.C. (AP) -- One minute, Barbara Clark was having a
cup of coffee early Monday in the dining car of Amtrak's Silver
Meteor. In the next moment, the car was thrown off the tracks,
coming to rest at a 45-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard this click-like sound, and then the train shifted. We
knew it. We just knew it and we just grabbed onto the table,'' said
Clark, 60, of Sanford, Fla. ''We heard the wheels coming off the
track. There is a sound it makes; I don't know how to tell you. It
was horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine cars of the Silver Meteor, from New York to Jacksonville,
Fla., derailed at about 7:30 a.m., about 15 minutes after a street
sweeper jumped a curb and hit the tracks, damaging the rails, said
Highway Patrol 1st Sgt. Jo Nell. More than 40 people were sent to
hospitals, mostly with ''little bumps and bruises,'' Nell said.
</P>
<P>
   Two sleeping cars, four coach cars, a dining car, a lounge and a
crew dorm jumped the tracks, Amtrak said. A wheel of the engine
also left the rails. Two other cars did not derail.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board was looking into the
cause of the derailment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do know there was a sweeper operating,'' NTSB investigator
Jay Kivowitz said. ''We cannot say at this time that was the cause
of this accident.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 218 passengers and 15 crew members on board, Amtrak
said. At least 46 were taken to hospitals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Clark injured her ribs and had to be lifted out of the tilted
car through a window on a stretcher. She was taken to a hospital
for X-rays and then released.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have some angels in this town. They gathered here this
morning,'' she said. Lake City is a town of about 7,000 people,
about 70 miles east of Columbia in northeastern South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hewitt, who was traveling to Beaufort, said he was able to
open an emergency window and climb out. He likened it to climbing
through a skylight in a ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a few funny noises, and I felt it was tilting. I knew
what was going on,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nader Criticizes Gore's Pitch  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREA CAVANAUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Green Party presidential candidate Ralph
Nader challenged Al Gore's populist credentials on Monday and urged
him to reject campaign money from industries he criticized during
his address to the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his speech he challenged and criticized the giant drug
companies, the oil companies, the pharmaceutical industry, the
HMOs.... He talked populist but buys into corporate power,'' Nader
said at a news conference outside Staples Center, site of the
Democratic convention last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore should reject the money poured into the party's coffer's,
Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Give the money back, Mr. Gore, or stand condemned of deceiving
and misleading the American people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the Democratic presidential nomination last week, Gore
told delegates: ''Big tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the
pharmaceutical companies, the HMOs -- sometimes you have to be
willing to stand up and say no, so families can have a better
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's trying to make a passing grade in Populist 101,'' Nader
said. ''The problem is for the past eight years Gore has been
walking a corporate line, not the populist line.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway said the vice president's
record speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people look at Al Gore's record of fighting powerful
special interests over the past 25 years they'll see that he's the
best candidate,'' he said. ''He has been fighting polluters to make
them pay for their messes and taking on the drug companies for
cheaper prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader insisted that he remains a contender in the presidential
race despite a new CBS News poll showing him with just 5 percent
support nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Gore campaign has said they're not losing any sleep over
my campaign and to that I say, slumber on, Al Gore, slumber on,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Polls: People See Gore in New Light  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is getting a second look from the
American voters, post-convention polls indicate, and they generally
like what they see -- from his leadership skills to his handling of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS News, ABC-Washington Post and CNN-USA Today-Gallup polls
indicate Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Gore are now in a
dead heat -- about a 15-point swing for Gore in all three polls
since before last week's Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of people who view Gore favorably has improved
significantly, both in the CBS poll and the Gallup poll, to levels
that are now comparable to Bush's ratings. In the CBS poll, 45
percent viewed Gore favorably and 27 percent unfavorably -- the same
as the results for Bush. Six in 10 viewed Gore and Bush favorably
in the Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
   Six in 10 said in the Gallup poll that Gore has the personality
and leadership qualities a president should have, about the same as
for Bush. Fewer than half in July said Gore has such qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was rated stronger than Bush on health care, Social
Security, education, abortion rights, prescription drugs, and
campaign finance reform in the Gallup poll. Bush led on national
defense and they were about even on foreign affairs, guns and
handling the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   All three polls gave Gore improved marks on the quality of
leadership, which had been a solid Bush advantage for months. Gore
was seen as having strong leadership qualities by just more than
six in 10, up from 55 percent in the Gallup poll in July. Bush was
seen as a strong leader by almost seven in 10, about the same as in
July before the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was seen as having an appealing personality by 65 percent
in the ABC-Washington Post poll, while 51 percent said that of
Gore. But three-fourths said Gore has the right kind of experience
to be president, compared with six of 10 who said that of Bush.
Gore was seen as more likely to understand the problems of ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
   Six in 10 in the CBS poll said Gore can be trusted to keep his
word, up from 47 percent in July and about the same as Bush's
rating on that measure now. Six in 10 said Gore has made it clear
what he would do as president, while half said that of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Three quarters in that poll said Gore would ensure that the
economy remains strong, while six in 10 said that of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The boost in poll numbers following a convention can evaporate
as quickly as it appears and some political pollsters said this
particular round of weekend surveys can be Democrat-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS poll of 956 registered voters was taken Friday through
Sunday and has an error margin of 3 percentage points. The CNN-USA
Today-Gallup poll of 697 likely voters was taken Friday and
Saturday and has an error margin of 4 percentage points. The
ABC-Washington Post poll of 896 registered voters taken Friday
through Sunday has an error margin of 3.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Spraying for West Nile delayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Three upstate counties delayed Round Two of
spraying for mosquitoes infected with the West Nile virus Monday,
citing cool temperatures and predictions of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Nighttime temperatures here have dipped below 50 degrees,
lessening mosquito activity and therefore the likelihood of
mosquitoes being killed by the spraying.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials in Albany, Rensselaer and Schenectady counties
had planned a second spraying of the insecticide Anvil for
Wednesday. The first round was completed on Aug. 11 and 12. The
spraying is aimed to cover a two-mile radius of where an infected
baby crow was found on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the New York State Department of Health reported
that a crow found dead on a city of Albany street tested positive
for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was likely mosquitoes fed on the bird in
Albany, but that it was also possible the bird contracted the
disease elsewhere then flew into Albany.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the virus have been found in either dead birds or
mosquitoes in 21 counties across the state and in three boroughs of
New York City.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Knuckleballer Steve Sparks won his fourth
straight start as Detroit beat the Oakland Athletics 3-1 Monday
night, the Tigers' sixth victory in their last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers won three of four from Oakland to move within five
games of the A's in the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks (4-2) allowed an unearned run on four hits with a
season-high seven strikeouts and no walks in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who pitched his first career shutout in his last start
Aug. 15 at Seattle, has not allowed an earned run in his last 20
2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his AL-leading 35th save in 37
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mulder (7-9) fell to 1-8 in his last 10 starts, allowing
three runs on six hits in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder, who played at Michigan State, is 2-7 in 12 road starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers broke a 1-1 tie with three straight two-out hits in
the sixth, including an RBI double from Deivi Cruz and Brad Ausmus'
run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer flared a two-out RBI single to give Detroit a 1-0
lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chavez's third-inning single was the only hit off Sparks
until Chavez hit a leadoff double in the sixth and scored from
third when Terrence Long grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unearned run because Chavez had advanced when Frank
Menechino struck out but reached on a passed ball by Ausmus.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sparks has an AL-beat 1.50 ERA in August. ... Mulder's road
ERA is 7.35. He entered with an AL-worst 7.59. ... Cruz has five
doubles in his last three games. ... The A's are 18-19 since the
All-Star break and just 7-18 in their last 25 road games. They
ended a seven-game road losing streak Sunday with their lone win in
Detroit.

McCain's Cancer Didn't Spread
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The office of Senator John McCain announced today that tests
on lymph nodes and tissue removed during the skin cancer surgery confirmed that
his skin cancer didn't spread. The former GOP presidential candidate underwent
more than five hours of surgery on Saturday to remove melanoma, the most
dangerous form of skin cancer, from his temple and upper arm. Pathologists
completed the final review of the tissues around the cancers and found no sign
the melanoma had spread, said Todd Harris, a McCain spokesman.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Divers announced Monday that none of the 118 sailors aboard a
sunken Russian submarine could have survived, ending a desperate hunt for
survivors. Norwegian divers who finally opened the escape hatch and forced their
way into the hull of the Kursk after working in the Arctic depths for more than
24 hours said the submarine was completely flooded. There was no sign that any
of the crew had survived for long inside the mangled warship 350 feet below the
surface.

Colombia Rebels: No Clinton Attacks

   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels who oppose growing
U.S. ties to Colombia's military promised today not to stage attacks to disrupt
President Clinton's upcoming visit to the South American country. ''We will not
impede (the Aug. 30 visit) with guerrilla actions,'' Andres Paris, a commander
and spokesman of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia told The Associated
Press in an interview in this southern ranching town. But the insurgents known
as FARC are ''calling on the Colombian people -- the labor unions, student
groups, organizations of the unemployed and others -- to protest Clinton's
visit,'' Paris added.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to a summer travel season marred by thousands

formation of a task force to monitor airline service. Slater acted after
summoning airline industry leaders to a meeting that he said was ''a necessary
first step in resolving some of the challenges'' faced by the industry. Some 670
million Americans will fly this year, up 20 million from a year ago and an
increase that is taxing the system and could not have been foreseen, Slater
said.

of 6.5 million Firestone tires. The plants in St. Paul, Minn.; Edison, N.J.; and
Hazelwood, Mo., will close from Aug. 28 to Sept. 8 so that 15-inch tires used in
production of Ford Explorer/Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicles and Ford
Ranger pickups can be sent to Ford and Lincoln/Mercury dealers. The plants
employ about 6,000 workers, who will still get paid.

<HEADLINE> Boy Inspires Vancouver Players  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Jay Ponciano pitched a two-hitter, and
Dustin Corl hit a two-run homer as Vancouver, Wash., beat Bellaire,
Texas, 5-0 in the Little League World Series on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano was dominating, striking out seven while walking one,
and never allowing a runner past second base.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Evans had two hits and scored twice in Vancouver's
Series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Atherton and Drew Zizinia had the lone hits -- both singles
-- for Bellaire (1-1), coming off Sunday's 3-0 victory over
Goffstown, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire pitcher Michael Johnson was charged with three runs on
four hits over five-plus innings. Bellaire has one pool game
remaining, Tuesday against Davenport, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver struck first with two runs in the third when Evans got
on with a one-out single, and Corl followed with a home run that
just cleared the left-center field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver broke the game open with a three-run fifth. Evans led
things off with a double and came home from third -- just beating
shortstop Zach Jamail's throw to the plate -- on Josh Hash's
grounder. Hash made it 4-0, scoring on Alex Gordon's RBI single,
and Greg Peavey scored on Jesse McLean's groundout to short.
</P>
<P>
   Evans had a strong game at shortstop as well, showing his range
and strong arm with a hand in six outs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Julian Vandervelde's two-run homer keyed Davenport to a
5-0 victory over winless Goffstown. Ruben Mavarez pitched a
two-hitter as Maracaibo, Venezuela, evened its record at 1-1 with a
3-0 win over Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. And Tokyo improved to 2-0 -- and
all but mathematically clinched a spot in the pool final -- by
hanging on for a 9-8 victory over Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Vandervelde, 6-foot-2 and 231 pounds, carried a big bat for
Davenport, which marked the U.S. Central region's first Series win
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 1-0, the first baseman slammed a two-run, 239-foot shot
off the hedges beyond the center-field wall in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We grow them big,'' Davenport manager Matt Kolar said. ''I
don't know how many teams have one guy that can put the ball out of
the park every other time up if you're not careful. And that's big
because runs are hard to come by.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport added two more runs in the fifth, while starter Dan
O'Donnell -- 10-0 in All-Star play -- went the distance, throwing a
two-hitter and striking out seven. Michael Mitchell had a hit and
scored three runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was going to hit the fence when it first went off
the bat, because I usually don't hit line drives all that far,''
said Vandervelde, who failed to hit a homer in seven regional
tournament games. ''But yeah, I'm glad it went anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Sunday's 3-0 loss to Bellaire, Goffstown has managed
just three hits in the Series.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the best pitchers in the country and we're having a
hard with the mixing (of pitches),'' Goffstown manager Frank
Szumiesz said. ''We've just got to refocus.''
</P>
<P>
   Maracaibo may have won, but manager Eduvino Quevedo wasn't
pleased with his team's sputtering offense.
</P>
<P>
   In two games, the Venezuelans have stranded 14 runners.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're expecting a better pace out of themselves on the
offensive side,'' Quevedo said through interpreter Micah Hughes.
''It's his bats, he doesn't know, he's trying to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Figueroa had two hits and drove in a run, while Mavarez had
a hit and RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Hecht doubled and Chris Griffith singled for Dhahran,
playing its Series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Riley Arp allowed eight hits, but was undone by two
errors that led to Maracaibo's three-run second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dhahran manager Al Griffith blamed ''butterflies'' on his team's
early miscues.
</P>
<P>
   The day's first game was the most exciting as Toronto's six-run,
sixth-inning rally -- capped by Julian Olibera's two-out, three-run
homer -- fell one run short against Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Daiki Ichimura, the second reliever of the inning, got Ozzie
Diaz to pop out to second baseman Yuusaku Nakanishi to end the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, Toronto manager David Trimble was bolstered by
the way his team didn't give up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me put it this way. We'd love to have a shot at Japan
again in the playoff game,'' Trimble said, referring to Thursday's
International Pool final.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo starter Kazuma Yamada threw a three-hitter, smacked two
home runs and drove in six runs, giving him a Series-high eight
RBIs in two games.

<HEADLINE> Florida 'Stiltsville' Still Stands  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The group of aging houses propped on poles inside
Biscayne National Park known as Stiltsville will be allowed to
stand, but homeowners' leases will not be renewed, National Park
Service officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Stiltsville won't be torn down Dec. 1, as feared by homeowners
who've been fighting to preserve the seven structures built over
the water a few miles south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But under the plan, the Park Service will not rebuild the homes
if they are destroyed or severely damaged during a storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure that those structures are used for the
public,'' said Linda Canzanelli, Biscayne National Park
superintendent. ''We want to make sure that those are safe ... for
folks to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiltsville dates to the 1920s and 1930s, when fishermen built
shacks in the area. By the 1940s, homes were being built, mostly
used for retreats and parties.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, Stiltsville boasted 25 homes, as high as 50 feet
above Biscayne Bay. Hurricanes and fires have taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
   Duff Matson, who co-owns a Stiltsville home, said the plan would
not ensure homes would be preserved and questioned Biscayne
National Park's ability maintain the structures.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've gotta have blood, sweat and tears to keep maintaining
them, and money,'' Matson said. ''So they're going to
disintegrate''
</P>
<P>
   Government engineers will examine the homes to determine how
structurally sound they are, and any found to be unsound may be
taken down or mothballed, preserved for people to see but not
inhabit, Canzanelli said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a ruse for the total destruction of the houses,'' Matson
said. ''Some will be called engineering unsound ... So they'll
remove it, and that's how they'll be discarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiltsville homeowners have been trying to reach an agreement
that will preserve the homes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service owns the area underneath the
structures. The homeowners' lease with the government, signed
almost 30 years ago, had been set to expire Dec. 1, 1999 and
Biscayne National Park had planned to reclaim the houses and
destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   In November, homeowners and National Park Service officials
agreed to give themselves a year to negotiate a resolution.

<HEADLINE> Source: Dolphins RB Faces Suspension  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Dolphins running back J.J. Johnson faces a
suspension for the first four regular-season games for violating
the NFL's steroid policy, unless the ruling is overturned on
appeal, a football source familiar with the case said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the appeal by the commissioner's office is
expected before the season begins Sept. 3, said the source, who did
not want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The league and the Dolphins declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, was at Miami's game against
Green Bay on Monday night but refused to comment on the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has a no-tolerance policy regarding steroid use, which
means Johnson would be suspended even for his first offense.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 26, was expected to start the Dolphins' opener against
Seattle. He started four games as a rookie last year and led the
team with 558 yards rushing in 164 carries with four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension doesn't include exhibition games. Johnson sat out
the first half against the Packers, but entered the game with about
four minutes to play in the third quarter.

<HEADLINE> More Help Needed in Western Fires  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN GALLAGHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Fire crews called in more reinforcements
Monday as they tried to overcome a chronic shortage of help in
battling fires that continue to run rampant in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of firefighters are already working to slow down
blazes that have scorched more than 5 million acres this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the help hasn't been enough in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are fires we only monitor because we don't have people''
to fight them, said J.D. Coleman, fire information officer at the
Northern Rockies Coordination Center in Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   The National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho said an Army
battalion from Kentucky would be sent to Montana late this week and
Marines from North Carolina would follow within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a way to provide some manpower when it's badly needed,''
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of state and federal agencies recommended
Monday that a 16-county section of central Montana, from Wyoming to
the Canadian border, be closed to all public use, such as camping,
hiking and fishing. Residents would not be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation is based on extreme fire danger in the area,
the threat to public safety and the lack of resources to fight
fires, said Ed Mathews, fire management officer for the state
Department of Natural Resources and Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Marc Racicot said his decision on whether to accept the
recommendation could come as early as Tuesday. The governor last
week shut access to state and private land in nine western Montana
counties.
</P>
<P>
   The National Interagency Fire Center said 87 fires were burning
on 1.3 million acres Monday. More than 700 firefighters are toiling
between Helena and Bozeman on a fire that has wiped out 75,000
acres, destroyed buildings and left ranchers wondering whether
their cattle survived.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have livestock wandering throughout the fire,'' said
Graver Johnson, fire information officer at the Gallatin County
emergency operations center. ''We're trying to help the ranchers
find and relocate them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, the south entrance to Yellowstone National Park
reopened Monday after being closed since Thursday by a nearby
wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho, the nation's largest wildfire continued to devour the
Salmon-Challis National Forest. The fire had consumed about 159,000
acres and was about one-third contained. Almost 1,600 people were
assigned to fight the blaze, as well as 16 helicopters and 58 fire
engines.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,900 people were assigned to Idaho fires that have cost
almost $58 million to fight and consumed nearly 1 million acres
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Officials continued to fight a fire that had forced evacuation
of the tiny mountain town of Atlanta. Most residents were back in
their homes Monday after cooler, calmer weather during the weekend
let fire officials beat back the flames. Still, the fire was only
10 percent contained.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could see the effects of this fire for years to come,''
said state Bureau of Disaster Services Director John Cline. ''The
end result could be mudslides this spring, or it could have an
impact on rivers and streams.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have guided a small orphaned bear cub to safety that
had all four paws burned in a forest. Wildlife officer Joe Jaquith
put the cub into a cage at a veterinary clinic and drove the bear
to be taken to a state shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave him an apple and a drink of water before we started,''
Jaquith said as he drove. ''He's doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaquith, who rescued the animal Saturday, suspects fire killed
the mother. The rescue rekindled the story of Smokey Bear and the
cub who symbolized the fire-prevention mascot after being plucked
from a fire in New Mexico 50 years ago.

	   SCHAGHTICOKE, N.Y. (AP) - Police Monday recovered the body of a
19-year-old Schaghticoke man who fell into the Hoosick River Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Larry Chuba of Melrose was walking along a log when
he slipped and fell five feet into the river's fast moving waters.

Several attempts to reach Chuba with wood branches failed and his

   Fifteen divers searched the river for four hours and a

Sunday before calling off the search at nightfall.

<HEADLINE> Liberty 81, Rockers 67  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tari Phillips and Crystal Robinson combined for
18 points during an early 30-2 run as the New York Liberty beat the
Cleveland Rockers 81-67 on Monday night to advance to the WNBA
finals for the third time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty will face the Houston Comets, the only champion in
the league's four-year history. Houston beat New York in the
one-game final in 1997 and again last year in the last game of a
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The best-of-three series opens Thursday night at Madison Square
Garden, where the Liberty have won 13 straight games. Game 2 and
Game 3, if necessary, will be played in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After New York's Becky Hammon and Cleveland's Suzie McConnell
Serio traded 3-pointers to open the scoring, Phillips scored 10
points and Robinson added eight as the Liberty shot out to a 33-5
lead with 8:57 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Tamika Whitmore scored a game-high 19 points to lead New York.
Vickie Johnson added 14 points and 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell Serio had 13 points in her final game. The 34-year-old
mother of four announced that she would retire following the
season. She left with 1:10 remaining and received hugs from her
coaches and teammates as the crowd gave her a large ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Merlakia Jones also had 13 points for the Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   Chasity Melvin, Cleveland's third-leading scorer in the
playoffs, picked up four fouls in the first eight minutes and only
had three points.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which won the opener of the Eastern Conference finals
at home, rallied for the second straight game but again couldn't
overcome a big deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers trailed 46-27 at halftime and scored the first six
points of the second half to get within 46-33 with 17:04 left. But
Whitmore and Johnson had four points each during a 10-0 run as New
York extended the lead to 56-33 at 14:12.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell Serio hit a 3-pointer with 5:42 left to make it 67-52
and start another Cleveland run. Rushia Brown followed with a layup
and McConnell Serio made another jumper to cut it to 67-56 with
5:07 left.
</P>
<P>
   After Whitmore bulled inside for the Liberty, McConnell Serio
hit another 3-pointer to make it 69-59 with 2:59 left. Hammon
scored six points in the final three minutes as New York closed out
the victory, punctuated by confetti and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty used a 19-0 first-half spurt Sunday to grab a 24-7
lead, before holding on to win 51-46.

<HEADLINE> Charge Reduction for DNC Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN SANTOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The city attorney's office agreed Monday to
reduce misdemeanor charges against scores of people arrested during
last week's street protests outside the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the 52 protesters will plead no contest to the
reduced charges Tuesday, clearing the way for their release. A
hunger strike by 45 of them will continue until then, their
supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators called the agreement a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows the power of collective action, what you can
actually do when you stick together,'' said Lisa Fithian of Direct
Action Network, an umbrella organization for protest groups.
</P>
<P>
   City attorney's officials agreed to reduce charges because the
demonstrators already have spent more than enough time behind bars,
spokesman Mike Qualls said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had already served sentences far beyond what we would
have been asking for had we proceeded with our prosecutions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were expected to be released Monday, but
sheriff's officials could not verify their identifications before
courts closed in the afternoon. Most were being held because they
refused to give their names until they could negotiate reduced
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California filed a federal lawsuit charging that police targeted
members of the media in their attempts to control demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   All the incidents referenced in the lawsuit revolve around
police actions to disperse a crowd of several thousand people who
gathered for a free concert Aug. 14, the convention's opening
night.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five plaintiffs are free-lance photographers or
television cameramen who claim they were struck by rubber bullets

<P>
   ''The bullets and batons that struck these journalists were not
simply aimed at them,'' said Ramona Ripston, executive director of
the ACLU chapter. ''They were aimed at our basic rights to a free
press and to the oversight which it can, at its best, provide over
our public institutions, such as the police department.''
</P>

   During a morning radio show Monday, police Chief Bernard C.
Parks defended officers' actions, adding they did not target

<HEADLINE> City To Reduce DNC Protest Charges  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN SANTOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The city attorney's office agreed Monday to
reduce misdemeanor charges against scores of people arrested during
last week's street protests outside the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the 52 protesters will plead no contest to the
reduced charges Tuesday, clearing the way for their release. A
hunger strike by 45 of them will continue until then, their
supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators called the agreement a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows the power of collective action, what you can
actually do when you stick together,'' said Lisa Fithian of Direct
Action Network, an umbrella organization for protest groups.
</P>
<P>
   City attorney's officials agreed to reduce charges because the
demonstrators already have spent more than enough time behind bars,
spokesman Mike Qualls said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had already served sentences far beyond what we would
have been asking for had we proceeded with our prosecutions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were expected to be released Monday, but
sheriff's officials could not verify their identifications before
courts closed in the afternoon. Most were being held because they
refused to give their names until they could negotiate reduced
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California filed a federal lawsuit charging that police targeted
members of the media in their attempts to control demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   All the incidents referenced in the lawsuit revolve around
police actions to disperse a crowd of several thousand people who
gathered for a free concert Aug. 14, the convention's opening
night.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five plaintiffs are free-lance photographers or
television cameramen who claim they were struck by rubber bullets
or batons in the chaotic attempt to move protesters away from the
downtown Staples Center. The fifth was well-known consumer advocate
David Horowitz, who said officers knocked him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bullets and batons that struck these journalists were not
simply aimed at them,'' said Ramona Ripston, executive director of
the ACLU chapter. ''They were aimed at our basic rights to a free
press and to the oversight which it can, at its best, provide over
our public institutions, such as the police department.''

<HEADLINE> Reds 7, Phillies 4  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Dmitri Young hit an upper-deck grand slam and
Barry Larkin got his 2,000th hit in the same inning Monday night as
the Cincinnati Reds beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Young's first career slam highlighted a six-run third inning off
Randy Wolf (9-7) that sent the Reds to only their second victory in
seven games. Chris Stynes had four hits and scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Perez had three doubles and drove in three runs for the
Phillies, who lost for the seventh time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati had two franchise moments as it batted around in the
third for a 7-1 lead. Larkin, the team captain, lined a run-scoring
double to left for his 2,000th hit, then stood at second and waved
as the crowd of 21,558 gave a standing ovation and chanted his
first name.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin became the first major league shortstop to have at least
2,000 hits, 170 homers and 350 stolen bases. He's the fourth player
with 2,000 hits for Cincinnati, joining Pete Rose (3,358), Dave
Concepcion (2,326) and Johnny Bench (2,048).
</P>
<P>
   After Wolf hit Ken Griffey Jr. on the arm with a pitch and
walked Dante Bichette, Young hit the first pitch into the first row
of the upper deck in left -- the 34th red-seat homer in the
stadium's 30-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The only other red-seat slam by a Reds player was the first ever
hit into the upper deck -- by Tony Perez on Aug. 11, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Young also had a single and a double in a free-swinging
performance, hitting the first pitch in each of his first three
at-bats. He got an intentional walk in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf gave up seven runs and seven hits in three innings,
matching the shortest start of his career. He lasted only three
innings in a 10-2 loss at Houston on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   In his last three starts, Wolf has given up 21 runs in 15 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Harnisch (5-6) struggled despite the big lead, giving up
nine hits and four walks in 5 1-3 innings. Angry after giving up
consecutive walks to load the bases in the sixth, Harnisch walked
to the dugout at a fast clip after he was replaced and slammed his
glove and hat against the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Perez had run-scoring doubles in the second and sixth off
Harnisch and drove in another run by hitting into a forceout in the
fourth. He doubled again in the eighth, but Danny Graves relieved
and got four outs for his 21st save in 24 chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bobby Abreu, who batted leadoff for the first time in his
career Sunday and went 2-for-3, hit leadoff again Monday and went
1-for-3 with a pair of walks. ... Scott Rolen singled in the fifth,
ending an 0-for-17 slump. ... Griffey and Phillies Doug Glanville,
Mike Lieberthal and Pat Burrell were on the field early to film a
segment for a movie tentatively called ''Summer Catch.'' It's about
a pitcher who makes it to the big leagues and gives up a homer to
Griffey in his first appearance. ... Harnisch threw the Reds' 82nd
wild pitch of the season, one shy of the club record. ... Young's
upper-deck homer was the first by a Red this season and the fourth
overall. Mark McGwire, Preston Wilson and Moises Alou also have
reached the red seats. ... Griffey went 2-for-4, extending his
hitting streak to seven games and raising his average to a
season-high .257.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks' Durazo Faces Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona first baseman Erubiel Durazo could be
facing a second operation on his sore right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, who went on the disabled list for the third time this
season because of soreness in the wrist on Sunday, had an MRI exam
on Monday. Afterward, Diamondbacks team doctors were
uncharacteristically mum on the results.
</P>
<P>
   ''Erubiel Durazo is having recurrent problems with his right
wrist that was operated on earlier this season,'' Dr. Don Sheridan
said. ''At the present time Erubiel is weighing his options. We
should have more information in the next day or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan said Durazo asked that no further information be
released at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to leave it at that at this point so Erubiel can
discuss this with his family,'' Sheridan said. ''He's a team
player. He wants to do what's best for his team and at this time
he's considering all the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The options could include undergoing surgery now, and likely
being lost for the season, or putting off the surgery until after
this season and trying to play through it in Arizona's drive for
the playoffs in September.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo was on the disabled list from May 30 to June 23 while
recovering from surgery to repair torn cartilage in the wrist. Just
four days later, on June 27, he went on the DL again with wrist
pain. He was activated July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo said he aggravated the wrist injury when he fouled off a
pitch in his final at-bat in Saturday night's 11-3 victory over the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo was one of baseball's big surprises as a rookie in 1999,
working his way up to the majors quickly from Double-A El Paso. In
52 games with Arizona last season, Durazo batted .329 with 11 home
runs and 30 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's hitting .265 in 67 games with eight home runs
and 33 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   After a 5-for-20 road trip, Durazo was sent to Tucson for nine
games earlier this month to work on his swing. He was recalled Aug.
11, and was 2-for-4 Saturday night in just his third start since
rejoining the Diamondbacks.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo 9, Toronto 8  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Jay Ponciano pitched a two-hitter and
Dustin Corl hit a two-run homer as Vancouver beat Bellaire, Texas,
5-0 in the Little League World Series on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Having already made their statement by beating the California
powerhouses in the Western Regional, Vancouver -- playing its Series
opener -- wasn't about to be rattled playing on a national stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing in the Western Regional championship game, I got used
to (the pressure),'' said Ponciano, who struck out seven, walked
one, and never allowed a runner past second base. ''I just have to
do it. It's my job and I got to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Evans had two hits and scored twice for Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Atherton and Drew Zizinia had the lone hits -- both singles
-- for Bellaire (1-1), coming off a 3-0 victory over Goffstown,
N.H., on Sunday. Bellaire has one pool game remaining, Tuesday
against Davenport, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We actually thought we had an advantage going in having played
last night and they haven't played,'' Bellaire manager Terry McConn
said. ''But hats off to them, they're a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Late starts are nothing new for Vancouver, said manager Tom
Peavey.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Western Regionals, we were the last team to arrive. It
took us 28 hours to get there, so these kids are used to being
late,'' Peavey said.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver struck first with two runs in the third when Evans got
on with a one-out single, and Corl followed with a home run that
just cleared the left-center field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Corl said he was giving his home-run ball to ''T.J.,'' Tyler
Jacobs, a 6-year-old who underwent surgery in mid-June to remove a
benign brain tumor, who has become the team's inspirational leader.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver broke the game open with a three-run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Julian Vandervelde's two-run homer keyed Davenport to a
5-0 victory over winless Goffstown. Ruben Mavarez pitched a
two-hitter as Maracaibo, Venezuela, evened its record at 1-1 with a
3-0 win over Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. And Tokyo improved to 2-0 -- and
all but mathematically clinched a spot in the pool final -- by
hanging on for a 9-8 victory over Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Vandervelde, 6-foot-2 and 231 pounds, carried a big bat for
Davenport, which marked the U.S. Central region's first Series win
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 1-0, the first baseman slammed a two-run, 239-foot shot
off the hedges beyond the center-field wall in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We grow them big,'' Davenport manager Matt Kolar said. ''I
don't know how many teams have one guy that can put the ball out of
the park every other time up if you're not careful. And that's big
because runs are hard to come by.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Dan O'Donnell -- 10-0 in All-Star play -- went the
distance, throwing a two-hitter and striking out seven. Michael
Mitchell had a hit and scored three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Including Sunday's 3-0 loss to Bellaire, Goffstown has managed
just three hits in the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Maracaibo may have won, but manager Eduvino Quevedo wasn't
pleased with his team's sputtering offense.
</P>
<P>
   In two games, the Venezuelans have stranded 14 runners.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're expecting a better pace out of themselves on the
offensive side,'' Quevedo said through interpreter Micah Hughes.
''It's his bats, he doesn't know, he's trying to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Figueroa had two hits and drove in a run, while Mavarez had
a hit and RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Hecht doubled and Chris Griffith singled for Dhahran,
playing its Series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Riley Arp allowed eight hits, but was undone by two
errors that led to Maracaibo's three-run second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dhahran manager Al Griffith blamed ''butterflies'' on his team's
early miscues.
</P>
<P>
   The day's first game was the most exciting as Toronto's six-run,
sixth-inning rally -- capped by Julian Olibera's two-out, three-run
homer -- fell one run short against Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Daiki Ichimura, the second reliever of the inning, got Ozzie
Diaz to pop out to second baseman Yuusaku Nakanishi to end the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, Toronto manager David Trimble was bolstered by
the way his team didn't give up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me put it this way. We'd love to have a shot at Japan
again in the playoff game,'' Trimble said, referring to Thursday's
International Pool final.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo starter Kazuma Yamada threw a three-hitter, smacked two
home runs and drove in six runs, giving him a Series-high eight
RBIs in two games.

<HEADLINE> Bucs Release Brad Culpepper  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Defensive tackle Brad Culpepper was among 12
players released Monday night by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, clearing
the way for second-year pro Anthony McFarland to move into the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper, entering his sixth season with the Bucs, started 61
games over the past four years and in 1998 he led one of the
league's top defenses in sacks with nine. He's fourth on the club's
career sack list with 33.
</P>
<P>
   The decision caught the ninth-year pro by surprise. He received
a call from the team as he and his wife were headed to dinner about
9 p.m., and drove to the team's training complex instead.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland, a No. 1 pick who played sparingly as a rookie in
1999, will take over Culpepper's spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''They feel he's ready to play and they don't really see me in a
backup role,'' Culpepper said, adding that ''time will tell'' if
the Bucs made the correct decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe I'm a starter in this league, and I feel I have the
film to prove it,'' he said. ''By no means is my football career
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven other players were also waived as the roster was trimmed
to 72, including seven NFL Europe exemptions who don't count toward
the league-mandated limit of 65. The biggest name was third-string
quarterback Scott Milanovich.
</P>
<P>
   Also released were center Eric DeGroh, receivers Tavarus Hogans
and Michael Williams, defensive linemen Aaron Humphrey and Damonte
McKenzie, linebackers Antony Jordan and Kinnon Tatum, cornerback
Terrance Parrish, fullback John Waerig and punter John Shay.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tony Dungy was not available for comment after Culpepper's
release. However, the team issued a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brad has been a real good player for us for a number of years,
and this was a very difficult decision,'' Dungy said. ''We wanted
to do this now to give Brad every opportunity to hook on with
another football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Dungy talked about how painful the cut process
can be.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the same, year in and year out. You get close to guys.
Guys come in, especially the way we do it now, you get guys who
sign with you in February and March and they've been here all
summer and spring, worked hard and done everything you've asked,''
Dungy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no easy way to tell someone you're fired. In normal
(employment) situations, you don't say I'm going to fire 20 guys
this week and fire 15 guys next week and know that it's coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Milanovich, who spent parts of four seasons with the Bucs, was
re-signed late last season after Trent Dilfer was injured. He was
3-of-8 for 9 yards and was intercepted once this preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't totally unexpected,'' said Milanovich, who has
thrown three regular season passes during his career. ''I've been
around long enough to know how things work. So I was prepared for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Milanovich's release improved the chances that rookie Joe
Hamilton, a seventh-round draft pick from Georgia Tech, will make
the team as the third quarterback behind Shaun King and Eric Zeier.
Although Milanovich plans to move to New York and complete work on
his college degree, there's still a chance he could wind up with
the Bucs if one of the club's quarterbacks is injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were some things to that effect said,'' Milanovich said.
''But you just have to kind of wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts didn't include any safeties, a position depleted by
injuries during training camp. With Shevin Smith dislocating his
left big toe during Sunday's 31-21 victory over New England, the
team is down to just four healthy safeties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shevin is going to be out quite a while. He's got a turf toe
with some ligament damage in there, and it's going to be an
indefinite period of time for him,'' Dungy said, adding that it's
too soon to tell if the third-year pro could wind up on injured
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have to wait and see,'' he added. ''But, its not going
to be a one- or two-week deal.''

<HEADLINE> Astros 5, Cubs 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Scott Elarton won his fifth straight decision and
reliever Joe Slusarski escaped a bases-loaded jam in the ninth
inning Monday night to give the Houston Astros a 5-4 win over the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 43rd home run for the
Cubs, connecting for the fifth time in four games. Chicago lost its
season-high sixth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton (14-4) allowed three runs and eight hits in eight
innings and left with a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Dotel took over to start the ninth and walked the bases
loaded with no outs. Slusarski got Ricky Gutierrez to ground into a
double play, with one run scoring, and retired Mark Grace on a fly
ball to earn his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo hit his 32nd homer for Houston. Tony Eusebio
extended his hitting streak to 20 games with a third-inning single.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton hasn't lost since July 21 against St. Louis. Since then,
he is 5-0 with a 3.10 ERA in six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Tapani (8-10) gave up five runs on six hits in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs went ahead 2-0 in the fourth when Damon Buford doubled
and Willie Greene homered. Greene became the first Chicago player
to homer other than Sammy Sosa since Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Lugo led off the bottom half with a double and scored on
Tim Bogar's single. One out later, Hidalgo homered.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit a solo homer in the fifth that made it 3-all.
</P>
<P>
   Astros scored twice in the sixth on Hidalgo's sacrifice fly and
Moises Alou's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jeff Bagwell's hitting streak ended at 18 games. He went
0-for-3 with a walk. ... The Cubs' losing streak is their longest
since a six-game skid last Sept. 7-12. ... Greene's home run was
his first since June 16. ... Alou is hitting .439 (18-for-41) in
his last 11 games.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Debby approaches Leeward Islands  </HEADLINE>
By MARVIN HOKSTAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) - Speeding west at near hurricane
strength, Tropical Storm Debby threatened several northeast
Caribbean islands still recovering from last year's storm damage.
</P>
<P>
   Schools closed, people rushed to buy emergency supplies and
governments prepared shelters. Tourists crowded airports to flee
the storm and airlines began canceling flights. Cruise ships turned
away from the winds and rain.
</P>
<P>
   Ten ships and two submarines in the USS Harry Truman battle
group abandoned training exercises off Vieques island and moved 300
miles south of Puerto Rico, the Navy said. Vieques is the site of
recurrent protests over military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth named storm of the Atlantic season emerged with
unnerving suddenness as the season's first threat to land.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m. EDT, Debby was centered about 115 miles east-southeast
of Antigua, heading for French, Dutch and British islands overnight
and expected to continue onto the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto
Rico Tuesday and then the Dominican Republic. Forecasters said it
was too early to say whether the storm could threaten the U.S.
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Debby seemingly came out of nowhere Saturday and reached
near-hurricane strength in little more than a day. Its sustained
winds reached nearly 70 miles per hour late morning Monday, just
shy of the 74 miles per hour to be classified as a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Debby was churning west at about 22 mph, especially fast for
such a storm, and was expected to intensify and keep on the same
track for the next three days. The weather service said winds were
expected to reach about 86 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings were posted from the French island of
Guadeloupe north through the island chain including Dutch St.
Maarten, Saba, and St. Eustatius, through the British and U.S.
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The Dominican Republic went on
storm watch Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Debby could be a hurricane by the time it hits Guadeloupe and
the Caribbean's easternmost islands around 10 p.m. Monday, said
forecaster Henry Laskosky at the National Weather Service office in
San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   In volcano-plagued Montserrat, British Gov. Anthony Abbott
warned in a radio broadcast that ''There's a possibility that Debby
could pass right over Montserrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Stormy weather likely would cause mudflows of volcanic debris
down the Belham River, the Montserrat Volcano Observatory warned,
though that area has been in the restricted danger zone.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists in Antigua warned their residents to prepare for
a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity on some parts of Antigua went out, apparently turned
off to avoid storm damage. Motorists lined up for gas, and
emergency specialists warned people living in roofless homes
unrepaired since last year's hurricanes to get ready to head to
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   A flight by a hurricane hunter airplane Monday morning showed
Debby was outpacing even the experts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's moving faster and it's also more intense than we had
thought,'' Laskosky said.
</P>
<P>
   In the twin-island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, Debby
threatened to soak Carifesta, a 35-nation arts and music festival
that began Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Report: Hurricanes' Tyler Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Miami forward Elton Tyler has been
suspended for the fall semester for academic reasons and will miss
at least six games, according to The Palm Beach Post.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler, one of two starters returning from the team that reached
the regional semifinals of the NCAA tournament last season, will
not be eligible to play until at least mid-December, the newspaper
reported in Tuesday's editions, citing unnamed school sources.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler could become eligible for the Hurricanes' Dec. 16 game
against Nebraska in the Orange Bowl Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper was unable to reach Tyler on Monday, but said his
mother, Eleanor Tyler of Dorchester, Mass., was unaware of any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spoke to him yesterday on the telephone and he didn't say
anything about that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper did not have details of the academic violation,
but said it preceded Perry Clark's hiring as coach July 6. Clark
replaced Leonard Hamilton, who became coach of the NBA's Washington
Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was traveling Monday and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-9 Tyler averaged 10.1 points and 5.5 rebounds last
season, when the Hurricanes finished 23-11 and won the Big East
Conference regular-season championship. He led the Hurricanes in
shooting at 51.2 percent and in blocked shots with 34.
</P>
<P>
   The school's sports information director did not immediately
return calls to his home Monday night.

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Tests on lymph nodes and tissue removed during Sen. John
McCain's skin cancer surgery confirmed that his skin cancer didn't spread, his
office announced today as McCain went home from the hospital. The former GOP
presidential candidate underwent more than five hours of surgery on Saturday to
remove melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, from his temple and
upper arm. Todd Harris, a McCain spokesman, said pathologists completed the

<HEADLINE> L.A. To Reduce DNC Protest Charges  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN SANTOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The city attorney's office agreed Monday to
reduce misdemeanor charges against scores of people arrested during
last week's street protests outside the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the 52 protesters will plead no contest to the
reduced charges Tuesday, clearing the way for their release. A
hunger strike by 45 of them will continue until then, their
supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators called the agreement a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows the power of collective action, what you can
actually do when you stick together,'' said Lisa Fithian of Direct
Action Network, an umbrella organization for protest groups.
</P>
<P>
   City attorney's officials agreed to reduce charges because the
demonstrators already have spent more than enough time behind bars,
spokesman Mike Qualls said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had already served sentences far beyond what we would
have been asking for had we proceeded with our prosecutions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were expected to be released Monday, but
sheriff's officials could not verify their identifications before
courts closed in the afternoon. Most were being held because they
refused to give their names until they could negotiate reduced
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California filed a federal lawsuit charging that police targeted
members of the media in their attempts to control demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   All the incidents referenced in the lawsuit revolve around
police actions to disperse a crowd of several thousand people who
gathered for a free concert Aug. 14, the convention's opening
night.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five plaintiffs are free-lance photographers or
television cameramen who claim they were struck by rubber bullets
or batons in the chaotic attempt to move protesters away from the
downtown Staples Center. The fifth was well-known consumer advocate
David Horowitz, who said officers knocked him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bullets and batons that struck these journalists were not
simply aimed at them,'' said Ramona Ripston, executive director of
the ACLU chapter. ''They were aimed at our basic rights to a free
press and to the oversight which it can, at its best, provide over
our public institutions, such as the police department.''
</P>
<P>
   During a morning radio show Monday, police Chief Bernard C.
Parks defended officers' actions, adding they did not target
reporters and photographers. He said many members of the media
unwittingly placed themselves in harm's way by getting between
police and protesters.

<HEADLINE> Brit News Crew Indicted in Liberia  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN PAYE-LAYLEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- A detained British television news crew
was indicted Monday on espionage charges in Liberia, with officials
saying they entered the country to produce a ''damaging and
injurious'' documentary about the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
   The four journalists from London-based Insight News Television --
two Britons, a South African and a Sierra Leonean -- stood silently
in a courtroom Monday in the capital Liberia as a sheriff read the
charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists, who were dressed in street clothes and were not
shackled, did not appear to have an attorney with them. A court
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he expected
their trial to begin Tuesday, though that could not be otherwise
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the charges, the group entered the country with
''criminal design'' and ''began to carry out interviews and filming
in the sensitive areas of the Republic of Liberia.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said the government believed the documentary
would try to support British and U.S. allegations that the Liberian
government has been smuggling out diamonds for rebels in
neighboring Sierra Leone, as well as smuggling weapons to them.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Charles Taylor, a former warlord
with longtime ties to the Sierra Leonean rebels, has denied acting
as a conduit for diamonds or guns.
</P>
<P>
   Insight News and Channel 4, the British network that
commissioned the documentary, said the four were bona fide
journalists with official permission to work.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 4 spokesman Matt Baker, speaking from London, identified
the four as Sierra Leonean journalist Sorious Samura; British
director David Barrie; British cameraman Tim Lambon, and South
African cameraman Gugu Radebe.
</P>
<P>
   Their arrest Friday at their hotel after nearly three weeks in
Liberia has been criticized by press freedom groups. The American
civil rights leader, Rev. Jesse Jackson, has appealed for their
release and former South African president Nelson Mandela said
Monday he planned to raise the matter with Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what punishment the journalists
could face if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Arms Smugglers Arrested in Peru  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's shadowy intelligence chief made a rare
public appearance Monday to announce the arrest of what the
government said was a group of international arms dealers selling
weapons to Colombian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a strong blow to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia,'' said Vladimiro Montesinos, who for 10 years has used
his position as head of the intelligence service to help President
Alberto Fujimori maintain his authoritarian grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have suffered a heavy strike in the chain of logistical
supply of arms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said the arms ring was uncovered by an intelligence
service investigation that began in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokeswoman said that a Russian and five Peruvians,
including at least one retired army officer, were arrested in
recent days in connection with the alleged arms smuggling. She said
three others escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said weapons were being flown from the Jordanian
capital, Amman. The shipments hop-scotched from the Canary Islands
to Guyana and finally to Peru's northern Amazon city of Iquitos,
passing over southern Colombia. Some 10,000 weapons were dropped by
parachute to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
Fujimori said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the first of three known flights occurred on March
17, 1999, when 2,500 rifles were dropped into FARC territory. A
scheduled fourth shipment was stymied by Peru's intelligence
service, Fujimori added.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, Police Gen. Tobias Duran Quintanilla said that the
FARC receives arms shipments from various points, including from
Ecuador, and the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. ''The entry of arms
to Colombia comes from different places and over different borders,
not only from Peru,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from FARC were not immediately available to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Fujimori has brought out Montesinos for a
speaking role during a press conference, though both men appeared
together last year in a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Fernando Rospigliosi questioned the timing
of Monday's press conference, calling it ploy to justify the role
of the intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Montesinos' dark reputation, Fujimori has defended their
close relationship. He said Monday that Montesinos' experience
fighting leftist rebels and narcotics trafficking made him
essential to Peru's national security.

<HEADLINE> Gore: It's Issues, Not Images  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUINCY, Ill. (AP) -- Flying high on their lift from the polls,
Democrats Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman dubbed themselves ''the
Dream Team'' on Monday and said their sometimes weighty talk of
policy was paying off.
</P>
<P>
   At a Mississippi riverside campaign stop, Gore even used a
somewhat wonkish speech on tax and health care policy as a rallying
cry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm giving you specifics before the election because I'm not
afraid for you to know the facts,'' the presidential nominee cried
out. ''Do you want specifics?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yea!'' replied the crowd of some 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Gore and Lieberman, a new campaign banner debuted: ''The
Dream Team -- Full Steam Ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also plans to begin airing new biographical
ads this week. The TV spots are set for many of the 17 states where
the Democratic National Committee has spent nearly $30 million on a
summer ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the pair and their wives disembarked from their
rented campaign boat, The Mark Twain, CBS News released poll
numbers to give the Democrats reason to beam. Consistent with other
national polls in the afterglow of last week's Democratic National
Convention, Gore picked up 10 points to tie the race, 43-42, with
Republican George W. Bush in a four-way matchup with Ralph Nader at
5 percent and Pat Buchanan at 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More dramatic, Gore's favorability rating shot up to 45 percent
-- even with Bush and at its highest level since campaign
fund-raising questions began to dog the Democrat in 1997. Earlier
this month, after the GOP convention, Gore was favorably viewed in
the CBS survey by just one-third of respondents compared with
Bush's 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates' popularity tends to spurt upward right after their
conventions, as Bush and Dick Cheney's did earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's Democratic focus was on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In an issue forum on The Mark Twain's upper deck, Gore and
Lieberman told two dozen area residents that targeted relief is the
fair way to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's $500-billion package over 10 years offers write-offs and
tax credits for child care, long term care, college tuition savings
and retirement investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to reduce income tax rates to a tune of $1 trillion
over 10 years. He also would double the $500 tax credit for each
child and increase other deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said the Republican proposal would primarily benefit
the very rich: ''Their plan gives most to people who need it least
and least to people who need it most.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who had just sworn off a campaign of ''sound bites and
P.R. and images,'' chuckled. ''That was a sound bite with
substance,'' he told his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said Gore was misleading
people about Bush's proposal. The Bush plan is ''much more fair''
because everyone would have lower taxes, Bartlett said. ''With the
Gore plan, you've got to jump through hoops to get targeted tax
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman wrapped the fourth and final day of their
400-mile tour of Mississippi River communities in a page of
Americana -- Mark Twain's boyhood home of Hannibal, Mo., where
children dressed as Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher played host at
the gate.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieberman spoke there, it began to rain and he said:
''Doesn't it say in the Bible that the words of God come down like
rain?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and wife Tipper have been so pleased with the image of this
trip that they were considering more politicking by boat. Aides
said husband and wife were also more likely now to campaign
together, instead of covering more ground separately as they did in
the primaries, because they saw these past days the benefit of
having Mrs. Gore around to keep her husband loose.
</P>
<P>
   Talking with reporters over a yogurt breakfast, Gore credited
his bump in polls to the policy detail he has added to his stump
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk I took to talk specifics has paid off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore, an accomplished debater, said he was eager to go
one-on-one with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested the Republican was trying to duck prime-time
exposure by proposing that their camps negotiate debates outside
the three televised forums already scheduled by the Commission on
Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ''wants to see if he can get away with some Sunday morning
talk show when nobody's watching much,'' Gore said. ''The American
people have a right in this day and time to be respected with an
adult, intelligent discussion of what the major issues are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer noted that during the 1996 campaign
President Clinton and Gore agreed to only two of the three debates
proposed by the debate commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the worst examples I've ever seen of Al Gore
saying one thing and doing another,'' Fleischer said. ''The last
major party candidate to stiff the commission was Al Gore and Bill
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman, scheduled for some time off at the end of
this week, were showing the strain of virtually nonstop campaigning
and late-night rallies where no outstretched hand went unshaken.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieberman joked, ''I realized I was coming to the edge the
other night when I started shaking hands with the Secret Service
agents.''

<P>
   TIERRA VERDE, Fla. (AP) -- John Lombard ''Jack'' Powell, a
three-time champion of the Southern Ocean Racing Conference and
designer of a sailboat that changed the face of the sport, died
Sunday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Powell revolutionized sailboat racing in 1961 with his design
for a lightweight fiberglass yawl, the Paper Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   He then won back-to-back Southern Ocean Racing Conference
championships in 1961 and 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, he was the driving force in bringing sailors from all

World Championships. Seven years later, he won the SORC for the
third time with the Salty Tiger, a boat he helped design with an
extruded aluminum hull.
</P>
<P>
   Powell also was a member of the Olympic Sailing Committee and a
founder of the World Ocean Racing Championship, which is now
sponsored by Yachting magazine.
Gustav Scholz:
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Gustav ''Bubi'' Scholz, one of Germany's boxing
stars, died Monday after years of declining health. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The former European light heavyweight champion, who had a career
record of 88-2-6, became a symbol of Germany's rise from the ruins
of World War II to many of his countrymen. His life outside the
ring constantly made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   He made his professional debut in 1948, and fought his way up to
a 1962 world title fight against Harold Johnson of the United
States. That earned the former newspaper boy a then-record sum for
a German fighter of $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Scholz narrowly lost on points in front of 64,000 spectators at
Olympiastadion.
</P>
<P>
   That fight made him a hero to many Germans, who also were
fascinated by his problems with alcohol abuse and battles to
overcome various setbacks, including tuberculosis and eye
operations.
</P>
<P>

   MIAMI (AP) -- Reporter Milt Sosin, who covered some of the most
important historical events of the 20th century and was still
scooping others on stories in his 90s, died Sunday. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Sosin covered Miami's federal courts for The Associated Press
for more than two decades after retiring from newspapers at 68. He
was still working as late as June.
</P>
<P>
   His career spanned 75 years, and he was the only U.S. reporter
to get a sit-down interview with Mafia financier Meyer Lansky -- and
Lansky called him. He got an exclusive with a vacationing Winston
Churchill, after skulking out his secret retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Sosin also interviewed a young Fidel Castro and served as a
correspondent in World War II in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He was there when John F. Kennedy met with Richard Nixon in
Florida after the 1960 presidential election. He was there when
nightclub owner Jack Ruby killed Lee Harvey Oswald.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the Space Race he broke the secret on who the first
American in space was to be.
</P>
<P>
   In April of this year, he gave AP a 20-minute scoop on the first
U.S. court ruling in the Elian Gonzalez case.

<HEADLINE> Trial gets underway for officer wounded in Jamestown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAYVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Testimony began Monday in September's
shooting of a Jamestown police officer, allegedly by a teen-ager
police had hoped would lead them to an area drug kingpin.
</P>
<P>
   During more than 90 minutes of testimony, Jamestown police
Detective David P. Mitchell said he was shot by James E. Lewis Jr.
on Sept. 15, the night he and his partner were to meet Lewis for
information on a drug supplier from Rochester named Tracy Roach.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, then 18, had been released from police custody earlier in
the day after being taken in on drug sale charges. Mitchell told
the court Lewis had agreed to work as a confidential informant.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Lewis) was very,very important to me,'' Mitchell said, ''If I
was responsible for knocking Tracy Roach off the drug trade in
Jamestown, then I was making a big dent in the supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Roach has since been charged with drug sales in Rochester and is
now in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell and partner Scott DePietro, who was to testify Tuesday,
were apparently driving an unmarked car in the neighborhood where
they were to meet Lewis. Lewis allegedly opened fire with a handgun
at close range as Mitchell rolled down his window.
</P>
<P>
   Police found Lewis at the nearby home of an acquaintance and
quickly surrounded it with a SWAT team. Lewis surrendered after a
standoff that lasted more than five hours.
</P>
<P>
   Jamestown is a city of about 35,000 located 60 miles south of
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, a 17-year veteran of the police department, was the
first officer shot in the line of duty there in 30 years.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Pipeline Explosion Kills 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- The death toll from a natural gas
explosion rose to 11 on Monday, with one survivor in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th death occurred as National Transportation Safety Board
investigators found pipeline corrosion -- and a thinning of the
pipe's wall -- in a 22-foot section that was blown off the pipeline,
agency spokesman Keith Holloway said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we visibly observed a significant amount of corrosion at
the bottom of the pipeline,'' Holloway said. ''The corrosion was
along the pipe. Also we noticed some wall thinning, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   An NTSB metallurgist was on scene studying the pipe, Holloway
said, ''and we are going to take certain parts back to Washington
(D.C.) to further examine.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment further on the corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB still has found no cause for the blast, Holloway said.
It will be months before a report is released, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB team expects to gather evidence from the scene through
Wednesday. Investigators will analyze maintenance and corrosion
inspection records, as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pipe ruptured and exploded early Saturday, sending a
fireball roaring into the campsite of two families.
</P>
<P>
   The blast left a crater 86 feet long and 20 feet deep and
generated heat so intense that sand melted into glass and part of a
bridge's concrete structure turned to powder.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen people from two families had been camped near that
bridge over the Pecos River, 500 feet from the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included five children and were identified as five
members of one family and six from a second extended family.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just don't dream of something like that happening,'' said
Jim Bailey, who went to church with some of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Smith, 43, died at a hospital in Lubbock, Texas, on
Monday. His daughter-in-law, Amanda Smith, 25, of Carlsbad,
remained in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso Natural Gas Co. defended its pipeline record in the wake
of the explosion 25 miles south of Carlsbad, in southeastern New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Government records show El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s pipeline
facilities in Arizona were cited for likely safety violations in
1997, The Albuquerque Tribune reported Monday. Similar questions
were raised by the U.S. Office of Pipeline Safety in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But John Somerhalder, president of El Paso Energy's pipeline
group, said El Paso Natural Gas was able to show it was in
compliance in both instances.
</P>
<P>
   Somerhalder has said the ruptured line was installed in 1950.
The line was last checked Aug. 2, company spokeswoman Norma Dunn
said.

<HEADLINE> Groups Sue City Over Video Game Ban  </HEADLINE>
By REX W. HUPPKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Two video game industry groups filed a
lawsuit Monday claiming a new city law banning minors from playing
violent and sexually explicit video games is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires coin-operated games featuring graphic violence
or strong sexual content to have warning labels and be kept at
least 10 feet from nonviolent game machines. The machines must also
be separated by a curtain or wall so minors cannot see them. The
law bars people under age 18 from such games unless accompanied by
a parent or guardian.
</P>
<P>
   The American Amusement Machine Association and the Amusement and
Music Operators Association hope to obtain a temporary restraining
order to keep the law from taking effect Sept. 1. They say they
support the city's desire to curb juvenile violence, but believe
the ordinance violates First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's next after banning video games depicting violence?''
AMOA president Frank Seninsky said in a statement. ''Movies? Books?
... We are on the edge of a slippery slope, and our industry has
been forced to litigate to protect core constitutional rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit names Mayor Bart Peterson, Marion County
Prosecutor Scott Newman and city and county law officers who would
enforce the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoral spokesman Steve Campbell said the city expected a
lawsuit over the ordinance -- believed to be the first of its kind --
but remains confident it will meet constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't ever guarantee anything that goes on in a court of
law, but we did our homework on this one,'' Campbell said. ''We did
quite a bit of research to make sure that this would stand up under
judicial scrutiny.''

<HEADLINE> Rescue Teams End Efforts at Sub  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A desperate effort to reach a sunken Russian
nuclear submarine ended Monday, when divers said none of the 118
sailors was alive more than a week after a catastrophic explosion
left them inside a crumpled wreck on the bottom of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian divers who finally opened the escape hatch and forced
their way into the hull of the Kursk after working in the Arctic
depths for more than 24 hours said the submarine was completely
flooded. There was no sign that any of the crew had survived for
long inside the mangled warship 350 feet below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Dejected and emotional, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev expressed
condolences to the sailors' families and admitted the rescue
attempt had been flawed in a Monday night interview on Russia's
largest network, ORT.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all mourning together with the relatives and loved
ones,'' he said, then paused and sighed deeply. ''We will never
forget what the sailors did, that they did all that was possible
and impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends of the crew collapsed with grief after
rescuers found no survivors. Other Russians, who were transfixed by
television and radio reports of the drama, assailed their
government for its slow, bumbling response to the Aug. 12 disaster
and wondered when their crisis-wracked nation will see stability.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forgive me for not saving your sailors,'' the commander of the
Northern Fleet, Adm. Vyacheslav Popov, said to victims' wives and
mothers in a televised statement. He said the crew was not to blame
for the Kursk's sinking.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government resisted international help for days,
even as its rescue capsules repeatedly failed to reach the Kursk's
damaged escape hatch. A British mini-submarine brought to the site
was never used.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have killed the boys, that's all,'' said Yekaterina
Dyachkova, a retiree in Murmansk, headquarters of the Northern
Fleet, struggling to hold back tears. ''The (navy) should have
called for help immediately, but they waited for so many days.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev said that during the rescue operation, ''It's possible
that we made mistakes.'' He complained that meager funding left the
navy short of divers and modern rescue equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our country has been robbed and shredded for the past several
years, and the armed forces receive less than 50 percent of what
the budget promises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow was considering ways to raise the submarine, which
contained some of the navy's most advanced weapons and equipment,
but the precarious project could take weeks or months. There was
also growing concern about the submarine's two nuclear reactors,
though the Norwegian divers found no signs Monday of radiation
leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak, chief of the Northern Fleet, said on
Russia's RTR television that Norwegian officials had agreed in
principle to help retrieve the bodies, but did not say how.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the equipment we have, there is no possibility to do any
more than we have done,'' Norwegian Vice Adm. Einar Skorgen said in
a radio interview. Retrieving bodies, he said, ''is a totally
different operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said the cash-strapped
Russian government would make an international appeal for funds to
raise the Kursk. He suggested it would take weeks just to draw up
plans for the salvage operation.
</P>
<P>
   World leaders expressed condolences to the sailors' families
Monday, and the U.S. Defense Department said it would consider any
Russian request for help in salvaging the submarine. Washington
made several offers to assist in the rescue effort but was turned
down.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Norwegians determined that there were no
survivors, the Russian government was reluctant to admit the crew
was dead, making an announcement only hours later.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin, who did not interrupt his summer
vacation when the disaster hit, has been harshly criticized by the
Russian media and many ordinary people. The speaker of Russia's
upper house of parliament, Yegor Stroyev, called Monday for a
parliamentary probe into the accident and criticized the weak state
of the impoverished military.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the worst blow to the president's stunning
popularity since his election in March, though observers say it
won't be crippling.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of how influential public opinion has become in
Russia, the Kremlin was frantically trying to stem the political
damage. Putin on Monday ordered his Cabinet to help provide aid and
support to the sailors' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 family members of the Kursk sailors came to Murmansk on
Monday on a special charter flight from Moscow. The Navy whisked
them away to a military facility outside the city where other
relatives of the sailors have been closeted.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Navy has only provided food and a place to stay at
the military base and brought in a few psychotherapists. Most
family members had to pay their own airfare to Murmansk.
</P>
<P>
   The navy's focus shifted to studying what caused the explosion
on one of Russia's most advanced submarines. U.S. and Norwegian
seismic stations both reported two explosions at the time the Kursk
went down. But Sergeyev, the defense minister, said Monday that
Russian monitors registered three explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts, which probably involved up to 30 warheads stored in
the torpedo compartment at the front, caused massive damage
throughout the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev said an investigative panel thought the most likely
cause of the accident was an initial collision between the Kursk
and another ''underwater object'' comparable in size.
</P>
<P>
   He hinted that the object could have been a submarine and said
the object was supposedly detected by Russian ships but later never
found. No other ships in the area at the time have reported any
damage, and no one has been able to offer evidence to confirm a
collision. The Russians have said another possible scenario
involved a collision with a World War II mine.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev said other Oscar-class submarines would remain berthed
until the cause of the Kursk disaster is determined.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 11, White Sox 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Gerald Williams became the 25th player in major
league history to hit 20 home runs from the leadoff spot, leading
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays over the Chicago White Sox 11-4 Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit a solo shot in the third for his 20th, becoming the
14th AL player to accomplish the feat. He also hit an RBI single in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Martinez hit his second career home run, and Fred McGriff
and Bobby Smith each drove in three runs to lead the Devil Rays,
who split the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, whose 74-51 record is the best in the AL, have
lost five of nine and are 10-10 in August and 19-19 since the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Tanyon Sturtze (5-2), acquired from the White Sox on May 31, won
his third straight start, allowing one run and five hits in seven
innings with six strikeouts. He is 3-0 with a 2.45 ERA in four
starts since joining Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Parque (10-5) lost for the third time in four decisions. He
gave up six runs -- three earned -- five hits and five walks in 4 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith hit an RBI single with two outs in the first and Williams
homered in the third to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas doubled to start the fourth and scored two outs
later on Carlos Lee's double.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Guillen walked to lead off the fifth. Jason Tyner
sacrificed and Martinez reached on a throwing error by Parque.
Williams singled to score Guillen and, one out later, Vaughn walked
to load the bases for McGriff, whose two-run single made it 5-1 and
chased Parque.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn then stole home on a double steal to go ahead 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay sent 10 batters to the plate in the seventh. Martinez
homered off Kevin Beirne leading of, McGriff drew a bases loaded
walk to make it 8-1, and Smith greeted Mark Buehrle with a two-run
single. One out later, Guillen hit an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin tripled with one out in the eighth off Billy
Taylor and scored on Thomas' groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson hit a two-run double in the ninth off Doug
Creek.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brady Anderson (1996) and Bobby Bonds (1973) share the
season record for homers in the No. 1 slot at 35. ... Williams'
previous career high was 17 homers, set last year with Atlanta. ...
Martinez's other home run was June 4 against the Mets. ... Sturtze
was dealt to the Devil Rays for INF Tony Graffanino. ... Chicago
RHP Sean Lowe is to make his first start this season Wednesday
against Baltimore. Rookie RHP Jon Garland was expected to be placed
on the disabled list to open a roster spot for Lowe, 3-1 with a
6.46 ERA.

<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton reached the .400 mark with two singles
in his first three at-bats Monday night for the Colorado Rockies
against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After his soft single to center off Kevin Millwood in the sixth
inning, Helton's average was an even .400. He is the first person
since George Brett to reach that mark this late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brett was hitting above .400 on Sept. 4, 1980. Helton already
has surpassed the 502 plate appearances needed to qualify for the
batting title.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Raiders Sign Wide Receiver Rison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Raiders on Monday signed wide
receiver Andre Rison, a five-time Pro Bowl selection who was waived
by the Kansas City Chiefs last week.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Rison, who spent the last three seasons with Kansas City, was
waived by the Chiefs on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day I was released I already knew where I was going,''
Rison said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs said their decision to waive Rison was based on the
desire to develop young talent, not the 33-year-old's performance
in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Rison had just 21 catches and no touchdowns, but he
reportedly maintained a rigorous conditioning program during the
offseason and is in game shape.
</P>
<P>
   Rison has some ongoing legal issues, including a scheduled court
appearance next month for not returning a rented $1,000 tape
machine to a music store.
</P>
<P>
   Rison has played for five teams in his 11 seasons in the NFL. In
1989, after finishing as Michigan State's leading career receiver,
Rison spent his rookie season with Indianapolis and then the next
five seasons with Atlanta. Rison spent the 1995 season with the
Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Rison started the year with Jacksonville but was
subsequently released by the Jaguars. Later that season, he was
picked up by Green Bay and started all three of the Packers'
postseason games. He caught two passes for 77 yards, including a
54-yard touchdown, in their Super Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rison has played in 170 NFL games with 702 catches for 9,599
yards and 78 touchdowns.
