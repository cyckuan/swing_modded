EDITORIAL: NEXT STEPS ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 25:
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's reflexive rejection of a new U.N. weapons inspection plan
need not be taken as the last word. With some assistance from
France and Russia, which have an interest in limiting Iraq's
development of chemical, biological and nuclear arms, an effective
monitoring system can yet be put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein would clearly prefer to have no U.N. arms
inspectors snooping around as he tries to rebuild his biological
and chemical arsenals and continues his pursuit of nuclear weapons.
He has already had more than 13 months to work on these programs
unobserved. But his ability to resist U. N. directives depends on
his success in sustaining divisions within the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Security Council passed, by an 11-0
vote, a resolution creating a new inspection system and outlining
the steps Baghdad can take to win some relief from sanctions.
Regrettably, France, Russia and China joined Malaysia in
abstaining. But as even Paris is quick to acknowledge, the areas of
disagreement on the council have appreciably narrowed during the
eight months of diplomacy that produced this resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The council's action, despite the four abstentions, now has the
force of international law. France and Russia, both of which have
long argued for the kind of sanctions relief and other incentives
for Iraq's cooperation embodied in this resolution, should now use
their influence with Baghdad to convince Iraq to abide by its
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution requires Iraq to comply with a list of essential
remaining disarmament tasks to be drawn up by the new inspection
commission. If these are achieved, some international economic
sanctions would be suspended, and remain suspended as long as Iraq
continued to cooperate. While Baghdad's oil revenues would still be
monitored and its import of weapons and weapons-making materials
prohibited, Iraq would gain more freedom in its purchases of
civilian goods. It might also be allowed to repair its oil pumping
and transmission facilities.
</P>
<P>
   To get the resolution passed, Washington had to agree to replace
the old inspection commission, known as Unscom, with a new one
likely to be more closely supervised by the Security Council. It
also had to accept the idea of suspending some sanctions before
Iraq demonstrated full compliance with all disarmament
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Those concessions are acceptable if they permit resumption of a
serious arms-control program inside Iraq. Unhindered inspections
are the best way to monitor Iraqi weapons programs. That is a point
even the abstaining members of the Security Council agree on. Their
help is now needed to convince Iraq that it must honor the new
resolution.

WOMAN FOUND ALIVE IN CAR AFTER TWO DAYS TRAPPED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jennifer Hamm and Bhavna Mistry  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Santa Clarita woman who was trapped for two days in her
wrecked car off the side of a freeway was found alive Friday in
what many were calling a Christmas Eve miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters had to cut Jolene Donohue, 52, from the crushed
car, which had rolled down a 70-foot embankment near Sylmar, just
off the transition road from the southbound Golden State Freeway to
the eastbound Foothill Freeway. She was taken to Providence Holy
Cross Medical Center, where she was listed in serious but stable
condition Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very lucky to be found,'' said Darin Conant, Los Angeles
County Fire Department paramedic. ``What a great Christmas present
-- somebody found their mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue was last seen at 9 p.m. Wednesday when she left a
Christmas party in La Crescenta. Her son filed a missing person
report Thursday when his mother failed to come home, said Sgt.
Richard Larue of the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while David Donohue was at the station Friday checking on
the status of the case, he got a call from his uncle saying that
his mother's car had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said that if it weren't for Stockton resident
John Teslich, 41, who had pulled off the road around 12:10 p.m.
Friday, Donohue may not have been found.
</P>
<P>
   After Teslich flagged down a delivery truck, someone called 911.
</P>
<P>
   The California Highway Patrol did not know why Donohue's car
went undetected.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue was able to tell the rescue and emergency workers she
had been there for two days but couldn't remember the sequence of
events.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe she was driving west on the Foothill Freeway
at about 65mph on her way home Wednesday night, said Sgt. Rick
Sirovy of the CHP's Newhall Office.
</P>
<P>
   For unknown reasons, Donohue crossed the dirt divider and drove
the wrong way on the freeway, Sirovy said.
</P>
<P>
   Her midsized two-door car tumbled 70 feet down an embankment and
landed on its wheels, Sirovy said. The crushed roof trapped Donohue
in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Highway patrol officials said Donohue had been wearing her seat
belt and that there is no suspicion of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't remember what happened,'' Conant said. ``But you
could see the tire marks on the roadway and in the grass and where
she had crossed the ravine.''
</P>
<P>
   When rescue crews arrived, they cut the roof off the car.
Firefighters spent 20 minutes removing the woman from the crushed
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a long-sleeved shirt made of light material and sweat
pants, Donohue was in the driver's seat of her car with her seat
belt on and was alert, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said that temperatures may have dipped into the low
60s.
</P>
<P>
   She complained of neck and back pain but was conscious and able
to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that she had only minor injuries from the
accident,'' said Bob Collis of the Los Angeles Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   She was said to be surrounded by family members at the hospital.

GI's THANKFUL FOR MEMORIES OF BOB HOPE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dennis McCarthy  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They crawled out of foxholes and walked out of jungles and
deserts to see him. Mr. Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the kids were waiting for Santa Claus. Thousands of
miles away, in the middle of another war, their G.I. dads and older
brothers were waiting for Bob Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Christmas never let them down, and they've never forgotten
him for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're 18, 5,000 miles from your loved ones at Christmas, the
mail hasn't come in two weeks, and you're so very homesick,'' Ernie
Meylan of Granada Hills says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, out of nowhere, Bob Hope shows up, and it's like a shot
in the arm, like a visit from home.''
</P>
<P>
   For Meylan, a young army private in World War II, it was a visit
on Okinawa. For Arvid Larson, it was France. For Dan Trifunovich,
it was Germany and England. For Hillard Friedman, it was Ora Bay,
New Guinea. For Grady Carmickel, Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``His show was in the evening, but all the guys started showing
up for it after lunch, just sitting there waiting,'' Carmickel
said. ``That's how much we wanted to see him, how much his visit
from home meant to the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   From early in World War II through Operation Desert Storm in
1990, Mr. Christmas went wherever American GI's serving this
country needed a shot in the arm during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   In the South Pacific, he gave one to a young Navy officer named
John Kennedy, who would one day become president of the United
States and present Hope with the Congressional Gold Medal telling
Mr. Christmas how he had sat in a torrential rainstorm for hours
with thousands of other soldiers to see his show.
</P>
<P>
   And he gave a shot in the arm to all the vets mentioned above,
and many more who spend at least part of their days now at the
Sepulveda and West Los Angeles VA facilities.
</P>
<P>
   They all wanted to say thanks again to Mr. Christmas today, to
tell him how much he meant to them back when they were young
soldiers, scared and so far from home.
</P>
<P>
   They all wanted to say a special Merry Christmas to Bob Hope.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband would return from his Christmas tours, they
would sit for hours talking about the young faces he had seen
looking back at him from the audiences, Dolores Hope said.
</P>
<P>
   It was how Mr. Christmas unwound after coming home from
somewhere in the world where America's soldiers needed a shot in
the arm during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting the men and making them smile was always the thing he
talked about most,'' she said. ``It gave him such satisfaction to
be able to replace the fear and loneliness on their faces with
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a few hours, he could make them forget where they were and
make them feel like they were home again.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was sleeping now, Dolores said when we talked
Thursday. He sleeps a lot, she laughs. But, don't worry, he is
doing well for 96, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his good friend, former President Ronald Reagan, he does
not suffer from Alzheimer's, she said. They still entertain friends
and enjoy together reading the holiday cards and letters that have
come from all over the world again this year.
</P>
<P>
   I tell her there are thousands of veterans in Los Angeles who
want to wish Bob Hope a merry Christmas and thank him again for
giving up all those Christmases with his own family to spend them
with GI's somewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   She would tell Bob that, Dolores said. Thank you. He'll
appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he could, he'd do one more show for them right now,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Now wouldn't that be a great way to wrap up the century?
</P>
<P>
   One final present to his country from Mr. Christmas.

40 YEARS FOR A DROP IN THE BUCKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jennifer Hamm  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTROSE _ For nearly 40 years, Gordon Milbauer has filled the
streets of Montrose with the famous ringing of the Salvation Army
kettle bell.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 79-year-old Milbauer closed a chapter in local
Christmas tradition as the city's beloved kettle worker. Because of
declining health, this is thought to be his last year as a bell
ringer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an icon,'' said Jack Geer, a La Crescenta resident who
stopped by Milbauer's kettle Friday afternoon. ``We wait every year
so we can come down. He's the kind of person you look forward to
seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping his little silver Salvation Army bell in constant
motion, Milbauer greeted everyone who walked by his kettle on
Honolulu Avenue. ``Merry Christmas,'' he shouted to some; ``Hey
Buddy,'' he called to others.
</P>
<P>
   Many sidewalk strollers stopped, shoved a dollar in the red
kettle and stayed to chat. They love hearing his jokes, singing
carols with him and just shooting the breeze, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For Milbauer of Tujunga, the job is more like a party than work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else could you ask for? It's a nice pretty place with
nice pretty people,'' he said, grinning. ``Besides, where else can
you get a job with an 11-month vacation?''
</P>
<P>
   When Milbauer started working as a Salvation Army bell ringer in
the early 1960s, he still worked with the city of Los Angeles
irrigation systems department. Until he retired in 1985, Milbauer
took his annual vacation during the holiday season to accommodate
his bell ringing work.
</P>
<P>
   Milbauer has been a ``soldier'' for the Salvation Army for most
of his life. Born in Canada, his family moved to Los Angeles when
he was 6 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we did was join up with the Salvation Army,''
Milbauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Milbauer suffered from infantile paralysis and has always used
crutches, which he calls ``Rufus'' and ``Doofus.'' His left foot is
six sizes smaller than his right.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his regular stays in hospitals as a child that
Milbauer learned his greatest lesson, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to have a sense of humor,'' he said. ``There's no
sense of having a hard nose. When you smile, you don't use as many
muscles.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital was also where he found one of his great treasures
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He met Evelyn during a stay in the hospital, and the two fell in
love immediately. The couple married within a few years. They've
been married 57 years and raised six children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Milbauer agreed to help the Salvation Army in Glendale
during the holidays. For the first two years, he worked downtown.
But in 1965, the Salvation Army set up a post in Montrose and
Milbauer's been there ever since.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly four decades, Milbauer only missed working last
year when he was in the hospital. He was released three days before
Christmas and immediately called Maj. Floyd Bacon, corps commanding
officer for the Glendale Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if I could work,'' Milbauer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bacon told him to take care of himself and enjoy the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Among bell ringers, Milbauer is a rarity, Bacon said. Most work
a few shifts or at most, a few years. Bacon said he doesn't know of
anyone who has been a bell ringer as long as Milbauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major Bacon tells me I'm the top kettle worker,'' Milbauer
said. ``I'm the champ.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the Salvation Army cap that he's had since he started as
a bell ringer, Milbauer says he's never tired of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God blesses what I do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He loves watching people and chatting with them.
</P>
<P>
   Does the ringing bell ever grow tiresome?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even hear it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the three-day-a-week job that pays only minimum
wage has been tougher for Milbauer, who goes to dialysis three
times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Milbauer believes this is his last year as a bell ringer, but
still hopes his health will improve and he'll be back next
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, Milbauer says he'll start to miss kettle
collecting when this season ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next week, I'll say I can't go back no more,'' he said.

   Five Sikh men said to be armed with grenades, rifles and knives
hi- jacked an Indian Airlines jet Friday and killed at least one of
the 189 people aboard, during a forced odys- sey across India,
Pakistan, Afghani- stan and the Persian Gulf before touching down
in Kandahar, Afghani- stan, Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, the militia that rules most of Afghanistan, said
their sol- diers had surrounded the plane in Kandahar, Agence
France-Presse reported. A Taliban spokesman said the militia had
nothing to do with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has been allowed out of the plane, which is surrounded
by the military vehicles,'' said the spokes- man, Abdul Hai
Mutmaen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got nothing to do with the hijackers,'' he said,
according to the French agency. ``We are con- cerned about the
safety of those ab- ducted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban reportedly refused both an Indian request for a
rescue attempt and a plea for asylum for the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft had taken off from a military air base in the
United Arab Emirates and, low on fuel, landed in Kandahar two hours
later, at 7:33 a.m. local time Saturday. The ruling Taliban
permitted the troubled jet to land, after denying an earlier re-
quest for a night-time landing.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen comandeered the A- 300 Airbus after it took off from
Katmandu, Nepal, at 4:25 p.m. local time Friday. Over the next 15
hours, they landed on three separate occasions to refuel. During a
five- hour stop at the Al Minhad military base outside Dubai, they
released about 35 hostages, including women, children and one
injured man.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers also brought out the body of a hostage they had
killed, an image broadcast on Dubai television.
</P>
<P>
   Two male passengers who were also released told The Associated
Press that the hijackers had killed two hostages with knives but
that no guns had been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Emirates officials, who had allowed the plane to land after
nearby Oman had refused per- mission, said the hijackers had agreed
to free some hostages after the plane had been refueled.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the hijackers, their demands and their intended
destination remained a mystery. At one point in the erratic
journey, they ordered the pilot to fly to Afghanistan but the
ruling Taliban militia refused to allow the plane to land.
</P>
<P>
   The men were confirmed as Sikhs, the BBC reported Friday night,
and both Indian and Pakistani officials said the gunmen spoke
Hindi, the official language of India and the predominant language
in the north- ern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was originally bound for New Delhi from Katmandu, the
capi- tal of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in the emirates said negotiated for the release
of women and children without trying to hold the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will allow it to refuel and we will provide it with medical
aid and food if needed,'' Information Minister Abdullah bin Zayed
said. ``That airport is equipped with ambulances. We are not
interested in allowing them to stay for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines officials said Flight IC 814, which left Katmandu at
4:25 p.m. local time, 5:55 a.m. Eastern time, had a crew of 11 and
178 passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, however, had conflicting reports on passengers'
nationalities. At least 154 were reported to be Indian and eight
Nepalese. Officials told Reuters that other passengers included
four Swiss, four Spaniards, a Japanese, a Canadian and a Belgian.
The nationalities of the other five passengers were not known.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, which is usually a one-hour trip, was seized about
30 minutes after it took off and just as the plane crossed into
Indian airspace.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, armed with AK-47 rifles, grenades and knives that
they had apparently carried when they boarded in Nepal, first
ordered the pilot fly to Lahore, Pakistan. After Pakistani
authorities denied them permission to land, the plane was allowed
to land in nearby Amritsar, in northwestern India, because it was
running low on fuel, with 20 minutes of flying time remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In Amritsar, the hijackers appeared to panic after having warned
authorities that they would begin killing passengers if anyone
tried to approach the plane except to refuel it. Airport officials
said the gunmen opened fire while the aircraft was on the ground
and then, without waiting for refueling, ordered the pilot to take
off.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said later that the pilot reported to air
controllers that the hijackers had told him that they had killed
four people and had injured several others.
</P>
<P>
   The plane again turned toward Lahore, sinking to an altitude of
just 500 feet before Pakistani officials finally agreed to let it
make an emergency landing on a darkened runway.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan had already sent army commandos to patrol the airport,
although officials tried hard to avoid having anything to do with
the plane. The airport manager, Ghulam Mustafa Mirani, told the
Agence France-Presse that the runway lights had been switched off
to prevent the plane from landing. Only when the plane was
dangerously close to a crash landing, Mirani said, did authorities
relent.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Islamabad said
permission was granted on humanitarian grounds after the pilot
reported that he was almost out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In Lahore, the hijackers demanded fuel and food but apparently
did not speak directly to officials. A spokesman for the
government, General Rashid Qureshi, said the hijackers made their
demands through the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   After 2 1-2 hours in La- hore, the gunmen ordered the pilot to
fly to Afghanistan, the authorities said. But it was denied landing
per- mission, and detoured to Dubai be- fore returning and being
allowed to land at Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts speculated that the hijacking could be linked
to the disputed territory of Kashmir, the object of a long and
bitter struggle between India and Pakistan that heated up into a
military confrontation this year.

Rockets' Rogers overcomes life filled with grief
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JONATHAN FEIGEN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The presents were nestled under a Christmas tree in a room full
of fresh faces, each child no doubt with his own story to tell,
waiting before him. Carlos Rogers towered in a red Santa Claus hat
and beamed a sweeping smile, as jolly as St. Nick himself, as he
tried to make the kids understand where he had been and why he was
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just like you,'' the 6-11 Rockets forward said, almost
pleading for them to understand. ``I've been where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearing gifts and a message of hope, Rogers this week visited
the Star of Hope Transitional Living Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to talk about basketball,'' he told his
audience. ``We can talk about anything you want.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids waited politely but quietly. And before long, Rogers
was passing out Walkmans, Rockets gear and tickets, and pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to share with them more than just merchandise. He
could have spoken about growing up in abject poverty, about abuse
and about the tragedy that goes with it all. He wanted them to know
that if he could break free from the Detroit ghetto gangs, survive
and flourish, they could as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, 28, says his first memories are of his father beating
his mother. Countless assaults would follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ashamed to say I had nothing,'' Rogers said. ``I
didn't have NBA players coming to my neighborhood giving me
nothing. They didn't even give me conversation. The only thing I
had was what the police collected in the boxes _ defective
underwear, toys that were broken, but you had something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give these kids something so they would have hope
to move forward, so they're not stuck in the paradigm that from
this environment I can't make it. I don't want their environment to
be their excuse to fail. I let them know I come from the same
environment. You can make it. You have to find your niche. You have
to find what you do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how these kids are living. I know how it feels to
believe people don't care about you. I know how it feels to wonder
where your next meal is coming from. I know how it feels to not
hear Happy Birthday on your birthday. I know how it feels to not
receive a Christmas gift. I can sit down and have common bonds with
these kids. I can reflect on my childhood like it was yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers would seem better off if he could forget. But there are
many realities of his life he must accept, and his memory is just
one more curse he has turned into a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems sometimes I can remember everything back to my
mother's womb,'' he said. ``I can remember from the time I was 3
years old, my dad shot at us when I was sitting on my mother's lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like that, kids don't forget. This stuff still weighs
heavy on my heart today. There were times I felt if my father
passed, I wouldn't cry. That's how he made everybody feel. He
thought the only way to have respect was to make everybody afraid
of you. That's not how you should live.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers grew up with two brothers and a sister, and his father's
four children from a previous marriage also lived in the small
upstairs apartment on the mean streets of Detroit. His mother
Jacqueline supported the household, which often included as many as
11 people.
</P>
<P>
   It was understood that when his father was delivering
punishment, no one interfered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest things to reminisce (are) your mom getting hit
on,'' Rogers said. ``It happened every weekend. Every time he went
out and got drunk, he came back and hit my mom. I can remember when
I was about 4 years old. I heard my mom crying. I heard her
whimpering in the other room. I said, `Mama, why are you crying?'
She told me how my dad mistreated her. I told her, `Don't worry
mommy, one day I'm going to take care of you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He heard me say that. He grabbed me by my collar and slammed
me to the bedroom floor. He kicked me in my ribs and said, `That's
my woman. You find one and you take care of her.' I was a baby, and
that's what he said? He didn't care who he hurt. He was a terrible
man.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a surprising lack of bitterness in Rogers' voice as he
describes his father. There is still bitterness inside, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he recounts the last time his father beat him, Rogers
lays out each step of the horrible night unemotionally, as if he
has no idea how shocking such horrors sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 10 years old,'' Rogers said. ``My dad made up a myth
that I stole his gun. He was into the drugs real heavy. He was
trying to make my mom pay for it. He was always trying to get money
from my mom then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said if my mom didn't come up with the money to pay for it,
he was going to beat me every 10 minutes. He held true to his word.
Every 10 minutes he came into that room and pounced on me like I
was a grown man. I took about nine whippings. He punched me in the
face, he kicked me in my ribs. That time he had the dog's chain,
and he started hitting me across the back with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I'm sitting there bleeding and everything, and I'm there
saying to myself, `This man's going to kill me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said his mother tried to intervene, but there was little
she could do. Even now, there is a sense of relief apparent in
Rogers that his mother could get herself and the other children out
safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd tried to help me, he'd have beaten them, too. We all
understood that.''
</P>
<P>
   The eighth time Rogers' father returned to the room, he wrapped
the chain around his son's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked me up with a dog chain,'' Rogers said. ``He picked
me up in the air. I really felt like I was about to die. I had
blood dripping from my mouth. I was up in the air wondering, `Is
this man going to kill me?' He dropped me, and I was real weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a two-family flat, and we were on the top. I went
to the window and took the screen out and put it under the bed. I
said, `I'll take one more whipping and then I'm out of here.' He
came back 10 minutes later and beat me again. After he left, I knew
I had 10 more minutes to get out of the room. I sat on the edge of
the window. I said, ``God, if he doesn't kill me, I'm going to kill
myself trying to get away from him.' So I jumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I jumped, I didn't hurt myself. I just ran. I didn't talk
to him again until I was 24 years old. I went and stayed with my
granddad. The funny thing is, he is even more violent than my
father, but he never hurt his grandkids.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Rogers said, the family's situation improved. Still
the family's sole means of support, his mother went to night school
at Highland Park Community College and learned cement finishing.
She began to make a good living laying foundations and became a
supervisor. The family not only had enough to eat, but there were
new shoes and clothes to go around along with a new feeling of
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Then one night Rogers said his father pistol-whipped his mother,
sending her to the hospital for a month and rendering her unable to
do the sort of work that she had been doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' he said, ``back to the ghetto.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' mother eventually left his father, but his father was
not the only danger that existed.
</P>
<P>
   Their neighborhood was filled with crack addicts, and the gangs
ruled the streets, ready to pounce on anyone not backed by the
strength of numbers. Violence was everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had a gun,'' Rogers said. ``That was nothing. It was
nothing to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still innocent enough to run home after school each day to catch
afternoon cartoons, Rogers was 14 when he was stopped by a group of
teens. They searched him for money, found his pockets empty and
then punished him for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat me real bad that day,'' Rogers said. ``I mean, it
was really bad. From that day on, I was in a gang. That's when I
really got bad. There were gang fights. I was stealing from people
and doing some (things) I shouldn't have done. My mother never knew
the things I was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got real bad. My brother and sister kept telling me I was
going to get killed, but it got to the point where I didn't give a
damn. I thought I was going to die anyway. You know. I just didn't
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like everyone I knew went to jail and is dead. Man,
there were so many people I saw die. It was every other day one of
your gang members was dead. I was just waiting for my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he cried after every friend's death until he
wondered if he had any tears left. He eventually found out.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Kevin, was 15 when he was shot and killed. While
Rogers openly talks about his personal tragedies, mistakes and
hardships, he and his family have a heard time speaking of Kevin,
if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers quickly realized that if he were to have any chance of
improving his lot in life, then basketball was likely to be his
ticket to success. He immediately jumped into the deep pool of high
school talent in Detroit, competing with Jalen Rose and Chris
Webber and showing enough in one season to draw interest from
several college recruiters. Rogers played only one season of high
school basketball and then jumped at the first scholarship offer _
from Arkansas-Little Rock _ he received.
</P>
<P>
   After spending a season to become eligible, Rogers played one
season in Little Rock and then transferred with assistant coach
Ricardo Patton to Tennessee State, where he blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers averaged 22.5 points and 11.6 rebounds in his two seasons
at Tennessee State. He led the Tigers to the NCAA Tournament and
was the 11th pick (by Seattle) in the 1994 NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers spent the day of the draft wondering if he had done
enough to hear his name called. He was not invited to the draft
party. So he walked for hours along the Detroit waterfront and then
watched the draft alone in a hotel bar.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard his name, he went numb, stunned silent until the
bartender realized he was serving the celebrity of the moment. He
dropped $200 on the bar and rushed home where his front lawn was
packed with screaming friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers found his mother, wrapped his long arms around her and
told her that her struggles were finally over.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was to take care of my mother,'' Rogers said.
``That's all I ever thought about. My brothers and sisters and I
used to sit around all the time and I would say, `I'm going to be a
millionaire. I'm going to take care of mommy.' That's all we all
wanted, to take care of her. She went through so much to take care
of all of us. If I go to bed hungry and I know my mom went out and
did everything she could to feed me I can appreciate her more.
That's what my mom did. She did everything she could to provide for
us. Sometimes ends just don't meet.''
</P>
<P>
   That summer, he was traded to the Golden State Warriors and
signed a nine-year, $14.1 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers eventually convinced his mother to move to the Detroit
suburb of Farmington.
</P>
<P>
   With the money from his contract, he was able to send his
sister, brother and cousin to college. He sent a half-sister to a
rehabilitation clinic. Incredibly, he even paid for his father to
receive treatment at a clinic, although Rogers said the treatment
was unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to establish relationships with my dad,'' Rogers
said. ``Every time I tried, he lets me down. It gets to the point I
don't want to try anymore. Right when I think he's living right,
when he's got the drugs out of his system, I enter him into a rehab
and he comes out and says he's clean, and then he disappears. I
don't see him for a long time. And when he's back, I can see he's
been on the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bitter for a long time. Most of it was because of my
father. I always felt every kid is supposed to have a great father
and I didn't. I had an abusive father. He would drink, use drugs.
He'd beat my mom. He'd beat the rest of the kids. I always looked
at him as the person I hated the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I used to just think of ways to get back
at him. Even when I got older, I had dreams about this man, either
him killing me or me killing him.''
</P>
<P>
   But his childhood dream of freeing his family from its hard
circumstances turned out to be an innocent fantasy. It was perfect,
too perfect to be real life. Rogers could not protect them or
himself from reality.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, Rogers, who was in his third year with the
Raptors, was at home in Toronto, waiting to play a game that night,
when word came that his older sister, Adriene, then 29, was
seriously ill with a kidney ailment. Rene, as Rogers affectionately
called her, had filled many of the voids during Rogers' early
years, hugging him or scolding him as needed while their mother
toiled to provide for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers began making plans to donate one of his kidneys, risking
his still new career to save his sister. Then word came that Rene
was deteriorating rapidly and had been moved to the intensive care
unit at a Detroit hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the big, mean sister that looked out for you,'' Rogers
said. ``She made sure things were taken care of. When my mom wasn't
home, she was mom. We had to listen to her or there were
consequences. She was a person you looked at as mean, but you knew
when push comes to shove, she was in your corner. The older we got,
the closer we got.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I cared about was, she's my sister. You don't understand
until you get older what she was trying to accomplish. She was
providing guidance, making us responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I thought about on my way to Detroit was,
`Lord, just please let my sister be alive so I can see her.'''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Rogers stopped talking. He had told his story
easily until then. But now, it is a struggle as he tries to piece
together the final hours of his sister's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, that was all I was thinking about, just seeing
her,'' Rogers said. ``When I got there and I saw her, she looked so
bad. They had all these machines on her. She looked like she was
gone before I got there and they were just trying to fix her up to
make her look good. Once I got there and saw her, the doctors told
me she was too weak to even think about surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was praying for was that she would get strong enough for
it to actually happen. I asked them, `If she comes to, don't tell
her it's me giving her the kidney because then she won't accept
it.' My sister told me she would rather die than for me to stop
playing basketball. She was willing to die before she stopped me
from doing what I was doing. That's the type of person she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said even though he was told his career could have ended
with the transplant he never considering doing anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me that's not something any sibling should need to
contemplate,'' he said. ``I never even thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rene died of septic shock that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   To honor her memory, Rogers wears Rene's name on his shoes and
tattooed on his left shoulder surrounded by musical notes from her
choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about her every day,'' he said in a whisper. ``Every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   This past offseason, there was even more heartache to endure.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers brought his brother, Kefrin, 21, and cousin, Larry
Jefferson, 23, to live with him in Toronto. Rogers sent them to
Humber College, where both played on the basketball team. During
the summer, Jefferson was in a horrible automobile accident that
left him a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me he'd be on respirator the rest of his life,''
Rogers said. ``He's still paralyzed from his neck down. I'm never
going to say for always. Hopefully he'll get some movement or
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what's driving me this year. I think how tired
I am, how much I feel like I can't go on, how I can't wait for a
timeout to come. But I wrote in my shoes, so I look down at it.
I've got 'CB4' for Charles (Barkley) because I know he can't get
around like he wants to, and I have LJ for Larry because I know he
can't move at all. He was a very athletic person. I'd be cheating
myself and him to not give everything I have on that floor right
now, knowing he wishes he could just walk. That's my drive now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious he has overcome his past. Rogers has somehow
turned it all into an exercise that has strengthened him. Even the
frustration from two seasons of relative inactivity in Portland
seemed necessary for him to become a hungry starter in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes from my mom,'' Rogers said. ``She gave us that
strength and character. She gave us all the hopes and dreams and
aspirations. Even though things seemed too far away, she made you
imagine taking steps closer. She instilled positive to us. That
just stayed with us. I tried to instill same things to my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his mother taught him faith and his sister gave him
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father gave me a lot,'' he said. ``He showed me what not to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers cites several men _ from Patton at Arkansas-Little Rock
to Bob Lanier at Golden State to John Shumate at Toronto _ who were
positives in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he knew searching for it, but because of
family situations, a lot of us black men grow up without strong
male figures,'' Shumate said. ``We are dominated by the matriarch
of the family. So many black males search for a figure to identify
with. Bob and I are real close. We talked about Carlos. He said,
initially he may turn you off. But here's what you'll find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos needed help, emotional, psychological help. He had a
lot of growing to do. He had been through so much. He needed to
shed the shackles of his past, to have a chance to grow, blossom
and bloom into a new world. We had to help him see another side, to
show being male is not just the hardcore streets of Detroit. Maybe
we're able to shed negative baggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a person that wants to be loved. Has got so much love to
give, and share. He's a special person. I loved many players.
Carlos is something different, something special, spiritually,
emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas gifts have been passed out. The pizzas are gone.
Outside, there is a basketball hoop, where for 90 minutes after the
party ended, Rogers and 38 new friends played. They joked and
laughed, with Rogers' booming, rapid-fire voice filling the
playground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I wanted,'' Rogers said. ``I didn't want to come
in and say, `Hey I'm Carlos. Here's my story. Listen. Listen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they were wondering, `Who is this guy with the
presents. Why is he here.' I just wanted to be there for them. I
wanted them to see it can be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rogers was leaving, one of the kids pulled him aside. He told
Rogers he would never grow to 6-11 and be a NBA player. But seeing
Rogers that day had inspired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked if he gets good grades,'' Rogers said. ``He told me,
`I will from now on.'''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, nearly 30 years of heartache began to make sense.
There is no bitterness, Rogers said. No anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you look back, it makes you appreciate where you are,'' he
said. ``You think about all the people who want to be where I am,
and then you can't take your position for granted. I've always been
an appreciative person. Mine is mostly spiritual. I thank God for
everything I have. Even when I had nothing, I thanked Him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now, I can go to somebody and say, there will be better
days. It might not be now, but it will be. We have to say, `I've
got to find a way through this, a way through that.' Sometimes it's
not you that's the problem.''

   WHITE-CHRISTMAS (Darien, Conn.) _ The meteorologists may say
that there hasn't been any snow this winter in this quaint and

Christmas morning, they will discover a hill on their grandparents'
property blanketed with snow, giving them the perfect place to test

   MCCAIN-PRESS (Portsmouth, N.H.) _ Among political reporters, the
extraordinary access that John McCain provides has become the stuff
of instant legend. For hour after hour, he takes on all comers on
the bus his staff has christened Straight Talk Express. McCain will
spar and ruminate, banter and cajole, kick back and hold forth for
as long as anyone with a pad or a microphone cares. The result: an

while grimy, ancient machines gushed foaming beer into dirty green
bottles, often along with insects, twigs and clumps of dirt. But

others saw only pitfalls. Nearly three later, Zayat has turned the

   LATIN-Y2K (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ With less than a week to go, no
one is quite sure what the fallout will be from Latin America's
approach to dealing with the Year 2000 problem. Some of the
region's poorest countries, like Paraguay, are drastically
ill-prepared, while other nations, like Chile and Mexico, planned
ahead and budgeted funds to sufficiently adapt their government
computers. Nevertheless, there appears to be a consensus emerging
among the people who have been rushing to prepare the region: The
parts of Latin America most at risk are also the most
technologically advanced, while the most underdeveloped regions,
while they will almost surely also be affected by the problem, are
not likely to suffer as much as the pockets of wealth. By Simon

   MODERN-MASKS (Undated) _ Once upon a time masks belonged to
anthropology. They were strange objects made of wood, shells,
feathers and bells that primitives wore for coming-of-age rituals,
funerary rites, rain dances, fertility festivals and seasonal
get-togethers. Modern people also wear masks: hockey masks, gas
masks, surgical masks. You could say that modern masks are just for
protection. You could also say that hockey, war and surgery are
rituals and that these masks reveal something about the
relationships of the people who wear them. And now puppeteers,
artists and dramatists are spinning their own theories about the
place of masks in modern culture now, and they are finding that it
is not all kinship or cranial protection. By Barbara Boxer. (1300

   ZERO (Undated) _ Before the millennium gasps its last tired
breath, a final tribute must be paid to something overlooked. It
might seem to be nothing, yet during the last 1,000 years it has
transformed physics, mathematics, commerce and the shape of Western
civilization. That something is nothing. And that nothing is marked
by something. The object in question is the number zero. And zero,
whose presence declares absence, is a cipher in more ways than one
_ or maybe in more ways than none. Edward Rothstein looks at two
recents books about zero. (1000 words)

CUSTOM SKIS FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM, AND $2,000
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wyo.)   (rk) 
 By   BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adam Sherman thought it was a joke when advertising executives
from Dewar's, the Scotch whiskey maker, phoned him about appearing
in an advertisement. As the founder of a fledgling ski
manufacturing company in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Sherman was hardly a
mover or shaker.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he had been living in a van the past few years. He
took his showers in the back of the cement-block warehouse where
his staff of eight workers make custom-built skis in Jackson Hole.
One of the employees even lives there now, in a custom-built
cardboard box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were kidding, of course,'' Sherman said
recently about the phone call from the Dewar's executives in New
York City. ``But then they called me back with 16 people on a
conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were definitely curious. I'm sure they envisioned me
sitting there in a coat and tie like them, just talking on the
phone. But I was just hanging out in ski clothes. I don't think
they understood we are all ski bums.''
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent ad contact proved fruitful beyond his wildest
dreams. Dewar's told Sherman, 30, that the company wanted him and
his two partners, Bryce Roberts, 26, and Niki Singlaub, 24, to be
featured in its new ``Profiles for the New Millennium'' campaign.
The $2 million advertisement would appear in national magazines
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Why us, they asked. ``Today it's all about going there, not
getting there,'' said Frank Ginsberg, chairman of Dewar's
advertising agency, Avrett, Free &AMP; Ginsburg. ``The risk, not the
reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman could relate. He had named his company Igneous Skis,
igneous as in rock that ``comes from fire,'' he said. Dewar's flew
the three budding stars to New York last August for the photo
shoot. They were picked up at the airport and taken to a Soho hotel
for three days. Plenty of good food and wine, too, Sherman reports.
</P>
<P>
   But is their company truly hot? Well, not yet, especially given
the company's allegiance to skis and the preponderance of
snowboarders on the slopes these days _ 27 percent of all Alpine
visits last season. But each one of the Igneous triumvirate is a
diehard skier who puts in 100 days or more on the slopes each
winter. Just try to reach them before 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Dewar's ad shows Sherman and his two partners on a chairlift
(in a shot that was fabricated in an air-conditioned New York City
studio). All three have that 20-something, baggy-clothed demeanor
of a contented snowboarder. But Sherman scoffs at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skiing is going to become cool again,'' he said. ``The ski
industry is in one big cycle. Snowboarding catches on with the
younger set, and they take over the sport. But then all the
50-year-olds want to do it, and it's no longer punk. So then all
the early snowboarders go back to skiing, looking for ways to make
it more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman's confidence comes despite modest revenue. Still in the
red after four years, Igneous has reached its goal for the coming
season: 350 pairs of custom-built skis. Word is getting out,
Sherman said, through the company's Internet site,
www.igneousskis.com/.
</P>
<P>
   But theirs is a select market. To create a custom ski, Sherman
and his colleagues try to meet face to face with potential
customers. They watch how a person skis and then listen to what the
skier thinks he or she needs. Then they suggest a design based on
eight basic models, but with individual adaptations.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is fierce from companies like Rossignol,
Salomon, K2 and Atomic in a relatively flat sales market. But with
prices that range from $600 to $2,000 for a pair of custom skis,
the team at Igneous is not worried about cutting costs for
materials that make a good ski better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking at the bottom line on skis,'' Singlaub said.
``And we don't use the gadgets that other manufacturers are using
to sell skis. They're all little add-ons that change the ski in a
minor way.''
</P>
<P>
   It still remains to be seen whether a small operation like
Igneous can eventually compete with mass producers. Hugh Harley,
president of Rossignol Skis in the United States, said recently
that consolidation in the industry has a way of swallowing up small
companies. ``If they can develop a little bit of a cult following,
they might survive,'' Harley said. ``But the rubber's going to meet
the road at some time. It's going to be very, very rough.''

SPECTER OF DISASTER LOOMS OVER AUSTRALIAN RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JOHN SHAW    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Last year on the day after Christmas, Iain
Moray _ banker by profession, sailor by preference _ skippered his
35-footer, Siena, in the 630-mile Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up helping in the rescue of the crew of a larger yacht
shattered by 70-knot winds and 50-foot waves.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 1,135 sailors in the 54th running of the
Sydney-to-Hobart classic were killed. Scores of other crew members
were injured, and 57 had to be hauled from damaged yachts, sinking
rafts and the sea itself by helicopters and coast guard craft in
the largest maritime civilian rescue operation in Australia's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Only 44 of the 115 boats that started the race finished the
course. Five of them sank in a tempest that quickly escalated from
a grim forecast of storm-force gales to the terrifying reality of
90 mph winds and 35-foot waves.
</P>
<P>
   When this year's race begins here on Sunday, Moray, a veteran of
six Sydney-to-Hobarts and three other major ocean races, will stay
in the harbor as some 80 yachts put to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Moray and some other skippers say they would not have started
last year, or would have quit sooner, if they had been fully
briefed on storm warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-hour hurricane-force ``extreme event,'' as weather
experts called it, was predicted by some forecasters, but the
warnings were not fully heeded by race officials _ an aspect of the
disaster that remains controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the sport dearly, but not enough to die for it,'' Moray
said, recalling winds of 86 knots and whiteout conditions in which
``the tops blew off the waves and spume came at you horizontally
like bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this year there will most likely be 35 fewer starters
than a year ago, most of the absentees are not protesters or
sailors worried by storms. Rather, many regular crews have heeded
family requests to stay home for millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Moray has vowed to shun the passage to Hobart, the capital
of Australia's island state of Tasmania, until more is revealed of
the 1998 disaster and reforms are made to help avoid another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the worst tragedy in Australia's sporting history,
and there must be an independent investigation without further
delay,'' Moray said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the government of New South Wales ordered
a coroner's inquiry last December into the death of the six
yachtsmen, no judicial verdict on the deaths has been delivered,
nor is one expected soon because of bureaucratic tardiness and the
illness of a coroner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 1998 Sydney-to-Hobart remains the deadliest event
in world yachting since the 1979 Fastnet race when 80-knot winds
off the British and Irish coasts capsized 80 of the 300 entrants,
sinking 20 boats and killing 15 sailors.
</P>
<P>
   A report on last year's disaster by the race organizers, the
Cruising Yacht Club of Australia, did not find fault but
recommended 12 new or stricter safety measures, including mandatory
carrying of high-precision position-indicating radio beacons able
to guide rescuers within three miles of an emergency location. A
helicopter equipped with advanced search and communication systems
will shadow the fleet this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian club's commodore, Hugo Van Kretschmar, a veteran
of 19 Hobarts, including last year's, said: ``The race has grown in
stature as a result of last year. Some lesser competitions would
have crumbled, but world yachting recognizes the challenge here and
the quest for adventure which draws sailors to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a test of offshore sailing, the Australian race is rated
alongside two northern hemisphere events _ the annual 600-mile
Atlantic voyage from Newport, R.I., to Bermuda and the Fastnet
contest for Britain's Admiral's Cup, sailed every two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney-to-Hobart's macho reputation belies the race's more
relaxed beginnings in 1945 as a vacation voyage (``no spinnakers,
gentlemen''). It evolved into the current mix of recreation and
rivalry where weekend craft of skilled amateurs, from lawyers to
laborers, blend with the maxis of tycoons crewed by professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's winner, as in 1995, was the maxi-yacht Sayonara,
owned by Larry Ellison, the billionaire founder of Oracle software.
His crew of 22 sailed fast enough (two days and 19 hours, but
almost 19 hours outside the record time) to escape the worst of the
storm. But Ellison, upon arrival in Hobart, still deemed the
experience ``just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, three American entries will race this year, Alaska
Eagle, Mari-Cha III and Pipe Dream IX, all here on transworld
voyages.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Badham, an Australian meteorologist who is in
Auckland, New Zealand, advising the America's Cup campaign of
America One, one of three U.S. qualifiers for the cup semifinals
next month, said the storm that struck the 1998 Sydney-Hobart was
``a one in 50 or more years event, rare and extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Badham sees early indications for favorable northeast winds to
give the fleet a good start southward this year, with the chance of
a low-pressure front _ the condition that forms storms _ across the
course later.
</P>
<P>
   Severe weather is hardly rare on the haul to Hobart. In 1984,
southerly gales forced 104 of 150 starters to retire. In 1993,
there were 110 starters but only 38 mastered gusts up to 70 knots
to finish.

   Five Sikh men said to be armed with grenades, rifles and knives
hijacked an Indian Airlines jet Friday and killed at least one of
the 189 people aboard, during a forced odyssey across India,
Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf before touching down in
Kandahar, Afghanistan, Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, the militia that rules most of Afghanistan, said
their soldiers had surrounded the plane in Kandahar, Agence
France-Presse reported. A Taliban spokesman said the militia had
nothing to do with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has been allowed out of the plane, which is surrounded
by the military vehicles,'' said the spokesman, Abdul Hai Mutmaen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got nothing to do with the hijackers,'' he said,
according to the French agency. ``We are concerned about the safety
of those abducted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban reportedly refused both an Indian request for a
rescue attempt and a plea for asylum for the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft had taken off from a military air base in the
United Arab Emirates and, low on fuel, landed in Kandahar two hours
later, at 7:33 a.m. local time Saturday. The ruling Taliban
permitted the troubled jet to land, after denying an earlier
request for a night-time landing.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen comandeered the A-300 Airbus after it took off from
Katmandu, Nepal, at 4:25 p.m. local time Friday. Over the next 15
hours, they landed on three separate occasions to refuel. During a
five-hour stop at the Al Minhad military base outside Dubai, they
released about 35 hostages, including women, children and one
injured man.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers also brought out the body of a hostage they had
killed, an image broadcast on Dubai television.
</P>
<P>
   Two male passengers who were also released told The Associated
Press that the hijackers had killed two hostages with knives but
that no guns had been fired.
</P>
<P>
   Emirates officials, who had allowed the plane to land after
nearby Oman had refused permission, said the hijackers had agreed
to free some hostages after the plane had been refueled.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the hijackers, their demands and their intended
destination remained a mystery. At one point in the erratic
journey, they ordered the pilot to fly to Afghanistan but the
ruling Taliban militia refused to allow the plane to land.
</P>
<P>
   The men were confirmed as Sikhs, the BBC reported Friday night,
and both Indian and Pakistani officials said the gunmen spoke
Hindi, the official language of India and the predominant language
in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was originally bound for New Delhi from Katmandu, the
capital of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in the emirates said negotiated for the release
of women and children without trying to hold the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will allow it to refuel and we will provide it with medical
aid and food if needed,'' Information Minister Abdullah bin Zayed
said. ``That airport is equipped with ambulances. We are not
interested in allowing them to stay for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines officials said Flight IC 814, which left Katmandu at
4:25 p.m. local time, 5:55 a.m. Eastern time, had a crew of 11 and
178 passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Associat- ed Press, the passengers included 150
Indians, eight Nepalese, one Canadi- an, one American, four Swiss,
four Spanish, one Belgian, a Japanese, one Austri- an, two French
and one Italian. Four passengers were not listed by nation- ality.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, which is usually a one-hour trip, was seized about
30 minutes after it took off and just as the plane crossed into
Indian airspace.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, armed with AK-47 rifles, grenades and knives that
they had apparently carried when they boarded in Nepal, first
ordered the pilot fly to Lahore, Pakistan. After Pakistani
authorities denied them permission to land, the plane was allowed
to land in nearby Amritsar, in northwestern India, because it was
running low on fuel, with 20 minutes of flying time remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In Amritsar, the hijackers appeared to panic after having warned
authorities that they would begin killing passengers if anyone
tried to approach the plane except to refuel it. Airport officials
said the gunmen opened fire while the aircraft was on the ground
and then, without waiting for refueling, ordered the pilot to take
off.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said later that the pilot reported to air
controllers that the hijackers had told him that they had killed
four people and had injured several others. &UR;  &LR; Airport workers who
went onto the plane to deliver food and water at one of its
refueling stops reported saw the bodies of four people.
</P>
<P>
   The plane again turned toward Lahore, sinking to an altitude of
just 500 feet before Pakistani officials finally agreed to let it
make an emergency landing on a darkened runway.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan had already sent army commandos to patrol the airport,
although officials tried hard to avoid having anything to do with
the plane. The airport manager, Ghulam Mustafa Mirani, told the
Agence France-Presse that the runway lights had been switched off
to prevent the plane from landing. Only when the plane was
dangerously close to a crash landing, Mirani said, did authorities
relent.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Islamabad said
permission was granted on humanitarian grounds after the pilot
reported that he was almost out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In Lahore, the hijackers demanded fuel and food but apparently
did not speak directly to officials. A spokesman for the
government, General Rashid Qureshi, said the hijackers made their
demands through the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   After 2 1-2 hours in Lahore, the gunmen ordered the pilot to fly
to Afghanistan, the authorities said. But it was denied landing
permission, and detoured to Dubai before returning and being
allowed to land at Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts speculated that the hijacking could be linked
to the disputed territory of Kashmir, the object of a long and
bitter struggle between India and Pakistan that heated up into a
military confrontation this year.

IN MODERN SPAIN, THE SIESTA FACES OBSOLESCENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ With Spain under pressure to conform to the
shorter lunch- break habits in most of the 14 other countries in
the European Union, its traditional workday _ with its three-hour
siesta break to eat and sleep _ is disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, large companies are cutting lunch to two hours and
corporate culture is turning against the concept of nodding off
during the day, seeing it as a sign of laziness.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Carranza Ortiz, the director of human resources for
one of Spain's largest banks, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, is clear on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who can take siestas do,'' he said. ``But those who are
really serious about working do not.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all Spaniards agree. Some openly rail at this
sort of thinking. Others have become closet nappers, sometimes
retreating to their cars or into nearby health clubs for a quick
snooze. Carranza had no sooner disappeared down the hall to his
next meeting when another bank official confided that he still
slipped home every day for a 30-minute rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very healthy,'' he said. ``You feel much better.'' But
please, he begged, he could not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The siesta question is a big issue here because abandoning the
midday snooze amounts to a radical change in a traditional way of
life. When the European Union tried in the early 1990s to get the
Spanish to take the tilde _ the squiggle over the letter n _ from
their keyboards to conform with the single market enshrined in the
Treaty of Rome, howls of protests went up. The European Union
eventually backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings about the siesta can run just as deep. The mayor of
Plasencia, a town in the western province of Caceres, was so
concerned about the growing noise during the lunch hour that he
issued an order calling for silence between 3 and 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Studies suggesting that naps are healthy are routinely trumpeted
in Spanish papers, proof that the rest of the world is finally
coming around to something that Spaniards long ago discovered. Last
summer, the national daily El Mundo devoted 10 pages to the
subject. It said that siestas in America were called ``power naps''
and it cited Levi Strauss, Ben &AMP; Jerry's and Mac World Magazine as
some of the companies trying out ``nap lounges.''
</P>
<P>
   The headline read: ``It's proven _ the siesta is beneficial, and
if in the United States they are starting to discover it, here it
continues to be part of the national heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   But even its proponents say the siesta is under attack on many
fronts. The economy is on the upswing, with more new jobs created
here this year than in any other country in the 15-nation European
Union _ 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   This has increased traffic in the cities and allowed young
people to move to the suburbs. More and more Spaniards are facing
long commutes, and increasingly women are joining the work force,
although the unemployment rate for women remains at 22 percent,
twice that for men.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all this means that popping home is getting harder. And
since couples are both working, no one is there cooking the hot
meal that usually preceded the siesta.
</P>
<P>
   The siesta has pretty much vanished from the cities of Latin
America, though some rural areas carry on, especially in the most
tropical climes. Last April it came to an abrupt halt in Mexico
City when President Ernesto Zedillo imposed a new schedule that
required officials to be at their desks from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m.
That has quickened a lengthy erosion in the siesta there.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish mattress company, Pikolin, which recently did a survey
on the subject, found that only 25 percent of Spaniards surveyed
still take a siesta and, unlike 50 years ago, few actually get into
bed anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The siesta is nothing more than a cliche for most working
people in Spain,'' said Juan Ignacio Perez-Nievas, the company's
marketing director. ``They do not have time for it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The survey indicated that the siesta is most popular among the
older generation and rarest for young people, particularly in the
most northern regions of Spain, where the weather is coolest.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many young people mourn the loss of the afternoon nap, which
they say gave a certain pace to the day and intimacy to their
parents' relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Suarez Santos, for instance, director of the labor
relations department of the powerful Spanish Employers'
Organization, said a siesta was out of the question for him.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez, 31, said he is really expected to have lunch with his
colleagues, talk about work and then get back to the office
quickly. He looks on the siesta, however, as something that
enhanced his parents' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had this time to go back home and talk to each other,''
Suarez said. ``They had two or three hours together in the middle
of the day to discuss what was going on in their lives. It gave a
coherence to the family. Now it seems there is less and less time
to talk. There is time at the end of the day, but somehow it is
perhaps not the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the workday in Spain is a bit chaotic these days. Big
department stores are open throughout the afternoon lunch break now
and remain open way into the evening, usually until 8:30 p.m. But
most small stores continue to close from 2 to 5 p.m. Almost
everybody knows someone who still has a three-hour lunch, someone
who has two hours and someone who is working an eight-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say that new collective bargaining agreements
are increasingly calling for continuous shifts, and many union
officials say they are glad about it. Otherwise, they say,
Spaniards tend to have a very long day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our people are up at 6 a.m. to get to work and then
they don't get home from work until about 9 p.m.'' said Antonio
Ferrer, the secretary of the General Workers' Union, which has
nearly 1 million members. ``Where else in the world do you have a
workday like that?''
</P>
<P>
   But many of those who still have the traditional Spanish day
like it that way. In the historic district of Madrid, Florencio
Cordoba, 46, closes his famous cape shop, Sesenin, at 2 p.m. and
goes home for three hours, where he changes into his pajamas, eats
his lunch and usually sleeps on the couch with the television on.
</P>
<P>
   Back to work at 5 p.m., he closes at 8:30 p.m. He considers the
siesta not only healthy, but a Spanish custom that should never be
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he sees the changes coming even in his own household. His
oldest daughter now works a continuous day, getting home at 6 p.m.
``She is always complaining she is tired,'' Cordoba said.
</P>
<P>
   And these days his wife has begun talking about going to work.
But he hopes she will not. ``I know that if she was not at home
everything would change,'' he said. ``We do not have two fancy
cars, but we have been happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some diehard nappers have just found creative ways of getting a
little nap in on a shortened lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   A chain called ``Masajes a 1000'' _ which offers busy Spaniards
a sort of McDonald's version of a siesta _ has opened 21 franchises
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At one of its newly opened health spas in downtown Madrid, the
lights were dim and all was quiet as four customers napped in
ergonomically correct chairs, wrapped in plaid blankets. Each had
paid $6 for a five-minute massage and a chance to take a half-hour
snooze.
</P>
<P>
   The occupant of one chair was Sara Ibanez, a 35-year-old
biologist. She happily leaned her head forward on the padded
cushion and fell asleep sitting up.
</P>
<P>
   Her employer, a Spanish pharmaceutical company, cut her lunch
break from three hours to two six weeks ago. She is understanding
about the company's need to have her at her desk when workers in
other European countries are at theirs.
</P>
<P>
   But she still wants her shut-eye. ``Afterward you have energy
for the rest of the day,'' she said.

A DECADE AFTER THE BERLIN WALL CAME DOWN, QUESTIONS ABOUT PUNISHING
EGON KRENZ  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Egon Krenz, who had the bad luck to become leader of
Communist East Germany three weeks before the Berlin Wall fell in
1989, is not going to prison without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Hunkered down on a recent December day in his comfortable home
on the east side of Berlin, he pleaded on the telephone in fluent
Russian for support from old allies in Moscow. He cited German and
European law from thumb-worn paperbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly he complained about being made a scapegoat. After years
of courtroom battles, he is supposed to start serving a six-year
sentence for his complicity in his government's policy of shooting
people who tried to escape to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is regrettable that there were deaths at the border,''
Krenz, 62, said sullenly. ``But I didn't divide Europe. I didn't
divide Germany. I didn't create the Iron Curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few miles away, a former comrade on the Politburo has
decided to stop arguing. Guenther Schabowski, 70 and ill with
diabetes, was effectively the old government's spokesman and was
prosecuted alongside Krenz. Unlike his former boss, Schabowski
quietly entered prison on Dec. 14 to serve a sentence of three and
a half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have absolutely nothing in common anymore,'' Schabowski
said in a brief interview before he entered prison. ``Krenz can do
what he wants and talk about `victor's justice.' But I don't see it
that way. I think the German courts are fully within their rights
to render a judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   These are two aging men who woke up on the wrong side of history
10 years ago. One is unrepentant and combative. The other is tired
and remorseful. Both are among the very few top-ranking former
Communist leaders punished for their deeds, and they embody the
uncomfortable debate in Germany about trying and jailing those who
served the old Communist government.
</P>
<P>
   Many Germans consider Krenz's rendezvous with prison long
overdue. German courts have prosecuted nearly 150 other former East
German officials, from lowly border guards up through the former
defense minister. Some have already completed their prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   Krenz took over from East Germany's longtime strongman, Erich
Honecker, just as the government was crumbling. Honecker, who had
cancer, escaped prosecution by arranging exile in Chile, where he
died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Many Germans, even those who reviled the Berlin Wall, are uneasy
about sending Krenz to prison. They worry that evidence of his
personal complicity in border shootings is weak, that he has been
convicted for what he represented rather than what he did. They
sympathize with his contention that he was convicted for actions
that were not illegal under the old government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was really a political decision,'' said Uwe Wesel, a
professor of civil rights law at the Free University in Berlin.
``Some of the other prosecutions were appropriate, because they
were against people who were in the leadership when decisions were
made that led to people being shot at the border, but with Krenz
and Schabowski, it was completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Wesel said, is that both men joined the
Politburo in the mid-1980s, long after the border policies were
decided. Neither played a direct role in the shootings, and it is
doubtful that either could have changed the policy, which Krenz
said was laid down in Moscow and ultimately depended on the Soviet
leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev enjoys considerable respect in Germany, though, as the
person who allowed the peaceful reunification of east and west.
</P>
<P>
   Krenz is a pariah. Aside from trying to put him in prison, the
German government is also trying to seize his spacious home,
contending that the purchase was never lawful and that the home
belongs to the state. Krenz has even been kept at arm's length by
the re-engineered successor to East Germany's old Communist Party.
Except for some occasional writing, he has been unemployed for
years.
</P>
<P>
   He gets little sympathy from people in his neighborhood of
Pankow. Though some neighbors are uneasy about the way he was
prosecuted, most say he deserves to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krenz should have been put before an East German court right
after the wall came down and should have been prosecuted by his own
people,'' said Frank Fischer, a 48-year-old truck driver who grew
up on the east side of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Lengsfeld, now a member of the German parliament who was
imprisoned in 1988 because of her public opposition to the
government's military policies, said: ``I look forward to the day
when we no longer have to be preoccupied with Krenz and his lies. I
think the verdict is entirely appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Krenz showed no remorse. ``I would rather be a hard-liner than a
soft egg,'' he said during a two-hour interview. A bookshelf of
decorative miniature books in his living room is dominated by the
writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Honecker.
</P>
<P>
   Krenz's greatest legacy may well be that he lived with one of
history's most notorious bumbles. On the evening of Nov. 9, 1989,
it was Schabowski who announced _ in error, as he later admitted _
that the Berlin Wall would suddenly be open to anyone who wanted to
cross.
</P>
<P>
   It was not what the Communist Party's governing Central
Committee had intended, but it was greeted by joyous mobs who
poured through the gates. Krenz, forced to choose between leaving
the gates open or blocking them with tanks, left them open.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent he feels guilty about anything today, Krenz said,
it is about the mistakes he made that night. ``From the point of
view of the German Democratic Republic, I was guilty on Nov. 9 of
letting events just flow and not guaranteeing the sovereignty of
East Germany,'' he said. ``But the courts would never prosecute me
for that. Instead, they are prosecuting me for the crimes of which
I am not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has charged that Krenz, Schabowski or a third defendant,
Guenther Kleiber, ever gave orders to shoot people at the border.
The main evidence of their personal complicity comes down to two
tangential votes taken by the Central Committee. One was a vote in
1986 to ``take note of'' a long speech by Honecker, which included
praise for the national police and border patrol. The other was a
vote in 1985 to accept a report from the Defense Ministry, which
noted that border guards had fulfilled their duty and would
continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Krenz contends above all that none of his actions were illegal
at the time. ``The German Democratic Republic was a legitimate
state that was accepted and existed alongside the old Federal
Republic of Germany,'' he said. ``Its laws were never challenged
before an international tribunal like the United Nations. But
suddenly, as soon as the GDR collapsed, it was delegitimized.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under Germany's reunification treaty in 1990, crimes committed
in the old East Germany were supposed to be prosecuted under that
country's laws. But West German courts ruled that the border
shootings, the most visible aspect of repression under the
Communist government, should be prosecuted as basic violations of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   A Berlin court sentenced Krenz in August 1998. A federal court
in Leipzig upheld the sentence in early November and ordered all
three defendants to surrender by mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   Schabowski did just that. Kleiber, another former Politburo
member who was sentenced to three and a half years, received a
short reprieve, because his wife is ill. Krenz got his respite on
Dec. 14, when the German supreme court said it wanted time to
evaluate his plea to remain free until his appeals were exhausted.
The court is expected to rule shortly after the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Krenz contends that the trial violated his own human rights, and
he is appealing his conviction to the European Court of Human
Rights in Strasbourg. His contention, rejected by the court in
Berlin, is that his government's border policies were decided
entirely in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our highest commander was Mikhail Gorbachev,'' he said. ``I
never saw any sign before 1990 that he was willing to accept
opening the border.''
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit for Krenz's trial in 1996, Gorbachev contended
that prosecution of top officials amounted to a ``witch hunt''
against people who actually contributed to reunification. ``The
question is whether there is any merit in making people, who were
partners not long ago, into scapegoats,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's reconstructed Communist Party, the Party of Democratic
Socialism, has also defended Krenz even as it has avoided any
active political association with him.
</P>
<P>
   Krenz, puttering about his living room, said his court trial
might as well have been in a foreign language for all the
misunderstandings. ``We may all speak German, but I felt we needed
a translator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schabowski freely accepted the court's jurisdiction
and gave a moving apology for his role in what he called a failed
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who died at the wall are part of the burden we inherit
from our misguided attempt to free humanity from its plagues,'' he
said at the time. ``As a former supporter and protagonist of this
world view, I feel guilt and shame when I think of those who died
at the wall.''

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ Russian media say Russian forces have
begun what is billed as the final assault on Grozny. By Michael R.
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN-SIESTA (Madrid, Spain) _ With Spain under pressure to
conform to the shorter lunch break habits in most of the 14 other
countries in the European Union, its traditional workday _ with its
three-hour siesta break to eat and sleep _ is disappearing. By
Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-KRENZ (Berlin) _ Egon Krenz, who had the bad luck to
become leader of Communist East Germany three weeks before the
Berlin Wall fell in 1989, is not going to prison without a fight.
By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PHONE-DEAL _ A few years ago, when an American company
was seeking a toehold in the newly privatized and potentially
lucrative Russian telecommunications market, it cut a secret deal
with directors and officers at the Moscow telephone company. By
Raymond Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   SKOREA-TENSION (Seoul, South Korea) _ Ever since war divided the
Korean peninsula in 1953, residents of this bustling capital city,
30 miles from the demilitarized zone, have lived with the threat
that Communist troops from North Korea could storm the border at
any time. But a decision by the United States military to
distribute 14,000 protective gas masks to American dependents
living in Seoul has raised concerns here that North Korea is
planning a major assault that will include chemical warfare. By
Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRALIA-ASYLUM (United Nations) _ During the last six months,
Australians have been surprised by an influx of people arriving in
small boats from Iraq and Afghanistan who, officials say, are first
being delivered to nearby Indonesian islands by smugglers from the
Middle East and then moved to Australia's north coast, where they
try to claim asylum. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-CHRISTMAS (Rome) _ On the first day of the 2000 Holy Year,
John Paul II delivered a Christmas speech Saturday that called for
repentance in the new millennium. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL-ERRORS _ Spurred by an Institute of Medicine report last
month, big employers, health care organizations, state regulators
and the federal government are stepping up pressure to revamp a
health care system that calls itself the best in the world yet
hides and ignores mistakes that kill tens of thousands of patients
a year. By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   NY-IMMIG (New York) _ Here at the end of the century, one in
three city residents is an immigrant and, of those, nearly half are
newly minted New Yorkers who arrived only in the last 15 years. Not
since 1910, at the peak of this century's great wave of immigration
through Ellis Island, has the ratio of newcomers been as high. By
Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   NY-CHANCELLOR-ASSESS (New York) _ As New York City seeks its
12th schools chancellor in 20 years, one question seems
inescapable: Can anybody do this job? By Jodi Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON-BABIES (Houston) _ In the last year, without any
apparent pattern, the Houston metropolitan area has experienced an
unprecedented rash of baby abandonment. The problem has baffled

answer: Why here? Why now? By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   RETIREE-EDUC (Los Angeles) _ Here at the Plato Society, an
educational haven for retirees, they prefer not to even call it a
class. Please, say study group. Teachers? Call them coordinators.
No papers, no tests. Just learning, for learning's sake. By Jodi
Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR-FIGHT (Spokane, Wash.) _ The 15-month struggle between
Kaiser Aluminum and the United Steelworkers of America is one of
the biggest, longest and fiercest labor disputes in years, but it
is far more than an old-fashioned labor war. It is a war of
attrition, a test of wills and a propaganda war against the
billionaire Texan who controls Kaiser, a man the union denounces as
a latter-day robber baron. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   EPA-COAL-POWER (New Haven, W.Va.) _ The Philip Sporn electric
plant here is one of the coal-fired plants cited by the EPA in a
suit filed last month against seven utilities that are charged with
violating the Clean Air Act, in what the agency says is one of the
largest investigations in its history. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-POLITICS (Austin, Texas) _ His father's failed re-election
effort stands as one of the most difficult episodes of George W.
Bush's life, a period when events seemed to spin out of his
family's control and he watched a man he reveres suffer the
ultimate public rejection. But, just as important, the loss carried
with it indelible lessons in the controllable and uncontrollable
ways a campaign can go wrong, and it has a clear bearing on the
kind of candidate Bush is today. By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-HIGHTECH (Washington) _ At a time when Congress is
bitterly divided and unable to reach consensus on issues like gun
control and health care, Democrats and Republicans are happily
reaching across party lines to pass legislation backed by high-tech
companies. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE-BUDGET (Washington) _ Flush with this year's first real
growth in military spending in more than a decade, Defense
Secretary William Cohen has quietly told all the services that in
drawing up this coming year's spending plan they must live within
the limits imposed in the current budget of more than $285 billion
and not expect additional increases. By Elizabeth Becker.
</P>
<P>
   RIVERS-AID-DISPUTE (Washington) _ From the vantage point of its
supporters, the Clinton administration's river restoration program
is flowing smoothly, carrying federal aid to the neglected reaches
of participating communities. To opponents, the program is an
illegal expansion of federal powers.

PRESIDENT BUSH'S BITTER DEFEAT SET COURSE FOR SON'S CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For months, George W. Bush had sensed what was
coming; he could see it in the news coverage of the campaign, feel
it in the restlessness of the crowds he addressed on his father's
behalf, hear it in acquaintances' apologies for their sudden
fascination with a political insurgent named Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush had tried, with intermittent success, to smile through
it all, because that was his role: the tireless cheerleader, the
dauntless optimist.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 p.m. on Nov. 3, 1992, there was no more pretending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exit polls look bad,'' Bush told his father, who had clung
to the belief that he might beat back Bill Clinton's challenge in
the end. Bush was actually underselling the truth. The exit polls
looked awful.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, hours later, when Bush listened to his father bid
goodbye to the presidency in a concession speech in a Houston
hotel, all the waiting and all the knowing that had preceded the
moment did not make it any easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember looking down at a White House photographer, a woman
who just had tears streaming down her face _ and mascara _ and then
I kind of looked at the ceiling,'' Bush said in a recent interview
here. ``If I'd looked at her, I would have been weeping like a
baby.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, his father's failed re-election effort stands as
one of the most difficult episodes of Bush's life, a period when
events seemed to spin out of his family's control and he watched a
man he reveres suffer the ultimate public rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But, just as important, the loss carried with it indelible
lessons in the controllable and uncontrollable ways a campaign can
go wrong, and it has a clear bearing on the kind of candidate Bush
is today.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he came to question the devotion of some of his
father's associates from inside the Beltway. Now, he entrusts his
own presidential campaign to a so-called ``iron triangle'' of three
longtime advisers in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   He saw his father tarred and feathered for agreeing to raise
taxes after saying he would not. Now, Bush seems to avoid emphatic
pledges that could come back to haunt him. He is also assiduous
about articulating the themes and priorities of his campaign and
reaching out to minorities, two things his father was criticized
for not doing well enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father's term in office _ and the campaign of 1992 _ have
had as much impact on the way he's been governor and his current
campaign as any other experience in his life,'' said Robert M.
Teeter, who managed the re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   That bitter year was also a case study of the traits that
distinguish the Bushes: their loyalty to one another, their stiff
upper lips, their potent belief in their own worthiness.
</P>
<P>
   It provided a similarly revealing glimpse of Bush, underscoring
his capacity for anger and especially his competitiveness, so keen
that he responded to his father's loss by insisting on a different
kind of victory and training for a marathon, the first and only one
he ever ran.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts, journalists and even some of Bush's
opponents have speculated that his current quest is in part an
effort to avenge his father's defeat. Bush has repeatedly laughed
at this suggestion, but it is a sensitive enough point among his
friends that one of them called a reporter to dispute it even
though the reporter had not broached the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, Joe O'Neill, a businessman in Midland, Texas,
who grew up with Bush, acknowledged that the way President Clinton
ended up comporting himself in office probably helped keep Bush's
emotional memory of 1992 alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ignominy of losing to this guy, in particular, probably
burns him,'' O'Neill said. ``He has no respect for Clinton morally.
And morals count in the Bush family.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Bush's tangle of motives, his friends and relatives say
that whatnessed in 1992 illustrated firsthand how quickly
and dramatically political winds can shift and how little can be
taken for granted. That perspective, they say, could stand him in
good stead over the months to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having seen his dad go through four national
campaigns, particularly the last one, has given George a very
realistic picture of what he faces,'' said former President Bush in
a written response to several questions that were submitted to him,
an interview format that he requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a bump in the road, I expect he will not be
thrown off course,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barbara Bush has described her husband's interest in
their eldest son's campaign as obsessive, the former president said
he did not butt in with unsolicited counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am available if George wants to ask my advice, but I was
then and he is now,'' President Bush said. ``I am yesterday. He is
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   President Bush receded into the past sooner than he wanted to,
sooner than anyone around him thought he would. Just a year and
half before the 1992 election, on the heels of the Persian Gulf
War, he had a stratospheric job approval rating of 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It dipped 20 points or so later in the year, but that seemed
little cause for worry. ``We went into the Christmas season
upbeat,'' George W. Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush also had more personal reasons to be happy,
because he was finally making the kind of name for himself that he
would need if he wanted to run for governor, a prospect that had
long been on his mind.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After living briefly in Washington to work on his father's
successful 1988 presidential campaign, Bush had returned to his
beloved Texas, settled in Dallas and put together a partnership
that bought the Texas Rangers baseball team and paved the path
toward the construction of a gleaming stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was the organization's managing partner and public face, an
exuberant presence not in some distant sky box but in a seat above
first base, where he beamed with pleasure as fans approached him
for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But as the new year began, his father's fate seemed increasingly
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush, more assertive by nature than his father, had
urged the president and his advisers to give the re-election
campaign an early, aggressive launching, it was not moving as fast
as it could have been, nor was it headed in a clear direction.
</P>
<P>
   A downturn in the economy showed no sign of abating. And
President Bush was still recovering from the departure of John H.
Sununu, his chief of staff, who was coaxed into resigning after
doing and saying things that embarrassed the president, an
unacceptable breach of loyalty in the Bush family's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Most ominous was the emergence of two protest candidates in
addition to the herd of Democrats ganging up on President Bush. The
first was Patrick J. Buchanan, whose attacks on the president in
the Republican primaries badly bruised him. The second was Perot, a
wealthy Dallas entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's business office was across the street from a
small building where Perot posters, yard signs and bumper stickers
were sold, and he had a perfect vantage point to observe the
activity there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing cars lined up, and these were nice, North
Dallas cars,'' Bush said. ``They should be screaming Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the drivers were people who were friendly with Bush or
his wife, Laura, and she said he called a few to seek explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say, `We love your dad, we love your dad, but we just
feel we've got to,''' Mrs. Bush said in a recent interview. ``And
when that started, there was no way to figure out what was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush conferred with Mary Matalin, the campaign's
deputy manager, as often as three times a day. He flew frequently
from Dallas to Washington to try to pump energy and confidence into
troops who seemed less spirited and focused than in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He also confronted the Republican opinion makers who were
expressing doubts about his father.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed to Ms. Matalin and to Bush that they could not
catch a break. President Bush's approval ratings sank lower, tugged
in part by the country's economic doldrums, which the president had
been slow to acknowledge. And the portrait of President Bush that
took hold in news coverage was that of an elite, weak leader
disconnected from the concerns of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This characterization, as much as anything else, devastated his
oldest son, who could not stand to see his father's character
impugned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They so love each other,'' Ms. Matalin explained. ``It's
something to behold. I've been in a million situations with the
father and son, and it's a movie _ I don't know how else to explain
it. The relationship is so complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of that closeness, George W. Bush loudly berated
reporters on a few occasions, demonstrating a temper that he has
since controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't act well,'' he conceded. ``I got frustrated because
of my dad. I got in some people's faces, out of frustration for
him, out of love for him, not out of disdain for the person. In
retrospect, those were such strong emotions for me, to see a good
man get whipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Bush family seemed amazed that voters might
prefer Clinton or Perot over a man with such a long and
distinguished political resume.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush scribbled in her diary, ``I do not know whether
George will survive this political year or not, but I do know that
he is the only stable person running.''
</P>
<P>
   The last weeks of the campaign were tense. Laura Bush said she
could still remember the dread she felt every morning when, in a
ritual that she and her husband continue to this day, he would go
to the front stoop to get the newspapers and bring them back to
bed. Too often, she said, the publications carried newly
discouraging polls or freshly critical editorials.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she and her husband used to watch the morning news
programs on television as well, but the habit died in fall 1992.
``We just didn't want to hear another bad story,'' she said. ``It
was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband said that he knew it was all over before the actual
moment of reckoning but that he tried not to let it show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect if he got down, he wouldn't burden me with that,''
his father said. ``We don't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, 1992, Bush was on the campaign plane with his father
on the way to Houston, where the whole family would gather for the
election. The Oak Ridge Boys, a vocal group that sometimes traveled
with President Bush, sang ``Amazing Grace'' at his request.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, as the returns trickled in, President Bush went to
buy a fishing reel. Ms. Matalin remembered that he also joined
George W. Bush and Jeb Bush, a younger son, in a game on the hotel
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most candidates sit on the phone all day,'' Ms. Matalin said.
``They were out there playing horseshoes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not that President Bush had stopped caring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe the emotions of something like this,''
he said in a Nov. 4 diary entry that was included in his recent
book of letters and other writings, ``All the Best, George Bush.''
``But it's hurt, hurt, hurt and I guess it's the pride, too.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush took 38 percent of the popular vote, to 43 percent for
Clinton and 19 percent for Ross Perot. The president's defeat,
oddly, made his oldest son's current candidacy possible. George W.
Bush said that he would not have felt comfortable about running for
governor of Texas in 1994 if his father had still been in office.
And without the five years he has spent as the leader of the
country's second most populous state, Bush would not be in a
credible position to seek the Republican nomination today.
</P>
<P>
   But in the days immediately after the election he was mainly
concerned with dissipating the frustration and disappointment he
felt. So he laced up his running sneakers, put on the grubby outfit
he typically used for exercise and hit the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   He ran too far and too fast, opening the window to a severe cold
and prompting a stern reprimand from his physician, who told him it
was ridiculous to shoot for the Dallas marathon in December. Bush
settled on the Houston marathon in January, still an ambitious
goal.
</P>
<P>
   His parents stood and waited at the 19-mile mark and, as Bush
remembered it, cheered him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some elderly women ahead of you!'' his mother
teased. ``Why are you running so slow?''
</P>
<P>
   His father just shouted, loudly and proudly, ``There's my boy!''

FLURRY OF BABY ABANDONMENT LEAVES HOUSTON WONDERING WHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By JIM YARDLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ They found the first baby in a hospital bathroom, a
crying newborn whose mother had disappeared. Five days later, a
family awoke to find another baby, only minutes old, on the front
porch. A third turned up a month later, and then a fourth was found
abandoned on a city street.
</P>
<P>
   The cases kept coming, and before long their number had reached
13: Three babies were left outside hospitals. A newborn wrapped in
a stained towel was found at a Holiday Inn. One baby boy was
discovered on the grounds of an elementary school, and another was
found on the street. Three babies were found dead, including a
newborn dropped into a trash bin behind a high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get a heads-up from the police that they'd gotten another
one, and I'd think, `Is this a bad joke?''' said Judy Hay, a
spokeswoman for Harris County Children's Protective Services. ``I
just couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, without any apparent pattern, the Houston
metropolitan area has experienced an unprecedented rash of baby
abandonment. The problem has baffled local officials, who say an
ordinary year might bring two or three cases and who are confronted
by a pair of questions no one can answer: Why here? Why now?
</P>
<P>
   There are almost no national data to put the problem into
context. Such cases are usually rare enough that most cities,
including New York, do not keep statistics on discarded babies, as
they are officially known.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Gray Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Child Welfare League,
an umbrella group in Washington representing more than 1,000 social
service organizations, said that like Houston, other large cities
usually saw only a few discarded babies a year. Precise figures
that might otherwise be kept, she said, are lumped into broader
categories of abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens all over the country, but what's happening in
Texas is different,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``For one city to have 13
is a little unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, a task force on baby abandonment, a group of public
and private officials trying to prevent what they consider an
aberration from becoming a trend, decided that the problem was
serious enough to merit an information campaign. Billboards aimed
at young mothers were unveiled across the city with a toll-free
number (1-877-904-SAVE) and a message: ``Don't Abandon Your Baby!''
</P>
<P>
   Public-service television and radio advertisements are planned,
and officials hope to publicize a new state law, enacted at least
in part because of the flurry of cases here, that encourages
mothers who are considering abandoning their babies to hand them
over to emergency medical personnel instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that this program will save lives,'' said one member
of the task force, Lester Tyra, the Houston fire chief.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hay, of the county's child protection agency, conceded that
there was no assurance the campaign would make a difference: other
organizations, public and private alike, already provide toll-free
numbers and services for mothers in crisis. Because it focuses
specifically on abandonment, she said, the new effort is a special
way of reaching needy mothers.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no geographic pattern to the cases here: babies
have been abandoned in the city proper, in three suburban counties
and in nearby Galveston. The heaviest flurry occurred in August and
September, when six babies were found. None have turned up since
then.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the police have found only four of the mothers, three of
them teen-agers. The assumption is that as a group, the mothers
involved in the 13 cases are poor and young, and were either
fearful of angering their parents or incapable of rearing a baby.
That 10 of the babies were found alive suggests that their mothers
wanted help for them.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the baby discovered on the front porch, Ms. Hay
said, the teen-age mother actually lived in the house, with
relatives who did not realize she was pregnant. She gave birth,
cleaned the baby, placed it on the porch and then pretended she had
discovered it. The baby is now in the care of a relative, and the
mother was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   The nine other surviving babies either have been adopted or are
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In the most highly publicized case, the dead newborn daughter of
a 15-year-old girl was discovered in August in a high school
garbage bin. The police say the baby was killed by multiple blows
to the head after birth, and the mother is now being prosecuted as
an adult on a murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who represents a
swath of inner-city Houston and helped organize the abandonment
task force, does not think the solution lies in the criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened about what happened to that lady,'' Lee said.
``She's indicted. I don't think she should have been indicted. She
needs help.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the public information campaign would bring attention
to the new state law, which took effect on Sept. 1 and provides
legal protection for mothers who turn over newborns to hospitals or
fire stations rather than abandon them. According to the district
attorney's office, the law makes prosecution very unlikely if the
baby is not abused and the mother turns it over within 30 days of
birth. The measure also streamlines the process of taking a newborn
into foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Grass-roots groups organized to find homes for discarded babies
have popped up over the years in Texas, Illinois, Florida and New
York. For the last several years, a San Antonio woman, Donna
DeSoto, who adopted a discarded baby, has operated a toll-free
number within Texas, 1-800-SAV-BABY. (She had to cancel a
nationwide number for lack of money.)
</P>
<P>
   While accounts of babies' being discarded _ dumped into trash
bins, placed on a stranger's stoop, left in a park _ can make a
splash in the news media, such cases amount to a small, mostly
unexamined corner of the broader problem of child abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   Far more common is the abandonment of newborns in hospital
maternity wards by drug-addicted or HIV-infected mothers. It was in
response to this matter that Congress created the National
Abandoned Infants Assistance Resource Center in 1988, a time when
these newborns, called ``boarder babies,'' frequently languished in
hospitals for months as officials struggled to find foster homes
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kharfen, spokesman for the Administration for Children
and Families, a federal agency, said that the boarder-baby crisis
had led to a great deal of research in the last decade, but that
far less attention had been paid to discarded babies. Kharfen said
the only statistic he could cite about discarded babies was
admittedly very unscientific: a database search of newspapers
across the country found 105 such cases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With so little information, the task force here has applied for
a $66,000 grant from a local foundation to study the problem and
find out what can be done to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The first step, officials say, will beto thoroughly interview
the four mothers who have been found and ask them a question: Why?

<P>
   Treating mental illness is not one of society's big priorities,
and public policy in the field often gets made in strange,
circuitous ways. Last June the president held the first White House
conference on mental illness; this month, Dr. David Satcher
released the first surgeon general's report on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the states that are responsible for funding and
treatment. And in New York, which has the nation's largest mental
health budget, recent policy changes come courtesy not of the
president or the surgeon general, but thanks to one violent
schizophrenic man, Andrew Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   When the president and surgeon general discuss mental health
policy, they sound cautious. They are not looking to commit new
federal money to a problem that has been the states' burden for 150
years. The surgeon general's key conclusions _ that one in five
Americans suffer some mental illness and that stigma is a main
obstacle to seeking care _ have been common knowledge for years.
</P>
<P>
   But when Goldstein pushed Kendra Webdale to her death on the
subway tracks last January, it set loose fear and outrage among the
public and forced state politicians to take action.
</P>
<P>
   Public policy ginned up in the heat of battle is often a mixed
blessing. Something gets done, thomay not have anything to
do with the crisis at hand. In the Goldstein case, some changes _
$215 million budgeted for more supervised housing, more case
managers and more beds for long-term state hospital care _ fit the
facts of the case. Other changes, like the passage of tougher
legislation to force resistant mentally ill people to comply with
treatment, may or may not be a good ideas, but had little to do
with Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   From the early news accounts of the killing it appeared that
Goldstein had repeatedly been offered mental health services, but
had refused treatment and medication. So the solution to preventing
future Andrew Goldsteins seemed to be an aggressive new commitment
law _ ``Kendra's Law'' _ and both the Republican governor and
Democratic attorney general quickly drafted legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Then an article in The New York Times in May examining
Goldstein's psychiatric record revealed a whole new set of facts.
Goldstein had frequently and voluntarily sought long-term and
short-term hospitalization, as well as supervised housing programs,
but was repeatedly rejected because there were no vacancies in a
system short of beds, programs and money.
</P>
<P>
   Whether tougher commitment laws even make a difference in
getting dangerous people off the streets is a hard public policy
question that has divided experts for years. In a mental health
system with scarce resources, to make room for an Andrew Goldstein,
do you wind up pushing out into the street someone else who is
equally troubled? In 1995, in an effort to assess whether New York
needed to change its laws, the state financed a three-year pilot
program at Bellevue Hospital with tougher commitment rules aimed at
the resistant mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The results of that study, completed a month before the killing
of Ms. Webdale, were inconclusive. Recently released documents make
it clear that the same Bellevue pilot program had two chances to
get Goldstein off the streets but let him go. By sheer coincidence,
he had visited the emergency room at Bellevue twice during the
pilot program. And even though this was the period when he was
regularly attacking strangers _ 13 in two years _ the psychiatrists
did not enroll him in the program. Each time, after a few days at
Bellevue, he was released to live on his own, unsupervised. A
tougher commitment standard had made no difference for the real
Andrew Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the facts did not matter. Certain personal tragedies
so unnerve the public _ the death of a Megan Kanka in New Jersey,
the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado _ that it
becomes almost impossible for politicians not to act, and in a
legislative instant new laws get made to register sex offenders, to
expand gun control, to commit more mental patients. On Aug. 27,
Gov. George Pataki signed Kendra's Law.
</P>
<P>
   That was just the beginning. By last summer the newly disclosed
facts of the Goldstein case justified what mental health advocates
had been arguing for years: a lack of state spending was crippling
the system. To cut costs, the state had set quotas for reducing the
patient population at every public hospital in New York, making it
extremely difficult to get long-term care. Goldstein was a perfect
example.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, after assaulting three staff members at a mental health
crisis program, he was hospitalized for eight months at Creedmoor
state hospital in Queens. But when he attacked 13 people in 1997
and 1998, his psychiatrists could not get him into a state hospital
for long-term care. Instead, he was admitted to short-term
hospitals, and usually discharged within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The low point came in June 1998 _ six months before he killed
Ms. Webdale. Goldstein was admitted to Brookdale, a short-term
hospital, after he struck a woman on a subway car. On his third day
at Brookdale, he attacked four hospital workers. Two weeks later he
struck a nurse's assistant. The Brookdale psychiatrists applied to
have Goldstein transferred for long-term care at Creedmoor. But the
hospital put him on a waiting list, a common stalling tactic used
at the time. Within days he was back on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   During the fall, Goldstein's trial kept public interest high and
encouraged the news media to seek changes in state policy. In a
rarity, The Times, The Daily News and The Post agreed in editorials
on the need to put a moratorium on the reduction of state hospital
beds, to finance more community housing programs and to support
Kendra's law. And Pataki listened.
</P>
<P>
   For a while the shark attack effect prevailed: if a mentally ill
person committed a violent act it was perceived as part of a
pattern _ another Goldstein _ and received prime news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But there are dangers when journalists instantly try to cast
news events in a public policy context. Last month, for example,
New Yorkers were riveted by accounts of the search for a mentally
ill homeless man who attacked a woman with a brick in midtown
Manhattan. It seemed like another tragic failure of the mental
health system _ another Goldstein! _ until the police arrested a
career crook with a drug habit who was neither homeless nor
mentally ill.

HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY FINDS EAGER SUITORS IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Mass, S.D., Calif., Wash., Vt., Ore., Utah, Okla.,
Miss.)  (dw) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a time when Congress is bitterly divided and
unable to reach consensus on issues like gun control and health
care, Democrats and Republicans are happily reaching across party
lines to pass legislation backed by high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech industry, at the same moment, is lavishing new
attention on Washington and changing its once-aloof posture toward
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats are both eager to win the loyalties of
high-tech companies and executives, knowing that they represent
untold jobs, wealth and, ultimately, votes and campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the industry has realized that the federal
government can do its members as much harm as good. Microsoft, and
its battle with the Justice Department, along with a spate of other
threatened legal problems, drilled this point home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft was a poster child for our industry,'' said Connie
Correll, director of communications for the Information Technology
Industry Council, a trade organization that represents America
Online, Dell and IBM, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the city the industry once eschewed _ along with
standard-issue, inside-the-Beltway practices like lobbying and
writing campaign checks _ is full of visiting high-technology
barons and marquee lobbyists who are working long hours to press
the industry's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   When representatives of Silicon Valley arrive in Washington they
often receive the kind of red-carpet treatment once reserved for
Hollywood stars. In September, Meg Whitman, the founder of the
auction site eBay, made her third trip to Washington this year. In
a single day, she met with more than 20 senators and House members,
dividing her attentions carefully between the political parties.
She was feted by Republicans at lunch and Democrats at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are stars,'' said Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, the
Louisiana Republican who heads the telecommunications subcommittee
that oversees many Internet start-ups. ``People want to know them,
touch them,'' added his colleague Rep. James P. Moran, a Virginia
Democrat.

   Like suitors cooling their heels on the front porch, Republicans
and Democrats on Capitol Hill have spent the last year doting on
the high-technology industry and its kingpins, often working in
rare harmony on issues dear to the heart of high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to get stuff through Congress at a time that
it is hard to do that,'' said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of
Netscape Communications who has now started his own company. It is
tough, he said, for members ``to be anti-high tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress granted the industry a three-year moratorium
on e-commerce sales taxes, increased the number of job visas for
high-tech workers and tightened restrictions on class-action
lawsuits against high-tech companies whose stock prices plummet.
This year, Congress extended a tax credit for research and
development to five years and limited lawsuits arising from Year
2000 computer failures, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   More complicated issues await Congress next year, including new
bouts on visas and taxation and a debate over expanding access to
Internet lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago you had a handful of bills that affected the
industry,'' said John Scheibel, the point person for Yahoo in
Washington. ``This year you have literally hundreds of bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats are unrelenting in their devotion
to the industry. Congressional Republicans point proudly to their
``e-contract,'' Democrats promote their ``e-genda.'' But the two
packages of bills have one thing in common _ they greatly benefit
the high-technology industry. In fact, high-tech issues are so
popular, the House and Senate both formed high-tech working groups
this year, and members virtually stampeded to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of interest is as high or higher than any other set
of issues I'm aware of,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic
leader from South Dakota. ``It's a new paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important victory for the industry this year was
passage of a bill that will limit lawsuits arising from Year 2000
computer failures. The measure, one of the few high-technology
issues of the year with partisan overtones, pitted big business,
which aggressively pushed for the measure along with the industry,
against trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup put Democrats in an uncomfortable position, because
trial lawyers are an important Democratic cash constituency. Still,
such is the power of the high-tech industry that enough Democrats
banded together to pass the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Then just before the recess came another victory. Moran and
other moderate New Democrats bucked their Democratic leaders to
help salvage a digital signature bill, which would give cyber
signatures the legal weight of ink-and-paper signatures. That
measure must still be reconciled with the Senate version next year.
Lawmakers also extended a crucial research and development tax
credit to five years from one year.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the digital signatures bill is a textbook
example of how the new politics of high-tech has changed the
workings, and the old alliances, in Congress. Just before Congress
went home for the holidays, 30 lobbyists piled into Moran's office
to try to resurrect the bill before the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew they needed our votes,'' Moran said. ``They realized
we understood the issue, and that we wanted to be helpful and that
we had the largest caucus in Congress _ 64 members.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats then banded with Republicans to defeat the
Democratic leadership bill, which included consumer protections the
industry deemed objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans looked on that Democratic battle with glee _ along
with the fight over Y2K lawsuits _ convinced many more would
follow, including next year's possible vote on China's trade
status.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the titans of the old economy, like the oil companies and
farmers, the high-tech sector has no particular home in Congress,
no single committee to fight its battles, like energy or
agriculture. Instead, it has a plethora of benefactors, working
across party lines to get things done on issues they consider
nonpartisan and nonideological.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to work hard to make technology issues Democrat or
Republican, liberal or conservative,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey,
a Massachusetts Democrat. ``It's not the Contras vs. the
Sandinistas.''

</P>
<P>
   That is an important change. In 1996, when Congress passed a
bill that would make it a crime to distribute indecent material on
the Internet, there was a partisan free-for-all in which social
conservatives rallied against pro-business Republicans and
Democrats. It was one of the first efforts Congress had made to
grapple with the Internet. The U.S. Supreme Court found the law
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, on many high-tech issues, it is not unusual to find a
liberal Democrat, like Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, working
closely with conservative Republican colleagues, like Sen. John
Ashcroft of Missouri and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, on encryption
legislation. Rep. Christopher Cox, a conservative Republican from
California, bonded with Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, in
battling efforts to tax sales on the Internet. Typically, these
coalitions hew to their constituents _ IBM is Vermont's largest
employer and Novell has its headquarters in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republicans David Dreier of California and Robert
W. Goodlatte and Thomas M. Davis III of Virginian, among others,
are viewed as industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   The bulging docket of high-tech issues had led to dramatic
growth in the industry's lobbying on Capitol Hill. Internet and
software companies have snagged some of Capitol Hill's best talent
this year _ former congressional aides whose expertise blends
technology and politics.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft built a large battery of lobbyists, beginning
two years ago, few other high-tech companies had Washington
lobbying operations. Suddenly, companies, including Yahoo and
Gateway, are opening Washington outposts, hiring lobbyists and
starting trade associations. In yet another coming-of-age gesture,
executives are beginning to dip into their spilling coffers to
write checks to political candidates and parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so critical that Silicon Valley be involved in Washington
right now,'' said Chris Larsen, the 39-year-old founder of E-Loan
who has made six trips here this year to meet with members. ``The
stakes are really high.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech lobbying has become so profitable that some
high-powered lobbyists are carving out specialty niches and
crossing party lines to do it. Edward W. Gillespie, a former policy
and communications director for Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House
majority leader, and Jack Quinn, Vice President Al Gore's former
chief of staff, have teamed up to start a firm.
</P>
<P>
   The two have worked together on legislation to ease encryption
export restrictions, a high priority for the high-tech industry.
Tony Podesta, the brother of John D. Podesta, White House chief of
staff, has also taken on a number of high-tech clients and even
renamed his firm Podesta.com.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable Washington names have been recruited. Michael D.
McCurry, the former White House press secretary, and Susan
Molinari, a former Republican congresswoman, are working in tandem
for iAdvance, a recently formed coalition that seeks to widen
access to broadband Internet lines. Various high-tech companies on
the West and East coasts have banded to form trade associations and
ad-hoc coalitions on various legislative issues.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley, meanwhile, has become a favorite destination for
lawmakers during the congressional recess. Members of both parties
have embarked on fact-finding missions to stay abreast of new
technology developments and the legislative issues they may spawn,
and, to mine for campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, still weary from budget wranglings on Capitol Hill, led
five colleagues, including his No. 2 man, Sen. Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, to the West Coast. They attended tutorials with
executives from Autoweb.com and Flextronics International, among
others, and came home with a bushel of campaign money from those
flush entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader,
touched down in Silicon Valley the next week with 12 colleagues.
The delegation raised even more money than the Republicans. Others
visited as well: Hatch, a Republican presidential candidate and
Microsoft nemesis, attended a glitzy fund-raiser; Sen. John Kerry,
Democrat of Massachusetts also visited. The list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, industry campaign contributions have not kept
pace with the rapid growth of the high-tech sector and are nowhere
near the size of other corporate giants like AT&AMP;T, or labor unions
or ideological groups like the National Rifle Association. ``For so
many millionaires and billionaires, it's still pretty scarce,''
said Davis, an industry ally and the chief Republican fund-raiser
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 1, the computer industry, including Internet
companies, gave more than $4.4 million through individual
contributions, political action committees and unregulated, soft
money. It gave double the amount for the first six months of this
year than in the same period in 1998. Fifty-four percent went to
Republicans, according to the Center for Responsible Politics, a
nonpartisan, nonprofit research group.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the high-tech industry has promised itself to no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the prettiest girl at the dance right now,'' said Ms.
Correll of the Information Technology Industry Council. ``Everyone
wants to curry favor with the high-tech industry.''

MULTIPLE EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO REDUCE MEDICAL-CARE MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Colo., Mass., Fla., Minn.)  (mk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spurred by an Institute of Medicine report last month, big
employers, health care organizations, state regulators and the
federal government are stepping up pressure to revamp a health care
system that calls itself the best in the world, yet hides and
ignores mistakes that kill tens of thousands of patients a year.
</P>
<P>
   Largely in response to the report, eight executives of some of
the nation's biggest companies, including General Motors and
General Electric, disclosed last week that they have formed an
organization they call ``The Leapfrog Group'' to encourage all
employers to make safe medicine a top priority of the health
insurance they provide their workers, and to steer workers to
hospitals that make the fewest mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, too, the Joint Commission on Accreditation
of Health Care Organizations, the independent group in Chicago that
accredits most of the nation's hospitals, will begin making
unannounced, random inspections in January. For years, the
commission has been accused of such close ties to the industry that
its inspections were little more than formalities that hospitals
could prepare for in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Upon release of the report, entitled ``To Err Is Human: Building
a Better Health System,'' the American Hospital Association and the
Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a nonprofit research
group, announced a project to reduce the incidence of errors
arising from medication.
</P>
<P>
   The government has responded with the same urgency. President
Clinton seized upon the report to order federal health agencies to
reduce the number of errors by 50 percent in five years. Three U.S.
senators said they would schedule hearings into medical errors
early next year, and many state regulators say they will step up
efforts to detect and fix error-prone practices.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the reactions to the report by the Institute of
Medicine, a part of the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's
top scientific advisory group, represent the most ambitious effort
ever to confront mistakes in the nation's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely the future,'' said Dr. Howard Koh, the
public health commissioner for Massachusetts. ``It's a paradigm
shift. We view this as a new way of looking at adverse outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ``singling out practitioners to blame,'' Koh said the
industry could develop safer ways to deliver care. As an example of
the kind of systematic planning that could help, he said
intravenous solutions could be mixed in the pharmacy by
pharmacists, rather than be left to nurses on the hospital floor.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the report suggested that medical errors kill
44,000 to 98,000 people a year. Though these numbers were
previously known in the world of health care, the report has had a
galvanizing effect, because of the academy's prestige and the
professional expertise and nonpartisan credibility of the report's
authors, who include prominent physicians, hospital officials and
executives of health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The report called for sweeping changes in the health care
system, including mandatory disclosure of serious mistakes leading
to death or injury, voluntary disclosure of less serious mistakes
and the five-year, 50-percent error- reduction goal that the
president promptly endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   It urged Congress to create a National Center for Patient Safety
to collect the reports and identify the flaws in the system _ like
an emergency room doctor who falls asleep on the job after working
48 hours straight saving lives _ that, the institute says, lead to
most errors.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators typically inspect hospitals no more than once a year
and doctors' offices hardly ever. The institute, in effect, urges
continuous scrutiny and reporting of flaws in patient care by
everyone on the staff of a health care facility.
</P>
<P>
   With its emphasis on gathering information and using it to
develop better processes, said Dr. John R. Lumpkin, director of the
Illinois Department of Public Health, ``We're talking about a
traumatic transformation about how health care is delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the momentum, patient advocates and some regulators
warn that for most hospitals and physicians a culture of
defensiveness and secretiveness is dug in deep, and will be
difficult to change. They pointed out that for years, some states,
like New York, California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Florida,
have mandated hospital disclosure of serious mistakes and worked
with health care providers to identify the missteps leading to
them. But little reduction in the incidence of mistakes has
resulted.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that some doctors have their own wall of silence,
not unlike that of police officers, and are reluctant to report
colleagues who make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't tell on each other,'' said Anna Polk, director of
the Agency for Health Care Administration in Florida. Ms. Polk
oversees one of the nation's oldest and most comprehensive systems
to report and prevent errors, yet one that she said the culture
obstructs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong back current that keeps people from being
entirely honest,'' Ms. Polk said. ``It's a very old culture. It's a
very longstanding culture.'' A physician who discloses another
physician's mistake, she said, faces ``almost certain retribution,
like losing referrals. We've seen that over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said that the report does not go far enough in making
demands on the health care industry. ``The report is a very good
start,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health
Research Group, a patient advocacy group. But in not insisting on
more autopsies, he said, the authors overlooked a vital source of
information about medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of patients who die in hospitals receive
autopsies, compared with more than 40 percent 30 years ago, so the
doctor who signs a death certificate can attribute the death to
causes other than his or his colleague's mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the disclosure rules described in the report become a
reality, they will be tough to enforce. Since early this year, for
example, Colorado has been listing unusual ``occurrences'' in
hospitals without naming names or assigning blame, on the Web page
of the Department of Public Health and the Environment. But nearly
all of those listings, 44 pages of 300- and 400-word detailed
accounts, involve patient and staff behavior, like altercations and
sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   New York state, which has some of the toughest reporting
requirements, says that thousands of problems, many of them errors,
have occurred since the current system was adopted in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, state records disclose 410 unexpected deaths since
then, 33 cases of surgery performed on the wrong patient, 138
instances of leaving foreign objects behind in patients' bodies
after surgery, 25 cases of patients who were wrongly administered
radioactive material, 2,093 unintended procedure-related injuries
requiring repairs and more than 10,000 cases of unplanned
reoperations or returns to operating rooms because something went
awry.

</P>
<P>
   For their part, physicians say they are too often blamed for
mistakes that are really systemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about all American society,'' said Dr. Dennis S.
O'Leary, president of the commission that accredits hospitals and
other health care institutions. ``We have a blame-and-punishment
society. When something goes wrong, we want a hanging. That's not a
climate that favors voluntary reporting of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, a Texas physician and recent president of
the American Medical Association, said that doctors endorse much of
the report and that through its National Patient Safety Foundation,
the association encourages the kind of system analysis that the
institute urged rather than looking for culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have concerns about reporting mechanisms,'' Dr. Dickey
said, ``and would want to see nonpunitive and confidentiality
measures'' included in any new system. Still, she said, the
reporting should be voluntary. ``We are opposed to mandatory
reporting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, the association stands apart from nearly all
the other medical institutions that have responded to the the
institute's report. The American Hospital Association, often an AMA
ally in opposing tighter government regulation, supports mandatory
disclosure of serious mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in our mind that there needs to be a
better reporting system, a national reporting system,'' said
Richard Wade, senior vice president of the hospital association.
``We have questions about how it would work and about liability.
But there probably needs to be mandatory reporting of serious
events.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the efforts of regulators, big business may have
tremendous influence on whether or not the academy's suggestions
are followed.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of years, health care executives of several major
companies and representatives of big California and Minnesota
employers have been meeting to explore ways of exploiting their
clout as buyers of health services to improve service.
</P>
<P>
   Since the release of the Institute of Medicine's report, the
Business Roundtable, the organization of the chief executives of
most of the nation's 100 biggest companies, has allocated funds for
the group to open an office and hire staff.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Leapfrog group, Bruce Bradley, director of
managed care plans at General Motors, said the goal is to write ``a
common agenda to drive quality improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary Jane England, director of the Washington Business Group
on Health, an association of large-company health program
executives, said, ``Employers do not want their employees maimed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want them at work,'' she said. ``They have learned how to
use engineering to improve processes to hold down costs and improve
quality. It's a systems issue. It's not new. We just haven't put it
in place in the medical community.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wetzell, a member of the Leapfrog Group and executive
director of the Buyers Health Care Action Group, which coordinates
employee insurance coverage for big Minnesota companies, said that
abundant analysis already shows that hospitals that perform the
same surgical procedures thousands of times make fewer mistakes
than those who rarely perform the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   So to encourage safer medicine, he said, businesses would give
workers incentives to use the more experienced hospitals. ``From an
employer's perspective,'' Wetzell said, ``this is a no-brainer. It
saves money and employees get better faster.''

<P>
   With the Vermont Supreme Court's bombshell ruling last week
stopping just short of legalizing gay marriage, it might be said
that the ``courtroom period'' of the national movement for same-sex
marriage has all but ended for now. With no major marriage cases
left pending in other states, the battle, all agree, shifts to
legislatures and the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But in its wake, some legal experts say, the ruling leaves
fodder for a long-running debate: How effective are courts at
bringing about social change?
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Koppelman, assistant professor at the Northwestern
University School of Law, who has argued that a ban on gay marriage
amounts to sex discrimination, noted that a colleague cites gay
marriage as an example of how courts cannot counter public opinion:
In both Hawaii and Alaska, he says, judicial moves toward
permitting gay marriage were blocked by popular initiatives in
which nearly two-thirds voted to protect traditional definitions of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast, he says, he believes the Vermont ruling shows
how litigation can help bring about social change. The court
``understood both its power to reshape culture and its political
limitations,'' he says. ``It did no more than nudge the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's court told the Legislature that it must either
legalize gay marriage or fully equalize the benefits gay and
heterosexual couples receive. And it retained jurisdiction over the
case to ensure that its order was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   A model often used by gay rights advocates like Evan Wolfson,
head of the national Freedom to Marry Coalition, is the ban on
interracial marriage in the 1960s, which was abolished by judges
even while public opinion polls showed most people still
disapproved of interracial unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have to remember it was the courts that ended race
discrimination in civil marriage, not the people and not the
legislatures first,'' Wolfson said. ``But having said that, I
believe that the polls show, and the growing support shows, that
fair-minded people in this country, the persuadable middle, are
ready to support equality and inclusion for lesbians and gay men if
the legislatures will show some leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of gay marriage disagree that the public is so ready,
and some brand the Vermont decision ``judicial tyranny.'' But they
emphasize that even in such a ``tyrannical'' mode, the courts are
held back by the weight of public opinion and cannot push it too
hard even if they want to.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the conservative American Center
for Law and Justice, pointed out that Vermont's finding that gay
couples were discriminated against could reasonably have led the
justices to rule that gay couples should simply be granted marriage
licenses. But the justices did not, though one dissenting justice
said they should have. Sekulow said, ``You ask yourself, `Gee, why
didn't they issue the marriage license? What stopped them from
taking that step?' They react as if they have a sword of Damocles
over their heads and they don't want to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   That reluctance, he said, stemmed from the awareness that
Vermonters were not ready for gay marriage _ and, according to
public opinion polls, most particularly do not believe that the
decision about gay marriage should be made by the courts rather
than the people or the lawmakers. The ruling, he said, was a
``dodge-the-bullet opinion.'' The Vermont Legislature will convene
next month, and is expected to invite testimony on how to equalize
benefits for homosexual and heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to follow the debate over gay marriage should
also keep an eye on Hawaii, where, gay rights advocates say, the
issue of gay partnership is alive despite the state Supreme Court's
recent ruling that the same-sex marriage question was moot because
voters had passed an initiative that favored limiting marriage to
man-woman unions.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's lawmakers, Wolfson said, will reconvene next month
still facing a court finding similar to Vermont's: homosexual
couples are discriminated against. Its lawmakers thus face a
decision about finding a remedy similar to the one their colleagues
in Vermont must make _ without the option of marriage. The third
place to watch is California, where a major fight over a ballot
initiative is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   The language on the state's Proposition 22, which will be voted
on in March, is quite simple: ``Only marriage between a man and a
woman is valid or recognized in California.''
</P>
<P>
   But gay rights advocates see the initiative as a threat that
goes far beyond marriage, threatening gains in areas like domestic
partner benefits and adoption. Kate Kendell, executive director of
the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said that in contrast to
the progress seen in Vermont, Proposition 22 ``would be the
beginning of rolling back the very basic elementary protections our
families here have been able to achieve in the last two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states may turn into lesser battlegrounds as well,
although no other major marriage lawsuits are pending. Laws against
gay marriage have been passed in 27 states, along with initiatives
in two more. But groups opposed to gay marriage are calling for a
push to get statutes against gay marriage passed in the 20 or so
remaining legislatures in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   One of those groups, the Family Research Council, is also
``urging people to resist sex-partner subsidies at every level,''
said spokesman Robert Knight, referring to domestic partnership
benefits. The council will also be pushing corporations to drop
domestic partner benefits, he said, and lobbying the public against
them as well.

that the ``courtroom period'' of the national movement for same-sex
marriage has all but ended for now. With no major marriage cases
left pending in other states, the battle, all agree, shifts to
legislatures and the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But in its wake, some legal experts say, the ruling leaves
fodder for a long-running debate: How effective are courts at
bringing about social change?
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Koppelman, assistant professor at the Northwestern
University School of Law, who has argued that a ban on gay marriage
amounts to sex discrimination, noted that a colleague cites gay
marriage as an example of how courts cannot counter public opinion:
In both Hawaii and Alaska, he says, judicial moves toward
permitting gay marriage were blocked by popular initiatives in
which nearly two-thirds voted to protect traditional definitions of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast, he says, he believes the Vermont ruling shows
how litigation can help bring about social change. The court
``understood both its power to reshape culture and its political
limitations,'' he says. ``It did no more than nudge the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's court told the Legislature that it must either
legalize gay marriage or fully equalize the benefits gay and
heterosexual couples receive. And it retained jurisdiction over the
case to ensure that its order was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   A model often used by gay rights advocates like Evan Wolfson,
head of the national Freedom to Marry Coalition, is the ban on
interracial marriage in the 1960s, which was abolished by judges
even while public opinion polls showed most people still
disapproved of interracial unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have to remember it was the courts that ended race
discrimination in civil marriage, not the people and not the
legislatures first,'' Wolfson said. ``But having said that, I
believe that the polls show, and the growing support shows, that
fair-minded people in this country, the persuadable middle, are
ready to support equality and inclusion for lesbians and gay men if
the legislatures will show some leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of gay marriage disagree that the public is so ready,
and some brand the Vermont decision ``judicial tyranny.'' But they
emphasize that even in such a ``tyrannical'' mode, the courts are
held back by the weight of public opinion and cannot push it too
hard even if they want to.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the conservative American Center
for Law and Justice, pointed out that Vermont's finding that gay
couples were discriminated against could reasonably have led the
justices to rule that gay couples should simply be granted marriage
licenses. But the justices did not, though one dissenting justice
said they should have. Sekulow said, ``You ask yourself, `Gee, why
didn't they issue the marriage license? What stopped them from
taking that step?' They react as if they have a sword of Damocles
over their heads and they don't want to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   That reluctance, he said, stemmed from the awareness that
Vermonters were not ready for gay marriage _ and, according to
public opinion polls, most particularly do not believe that the
decision about gay marriage should be made by the courts rather
than the people or the lawmakers. The ruling, he said, was a
``dodge-the-bullet opinion.'' The Vermont Legislature will convene
next month, and is expected to invite testimony on how to equalize
benefits for homosexual and heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to follow the debate over gay marriage should
also keep an eye on Hawaii, where, gay rights advocates say, the
issue of gay partnership is alive despite the state Supreme Court's
recent ruling that the same-sex marriage question was moot because
voters had passed an initiative that favored limiting marriage to
man-woman unions.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's lawmakers, Wolfson said, will reconvene next month
still facing a court finding similar to Vermont's: homosexual
couples are discriminated against. Its lawmakers thus face a
decision about finding a remedy similar to the one their colleagues
in Vermont must make _ without the option of marriage. The tlace to watch is California, where a major fight over a ballot
initiative is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   The language on the state's Proposition 22, which will be voted
on in March, is quite simple: ``Only marriage between a man and a
woman is valid or recognized in California.''
</P>
<P>
   But gay rights advocates see the initiative as a threat that
goes far beyond marriage, threatening gains in areas like domestic
partner benefits and adoption. Kate Kendell, executive director of
the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said that in contrast to
the progress seen in Vermont, Proposition 22 ``would be the
beginning of rolling back the very basic elementary protections our
families here have been able to achieve in the last two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states may turn into lesser battlegrounds as well,
although no other major marriage lawsuits are pending. Laws against
gay marriage have been passed in 27 states, along with initiatives
in two more. But groups opposed to gay marriage are calling for a
push to get statutes against gay marriage passed in the 20 or so
remaining legislatures in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   One of those groups, the Family Research Council, is also
``urging people to resist sex-partner subsidies at every level,''
said spokesman Robert Knight, referring to domestic partnership
benefits. The council will also be pushing corporations to drop
domestic partner benefits, he said, and lobbying the public against
them as well.

<P>
   For all the hype, the panic and the prophecies, the occasion is
real. This New Year's Eve feels different, no matter how arbitrary
the date announcing the new millennium may be. The big round number
about to invade our diaries and our lives has an undeniable
symbolic force.
</P>
<P>
   Is this mere superstition, the kind that stops us from walking
under ladders? Perhaps not entirely, for while our systems for
measuring time may be arbitrary, they are also necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Living in seemingly infinite time and space, we humans are
mortal and finite, and we cannot get along without borders and
markers to make the world graspable to our minds.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmund Freud famously opined that ``There is no time in the
unconscious,'' but as soon as we gain consciousness, we begin to
sense and search for shapes and patterns in the continuum of time.
Some of these are determined, or at least strongly influenced by,
the nature of our nature. We experience divisions of time through
the progression of the sun, the alternation of night and day, the
rhythm of our heartbeats, the limits of human life. Richard Fortey,
a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London and the
author of ``Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion
Years,'' believes that an experiential sense of time is encoded
into living creatures. Small mice, whose life spans are very short,
for example, probably ``perceive time in accelerated way,'' Fortey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The human ``appreciation of time,'' he notes, ``is still
governed by the old three-score and ten'' biblical life span and
that frame ``enables us to relate to time on a certain scale.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the tempo of human activity may be to some extent
determined by our bodies (although, as Fortey observes, some
hyperactive humans nowadays seem to live ``on mice-time''), our
conceptions of time are highly elastic, ranging from the light
speed of intuition to the poet's intimation of eternity. In our own
century, our awareness of time has undergone extreme contractions
and enormous expansions, as instruments for measuring time have
become ever more precise, and as our knowledge of the earth's
history continues to be extended. Fortey, who has called himself
``a historian of the last 200 million years,'' nevertheless admits
that the eons of geological and evolutionary time remain difficult
to comprehend even for him, and that he finds the names of
geological periods _ Cambrian, Ordovician, and so on _ helpful in
giving concreteness to the numbers he works with. To this, we might
add our increasing consciousness of the subatomic world and the
universe itself, with their units of time so unfathomably
infinitesimal and incomprehensibly immense as to bring the
imagination to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason, perhaps, why we need not only to measure
time but, in the words of Randall Styers, assistant professor of
philosophy of religion at the Union Theological Seminary, ``to
invest it with meaning.'' Styers notes that the function of the
liturgical calendar, of which the Christian calendar is just one
instance, is ``to give shape to the passing of time'' by endowing
certain days or phases of the year with special significance. The
importance of ritual dates such as Christmas or Easter, in Styers'
view, is not so much to commemorate real events _ the actual date
of Christ's birth, for example, is a matter of considerable dispute
_ as to ``reflect important moments for the community and take the
community through its story, its own self-definition.''
</P>
<P>
   The calendar, in any culture and tradition, delineates the
contours of seasonal and shared time. Art, and especially music, is
a more individual means of molding time and giving a kind of shape
and meaning to our thoughts and emotions. For Steve Reich, a
composer and an observant Jew, religious and musical understandings
of time are salient, and to some extent interconnected. For him,
the liturgical form of the week, particularly the culminating point
of the Sabbath, provides a spiritually refreshing counterpoint to
the hurly-burly of contemporary secular time. And, even without
overt religious content, the temporal form of music, he says, is
``what saves me and other composers from mental breakdown.'' The
underlying beat of any piece of music functions as ``an abstract
grid without which you would be sliding around in nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the year 2000, then, what kind of a marker and
milestone is it? It suggests a measure and a meaning; and on both
these scores, it belongs to the scale of time, which for us is the
central one _ the scale of human history. It's true that the date
derives from what was originally the Christian calendar, which was
not established until the sixth century A.D. But the Common Era
calendar, as it has come to be known, was officially adopted by the
United Nations, and therefore has become, in effect, the global
standard. Within this context, 2000 no longer refers to the
cyclical, ritual time of a particular faith, but to the more linear
chronology of historical time.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is historians themselves, accustomed as they are
to the capriciousness of dating, who are often most resistant to
the fascination of round numbers. Norman Davies, the author of
``Europe'' and ``The Isles,'' notes that ``professional historians
now rarely pay attention'' to the commonplace divisions in their
structuring of the past. For example, the 19th century has been
called by some historians ``the long century,'' and has had its run
extended to 1914; while our own 20th has sometimes been shrunk to
``the short century,'' lasting from the outbreak of World War I in
1914 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, then, cannot quite do away with epochs or eras, even
if theirs are modifications of the popular versions. But it's the
ringing punctuations of decades, centuries and millennia that
resonate in the world. They help us locate and orient ourselves in
the ever lengthening progress of human history.
</P>
<P>
   A millennium, especially, is a span of time to encourage wonder
and contemplation of the centuries it contains. Without such
signposts, our accumulated heritage might scramble itself into an
indiscriminate mass of facts, or recede into Shakespeare's ``dark
backward and abysm of time.'' With their symbolic aid, we might
just be able to reflect on the patterns of the human past, and
therefore conceive of a plausible human future.

   Have a good one.

KOREANS SEE DARK SCENARIO IN A U.S. PRECAUTION _ GAS MASKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Ever since war divided the Korean peninsula
in 1953, residents of this bustling capital city, 30 miles from the
demilitarized zone, have lived with the threat that Communist
troops from North Korea could storm the border at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite doomsday scenarios that North Korea would attack this
city of 10 million people with every imaginable weapon, including
chemical and biological agents, few residents have taken such dire
predictions seriously, and for seemingly good reason.
</P>
<P>
   About half a million South Korean soldiers are guarding the
border, backed up by 37,000 American servicemen and some of the
most sophisticated military technology available. Recently, North
Korea has seemed more interested in diplomacy than making war.
</P>
<P>
   But a decision by the U.S. military in November to distribute
14,000 protective gas masks to dependents of American soldiers and
embassy staff members living in Seoul has raised concerns here that
despite its new diplomatic tone, North Korea is planning a major
assault that will include chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard that the United States was issuing gas
masks to its citizens in Seoul, I was deeply troubled because our
government has no plans to do the same,'' said Lee Shin-Bom,
chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the opposition Grand
National Party. ``I asked myself what does the United States know
that our government isn't telling us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States says that the decision is not tied to
any increased threat or impending attack by North Korea, rumors
have spread across Seoul that an assault is imminent and is likely
to occur sometime near the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid,'' said Kim Yong-Shik, a taxi driver who was
waiting for a fare near the U.S. military base at Yongsan. ``None
of us have gas masks like the Americans. We are like sitting
ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korean and U.S. military intelligence officials said in
recent interviews that North Korea had large stocks of chemical
weapons and missiles and artillery shells to carry those weapons to
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Should chemical warfare be used against an unprotected civilian
population in Seoul, enormous casualties would result, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of North Korea's chemical warfare capability vary
widely. A South Korean defense ministry report issued in October
estimated that North Korea's chemical and biological arsenal was
2,500 to 5,000 tons, including nerve gas, blistering agents and
anthrax. The ministry's latest figures were a fivefold increase
over last year's, which the ministry said were grossly
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials said that equipping the public with
protective masks could reduce the number of civilian casualties and
injuries to about one-tenth.
</P>
<P>
   But very few residents of Seoul own gas masks, and neither the
state nor local governments have plans to distribute them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are recommending that individual citizens purchase their
own gas masks to guard against an attack of chemical and biological
warfare from North Korea,'' said Chun Jung Soo, head of the gas
mask distribution team at Seoul City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't started any massive campaigns yet because this
would obviously lead to a panic among Seoul citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Chun said that although residents could buy gas masks from a
booth at City Hall or at retail outlets for about $25, sales were
low because most Koreans ``don't believe that a war will actually
break out.''
</P>
<P>
   Seoul city government plans to distribute about 1.7 million gas
masks over the next 10 years to civilian defense squad leaders,
volunteers who supervise neighborhood evacuations in the event of
an attack or other emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The city government said that it had distributed about 300,000
masks to defense squad leaders and that recent surveys indicated
that about 200,000 Seoul residents had bought gas masks on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Chun said the city government hoped that the U.S. military's gas
mask program would increase awareness among South Koreans of the
importance of masks.
</P>
<P>
   Col. David R. Apt, public affairs officer for the U.S. Forces
Korea, said that distributing gas masks to dependents of military
personnel was part of the Pentagon's effort to improve protection
of noncombatants stationed overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the ability to provide your dependents with this
protection, you'd be negligent not to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military is issuing M-17A2 masks and hood systems,
which are used by many active duty forces around the world to
protect against chemical warfare. It is the first time that such
protection is being provided for noncombatants in South Korea,
which is a test case for other U.S. military installations.
</P>
<P>
   Apt emphasized that the plan was not related to any specific
event and had been in the works for more than a year. He said that
the United States had deliberately delayed distribution of the
masks until November, when relations between North Korea and the
rest of the world seemed to be improving.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, North Korea has engaged in talks with officials
from the United States, Japan and Europe in what appears to be an
effort to improve its foreign relations, after decades of isolation
and hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo Suk-ryul, a defense expert for the Korea Institute for
Foreign Affairs and National Security, said that North Korea's vast
arsenal of chemical weapons posed a great threat that should not be
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo said that since foreign governments had already persuaded
North Korea to abandon its nuclear and long-range missile programs
in exchange for concessions, chemical weapons were now likely to
become the major issue in dealing with the Stalinist country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North has plenty of weapons, and if they decided to use
them, many South Korean people would be sacrificed,'' Yoo said.
``The bottom line is that everyone needs to be prepared to use a
gas mask.''

   E-nuff already. It is the surest sign that the Internet is
totally mainstream: Everyone is tired of it, not just the
sleep-starved workers at dot-com startups, but everyone _ man and
beast alike. Turn on the television and you are assaulted by an
endless parade of jabbering advertisements for e-commerce
companies. Newspapers are so bloated these days with ads for
dot-com marketers that dogs across the nation must be loosening
their teeth and straining their necks to fetch them.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of the times was Time magazine's selection last
week of Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, the big online retailer of
everything from books to toys, as its ``Person of the Year.''
Time's cover headline declares, ``E-commerce Is Changing the Way
the World Shops.'' Inside is a large picture of Bezos' face,
doctored with a white ``e'' inserted in his left eye. ``An Eye on
the Future,'' says the accompanying headline. Though Bezos is worth
$10 billion, he doesn't really care about the money, Time says. And
a Time reporter says that Amazon's workers are ``all imbued with
this giddy faith that their best days lie ahead of them.''

   Innovations in technology and communications _ the telegraph,
telephone, automobile, airplane and others _ have often touched off
waves of optimism and exuberant claims about how the new thing is
going to transform society. In the 1920s, for example, as the
airplane moved beyond the Red Baron stage and started to become
used for carrying civilian passengers, there was a lot of talk of
every household's having a personal airplane in its garage. That
strain of euphoria was called ``air-mindedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology historians remain skeptical that the Internet age can
match the period from about the 1880s to 1910 in terms of its
impact on people's lives. Inventions and new products from that
period of technological dynamism included Bessemer steel making,
refrigeration, the light bulb, the phonograph, the telephone, the
radio, the automobile and the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the historians say, there does seem to be one truly
distinctive feature about the present. ``I don't think there has
ever been anything like the Internet and cyberspace craze in terms
of media hype,'' said Robert Post, a technology historian and a
former curator at the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The use and abuse of a single vowel _ ``e'' _ also seems without
precedent. And IBM is largely to blame. Since Lou Gerstner took
over in 1993, IBM had been trying to give its image as a mainframe
dinosaur a makeover. By 1995, it was apparent that the Internet was
the future, and the company began promoting itself first as an
expert in ``network-centric computing,'' then ``network computing''
and then ``Internet solutions'' _ before settling on ``e-business''
in fall 1997. Rivals scoffed at first, and then scurried to copy
IBM when the marketing campaign caught on.
</P>
<P>
   By now, all the Internet stories seem familiar _ of dot-com
millionaires, or billionaires, of young people fleeing business
schools, investment banks and consulting firms to join the Internet
gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ruettgers, the president of EMC, which sells the big data
storage equipment used by so many e-commerce companies, was
rummaging through his briefcase recently and pulled out a family
picture. It showed his daughter at New York's Metropolitan Museum
of Art, where she worked. Still there? ``Nah, she's 24 and went off
to join a dot-com company like everybody else,'' Ruettgers replied
in a tone that suggested he was belaboring the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Things could get more interesting if, as some analysts predict,
there will soon be a Darwinian winnowing among dot-com companies
who have bet so much of their venture capital money on ads to try
to become brand names during the do-or-die holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The winners will play on, while the losers will have little to
show for it and scant chance of raising more money. ``These
companies are burning enormous amounts of cash, and there will be a
massive shakeout in the new year after it becomes clear who did
well and who didn't,'' said Michael Hansen, an e-commerce
specialist at the Boston Consulting Group.

   E-nuff already. It is the surest sign that the Internet is
totally mainstream: Everyone is tired of it, not just the
sleep-starved workers at dot-com startups, but everyone _ man and
beast alike. Turn on the television and you are assaulted by an
endless parade of jabbering advertisements for e-commerce
companies. Newspapers are so bloated these days with ads for
dot-com marketers that dogs across the nation must be loosening
their teeth and straining their necks to fetch them.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of the times was Time magazine's selection last
week of Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, the big online retailer of
everything from books to toys, as its ``Person of the Year.''
Time's cover headline declares, ``E-commerce Is Changing the Way
the World Shops.'' Inside is a large picture of Bezos' face,
doctored with a white ``e'' inserted in his left eye. ``An Eye on
the Future,'' says the accompanying headline. Though Bezos is worth
$10 billion, he doesn't really care about the money, Time says. And

   ``To live on little, with contented mind,'' may be the
classically proper attitude toward wealth, but ``little'' and
``contented'' aren't seen together very much these days. A more
appropriate motto would be Oscar Wilde's ``Nothing succeeds like
excess.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the remarkable American economy, which has been growing
for almost nine years, and the dot-com tsunami, which has not yet
crested, the past decade has been a period of unprecedented wealth
creation. Consider that in 1989 there were an estimated 1.9 million
people in the country worth $1 million or more. Today that number
has jumped to about 8 million. The number of American households
worth $10 million or more has also quadrupled over the period,
jumping to 275,000 from 65,000, said Edward Wolff, a professor of
economics at New York University and an expert on wealth.
</P>
<P>
   So much money is sloshing around that it seems to have
overwhelmed the last vestiges of Puritan guilt over spending it. As
the stock market and corporate profits rise, charities nationwide
report that donations from both individuals and companies are
falling. The very idea of wretched excess, of buying as vulgar and
wealth as morally dangerous, has given way to a display-and-play
ethos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all millionaires and billionaires by the time they're
30,'' said Leonard Ely, a 76-year-old Silicon Valley captain of
industry turned philanthropist. Ask them for a chunk of their
newfound wealth, he added, and ``They'd say, `Look, I don't have my
Ferrari and my place in Tahoe, and you're telling me I should give
money away?'''
</P>
<P>
   The new attitude was on parade at the holiday party thrown by
the society furrier Dennis Basso at the House of the Redeemer on
East 95th Street off Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Two rows of black, chauffeured cars lined the block outside the
candlelit Episcopal sanctuary, as guests nibbled caviar and ladies
with newly sculpted faces worshipped, well, fur. Upstairs, Blaine
and Robert Trump held court in the library of the former Vanderbilt
mansion, while Kathy Hilton, wife of an heir to the hotel fortune,
received rave reviews on her pink mink.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ms. Hilton's coup, sable is de rigueur among the
pelt-wearing classes this year. ``Darling, this was the year of
sable,'' declared Basso. ``They all had to have one.'' Downstairs,
standing next to a cloakroom full of sable coats costing about
$150,000 each, Joan Collins, the former diva on ``Dynasty,'' stood
near several 30-something men in black-tie, who quietly questioned
whether her high cheekbones were real. And Michele Herbert, a Parue socialite, kissed Basso in gratitude for her $20,000
hand-beaded Russian broadtail suit.
</P>
<P>
   Even Locust Valley, N.Y., the capital of lockjaw and faded
chintz, has lost its bearings. The parking lot of the Piping Rock
Club, once filled with members' 10-year-old ``beater'' paneled
station wagons, now fills up with 3-year-old BMWs instead (and the
children own Porsches).
</P>
<P>
   Is it a new Gilded Age, with many thousands of robber barons,
instead of just a few dozen?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are striking parallels,'' said Jean Strouse, the author
of ``Morgan: American Financier'' (Random House, 1999), who spent
15 years writing and researching the biography of J.P. Morgan
(1837-1913). ``The Internet is very parallel to the building of the
railroads, the telegraph system, the transatlantic cable. People
were buying and building yachts. Enormous floating palaces.
Elaborate houses in Newport. It was an unbelievably lavish time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an unbelievably lavish time now. ``People seem to be
shopping at two in the morning, three in the morning. That's when
they buy the expensive items,'' said James Finkelstein, the founder
of Luxuryfinder.com, an online merchant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold out of pashmina blankets at $995 apiece,'' he said.
``We sold out of pashmina pillows for $335. We sold a lot of
caviar. A lot, a lot of caviar.'' The caviar costs $1,150 per 500
grams, but it comes with beautiful mother-of-pearl caviar spoons.
</P>
<P>
   One couple flies their palm trees from Southampton to Palm Beach
in the winter (to keep the trees warm). They also told their
decorator to put down black and white floor tiles to match the
coats of their terriers.
</P>
<P>
   Anastasia Soare, the owner of Anastasia's salon in Beverly
Hills, has grown accustomed to emergency calls from clients just in
from Europe who must have their eyebrows done at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was desperate,'' said Ms. Soare of one midnight call. In
response, Ms. Soare, whose shop also perfects the eyebrows of Naomi
Campbell, Jennifer Lopez, Lara Flynn Boyle and Kate Capshaw, packed
up tools in her own home in Benedict Canyon and drove across town
to her client's home. There, she performed an emergency pluck, cut
and wax. Charge: $400 to $3,000 (the latter price for flying cross
country) for as little as a five-minute session.
</P>
<P>
   Others fly their linens to Paris to be dry-cleaned. ``It's well
worth it,'' said one women at a Park Avenue cocktail party, as she
tossed her purple pashmina shawl around her shoulders. It better
be, since the tab in some homes runs to $6,000-a-month.
</P>
<P>
   It's exhausting, all this spending. Ms. Herbert, who is married
to the chairman of Pantone, a company specializing in color
graphics, talked about how hectic it is to keep up with everything.
``Let me put it this way, it would be easier if I had a job!'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   To help them keep up, the rich are hiring helpers, and even
helpers for their helpers. Mark Simone, a 44-year-old bachelor who
lives between New York and Greenwich, Conn., flipped through his
black book the other day and recited how many women he knows who
have multiple social secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you know how common it is for these women who do
nothing to have two secretaries,'' Simo. ``I can think of 20
who have two.'' He equated it to having a cat. ``When you're not
home all day, you need to get another one to keep the first one
company.''

   Children are equally the beneficiaries of excess. It's there to
be seen on any rainy day outside Nightingale-Bamford, an all-girls
private school on the Upper East Side. Ten-year-olds stand in
front, calling their very own town cars on their very own cellular
phones. An entire seventh-grade class at another New York private
school flew to Barbados for a birthday weekend. And a doting father
recently paid $17,000 to rent the F.A.O. Schwarz flagship toy store
on Fifth Avenue for his 12-year-old daughter's birthday slumber
party.

<P>
   At 3 a.m. one 12-year-old turned to another, both dressed in

Her friend said, ``We'll be Greenberg and Leff.'' And they would
make lots of money because the first girl knew all the ``lawyer
words.'' She recited: ``Malpractice, liability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Malpractice, liability,'' repeated her friend.
</P>
<P>
   One young woman, who spent 13 years in the New York private
school system and is a freshman at Cornell University, pointed out
the importance of the status of such things. ``Cell phones, town
cars, country houses, and kids whose parents who have really cool
jobs have no problem making friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that vacations were really important, too. ``If you go
to Florida for vacation you're not going away,'' the girl said.
Why? ``On a vacation you have to see clear water; in Florida, the
water is murky.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the rich at least, have got what they wished for. Which is
exactly what the gods are supposed to give us _ before they drive
us mad.

   ``Malpractice, liability,'' repeated her friend.
</P>
<P>
   One young woman, who spent 13 years in the New York private
school system and is a freshman at Cornell University, pointed out
the importance of the status of such things. ``Cell phones, town
cars, country houses, and kids whose parents who have really cool
jobs have no problem making friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that vacations were really important, too. ``If you go
to Florida for vacation you're not going away,'' the girl said.
Why? ``On a vacation you have to see clear water; in Florida, the
water is murky.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the rich at least, have got what they wished for. Which is
exactly what the gods are supposed to give us _ before they drive
us mad.

 &HT;    MEAT AND POULTRY PLANTS REMAIN OPEN DESPITE HUNDREDS OF FOOD
SAFETY VIOLATIONS
 &HT;    EDS: 980 and add. For release Sunday, Dec. 26
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN and SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who two years
ago pledged a crackdown on unsanitary meat and poultry processing
facilities, has instead let plants with hundreds of food safety
violations continue to sell their products to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 18, 1998 speech to the families of victims of
food-borne illness, Glickman said the department's new
``science-based'' inspection program would increase food safety. He
also promised to close plants producing ``dirty product.''
</P>
<P>
   On that same day a Cox Newspapers investigation had revealed
that plants were still in full production although they had amassed
over 1,000 ``critical'' food safety violations in a single year.
These violations occurred under the old ``poke and sniff''
inspection system that had been used since the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said in his speech that plants monitored under the
department's new inspection program should not ``expect a thousand
chances to get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   But a new Cox computer analysis of Agriculture Department
records shows the same lack of enforcement under the current
inspection system.
</P>
<P>
   According to inspection reports for 1998, the first year for
which complete data are available under the new inspection system,
several large plants were allowed to process food after collecting
nearly 1,000 citations for food safety violations, called
``non-compliance reports'' under the inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the 10 plants where the government did act in 1998, over
half the time the facilities were closed for 48 hours or less. The
longest closure lasted 9 days. And records show that when
production resumed, so did the almost-daily violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The records indicate these plants have a severe problem, ``
said Felicia Nestor, food safety director of the Government
Accountability Project, a consumer watchdog group in Washington.
``A plant that on hundreds of occasions failed to meet its (food
safety) commitment does not deserve to ship food to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for Glickman said he was not available for
comment. The department's under secretary for food safety,
Catherine Woteki, also was said to be unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   However, Beth Gaston, a spokesperson for the Agriculture
Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), said the
agency was not deviating from the enforcement policy Glickman
promised in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why plants with hundred of violations were allowed to
operate, Gaston said, ``As a result of a non-compliance report,
plants must take corrective action and inspectors, circuit
supervisors and district managers are trained to look for trends
that would indicate a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaston declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Nestor said there is little need to look for trends when
plants have hundreds of violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we may continue to see trends in food poisoning
tragedies,'' Nestor said, ``before (the Agriculture Department)
notices a trend at these plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the few attempts the department made to halt poorly
performing plants are in doubt following a pivotal case in Texas
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 10, a federal district court judge in Dallas issued a
preliminary injunction stopping the government from shutting down a
plant owned by Supreme Beef Processors Inc. The government said it
consistently found salmonella, a disease-causing bacteria, in meat
at the plant. But Judge A. Joe Fish said meat from the plant had
not caused food poisoning and if the plant was closed, it would put
the company out of business.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge's ruling stands, industry observers say it will gut
the new inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to 1998, federal food safety inspectors approved meat and
poultry if it looked and smelled OK _ so-called ``poke and sniff''
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But this changed two years ago when the department ordered the
nation's 300 largest meat and poultry plants to switch to the
inelegantly named Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points
(HACCP) inspection system. Plants are supposed to develop their own
HACCP plan that monitors key points in the production process.
Things such as the temperature in chilling tanks and bacteria
levels are supposed to be constantly monitored to quickly find and
correct problems.
</P>
<P>
   And federal food safety inspectors who once peered over the
shoulder of workers in the slaughter houses and packing plants, now
monitor how well plants carry out their HACCP plan. If a plant
deviates from its plan, inspectors now file non-compliance reports
called ``NRs.''
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis of the most serious NRs _ those involving
plant sanitation or their HACCP plan _ show that 66 plants
accounted for over half of all the violations recorded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Perdue Farms plant in Lewiston, N.C. amassed the worst record
with 959 NRs. Still, the Agriculture Department never closed the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Just behind the Perdue plant is one run by Tyson Foods, Inc. in
Dardanelles, Ark., which collected 772 violations. It also was
allowed to operate undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson officials declined to return repeated telephone calls to
discuss problems at their Dardanelles plant. Perdue officials,
however, invited reporters to tour the Lewiston facility and
interview Lester Gray, the plant manager.
</P>
<P>
   Gray acknowledged that his facility had had an ``atrocious''
record in 1998 but blamed it partly on a rocky first year trying to
adjust to the new science-based inspection system. He also said
that because he runs one of the nation's largest processing
facilities, there are more inspectors assigned who are able to
write NRs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Agriculture Department records show that under the old
inspection system his plant had a relatively good record.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock,'' Gray said of the time when he and the other
managers had to begin running their own inspection system rather
than rely on federal inspectors to oversee his operation. Despite
months of planning, he acknowledged that his plant was not ready
for the wrenching changes of HACCP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we understood our roles, then the implementation
lagged.'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he said the failure of employees to wash their
hands after they returned from breaks or during a change of shifts
resulted in several NRs.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said that prior to HACCP, a federal inspector would only
occasionally check if employees where washing their hands.
</P>
<P>
   But under HACCP, Gray said it became his company's
responsibility to check. His first attempt _ simply urging
employees to wash _ was unsuccessful and resulted in an NR.
Subsequent attempts also failed and resulted in additional NRs.
Finally he solved the problem by stationing someone in front of the
wash basins during all breaks and shift changes.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the plant is now more accustomed to the new system,
has spent $15 million upgrading its equipment to process carcasses
and NR's have declined by 40 percent in 1999 .
</P>
<P>
   While initial confusion over a new inspection system may have
caused problems, Agriculture Department records show that the Tyson
plant which fared poorly under HACCP was also a problem plant in
pre-HACCP days.
</P>
<P>
   During 1996, the Dardanelles plant was among the ten worst in
the county with 922 ``critical'' violations _ the most serious type
of citation a plant can get.
</P>
<P>
   Problems at the Dardanelles plant mirror the company's record of
failed inspections nationally. Although Tyson ranks fourth in sales
among the nation's meat and poultry companies, it led the industry
both before and after HACCP in the number of federal food safety
violations. In 1998, government records show Tyson's plants using
HACCP had 7,560 NRs for sanitation and food safety problems _ more
than double any other company that year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's performance, Agriculture Department
records show the government only shut down two of Tyson's 78 plants
in 1998, and then only for a total of 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's poultry processing plant in Waldron, Ark., which led the
country in critical violations in 1996, was in trouble again in
1998, records show. The plant was closed once in January 1998 for
48 hours and again in April for five days. At the time it closed in
April, the government had cited it 38 times that month. When it
reopened, federal records show it continued to collect nearly one
violation every day for the rest of the year. The plant continues
to operate today.

AUSTRALIANS FACING INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS SMUGGLED IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ During the last six months, Australians have
been surprised by an influx of people arriving in small boats from
Iraq and Afghanistan who, officials say, are first being delivered
to nearby Indonesian islands by smugglers from the Middle East and
then moved to Australia's north coast, where they try to claim
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   According to information provided by the Australian mission to
the United Nations, the Australian Department of Immigration and
Multicultural Affairs reported that 34 boats with passengers
originating in the Middle East were intercepted off the northern
and northwestern coasts of Australia between July and November. The
boats carried 1,643 people _ more than the total of people reaching
the country by boat in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials say that many of the refugees and asylum
seekers appear to have been brought to Southeast Asia by smuggling
rings operating in Amman, Jordan. Once in Southeast Asia, those who
have been smuggled can easily obtain fraudulent documents in
Bangkok, long known as a center for forgeries and a frequent
stopover point for illegal emigrants from China, many of whom also
try to land in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Travel from Thailand to Indonesia is relatively easy. Australian
officials say that the people headed for their shores are assembled
on a number of Indonesian islands _ most recently Lombok, Sumbawa,
Flores and West Timor _ for boats to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Australia itself may be a stopover for these people, Philip
Ruddock, the minister for immigration and multicultural affairs,
said in October, when he announced new measures to discourage the
flow of arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a growing trend that has become known as `forum shopping,'
these people are trying to exploit Australia's generous
arrangements for refugees to gain residence in their country of
preference,'' he said. To plug that loophole, Australia will grant
only three-year ``temporary protection'' visas to people deemed to
be genuine refugees _ including most of the Iraqis and Afghans _
but will not allow them to bring in other family members. If they
leave Australia for another destination, they will lose the right
to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia simply cannot afford to be seen as a potential soft
target by forum shoppers and the increasingly sophisticated
people-smuggling rackets,'' Ruddock said. As in other countries
like the United States, Canada and Germany that attract asylum
seekers, an influx of illegal immigrants in Australia can lessen
the chances of asylum for refugees languishing in camps,
Australians say. Illegal immigrants also erode sympathy for
refugees in general, Australians have found.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1960s, when Australian immigration laws began to be
changed substantially, Australia had an all-white immigration
policy, seeking settlers primarily from Europe. Now, about 40
percent of immigrants are Asians. Australia, a country only
slightly smaller than the United States with a population of barely
18 million, actively recruits students from Southeast Asia for its
universities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Illegal migration also conceals the movement of terrorists,
international law enforcement agencies and experts on immigration
say. The sophistication with which fraudulent identity and travel
documents are produced adds to their concern.
</P>
<P>
   In confronting a sharp increase of illegal immigrants, the
Australian government, in cooperation with other governments, is
now using fingerprinting, DNA testing, voice testing and face, palm
and retinal recognition techniques to help identify true asylum
seekers and learn whether applicants have been refused entry
elsewhere, the immigration ministry said. Suspect travelers may
also be more readily spotted.
</P>
<P>
   Australia also has growing problems with illegal arrivals by
air, which are rising by 30 percent to 35 percent a year. Last
year, more than 2,000 people were refused entry at airports.
Iraqis, who make up a growing proportion of those who arrive by
boat, are more and more frequently found among those seeking
illegal entry at airports, according to a recent immigration
ministry fact sheet. The number of Iraqis refused clearance at
Australian airports in 1998-99 was 325, an increase of 137 percent
over the previous year, the immigration ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Iraqis had been out of Iraq for years, the
Australians found. Iraqis have been fleeing Saddam Hussein's
government for decades, settling in other nations in the Middle
East and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There are also large numbers of Malaysians, South Koreans,
Chinese and Algerians who have sought entry without proper
documents. The number of Indonesians seeking entry declined,
however, after the May 1998 resignation of President Suharto and
the introduction of democracy in Indonesia.

POPE URGES REPENTANCE AND MUTUAL RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ On the first day of the 2000 holy year, Pope John Paul II
delivered a Christmas speech Saturday that called for repentance in
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must, however, confess that humanity has sometimes sought
the truth elsewhere, invented false certainties, and chased after
deceptive ideologies,'' the pope said in his traditional Christmas
urbi et orbi (to the city and the world) address from his balcony
at St. Peter's Basilica. ``At times people have refused to respect
and love their brothers of a different faith or race, they have
denied fundamental rights to individuals and nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The frail 79-year-old pope, who on Christmas Eve pushed open the
holy door to St. Peter's, the symbol of the beginning of a holy
year, or jubilee, has long urged his followers to use the
millennium jubilee to redress personal wrongs and the misdeeds of
the Roman Catholic Church throughout the centuries. Saturday's
words served as a prelude for the kind of soul-searching in which
he intends to lead the church throughout the year 2000. He said
believers should be ``pilgrims in time,'' and remember the horrors
of the past. ``We visit all the places of grief and war, the
resting places of victims of brutal conflicts and cruel
slaughter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas is one of the most sacred events on the Christian
calendar, and for John Paul II, this year has a special
significance, as it marks what the church views as the 2,000th
anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ and the start of a holy
year that is the first one at the turn of a millennium. ``This year
there is yet another reason that makes more holy this day of
grace,'' the pope said. ``It is the beginning of the great
jubilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of believers gathered in St. Peter's Square
clapped and cheered their approval. All morning, thousands of
believers passed through the bronze holy door that is kept bricked
up until a jubilee, many of them making signs of the cross and
kissing the sculpted panels.
</P>
<P>
   A jubilee, which now takes place every 25 years, is a tradition
that dates back to 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII urged pilgrims to
visit Rome when the Crusades made traveling to the Holy Land too
dangerous. Now, as then, believers make the pilgrimage to seek a
plenary indulgence, a remittance of punishment for sins, which can
be earned by a pilgrimage to Rome or other holy sites. The pope has
broadened the avenue to an indulgence, allowing believers to visit
Jerusalem churches, their own dioceses and even the Rome airport
chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, after his speech, the pope delivered a Christmas
greeting in 58 languages, as he does every Dec. 25. He then blessed
the crowd and granted them _ and those who followed the event on
television and radio _ a plenary indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past three years, the aging pope did not celebrate
Christmas Mass inside the basilica, leaving that task to Cardinal
Angelo Sodano, his secretary of state. But to emphasize the special
nature of this Holy Year, the pope broke with tradition and decided
to open the holy doors of the four main basilicas in Rome
personally. Saturday evening, the pope was expected to open the
holy door of St. John Lateran, the original church of the popes
before St. Peter's was built. He will open the doors at the other
two basilicas in January.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the pope needed help climbing the steps to the
holy door, but by the end of the midnight Mass, he was clearly
invigorated. As he walked down the aisle to leave, he smiled,
stroked the heads of small children, and blessed the faithful who
grabbed at his sleeve and touched his robe. At one point, he
playfully snatched back his hand from the outstretched hand of one
person in the aisle, smiling mischievously.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the pope sounded a more somber note, lamenting in
strong words the arms race, abortion and euthanasia. ``At times,
the world neither respects nor loves life,'' he said, asking that
God enlighten people ``so that legislators and political leaders,
men and women, of goodwill, may be committed to welcoming human
life as a precious gift.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas celebrations were a personal milestone for this
pope, who has been planning the 2000 holy year ever since he was
elected in 1978. At times, through sheer willpower, he has overcome
his numerous physical ailments to press an agenda that would
exhaust a far younger, healthier man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christ, you are the door,'' the pope said in closing his
remarks on Friday night. ``Through you, in the power of the Holy
Spirit, we wish to enter the third millennium.''

RUSSIA'S ARMY OPENS FIGHT TO CONTROL CHECHEN CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian forces advanced into Grozny on Saturday, as
what was billed as the decisive battle for the capital of Chechnya
got under way.
</P>
<P>
   After a night of furious shelling, Russian Interior Ministry
troops and Chechen forces loyal to Moscow began to move into the
city from several directions, according to Russian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's immediate goal is to establish control over key
junctions in the city and to prevent the militants from moving
freely within the town. The longer-term objective is to use
Russia's overwhelming advantage in firepower and take the city back
neighborhood by neighborhood in what promises to be a new, intense
stage of the 3-month-old war.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Russian soldiers died in street battles in Grozny
in the 1994-96 war in Chechnya. Russia has vowed not to repeat the
mistakes of that war, in which Russian soldiers rushed to the
center of Grozny at the outset of the fighting. That war left the
status of the officially Russian republic in limbo, with Islamic
militants determined to fight for Chechnya's independence.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the military says it will move more cautiously to
take back the city and flush out the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night there were reports of firefights at key
intersections and highways, including points deep inside the city.
Grozny was said to be under heavy shelling from Russian tanks and
artillery, as Russian troops advanced under smoke screens.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the information about the assault came from the Russian
military or officials, or semiofficial Russian news media. Very few
Western reporters have permission to visit Chechnya, and the
Foreign Ministry warned Saturday that any foreign reporters caught
in the region without permission would be committing a criminal
offense.
</P>
<P>
   There were no official casualty figures from the fighting
Saturday. In general, the Russian government has sought to reassure
its public during this war by avoiding mention of military
casualties in any detail and by portraying the assault on Grozny as
a commando-style operation that will avoid the huge death toll of
the last war among both military troops and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military leaders insist their troops are not
``storming'' the city. Rather, they say, Russian forces are
engaging in a ``special operation'' to rid it of rebels who are
blamed for incursions into Chechnya's eastern neighbor, the Russian
republic of Dagestan, in August and then for a series of apartment
bombings that killed almost 300 people in Dagestan and in Russia
proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing terrible is going on in Grozny,'' said Gen. Viktor
Kazantsev, Russia's top military commander in the North Caucasus.
``It is simply the continuation of the operation to free Grozny
from the bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   That distinction, however, may be lost on the tens of thousands
of civilians still trapped in the city. They have already been
pummeled by artillery and airstrikes. Now they are hiding in dark
cellars and basements, hoping to survive the fight on the streets
of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much the military leaders want it, they won't
capture Grozny by New Year's,'' said Malik Saidullayev, a
millionaire Chechen businessman who is supporting the Kremlin in
the war. ``Both the federal forces and their opponents, along with
civilians, are likely to suffer many casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Escape no longer appears to be an option for Grozny's civilians.
With much fanfare this month, Russia had opened what it said were
two corridors for civilians to leave Grozny. But the senior
official for Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, advised civilians on Friday
that it had become too dangerous to try to leave.
</P>
<P>
   He said that up to 50,000 people were still trapped in Grozny
and that only 8,000 had used the corridors to flee. Many of those
who did reported that they were shot at by unidentified gunmen as
they traveled the perilous route.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The onset of Saturday's attack coincided with efforts by the
Russian government to limit information from the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Most accounts of the fighting Saturday took the form of
semiofficial reports on Russian television, which has been
generally sympathetic to the Russian military, and dispatches by
semiofficial Russian news agencies, like Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed columns of Russian troops, commanders
and occasional artillery, but little of the intense fighting said
to be raging on the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   In warning foreign journalists not to enter Chechnya without
official permission, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a
statement: ``In some instances, foreign citizens have intentionally
lied about their goals and routes of their visit. They turn up in
Chechnya and practice journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of Moscow, a small vanguard of news service
reporters is already inside Grozny and has been operating beyond
the military's jurisdiction. They have been quoting Chechen
commanders about Russian losses and have been roundly denounced by
Russian spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to put the best face on the fighting, the Russian
military said Saturday that it was carrying out a three-phase
operation to capture the city with minimal losses.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began at midnight Friday, and the first two phases
are already under way, the military said. The first phase involves
intense shelling to weaken the resistance of the rebels in Grozny.
Then Russian Interior Ministry troops, military reconnaissance
units and several hundred Chechen soldiers loyal to Bislan
Gantamirov, the former Grozny mayor, began to enter the city, the
military said.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov had been imprisoned for embezzlement but was released
by Russian authorities eager to find allies _ however tainted _
among the Chechens, who have a long history of seeking independence
from Moscow and, like many minority groups in the now defunct
Soviet Union, suffered mass deportation under Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials told Itar-Tass that the city was to
be divided into 15 areas. The Interior Ministry troops and
Gantamirov's troops would control key junctions, hoping to prevent
the militants from moving freely within the city.
</P>
<P>
   The final phase is the destruction of the rebels in
house-to-house fighting. That is unlikely to happen quickly.
State-owned ORT television said the military hoped to break the
main rebel resistance by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But some Russian military officials said Saturday that clearing
the city of militants could take two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The military has apparently abandoned any plan to evacuate the
city, opting instead for what it says is a plan to create safe
havens for civilians in parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how many armed rebels remain in the city.
Russian officials say there may be as many as 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Movladi Udugov, who has been a spokesman for the rebels,
asserted that there was heavy fighting within the capital and that
Russian troops would run into a wall of resistance as they sought
to take Grozny. Key militants, like Shamil Basayev, however, no
longer appear to be in the capital. When he called reporters
Saturday, Udugov would not say where he was calling from.

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ On one level, Vice President Al Gore's
proposal to scrap all 30-second television spots in favor of
twice-weekly debates with former Sen. Bill Bradley was just what
the senator said it was: a campaign ploy. To be sure, it was a
modestly imaginative gambit that seemed to annoy Bradley by making
him defend the political system he prefers to deplore.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea is worth thinking about in two other contexts: as a
way of communicating with voters, and as a campaign spending
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   These days the only way most voters hear about Gov. George W.
Bush's views on education is by watching images of cute children
while listening to him promise local control, ``charters and
choice'' and phonics to teach reading. But if Gore's idea were
taken up, voters could hear candidates explain in depth what local
school boards should control and how much new plans would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Supreme Court banned campaign spending limits in
1976 as a violation of free speech, critics have sought indirect
ways to curb the spiraling costs of running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts became particularly urgent after politicians came
up with the idea of ``soft money'' donations in 1988. These are the
unlimited contributions made to party organizations by fat cats,
corporations and unions. The remaining contribution limits that the
Supreme Court had allowed became meaningless, and as a result
presidential elections today are hardly more regulated than they
were when the Watergate scandals led to the 1974 Federal Election
Campaign Act.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the dominant approach in Congress, backed by both
Democratic presidential candidates, is to ban soft money, which
theoretically goes to party building, but in fact buys thousands of
30-second spots _ both positive and negative _ about candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation prohibiting soft money commands majority support in
Congress, but Republican filibusters in the Senate have killed it
twice since 1997. Meanwhile, both parties are raking in soft money
as fast as they can.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' claim to virtue, based on their votes against the
filibusters, is no stronger in practice than the Republicans', as
evidenced by last week's disclosure that Democratic Party officials
had set up committees to funnel such donations into several Senate
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's challenge to Bradley last week is another indirect
approach to a spending curb. He would forswear the most costly way
to spend campaign cash: the 30-second television spots, whose price
rises sharply each election cycle. If nobody bought 30-second spots
praising or condemning candidates like competing brands of laundry
detergent, campaign costs would drop dramatically _ and the level
of political discourse might rise.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody expects that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   In this campaign, Bradley, after three years out of politics,
plainly needs television ads to introduce himself to voters. And in
subsequent campaigns, at least one side will surely see the need
for commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, perhaps not. Look at the history of presidential
debates. After the Kennedy-Nixon encounters of 1960, there were no
presidential debates in 1964, 1968 or 1972. In each of those
election years, one candidate held a big lead and saw no point in
legitimizing his rivals by sharing a television screen. The
conventional wisdom at the time was that somebody would always have
an advantage, and so no presidential candidates would ever debate
again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Jimmy Carter was up about 30 points in the polls after
the Republican convention. But his campaign managers thought the
lead was anything but solid and figured that debates could show
Carter had the stature to be president. So when President Ford
challenged him to debate, Carter accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Today, general election debates are regular parts of
presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it is not easy to visualize a situation in which
both sides would reject campaign advertising. Even the spots people
say they hate _ the attack ads that Gore has promised not to use in
any event _ are effective. They help politicians get elected.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Fred Wertheimer argue, though, that those ads also
make it harder for politicians to govern because of the cynicism
the spots engender. And Robert Teeter, a Republican consultant, is
among those who argue that the public may be getting fed up, that
it wants to hear directly from candidates through debates,
interviews, short speeches _ almost any forum where the candidate
is talking live without production gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who insists he has not given up on the idea, said last
week: ``I think the American people would love it. I think they
find the current way of doing things pretty boring.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ A year ago, the world was mesmerized by the
spectacle of exploding rockets lighting the skies over Baghdad as
American and British warplanes taught Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein a lesson about defying U.N. arms inspections. A year later,
it is clear that the fireworks were obscuring another reality: the
final retreat of the Clinton administration from a policy of making
the United Nations the focal point of policy on Iraq _ and, indeed,
from making Iraq a focal point of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Now fixed on the glittering prize of a broader Middle East peace
among Israel and its neighbors, the administration has let Iraq
slip into the middle distance, where it is likely to remain for the
last year of the Clinton era unless Saddam does something very
foolish and provocative.
</P>
<P>
   American policy, which once put so much focus on U.N. arms
inspections to restrain Saddam's military ambitions, seems now to
rely on more quietly keeping him hemmed in with sanctions, period.
If his weapons programs get to a really dangerous point, new
large-scale bombing is always an option anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For many diplomats here, the most telling sign of Iraq's eclipse
was the decision of Richard Holbrooke, the powerful new American
representative at the United Nations, to give no priority to the
issue here when he arrived in the fall, just as final negotiations
on creating a new arms inspection system to monitor the Iraqis were
reaching a crucial point.
</P>
<P>
   That system was adopted by the Security Council a week ago but
is likely to take months to put into place _ if it can be put in
place at all, given Iraq's immediate outrage at the very idea.
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of the United Nations, the American
policy on Iraq now seems to be on autopilot. A senior American
official recently told a group of foreign policy experts that only
a handful of people in the United States either knew or cared about
the issue, an indication that the policy was hardly under active
review.
</P>
<P>
   For at least two years, the administration has been focused
almost exclusively on two projects: first, continuing sanctions to
try to weaken the Iraqi government and slow its quest for new
weapons of mass destruction, and second, supporting the Iraqi
opposition in exile, even though it is fragmented and few people
take it seriously as an immediate threat to Saddam. Many experts
say the only possibility of overthrow that Saddam really fears is a
palace coup.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the continuing standoff with Saddam. No arms inspections
are likely soon, and therefore there is no end in sight for
sanctions, which Saddam sees as a gross insult to Iraq's
sovereignty, as is American enforcement of no-flight zones in the
north and south, where Iraq fires on American planes and the planes
keep bombing Iraq's air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years after the Gulf War, many nations have come to
disagree with the United States that sanctions by themselves should
be the bedrock of an Iraq policy. The Arabs, for example, have said
the Americans long ago became cynical about inspections _ that they
stopped wanting the inspections to work, because if Iraq ever
passed the test it would lead to the liberation of Saddam from the
box into which sanctions help keep him. The inspections also tied
American policy to an activity carried out not by Americans, but by
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the sanctions regime has lost virtually all the
support it once enjoyed around the world _ and that Saddam Hussein
is still firmly in place _ seems to matter very little in
Washington's thinking,'' said David Malone, a Canadian diplomat who
is president of the International Peace Academy, a research
organization with close ties to the diplomats at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, ``once it became clear that partners in the
Security Council, particularly among the permanent five, were no
longer willing to support sanctions, Washington had a choice to
make between Security Council solidarity and sanctions'' to support
its goal of containing Iraq, said Malone.

<P>
   With the decision in favor of sanctions, rather than any
inspection regime the council could readily agree on, it became
inevitable that the chief U.N. arms inspection official, Richard
Butler, would soon feel a chill wind. Now, in the final days before
his agency is disbanded, there is a palpable bitterness among its
inspectors at having been sold out by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After the effective end of inspections a year ago, it took many
months for the Security Council to decide what to do next. It is
telling that when the new plan was drawn up, the United States left
most of the work to others, stepping in only at critical points to
make sure the Iraqis will have months of work to do before they can
get to even a temporary suspension of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   If America's attitude toward working with the United Nations on
Iraq has seemed ambivalent and opaque to other countries, so too
has the attitude of Secretary-General Kofi Annan seemed confusing
to Americans and the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost two years since Annan went to Iraq to talk
Saddam into a modicum of cooperation with the inspection agency,
known as Unscom. The months that followed, in retrospect, can be
seen as the moment when the United States began disengaging from
the United Nations on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's mission led to sham diplomatic inspections of off-limits
Iraqi palaces in the glare of publicity, while Unscom was prevented
from doing any real work. But Washington was surprisingly
uncritical. Then, after Iraq was bombed in December 1998,
administration officials in Washington leaked reports of how the
United States had long used Unscom and, by extension, the United
Nations for spying on Iraq. Malone called these leaks ``profoundly
damaging'' to Butler.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview, Butler said that much of the blame
for what went wrong rested not in Washington but in the secretary
general's office, where he found some staff members ``deeply
sympathetic'' to Iraq. ``They made it clear to me after a while
that this actual pursuit of weapons was inadequately diplomatic,''
he said, still angry that Saddam, a documented liar in dealing with
inspectors and a concealer of poison gas, germ warfare and a
nuclear program, should get white-glove treatment from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   There is a paradox here. In recent months Annan has become very
outspoken and self-critical about the mistakes the United Nations
makes when it tries to treat abusers of their own populations with
the nonjudgmental neutrality accorded other heads of government.
Some people are just evil, a recent report on the 1995 fall of
Srebrenica and the subsequent massacre of its Muslim population
recently concluded. Annan has been stung in Bosnia, Serbia and
Rwanda _ and said so with extraordinary contrition. He has
criticized Russian action in Chechnya and supported NATO in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq? By the evidence of U.N. Human Rights Commission
monitors and human rights organizations, Saddam rules with ruthless
terror and is not squeamish about gassing his own population or
using the suffering of civilians as a propaganda tool. Annan's
entourage does not dwell on this.
</P>
<P>
   Annan now has a huge challenge ahead of him. The Security
Council has given him a month to choose a successor to Butler to
head a new inspection commission. Signs of American interest are
conspicuously absent. Although the strength or weakness of the
choice will be important, American diplomats say the United States
doesn't have a favored candidate in the race.

United States had long used Unscom and, by extension, the United
Nations for spying on Iraq. Malone called these leaks ``profoundly
damaging'' to Butler.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview, Butler said that much of the blame
for what went wrong rested not in Washington but in the secretary
general's office, where he found some staff members ``deeply
sympathetic'' to Iraq. ``They made it clear to me after a while
that this actual pursuit of weapons was inadequately diplomatic,''
he said, still angry that Saddam, a documented liar in dealing with
inspectors and a concealer of poison gas, germ warfare and a
nuclear program, should get white-glove treatment from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   There is a paradox here. In recent months Annan has become very
outspoken and self-critical about the mistakes the United Nations
makes when it tries to treat abusers of their own populations with
the nonjudgmental neutrality accorded other heads of government.
Some people are just evil, a recent report on the 1995 fall of
Srebrenica and the subsequent massacre of its Muslim population
recently concluded. Annan has been stung in Bosnia, Serbia and
Rwanda _ and said so with extraordinary contrition. He has
criticized Russian action in Chechnya and supported NATO in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq? By the evidence of U.N. Human Rights Commission
monitors and human rights organizations, Saddam rules with ruthless
terror and is not squeamish about gassing his own population or
using the suffering of civilians as a propaganda tool. Annan's
entourage does not dwell on this.
</P>
<P>
   Annan now has a huge challenge ahead of him. The Security
Council has given him a month to choose a successor to Butler to
head a new inspection commission. Signs of American interest are
conspicuously absent. Although the strength or weakness of the
choice will be important, American diplomats say the United States
doesn't have a favored candidate in the race.

SOMEWHERE THERE'S A HALL FOR EVERYONE, AND WITH VISITORS, TOO  
(DW)

<P>
   Cooperstown, Canton, Springfield, Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   While many sports fans have been heading to the Baseball, Pro
Football, Basketball and Hockey Halls of Fame for decades, few have
ventured to pay homage to lesser-known heroes from other playing
fields around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But just like the Bambino, Dr. J and the Great One, the best
athletes you never heard of are celebrated daily at their own
permanent residences. They simply don't hear the doorbell ring as
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people at every level of sport with a passion,''
said Paul Dickson, who wrote ``The Volvo Guide to Halls of Fame''
(Living Planet Press) with Robert Skole in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's most engaging about many lesser-known halls
is that they don't have all the bells and whistles and all the
interactive stuff that the better-known halls have,'' Dickson said.
``And while most of them are hanging on by a thread financially,
they exist simply because someone out there has a passion for that
particular sport.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you and the children happen to be sledding in Knik,
Alaska, any time soon, the Dog Mushers Hall of Fame, located in a
town where dogs outnumber people, might be worth a visit. For $2,
the museum, which is on the route of the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Nome, showcases not only the
world's greatest mushers, but also their sleds and other
musher-related items as well.
</P>
<P>
   One enshrined sled is from a trip to the top of Mount McKinley,
while another is from a 6,000-mile trek. One Hall of Famer, Col.
Norman Vaughn, went to the South Pole with Adm. Richard Byrd and
donated material from the expedition, including an old dog-style
collar.
</P>
<P>
   You won't need that sled to get to the National Jousting Hall of
Fame in Mount Solon, Va., which puts no price at all on seeing its
display of trophies, plaques, photographs and jousting rings.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the ``oldest continually held sporting event in
America,'' jousting made its debut on this side of the Atlantic in
1821, when, according to the local folklore, two young men on
horseback fought for the hand of a maiden by jousting, or trying to
kill each other with lances. Toned down for a much more amateur
field today, the idea now is not to plunge one's lance through
another's heart, but through small rings hanging on a string.
</P>
<P>
   When the door to the Greyhound Hall of Fame in Abilene, Kan.,
swings open, you are greeted by a couple of former greyhound racing
champions, Sharon and her sister, Chig. For the price of a pat on
their heads, you will quickly learn that greyhound racing is
America's sixth-largest spectator sport and that the breed is one
of the oldest and most respected in the canine world. In fact, back
in the 1500s, Queen Elizabeth I inaugurated the Sport of Queens by
initiating the formal rules of greyhound coursing, the pursuit of
hares.
</P>
<P>
   The price of fame is a little higher in Newport, R.I., where for
$6 you can visit the National Croquet Gallery, Hall of Fame and
Archives. On display is a 7-foot Grand Trophy with the names of the
sport's most notable performers, including the legendary comedian
Harpo Marx. Also on display are croquet-related works of art by
Monet, Bonnard, Winslow Homer and Rockwell Kent.
</P>
<P>
   If your passion is racing on wheels, find a parking spot in
Akron, Ohio, home of the Soap Box Derby Hall of Fame, where
legendary soap boxers are honored and vehicles are on display
during the one-week racing season in July. One of the most famous
inductees is a racer named Gilbert Klecan, the 1946 Soap Box Derby
champion, who covered himself with graphite in an effort to
increase his speed.
</P>
<P>
   If fish should become a part of your hall of fame diet, dive
into the memorabilia at the International Game Fish Association's
Museum World Center Fishing Museum and Hall of Fame in Dania Beach,
Fla., which, believe it or not, takes longer to tour than to
pronounce. This $20 million museum honors anglers, captains and
other leaders of the fishing business.
</P>
<P>
   The Ironman Hall of Fame in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, does not hang
portraits of Lou Gehrig or Cal Ripken Jr., but of triathletes like
Tom Warren, Mark Allen and Paula Newby-Fraser, all of whom have
conquered the physically challenging Ironman race: a 2.4-mile ocean
swim, followed by a 112-mile bike ride, followed by a 26.2-mile
run, followed by a shower and a lot of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for those who prefer their sports a little more
recreational, admission is free to the National Shuffleboard Hall
of Fame in St. Petersburg, Fla.; the United States Chess Federation
Hall of Fame in Washington; the International Checkers Hall of Fame
in Petal, Miss.; the Marbles Hall of Fame in Wildwood, N.J.; and,
soon to be in the loop, the Yo-Yo Hall of Fame in Chico, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a democracy where everyone is created equally, there are
people within their own realm who become great at certain sports,''
Dickson said. ``Whether it be professional baseball or basketball,
or marbles or chess, there should be a place to honor all of those
people.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Saturdays, Walter Arana moves like one of the
turbo-charged action heroes from the movies he rents and sells in
his store in Woodside, Queens. His hands fly from the cash register
to the computer to the videos stacked behind him and then to the
push-button clicker he keeps around his neck to buzz the door open
for the steady flow of customers.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rings. ``Si. Si. Wait a sec,'' barks Arana, a
linguistic quick-change artist in a neighborhood where people come
from 49 countries and speak 34 different languages. Then he
pirouettes, aims the remote control and silences the soccer game
that has transfixed an Irish immigrant waiting at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Nodding hello to two teen-agers deliberating in Bengali by the
horror films, Arana registers them with the practiced eye of an
urban anthropologist. He knows they are from Bangladesh, just as he
knows the names of British soccer players and Dominican movie
stars, because it is smart business to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a neighborhood like this one, it's good to know even the
capital of their country and ask them about it,'' he says, gently
motioning for the two to show him what they want, ``because when
they first come to the States, they feel no one knows them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meet Walter Arana: Peruvian immigrant, local notable and artful
avatar of the diverse human tide that is transforming New York City
_ from the neighborhood up _ with its multiplicity of languages,
religions and skills.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the end of the century, one in three city residents is
an immigrant and, of those, nearly half are newly minted New
Yorkers who arrived only in the last 15 years. Not since 1910, at
the peak of this century's great wave of immigration through Ellis
Island, has the ratio of newcomers been as high.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer numbers are only the beginning of the story. No other city
has absorbed so many different nationalities _ more than 100 _
since immigration laws were changed in 1965 to open the door to
people from Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. And
this diversity within diversity is changing the very definition of
the ethnic New York neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Classic old ethnic neighborhoods that had successfully resisted
change for half a century, now belong to no one and to everyone.
They are a clashing, colorful, polyglot, multiethnic collection of
microcommunities whose members sometimes come together on neutral
ground like Arana's video store, and sometimes lead parallel lives.
</P>
<P>
   In their volume and their variety, the immigrants have affected
each pillar of the neighborhood architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Overburdened schools where bilingual education once was just
academic theory now struggle to absorb an influx of children who do
not speak English. Where once there were moribund churches and
synagogues, immigrants are reinvigorating religious institutions.
And the local shops, where everyone once felt at home, now must
choose between serving an ethnic niche and catering to the
dissonant tastes of a multinational clientele.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years ago, the newest New Yorkers were largely
unskilled and unlettered. They worked close to home in Lower
Manhattan, with people much like themselves, so the sweatshops and
the schools became enclaves, too. As the subways and bridges
extended to the thinly populated outer boroughs, ethnic
neighborhoods could pick themselves up lock, stock and barrel and
move onto unclaimed turf.
</P>
<P>
   Those archetypal New York ethnic neighborhoods, the stuff of the
city's literature, its memoirs and its founding myths, were once
urban villages of a few square blocks where immigrants lost their
accents and joined the American mainstream, where everyone
worshipped at the same few churches or synagogues, learned the same
lessons in school and exchanged gossip at the same corner
drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   If it was never quite as homogenous as some of its old-timers
remember, these neighborhoods did bespeak the influence of one
dominant group. For much of this century, if you were
Irish-American in Woodside, Italian-American in Bensonhurst or a
Jew of Russian heritage in Brighton Beach, the neighborhood felt
like your turf.
</P>
<P>
   Those who now arrive in New York find a built-out city with few
manufacturing jobs, where they must compete for affordable housing
with native-born New Yorkers and other immigrants with whom they
share little but their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside under the microscope is one churning compact sliver of
the city _ less than one-fifth of a square mile bounded by Queens
Boulevard, Woodside Avenue, 52nd and 64th streets _ where the old
notion of neighborhood is being deconstructed and reassembled.
</P>
<P>
   On the Block a Sweet Smell as the Bars Close
</P>
<P>
   Around 4 a.m., a sweet, musty smell drifts onto the street on a
light cloud of steam from the Man Mi Korean Bakery, beckoning the
delivery trucks that will soon deliver the mom-and-pop shop's
mung-bean rice cakes and sticky sang doughnuts around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down a seven-block stretch of Roosevelt Avenue, it is
closing time for the Irish pubs. A man locks the door of the Mi
Pais restaurant, pausing to stare at the picture of the voluptuous
singer _ ``La Sexy de P.R.'' _ whose upcoming show is advertised on
a hand-lettered poster in the window.
</P>
<P>
   Daylight brings a group of solemn girls in long blue robes and
white head scarves trooping toward the Razi Islamic School, once
the home of Catholic Charities and now adorned with Arabic phrases
and painted tiles in feathery designs of white, yellow and blue.
</P>
<P>
   The manicurists in the Thai Beauty Salon prepare for their first
Hispanic customers of the day as an Indian immigrant in a baseball
cap arranges Greek, Arabic, Spanish and Urdu newspapers on the
shelves in his convenience store. Across the street, the lights in
the window of the Yuan Fu Sing grocery store flicker on,
illuminating the dust on the boxes of Chinese Anti-Contusion
Rheumatism Plaster and American beer.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, all of these colors, spices and languages blend into
one swirl of activity. Livery-car drivers cram into Warteg Fortuna,
a tiny restaurant with eight stools, piles of Indonesian magazines,
and a pungent smell of curry and chili rising from behind the
counter.
</P>
<P>
   On the side streets, where doll-size plastic statues of Jesus
are nestled among the geraniums, the Irish-American retirees who
first settled the neighborhood emerge to sweep the front steps of
their peaked two-family shingled homes.
</P>
<P>
   All this diversity translates into a neighborhood with one of
the city's highest proportions of immigrants: More than half of its
9,000 residents were foreign-born as of the 1990 census, and about
half of those newcomers have lived in the United States for 10
years or less.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the flow of immigrants into the neighborhood, and
their diversity, has only increased, according to immigration
records, city housing surveys and school enrollment data.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 70 percent of apartments are occupied by at least one
foreign-born person. One in five children in the local elementary
school, Public School 11, arrived in the country only in the last
three years. Eight in 10 school-age children live in a home where
the family communicates in a language other than English.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There has not been such a concentration of newcomers in the
neighborhood since World War I, when up-and-coming Irish immigrants
abandoned the tenements of Lower Manhattan for the suburban charms
of Woodside's garden apartments and shaded streets of shingled
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside soon came to be known as ``Irishtown,'' a conceit it
could preserve during the years when the city was expanding and
restrictive national laws substantially slowed the flow of new
immigrants. But starting in the recessionary 1970s, as the remnants
of the Ellis Island generations moved away, the neighborhood became
a magnet for a new wave of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Now no one group can claim the neighborhood as its turf. In
today's Woodside, people have different, perhaps more pragmatic,
relationships to the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Elvis Jain, a 28-year-old student from
India who favors pointed cowboy boots and recently dropped out of
business school to open a Filipino food store on Roosevelt Avenue
two blocks from St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church. For him, the
neighborhood is a place to make money. His marketing strategy was
simple: ``Filipino people are very religious, so they will always
be passing by here on their way to church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, are Wing and Yee Hom, immigrants from Hong Kong who
bought a small house in 1981 with savings from their restaurant in
Chinatown. The neighborhood offered good schools for their two
children, but even now they do not have a sense of belonging.
``Because I'm Chinese they are still not friendly,'' Mrs. Hom said.
``Sometimes I walk on the street, just a few houses below my own,
and they don't want to say hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are residents like Patrick Finn, whose grandparents,
Irish immigrants, moved here in 1923. He can no longer name all the
families on his block, but the diversity has made the neighborhood
more interesting. ``It doesn't matter to me who runs the stores as
long as they laugh at my jokes,'' said Finn, 46. ``Even if they
don't understand them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Classroom a Teacher Seeks Common Ground
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Silverman welcomes a visitor to her classroom at PS 11
with a wry introduction. ``I'm the only American here,'' she says
with a sweep of her arm to take in the 22 sixth-graders seated in
twos and fours at small metal desks.
</P>
<P>
   In this small space, half of a normal classroom, are children
who need to learn English. They come from India, Korea, China,
Egypt, Bosnia and an array of South American countries _ so many
different countries that Mrs. Silverman is not sure who is from
where.
</P>
<P>
   They are among 300 at the school, out of a total enrollment this
year of nearly 1,300 in kindergarten through sixth grade, who have
been placed in bilingual classes or are assigned to teachers of
English as a second language, like Ms. Silverman. The goal is to
get them reading and writing well enough to be transferred into
regular classes within three years.
</P>
<P>
   PS 11, the stolid brick heart of the neighborhood, has become
one of the city's most crowded schools, with as many as 46 children
in a class, and one of its most linguistically diverse.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Silverman's classroom, a card with ``clock'' written on
it is taped to the clock. The door is labeled. So are the bookcase
and the sink. Against this backdrop of order, her students come and
go, separated into language groups and later recombined as a class.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning the Spanish-speaking children leave for special
instruction in their academic subjects with a Spanish-speaking
teacher. In the afternoon the Korean and Chinese children are
pulled out to study in Korean and Chinese. While they are gone,
other teachers rotate into the class to help those who speak other
languages, including Arabic, Urdu and Bengali.
</P>
<P>
   Organizing their days requires the precision planning of a
military campaign, but one burdened by foot soldiers who do not
always understand the orders and who thus progress at different
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   This morning's task is to draw a picture and write about the
book the class was supposed to have read and understood, in
English, the day before. It is a Chinese folk tale _ the school has
decided that all classes will study China as the multicultural
project of the year _ about a stone cutter named Chan Lo who wants
to carve a fish from a perfect piece of jade.
</P>
<P>
   In a far corner of the room, Sun Soo' Shin, a boy who arrived
from Korea 10 months ago, has had enough of the assignment and has
twisted around in his seat to pull a different book from the shelf
behind him to read on his own. ``The stone,'' he has written next
to a quick sketch of Chan Lo and his jade, ``is make sound like
chop-chop or ss-ss. Chan Lo hear the that sound in the stone.''
</P>
<P>
   But a group of children, flummoxed by the assignment, ignore the
teacher and consult one another quietly in Chinese. Then together
they kneel before the book that is propped against the blackboard,
and all begin to meticulously copy the picture of Chan Lo on the
cover. Seemingly oblivious to the activity around them, they never
get to the task of writing about the story before the bell rings,
45 minutes later, for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, an Indian immigrant named Priyank V. Shukla,
dressed like all his classmates in blue jeans and sneakers, has
quickly finished a minimalist sketch of a man standing by a square
in which a fish floats serenely. He learned English back home, he
says, so he has progressed faster at school. While he waits for his
classmates to finish their drawings, he scrunches over his desk,
grasps his pencil tightly in his fist and writes a dozen lines
about the story.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Prayer Joining a Church, Creating a Home
</P>
<P>
   High above the rows of wooden pews, where the arched
mauve-and-pink rococo ceiling of St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic
Church meets its pale green walls, Cheeman Kim glances at the
green-robed priest below to check his timing and then leans toward
the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please join us in `Jerusalem My Happy Home' on page 226,'' he
announces in slow, heavily accented English, as the hundred or so
worshippers at Sunday morning Mass stand with a rustling of hymnals
and shuffling of feet.
</P>
<P>
   Then he raises his arms, turns to the expectant faces of the 13
members of his all-Korean choir and nods briskly to his wife,
Eunsook, to play the opening chords on the organ. Their voices,
strong and melodious, saturate the chapel, and an expression of
sweet joy suffuses Kim's face.
</P>
<P>
   As it has for generations of immigrants, religion provides a
neighborhood within a neighborhood for people estranged by language
and culture. The latest wave of immigrants has returned the favor:
It has rejuvenated established churches and created new ones to
reflect every conceivable national origin and permutation of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Above the grocery stores and phone parlors on one block of
Roosevelt Avenue, signs advertise the Choong Hyun Church, the
Korean Methodist New York Agape Church and the Spanish Unity
Ministerio de Cristianismo Practico. The Woodside Baptist Church,
built in 1925, shares space with the Gereja Kristen Indonesia
congregation. A Central American evangelical church has moved into
a warehouse across the street from a body repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the house of worship is a safe harbor where immigrants
like them find community in a bewildering world. For others, like
the Kims, the church is a stepping stone to belonging, the first
American institution they dared approach where they felt at ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my home,'' Kim said emphatically, referring to the
Woodside parish where he has now rented a home and opened a music
school. ``This is my hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kims, who immigrated from Seoul eight years ago, could have
joined an all-Korean Catholic church. But they chose the
104-year-old St. Sebastian's _ whose pastor is the latest of an
unbroken line of Irish-Americans in the job _ even though it does
not provide a Korean-language service.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is their 16-year-old son, Paul, who still sings in
his father's choir but speaks fluent English and is quickly picking
up American teen-age cultural accouterments like dyed and spiked
hair. A church just for Korean immigrants _ and a neighborhood
dominated by Korean immigrants _ might drive young people like him
away from the fold and the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second generation doesn't like it,'' Kim said, ``and
doesn't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Kim has begun to emerge from his immigrant shell, too.
His confidence bolstered by several years of dealing with St.
Sebastian officials in his halting English, he recently signed up
as a community volunteer to patrol the streets of Woodside. Twice a
month, he sets a flashing blue light on the roof of his car and
drives around looking for trouble that the police should know
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly it is Korean people who get together,'' he said, ``but
I am trying community groups. Because now I live and work in this
location and I must be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Stores, Movie Rentals Bind a Community
</P>
<P>
   If a neighborhood is a place where everybody knows your name,
then Walter Arana has made this one his own.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived from Lima, Peru, in 1979 at the age of 15, with
barely enough English to navigate the airport arrivals terminal.
Now, after 14 years in the business of renting videos in Woodside,
he has adapted perfectly to his new environment.
</P>
<P>
   Arana needs only to look around him to understand the risks in
an immigrant neighborhood like Woodside with its dizzying mix of
languages, national origins and tastes.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese immigrant who leased his store before him was a
printer, but he failed because he worked only in Chinese. Across
the street was a Spanish-language travel agency that gave way to a
Filipino-run food store that gave way to an Ecuadorian restaurant
that rarely has any customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to market in such a situation,'' said
Arana, jangling the two thin gold chains he wears around his wrist.
``If you're selling clothing, for example, the sizes and the colors
depend on who's in the neighborhood. As a product of this
multicultural society, I learned as I went along.''
</P>
<P>
   What he learned is that each segment of the neighborhood has its
quirks and preferences. Knowing them has made him a popular man and
his shop a haven of neighborly camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, a Mexican man climbed the stairs from the
basement where the adult videos are kept and glided to the counter
holding a pink video box containing a European-made pornographic
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lives with a group of guys who are here without families,''
confided Arana, as the man slipped into the fading afternoon
sunshine on Roosevelt Avenue. ``The Central Americans,'' he added,
revealing another bit of neighborhood intelligence, ``won't rent
the American porno. Too much silicone.''
</P>
<P>
   For his Peruvian customers, he keeps on hand a selection of the
popular television variety show ``Comicos Ambulantes,'' which
friends tape for him in Lima. For some of his American-born
customers who tell him they want to learn Spanish, he stocks
classic comedies with minimal dialogue. For children, immigrant or
not, he has English-language videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids pick up the language real quick,'' he explained, ``so
even though they might not understand everything, they are familiar
with the dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   For Irish immigrants in Woodside _ the old-timers who have lived
there for decades and the newcomers who took advantage of special
visas for the Irish in the early 1990s _ Arana orders any Irish
film he can get. ``They're as sentimental as we are,'' he said.
``They want to see their own people and the same type of stories
they heard when they were little.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when Arana goes out at night for a drink or to watch a
soccer game in one of the local clubs, other customers hail him
like an old friend.
</P>

THE DAUNTING JOB NOBODY CAN FILL FOR LONG: NEW YORK'S SCHOOL
CHANCELLOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., Mass., Ill., Calif., Ore.)  By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As New York City seeks its 12th schools chancellor in
20 years, one question seems inescapable: Can anybody do this job?
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Crew passed landmark governance changes, set up a
summer-school system to end automatic promotion of students, and
helped end principals' tenure, but his bid for a longer contract
was foiled, it seems, by politics and his own indecision. His
predecessor, Ramon C. Cortines, was beloved by school officials but
run out of town over squabbles with the mayor. Before that, Joseph
A. Fernandez, who had tackled corruption in community districts,
was tossed aside after a fight with an irate Board of Education
over instruction on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, one chancellor quit amid financial scandal and
another died in office of a massive asthma attack. The last person
to resign the post voluntarily, Frank J. Macchiarola, left in 1983,
before nearly all of today's schoolchildren were born.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something inherent in the system that makes it
impossible,'' said Joseph P. Viteritti, a special assistant to
Macchiarola who has advised most of the chancellors since that term
and wrote a book on New York school politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're going to start the next search for a miracle
worker,'' Viteritti said with a sigh. ``What we should be doing is
trying to figure out how to make the system more manageable, so we
can get a talented but normal person to run the school system, so
you're not looking for someone who is a combination of Mother
Teresa and Superman.''
</P>
<P>
   With 1.1 million students and 75,000 teachers in 1,100 schools _
not to mention 3,681 people in the central office and an $11
billion budget _ many people think New York's school system is too
vast for one person to run. Others fault the byzantine governance
structure, in which the mayor controls the purse strings, six
politicians appoint the seven-member Board of Education (which
hires and fires the chancellor), and 32 separate elected school
boards have primary control over elementary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the polyglot challenges of urban education, in schools
overflowing with the children of immigrants and the impoverished,
can themselves be overwhelming, and that the public's passionate
interest in educational issues makes things only more difficult. Or
that leading the nation's largest school system requires more
money.
</P>
<P>
   In part, New York's inability to keep a chancellor reflects a
growing crisis around the country, with the tenure of leaders in
large urban school systems averaging just 2.5 years. (Crew lasted
more than four.) As Chicago, Boston and other cities nationwide
overhaul their school systems to give more control to City Hall _
and places like San Diego, Seattle and Washington hand the reins to
noneducators with military or legal backgrounds _ many in New York
are challenging the current setup, which was put in place 100 years
ago to shield the schools from politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job was devised in the factory age of one wise man at the
top of the pyramid,'' said Diane Ravitch, a New York University
professor who has written a history of the system. ``No modern
organization functions this way. We need a chancellor who's going
to take the lead in changing the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some experts denounce as preposterous the notion that
the chancellorship is impossible, and point to Crew's
accomplishments in his first three years on the job as proof.
Considering the frequent turnover of mayors and school board
members _ who understandably want to pick their own school chiefs _
perhaps a longer term is unrealistic, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But in that case, even leaders who are successful at first, like
Crew, end up being perceived as failures when they depart, leaving
a trail of turmoil around the chancellor's office. The constant
turnover means frequent changes in strategy for improving skills in
reading and math. With such a short shelf life, how can significant
reform ever stick?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant churning,'' said Michael Usdan, president of
the Institute for Educational Leadership in Washington. ``You're
always picking up the seedlings by their roots, and nobody wins.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent national survey of 1,719 school superintendents showed
that 92 percent were worried that ``high turnover in the
superintendency means a serious crisis in keeping strong leaders in
the position.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 percent of current superintendents said they would be
interested in running a large urban system; the average tenure at
the helm of school districts overall is 7.25 years, nearly three
times as long as in big cities.
</P>
<P>
   New York, though, is the ``big-city phenomenon, cubed,'' said
James W. Guthrie, an expert in school governance who runs the
Peabody Center for Education Policy at Vanderbilt University. The
distance between the chancellor and the children is too vast,
Guthrie said; he suggested power be returned to local schools and
districts, but warned that such a move would inevitably lead to
more patronage and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a New York chancellor were to visit two schools every
day, it would take three years _ longer than most people last in
the job _ to hit them all. Carol Gresser, a candidate for borough
president of Queens who sat on the Board of Education from 1990 to
1998, said that breakup was the only answer. Staten Island and
Brooklyn have different problems, she said, and need different
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have different entities in each borough for various
things,'' like district attorneys, Ms. Gresser said, suggesting a
similar boroughwide system for schools.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who believe that the system's size is manageable say
the political structure is daunting.
</P>
<P>
   There is the meddling of the mayor, who controls two votes on
the Board of Education as well as the budget, and has a bully
pulpit always available for criticism. Then there are the
personalities of the other five board members and the borough
presidents who appoint them, all of whom are often trying to climb
to higher office. There are also the state legislature, powerful
employee unions and special-interest groups like parents to contend
with.
</P>
<P>
   To offset the authority handed to the 32 local school boards in
1969 _ much of which was undone by a 1997 law for which Crew
lobbied _ chancellors over the years have also built up rolls of
red tape at the headquarters on Livingston Street in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those good people who are supposedly interested in
reform want major improvements, but they don't want to get behind
major structural changes,'' said Stanley S. Litow, who ran two
chancellor search committees in the 1980's and became Fernandez's
deputy. ``Then the schools chancellors, all of them flawed in some
fashion, stumble, and when they stumble, begin to start looking
more vulnerable. Then that vulnerability allows them to be
subjected to a set of events that ultimately leads to them no
longer having the ability to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So, for Fernandez, the enemies he had made attacking local
principals and superintendents helped to engineer his ouster when
the board balked at his push for AIDS education. With Crew, a
months-old fight with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani over vouchers
fanned the flames of mini-scandals over cheating, attendance and
test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, most school systems were carved away from City Hall
at the turn of the century, in an effort to shield education from
politics. But politics crept back in through the school boards,
which are lesser known and thus less accountable than mayors. In
recent years, several big-city mayors have tried to wrest control
of those independent school systems, to mollify constituents who
are increasingly worried about the failures of education.
</P>
<P>
   The model, for many experts, is Chicago, where the mayor took
over in 1995, replaced the elected school board with appointees and
named Paul G. Vallas the chief executive. Vallas ousted scores of
entrenched bureaucrats and remade the structure to resemble a
corporation; test scores have begun to climb out of a deep hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really cannot have educators run major school systems,''
said Vallas, who was a teacher for several years before working in
the state legislature and city government. ``They're simply not
trained.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallas said it was crucial to find someone local, who knows the
political terrain and has experience in government finance. Like
the former United States attorney now running the schools in San
Diego, Vallas has a chief educational officer who handles all
instructional issues _ but none of the operational or budget
matters that often bog down other superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   Also essential, Vallas said, is the united political front,
which leaves little room for critics to block change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are they going to go to, the board?'' he asked. ``The
board is there to back me. They going to go to the mayor? I'm the
mayor's guy. We refer to it as the Holy Trinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Peterkin, director of a doctoral program at Harvard
University that trains urban school superintendents, said he was
befuddled as to why mayoral involvement in other cities had led to
greater stability, whereas in New York, ``it continues to go in a
destructive way for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has had in the last seven years two of the finest
chancellors in the United States,'' he said, about Cortines and
Crew, ``yet they have found a way to make these people unwelcome in
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, is one of many people fretting that the city will soon be
plunged into yet another political battle over school leadership _
and perhaps a larger debate over governance _ just as
standards-based change is beginning to take root. The timing is
particularly bad because the next chancellor will be picked, in
part, by a mayor who may leave office in a year, depending on the
outcome of his likely Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not very pretty and certainly they're a terrible
diversion from what needs to be going on in the schools,'' Ms.
Feldman said of the frequent chancellor searches. ``I just worry
that you then get into a whole discussion about governance, and
you're distracted from education.''

SAFE IN U.S., EX-ENVOY IS HAUNTED BY ROMANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID BINDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Dec. 23, 1989, at the height of Romania's
blood-soaked revolution, Mircea Raceanu, a diplomat condemned to
death as an American spy, was released under an amnesty as the last
political prisoner of the expiring Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   He weighed 121 pounds on leaving Bucharest's Rahova Prison, down
46 from his normal weight.
</P>
<P>
   A decade and several governments later, he again finds himself
under a death sentence in Bucharest, despite the amnesty _ although
he is safe in a Washington suburb, an American citizen since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His sentence was reaffirmed by the Romanian government on June
11, a day after a group of Romanian intellectuals sent a memorandum
to that country's attorney general asking that the sentence be
overturned because Raceanu was ``a committed anti-Communist
fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deputy attorney general declared on national television
that it was ``impossible to rehabilitate Mircea Raceanu.''
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty had been commuted under the Communists to 20
years in prison, but it is not clear whether that commutation
stands.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has asked Romania to clarify the case, a State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Romania has indicated that a response might be provided next
month. A spokesman for the Romanian Embassy here said it had also
sent a query to Bucharest and would respond when an answer came
back.
</P>
<P>
   Now 64, Raceanu was apprehended on a Bucharest street in January
1989 by officers of the state political police, Securitate, as he
was carrying two confidential documents to a reception at the
American ambassador's residence. One document dealt with the
Communist military alliance, the Warsaw Pact, the other with plans
by some journalists for an underground newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty almost immediately because he was privy to
plans by Grigore Raceanu, his stepfather, and five other longtime
Communists, to distribute a letter protesting the repressive
policies of the Ceausescu regime. He wanted to keep knowledge of
the letter to himself. ``I wanted to protect my stepfather,'' he
recalled. ``So I said, `Okay, I'm a spy.'''
</P>
<P>
   His confession, together with the documents _ which he said were
minimal in the category of state secrets _ constituted the only
evidence for his treason trial.
</P>
<P>
   After threats to his life in the spring of 1990 he sought asylum
in the United States. He is completing a memoir about his
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Raceanu and his friends say they are perplexed by the
reaffirmation of his death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Kirk, who was the American ambassador in Bucharest in the
last years of the Ceausescu dictatorship, said: ``Mircea is a man
whom I knew well who was committed to a free and democratic Romania
and worked to that end even under the Ceausescu regime, and it is a
surprise to me that a government that is committed to those same
ideals should reconstitute and restate a sentence against him. It
seems very much at odds with the ideals that government
professes.''
</P>
<P>
   Raceanu said that ``by embracing without reservation the
conclusion of the Ceausescu regime that I am guilty the present
authorities show the same old mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an adversary of the totalitarian regime,'' he continued.
``And if they say now that I am guilty then they are saying that
the Communist regime in Romania was right and it was wrong to fight
against it. The spirit of the Securitate still dominates Romanian
society, although the Democratic coalition came to power in
November 1996 under the slogan of breaking radically with the
Communist past. Unfortunately that did not happen.''

A CALL TO STICK TO THE BUDGET RILES SOME IN THE MILITARY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flush with this year's first real growth in
military spending in more than a decade, Defense Secretary William
S. Cohen has quietly told all the services that in drawing up this
coming year's spending plan they must live within the limits
imposed in the current budget of more than $285 billion and not
expect additional increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a tacit agreement we would live within the
increases,'' said Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget, which will be submitted to Congress in February,
includes $60 billion to buy new weapons systems, a goal long sought
by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as last-minute help from the
White House to cover fuel bills and other expenses that were higher
than expected. But for the last two weeks, the services have been
complaining behind the scenes that some of their pet projects could
be in jeopardy without more money.
</P>
<P>
   Those complaints are especially vexing to the Pentagon's top
officials who feel the Navy, Air Force and Army could be more
gracious in victory. President Clinton and Congress this year
approved a five-year, $112 billion increase, making the military
the biggest beneficiary of the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done very well the last two years _ it's a real success
story,'' said a senior military official overseeing the budget.
``We are very pleased we're able to modernize.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has already announced that it will need an
additional $2.2 billion over the next five years for the national
missile defense system under development, an increase of nearly 20
percent, but that will have to come out of the next year's budget.
Next summer, Clinton will decide whether to deploy the system,
designed to guard against errant missiles from countries like North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Pentagon officials acknowledge that the Army is wrestling
with how to fit its new vision of creating a lighter, more mobile
Army into existing weapons programs. At least one of those
projects, most likely the Crusader artillery system, will have to
be eliminated, a senior Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great controversy and great confusion in the Army
over the budget,'' the official said. ``The Crusader is one of the
programs contingent on remaining where the Army is and not where it
wants to go.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Navy officials say Congress might well put more
money into their shipbuilding program.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget also includes a new program to improve military
housing bases, another in a string of projects to make military
life more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, I think, an important initiative that will be
included in the budget,'' Cohen said last week. ``We are going to
focus on getting adequate housing for folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's package of housing programs, which he will announce in
January, will include fixing up or replacing some of the 200,000
housing units the Defense Department says are in need of major
repairs, and help with the cost of housing not on military bases,
said senior officials who refused to give further details.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting remains one of the military's most serious problems.
Last year Congress approved a 4.8 percent pay increase and a change
in retirement pay as part of an effort to win new recruits and
persuade those already in the service to stay. But for the second
year in a row, the Army fell short of its recruitment goal. The Air
Force and the Navy also struggled to meet their goals, despite new
advertising and inducements.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cohen argues that the Pentagon should be pleased with its
new largess, the leading Republican presidential candidates are
saying that even with the increase, the American military is
woefully underfinanced. Even though the military budget is at a
record high, it represents a smaller portion of the gross national
product than at any time since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a highly decorated
veteran and former prisoner of war, has routinely derided the
military for paying such low salaries that record numbers of
service members have to rely on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 12,000 enlisted personnel _ proud young men and
women _ whose low pay has left them with no choice but to accept
food stamps to feed their families,'' McCain said in a recent
speech. ``Substandard housing for military personnel is now
commonplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican
front-runner, have called for a complete transformation of the
military to meet the demands of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would add $5 billion to the annual military
budget to give the armed forces another pay increase and to pay
research costs to develop new, modern weapons systems that would
``skip a generation of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Those campaign pledges have prompted new calls for an increase
in the Pentagon budget even though Clinton effectively reversed
directions last year with his $12 billion increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, the procurement budget should be at $80
billion, not $60 billion,'' said Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings
Institution. ``The military's problem is very serious. Everything
is wearing out and now they have to replace it.''
</P>
<P>
   The public pressure from the Republican candidates also appears
to have helped persuade the White House to pay some of the
military's outstanding bills. The debate now is over how to spend
the money. This year Congress delayed production of the F-22
fighter jet because of serious cost overruns. In this year's
budget, the Air Force has financed its major modern weapons
programs mindful of the congressional complaints, an official said.

COLUMN: THIS YEAR, SPORTS WENT OVER THE EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something broke this year in sports, but it may not be until
next year or even well into next century before we figure out
exactly what it was and whether it can or should be repaired. It
felt more like the gradual crumbling of a bridge than the snap of
an elevator cable, but the drop was profound and unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   It was as obvious as the snowballs some Denver fans threw at
football players on the field, and as concealed as the batteries
inside those snowballs. Who had changed first, the players or the
fans? Is cause and effect ever that simple?
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it should have been easy to predict that a season
in which Latrell Sprewell replaced Michael Jordan as the signifying
sport's signifying athlete would offer widespread change and
challenge. Not that we can blame either man.
</P>
<P>
   Did Jordan or Sprewell order the umpires to lose their jobs?
Bribe a single Olympic decision-maker? Push Muhammad Ali's daughter
into the ring? And neither of them has ever been found guilty of
the routine transgressions of jock culture _ beating up women, drug
and alcohol abuse, illegal gambling. In fact, beating up women
seems to have become such a routine news event that there is even a
Web site devoted to listing male athletes and coaches who have been
accused of abusing women.
</P>
<P>
   But the transition from the cool, corporate, distanced Michael
to the overheated, individualistic, erratic Spree seemed to
indicate that the center was no longer holding, that sports was
balkanizing, spinning out of control into what will be some new
configuration, less like the vicious socialism of the National
Football League and more like the friendly fascism of pro
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   And what have we learned? If Michael was aberrational, a
one-of-a-kind logo for globalization, does this mean that shoes as
self-expression is over? That's good. There is something pathetic
about the swoosh as self. But does that mean you have to choke your
coach to get our attention? How good do you have to be to actually
injure your coach and still return to the game? Was Michael
important enough to kill his coach and come back?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we also missed an opportunity here to look into
coach-player dynamics; just how emotionally abusive a coach was
P.J. Carlesimo? He always seemed a far more dangerous role model
than Sprewell. Even an obscure coach can salvage or wreck a hundred
lives. Most athletes tend to affect only themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Especially with Jordan gone, it was easy for Muhammad Ali to
emerge this year as the consensus athlete of the century. The pick
that would have seemed breathtakingly radical when he actually was
the world's most famous person now seems a safe bet.
</P>
<P>
   Never as economically important as Jordan and once considered
far more of a moral danger than Sprewell, Ali has been tamed by
disease and new times. He seems to be celebrated mostly for his
nostalgia value rather than his long-gone power to shake up the
world.
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan and Babe Ruth were probably his closest rivals, a
very strong case for the century's MVP could be made for Billie
Jean King. Her impact on sports _ think women, promotion, populism
and professionalism _ has been enormous and unique.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Billie Jean will have to take some indirect blame for
the ring career of Laila Ali. What's that about? Is she hyping a
modeling career, following Dad, integrating a sport, satisfying a
blood lust? Why does women's boxing seem like something that should
be on a jock porn site?
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those can-it-or-should-it-be-repaired questions. But
we'll be asked: How can we ban boxing now that it would be unfair
to women as well as poor boys? Or at least until Mike Tyson gets a
chance to finish his slow-motion public suicide.
</P>
<P>
   What feels so profound and unsettling about that is the
willingness of so many promoters, television executives,
commentators, fans, to go along with it, freely admitting that
Tyson is necessary for the box office. Implicit is that as soon as
he is replaced _ with a pugilistic version of pro wrestling _ he
will be dumped to destroy himself in private.
</P>
<P>
   Every season we have to remind ourselves that all this is
important because sports holds the promise of renewal and
inspiration. The bridge crumbles, we learn to swim the river, the
elevator cable snaps, we get in shape by walking the stairs. Just
as long as we weren't on the bridge or elevator when it broke.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong's victory in the Tour de France was my pick for
best moment in sports this year. Lance, whom I've never met, shares
a type of cancer with me. When he won, I went out and bought a
bicycle. I have so far made my way up to a 35-mile trip. That's not
symbolic. What is symbolic is that, on the eve of a new time,
sports can give me the power to believe I have just begun to pedal.

AMERICANS' SECRET DEAL SHOWS A TRAP FOR RUSSIA'S TRANSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 4 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 7 p.m. ET EMBARGO
for electronic media.) 
(mk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, when an American company was seeking a toehold
in the newly privatized and potentially lucrative Russian
telecommunications market, it cut a secret deal with directors and
officers at the Moscow telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the arrangement, which has raised legal and ethical
questions and thrown a light on how some Western businessmen have
operated in Russia, the American company, Global Telesystems, paid
at least $65 million in stock and cash. Global paid the money to a
company the insiders had set up in the Bahamas to avoid public
scrutiny and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Global Telesystems ended up with ownership of a
Russian telecommunications company that generates millions of
dollars a year in revenues by providing service to 150,000 Moscow
customers, most of them businesses willing to pay a premium. The
eight Russians who took part in the deal each walked away with
about $9 million in cash and stock, tax free.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government says the phone company insiders committed
fraud and tax evasion, and has opened an investigation, as have law
enforcement agencies in countries where the insiders stashed their
gains. Global Telesystems, a fast-growing company based in McLean,
Va., says the transaction broke no Russian or American laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Telesystems deal illustrates how Western business
maneuvers may sometimes undermine Western governments' efforts to
promote Russia's economic transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Western business and political leaders have lectured Russians
over and over, saying that if they want to attract foreign
investment, they must adopt laws to protect shareholders' rights
and improve tax collection. But the Global Telesystems deal
resulted in the Moscow phone company's being defrauded of more than
$200 million, based on the value of the phone lines and projected
revenues, according to the Russian Ministry of Interior and Western
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Other shareholders in the company, Moscow City Telephone
Network, include the Russian government and a handful of investors
in the United States, where its stock is also traded.
</P>
<P>
   In America, the insiders' dealings would provoke shareholder
lawsuits, corporate and securities law experts say. That is
unlikely in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if this was not illegal, the question is, was it ethical
and smart?'' said Jonathan Winer, who monitored money laundering
and other international activities as a deputy assistant secretary
of state before stepping down recently.
</P>
<P>
   An American investment banker in Moscow described the Global
deal as ``only the tip of the iceberg,'' just one example of how
Western companies have engaged in business practices in Russia that
they would not try at home. Most of the cases, he and other
executives said, remain carefully guarded corporate secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Details on the arrangement between Global Telesystems and the
phone company insiders emerge from documents filed by Global
Telesystems with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
information on the company insiders gathered by law enforcement
officials in the United States, Russia and Europe. Global
Telesystems was well positioned for opportunities offered by the
new Russia, like the 1994 privatization of Moscow City Telephone.
The American company had worked in the old Communist Soviet Union
in the early 1980s, when the company was based in California and
called San Francisco/Moscow Teleport.
</P>
<P>
   It changed its name to Global Telesystems in 1995, and issued
stock publicly two years later, with a $200 million initial
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Global Telesystems put its Russian and other
Eastern European operations into a subsidiary, Golden Telecom, sold
off 34 percent in an initial public offering and raised $144
million more.
</P>
<P>
   One of Global's biggest backers, from its early days, has been
George Soros, the international financier who has been active,
commercially and philanthropically, in the former Soviet Union. Two
years ago, Soros and his affiliate companies owned 26 percent of
Global Telesystems, according to a company filing with the SEC,
though he never played any management role at the company. His
stake in the company is now about 7.7 percent, a spokesman for
Soros said. It is still one of the larger stakes in the company
after some institutional holders like Fidelity and Putnam
Investments.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said that Soros had not been aware of the deal
between Global Telesystems and the Moscow City Telephone insiders
until asked about it by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The insiders and Global Telesystems used three companies to
carry out their deal, which made it more difficult for government
officials to trace. They were Invest-Project, registered in Russia;
GTS-Vox, registered in Britain, and Swinton Ltd., which was
registered in the Bahamas, a haven for corporate secrecy and tax
avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said there were eight shareholders of
Invest-Project and Swinton. They included five top executives and
directors of the Moscow telephone company _ the general director,
Vladimir Lagutin, and four deputy directors, Said Alimbekov, Viktor
Panov, Semyon Rabovsky and Sabiryan Shambazov.
</P>
<P>
   None of these individuals nor Moscow City Telephone responded to
requests for comment, including a fax with detailed questions.
Swinton's American lawyer, Jacob Laufer of Manhattan, would not
disclose the names of the Swinton shareholders. ``The principals
value their privacy,'' he said. He would not say what business
Swinton was engaged in, but said it was ``lawful and proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the general counsel for Global Telesystems, Grier
Raclin, said in a written statement that the transaction between
his company and the phone company insiders ``was totally
aboveboard, legitimate and consistent with the laws and business
practices in Moscow.''

 UNDATED: in Moscow.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first step in the deal was for Moscow City Telephone to
award the insiders' company, Invest-Project, the contract to
provide telephone connections for 150,000 Moscow customers. Exactly
how much the insiders paid has not been made public, but
investigators and one person familiar with the deal estimate that
it was about $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Five days earlier, the insiders and Global Telesystems had
already agreed to sell 95 percent of Invest-Project to GTS-Vox.
Since Swinton wholly owned GTS-Vox, this meant they were merely
transferring ownership from a company registered in Russia to one
whose owners were hidden behind Bahamian secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was for Swinton to sell 53 percent of GTS-Vox to
Global Telesystems. For that, Global Telesystems paid with stock
worth about $26 million. This translates into $3.25 million in
stock for each of the Russian phone company executives.
</P>
<P>
   Putting in telephone lines increased the profit because most of
the lines went to businesses willing to pay a premium, as much as
$500 for a connection, in addition to monthly service charges.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues of Telecommunications of Moscow _ the new name for
Invest-Project _ grew from nothing in 1995 to $16.5 million in
1996, $29 million in 1997 and $21.5 million for the first six
months of 1998, according to Global's SEC filings.
</P>
<P>
   From those revenues, the insiders and Global Telesystems paid
themselves more than $7 million in dividends.
</P>
<P>
   The final bonanza came last year when Global Telesystems bought
Swinton's remaining interest in Telecommunications of Moscow for
$40 million in cash. That produced a windfall of about $5 million
for each of the phone company insiders and brought their total
receipts on the deal to nearly $9 million each.
</P>
<P>
   But when the insiders started moving their money around the
world, they attracted unwanted scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Swinton and each shareholder had an account at BankBoston. In
September 1998, Global Telesystems paid $7.4 million into the
Swinton account. Then Swinton quickly moved $895,000 into each
insider's account, said a senior law enforcement official and
another individual familiar with Swinton's financial activities.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of so much money set off alarm bells at the bank,
and it alerted federal authorities. The FBI and the U.S. Customs
Service opened an investigation, and in November 1998, a federal
judge in Boston ordered the accounts frozen. The bank would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But early this year, the U.S. attorney in Boston, Donald Stern,
decided not to prosecute, said lawyers for the companies. Federal
investigators, who thought they had a case of possible money
laundering, were dismayed. ``The case was not aggressively
pursued,'' said one senior law enforcement official. An
investigator from another federal agency said the case had been
``prematurely closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Stern declined to answer any questions
about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Swinton and Global said the case was closed, but
the court record remains sealed. The New York Times filed a motion
last month to have it opened, contending that keeping the record
from the public violated the First Amendment. A hearing is
scheduled for January.
</P>
<P>
   After the Boston accounts were unfrozen early this year, the
insiders quickly moved their money abroad, this time to Denmark,
according to law enforcement officials in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on evidence provided by the Russians, the Danes promptly
seized the accounts, on the theory that the money had been
fraudulently obtained, according to American and European
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the deal were also sent to Israel and Switzerland,
and authorities there are still investigating, officials said.

OLD PLANTS WITH NEW PARTS PRESENT PROBLEM TO EPA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Wis.)  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, W.Va. _ In the roaring hot interior of the Philip
Sporn electric plant, giant pulverizers work around the clock to
reduce coal to the consistency of talcum powder. Howling fans then
blow it into giant boilers.
</P>
<P>
   Every second that the plant operates, it grinds and burns 200
pounds of coal. Every second, it produces enough energy to run a
medium-sized city.
</P>
<P>
   To its owner, American Electric Power Corp., Sporn is an
engineering marvel, the first coal plant in the world to produce a
kilowatt-hour of power with less than 10,000 BTUs, which is well
under a pound of the coal it uses. This level of efficiency is far
better than the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   To the Environmental Protection Agency, the problem is that
Sporn set that standard 50 years ago. The plant, environmental
regulators say, is a relic of the era when the symbol of prosperity
was a smokestack spewing a fat black plume; now, they say, it is
time to clean up or shut down.
</P>
<P>
   But Sporn and plants like it are, for now at least, doing
neither. Entering what might have been their twilight years, they
are producing more electricity than ever by running for more hours
every year, as utility deregulation promotes shipment of their
cheap electricity over increasingly long distances, from the banks
of the Ohio River here to the big load centers of the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   And if their owners have their way, plants like this may be
nearly eternal. Rather than being replaced by new generating
stations with younger technology, Sporn may be an example of the
past replacing the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lifetime is 35, 40 or 45 years on many components, but not
all components,'' said Mark Gray, manager of American Electric
Power's environmental services division, during a recent tour of
the plant. ``Some may have an expected design life of 10 years or
15 years,'' he said, but some major parts, with proper painting and
cleaning, will endure ``for centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   And the end of a component's life does not mean the end of a
plant's, he said; it just means time for replacement, and then a
plant can run like new for years.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA emphatically disagrees. ``If you want to treat it as a
newish unit, you should have newish controls,'' Sylvia Lowrance,
the agency's principal deputy assistant administrator, said in an
interview in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sporn is one of the coal-fired plants cited by the EPA in a suit
filed last month against seven utilities that are charged with
violating the Clean Air Act, in what the agency says is one of the
largest investigations in its history.
</P>
<P>
   When the act was passed in 1970, it set strict emissions limits
for new plants and looser ones for those already running, as long
as no modifications were made. At Sporn and 23 other plants, the
agency alleges, utility companies have quietly rebuilt, bit by bit,
and the plants have lost their grandfathered status.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, many people say they never foresaw the idea of a
50-year-old power plant being viewed as in its prime. Sporn these
days is an interesting hybrid, with high-technology computers
replacing the old control panels in its control rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Clean Air Act has meant big changes for Sporn. The
2-foot-high letters that spell the plant's name are mostly obscured
now by precipitators erected around it to reduce fly ash, and its
stacks now produce only modest white wisps. Its sulfur output is
way down, too, because it has switched to cleaner coal. But it
still emits far more sulfur, which causes acid rain, and nitrogen
oxides, which cause smog, than a new plant would.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1960s, utilities retired old plants, the way people
today replace personal computers, because new ones were cheaper and
better. But by the '70s the pace of progress in generating stations
had slowed, and the new plants were not necessarily better than the
old ones.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental regulations themselves had an effect _ what
David Hawkins, a high-ranking official at the EPA during the Carter
administration, referred to as ``the Heisenberg effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Werner Heisenberg was a physicist who postulated that observing
an experiment would change its outcome. The Clean Air Act, said
Hawkins, who is now with the Natural Resources Defense Council,
also changed the outcome: It created an incentive to avoid the new
rules by never replacing old plants with new ones. The act, he
said, ``had built into it the potential for abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Billings, who was Edmund Muskie's chief aide on the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee from 1966 through 1978 and
thus an important player in the debate over the Clean Air Act and
its 1977 amendments, said such legislation created a problem for
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the National Environmental Policy Act, which
requires public hearings and environmental impact statements, as
well as various other legal challenges, building a new power plant
has become an ordeal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a utility manager,'' Billings said, ``you say, `A
new one wouldn't be a whole lot more efficient, and they're not
letting me build nuclear; maybe what I should do is just gussy up
what I've got.'''
</P>
<P>
   And now there is uncertainty over the deregulation of the
utility industry, and over whether new generating technologies will
emerge that make central-station power plants obsolete. As a
result, hardly any new coal plants have been built in the last 10
years. Plants like Sporn are thought of by their owners not as old
but as almost eternal.
</P>
<P>
   And as demand for power has grown, companies like American
Electric Power, operating in an increasingly competitive market,
have found they can maximize their investment by running fewer
plants for more hours, rather than building new ones. ``They're
operating at 80, 90 percent of capacity, instead of 60 percent,''
said Billings, who is now a consultant on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Billings pointed out in an interview that the word
``grandfather'' is not in the 1970 act. What the law did, he said,
was to allow the government to set new controls on old plants
strict enough to solve local pollution problems, and to demand that
new plants use the best available technology at the time they were
built.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Billings says _ and many people agree _ is that the
EPA dropped the ball and did not pay close attention to changes at
the plants.
</P>
<P>
   The agency did sue, but not until 1989, when it asserted that
Wisconsin Electric Power Co. had modified a plant in a way that
made it subject to the rules for new plants. A court agreed with
most of the agency's arguments, and now officials are arguing that
the utilities have been on notice since then.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials declined to give details about their accusations
against Sporn, because, they said, the company was contending that
some of what it had divulged to regulators was confidential
business information. But there is no dispute about what was done _
only about how to characterize it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, surrounding the combustion zone in Sporn's boilers
are pipes, lined up a little like bars on a cell, and inside is
water. At the top and bottom, big metal parts called headers
connect all the pipes, so the water can flow into one larger pipe.
At various times in 1990 and 1991, American Electric Power replaced
headers in four of Sporn's boilers.
</P>
<P>
   After the water has been boiled into steam and run through
turbines, to convert steam energy into the mechanical power of a
turning shaft, the steam must be turned back to water. To do that
involves running the steam through yet more pipes in a device
called a condenser; outside those pipes is water from the Ohio
River. But the pipes corrode over time, and the utility replaced
all the pipes in three condensers in 1990 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   To engineers here, the issue is simple. Sporn operates with
steam under pressure of 4,500 pounds per square inch and
temperatures at 1,100 degrees, far higher than a nuclear plant, and
produces nearly a million pounds of steam per hour. Consequently,
the engineers do not hesitate to replace heavy metal parts that
show signs of corrosion, or of erosion from steam or water flowing
past at 45 miles an hour, for months on end. Not to do so, they
say, would be suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Ms. Lowrance of the EPA, replacing major
components year after year eventually becomes the equivalent of
building a new plant. Congress set up the rule on modifications,
she said, ``so that life-extension projects don't go on forever.''
If they could go on forever, she said, Congress would never have
agreed to let old plants operate on laxer standards than those
applied to new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Some people agree with her. Gaylord Nelson, a senator from
Wisconsin from 1963 to 1981 and the organizer of the first Earth
Day in 1970, said of the grandfather provisions, ``That compromise
had to be made if you were going to get enough votes to pass the
act.'' But an eventual phase-out was assumed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, on the other hand, pointed out that the law does not set
any time limit on the plants; if Congress had wanted one, he said,
it would surely have written one in.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials say they hope to settle the case, but negotiations
have dragged on for months. If it goes to court, they say, they
will argue that the work constitutes ``modifications'' partly
because it was financed as capital investments, not maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Plant officials say that has no bearing on the nature of the
physical work, and they add that Sporn's construction cost was paid
off in the early 1980s. Every penny of value that Sporn and other
old plants in its system carry on the utility's books, they say, is
postconstruction expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   Among environmentalists and utility experts, there is no
certainty about which side will prevail. The uncertainty also
extends to the plant workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the control room here, Brent Watts, a 31-year-old engineer
who has worked at Sporn for seven years, reflected for a moment on
the idea that the plant was older than he was. ``I hope it gets us
till we get old enough to leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He looked uncertain, though.

COMMENTARY: WAITING FOR ASSAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes you're reading along and a fact just jumps off the
page at you. Like this one, for instance: Syria's economy, its GNP,
is one-seventh the size of Israel's. That means Syria, with 16.5
million people, produces about 15 percent of what the Israeli
economy produces with 5.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   I toss this out not to embarrass the Syrians. The Syrians
actually have a talented merchant class, which, if unleashed, would
quickly transform the Syrian economy. I toss it out to underscore
the tremendous imbalance of power that exists today between Israel
and Syria _ militarily, economically and technologically.
</P>
<P>
   This imbalance of power is an important backdrop to the current
Syrian-Israeli peace talks. Put simply, Israel, the vastly more
developed and powerful country, is being asked to relinquish a
strategic asset, the Golan Heights, to a weaker Syria, in return
for security guarantees and a still-to-be-determined Syrian
normalization with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting is that despite their power advantage
Israelis aren't just saying: ``Who needs this deal?'' Instead, a
slim majority of Israelis are leaning toward it, because they
believe it has the potential to actually enhance Israel's strength
_ by extracting Israel from its bloody quagmire in south Lebanon,
by turning Syria into a buffer between Israel and Iran instead of a
bridgehead through which Iran bleeds Israel, by transforming Syria
from the vanguard of the Arab ideological struggle against Israel
to a member of the circle of peace around Israel and by enabling
Israelis to drive directly across Syria to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But while a majority of Israelis are leaning in favor, they're
not there yet, because they still need to be convinced by President
Hafez Assad of Syria not only that such benefits actually accrue to
Israel if it relinquishes the Golan, but also that they will be
grounded in a wholly different Syrian approach to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   If a Golan deal is to have a solid majority in Israel, and if it
is to win the support of the American Congress, which will be asked
to help pay for it, Assad is going to have to undertake his own
initiative of reconciliation that says to Israelis this really is a
new day _ and it's not just going to be one day, the day Israel
relinquishes the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   With the parties resuming negotiations in Washington on Jan. 3,
Assad needs to move. If each act of reconciliation toward Israel
that he makes has to be squeezed out of him, if there is no sense
that each comes out of a real willingness to change the
relationship between the Syrian people and Israel, there will be no
impact. When things are squeezed out of you, you may feel as if you
are giving, but the other person will not feel as if he is getting.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar Sadat's genius was that he not only gave to Israelis the
reconciliation they most craved without being squeezed to do so, he
did it before talks even began. Also, by both his actions and his
words, Sadat made Israelis believe that it was a new day _ that
there was no going back for him so therefore there could be no
turning away by Israelis. Assad has done neither yet. Why is Assad
negotiating with Israel now? What is new for him? He has never
explained.
</P>
<P>
   There is going to be an Israeli referendum on this deal, so the
Israeli public will be deciding. Only Assad can tip the balance
firmly in favor, and he can do that best by opening the way, right
now, to contacts between Israelis and Syrians, who want peace and
an opening of Syria to the world every bit as much as Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Assad allowed a reporter from Israel's largest
newspaper, Yediot, to visit Damascus last week, and the reporter's
story in Friday's paper, including a picture of Syrian soldiers
embracing him and his conversations with Syrian students and
businessmen, was the buzz of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more Israelis can feel the Syrian response in the streets,
the more they will be convinced that this isn't just a deal with a
dictator,'' said the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi.
``Assad doesn't have to democratize Syria today, but he has to
democratize the peace, and he has to do it in a way that Israelis
see comes from his initiative, not something being squeezed out of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad has already started conditioning the Syrian public with
the new posters being plastered around Damascus: ``We fought with
honor. We will negotiate with honor. We will make peace with
honor.'' That's a good start. Now he has to condition the Israelis.

   Six shopping days left until the century cusp, and the average
shopper has stopped ordering bulk shipments of mineral water and
started making lunch dates for January. Pundits who spent the fall
debating portents of doom have begun making predictions about the
next hundred years and the next thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting the apocalypse couldn't have remained a national sport
for long. After all, the whole fun of a national sport is rooting
for some guy, no matter how messed up he is, and wondering whether
he'll prevail against incredible odds. If the Messiah showed up He
would just prevail. What fun is that? The final weeks of most
centuries have been more nerve-racking than the denouement of this
one.
</P>
<P>
   The first time a century ended, members of a desert religious
sect got themselves buried in Qumran with their graves facing north
so they could greet the Messiah when He resurrected them. He didn't
show.
</P>
<P>
   In the 990s, Christian priests took the Vikings to be the
biblical destroyers from Gog and Magog bringing the end of the
world. Turned out they were just Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Today the world is still intact, despite gloomy predictions from
the heavy hitters of prophecy. The mystic Edgar Cayce, who
accurately predicted the stock market crash of 1929, predicted that
the American coasts would flood in 1998. Jeane Dixon, the
astrologer who foresaw John F. Kennedy's assassination, thought a
world war would be fought in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably the world was supposed to explode this past July,
according to Nostradamus, who wrote cryptic prophetic verses in
1555 and usually hated to give a verifiable date. But he liked it
when numbers came in threes, so in one of his rare specific moods
he foretold the Great Fire of 1666: ``The blood of the just will be
required in London/burned by fire in thrice twenty and six.''
</P>
<P>
   In another precise moment, he pinpointed this past July as a
time of war and heaven-sent destruction: ``In the year 1999 seven
months,/From the sky will come a great King of Terror. ... Before
and afterwards Mars rules happily.'' Interpreters of the verse have
seen the King of Terror as a fusion weapon, a nuclear warhead or a
spaceship due to land around Independence Day. (Could he have been
anticipating the movie?)
</P>
<P>
   After July came and went, fans of eschatological prophecy calmed
down a bit. But the big breakthrough came in September, the start
of the academic year, with the arrival of next year's day planners,
the Filofaxes and the art calendars in stationery stores. Ancient
mystics did not have stationery stores and could remain riled up
for longer. Contemporary mystics had to face facts. How could time
both be ending and also be mapped out on so many glossy sheets of
cardboard? Anticipating the end suddenly seemed not a sign of faith
and imagination but just a good excuse to put off one's car
payments.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the mood has changed from predicting the end to
predicting the future, the time frame seems too long term. How can
we think about the next century or the next millennium, when it's
hard enough to tell what's going to happen this week?
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. A round-up of predictions for the coming week
appears below. Unlike predictions for the year 3000, these can be
verified. Just keep this newspaper around until next Sunday.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: JOHN ROCKER'S PERSONA AND `CORPORATE SYNERGY'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been mulling over rational explanations for why John Rocker
would so willingly stand up in front of the world to model the
naked truth about his fundamental life tenets, if that's what they
really are. I've been wondering what _ besides stupidity that is
almost beyond belief _ would induce a young man on the brink of
stardom to volunteer his neck for a national tomahawk chop?
</P>
<P>
   Could it have been that Rocker was saying what he thought people
wanted to hear? Could he, as so many late-20th-century athletes are
wont to do, have mistaken a news media forum for the grand stage of
the bizarre?
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: every time Rocker opened his mouth to spew some
garbage back at the equally foul New York City baseball fans last
fall, more salivating reporters came charging his way. Every time
he stuck his tongue out like some fifth-grade bully in the
elementary school cafeteria, the picture went directly into the
paper. Every time Rocker acted like a jerk to bring attention to
him, that's exactly what he got.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public monster Rocker created during the playoffs appears
to have consumed him,'' Michael A. Lough, assistant sports editor
of The Telegraph, Rocker's hometown newspaper in Macon, Ga., wrote
Friday. ``Something seems to have consumed him, for the John Rocker
of late 1999 doesn't seem to be the same one of a year earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't pretend to know, either. But I am familiar with what a
25-year-old athlete whose emotional development was most likely
stunted at 15 has been conditioned to think is potentially
profitable, and cool. Interestingly, Lough, who covered Rocker in
high school, wrote that the Rocker whose xenophobic bile appeared
in the latest issue of Sports Illustrated does not seem to
recognize the differences between a ``rasslin' show and real
life.''
</P>
<P>
   What a surprise, that the public persona Rocker has been
cultivating _ madman out of the bullpen _ would bear so much
resemblance to the stark ravings of the wrestling industry that
provides stellar ratings and revenue for, among others, the cable
network Ted Turner started. What a revelation, that someone might
be inclined to follow the path to commercials and film blazed by a
rasslin' role model named Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   What flaming hypocrites we are here in New York, city of
Sprewell, starting with our dueling candidates for Senate, who
jumped at the first opportunity to use Rocker to promote their
campaigns. The mayor should find his heart for the homeless and
repair his corrupt, crumbling schools before he worries about
fixing Rocker. The first lady might wish to recall which syndicated
radio show that soars on the wings of insensitive ethnic humor her
husband, and countless other politicians, have repeatedly phoned
into when they want to plug into the desired demographic market.
</P>
<P>
   When a microphone is thrust into the face of a John Rocker, does
he have the maturity or common sense to know if he is being judged
by the different standards of entertainment and sports?
</P>
<P>
   In one industry, anything usually goes. In the other, terms of
morality are loosely and self-righteously applied. In these days of
corporate synergy, when the same company (Time Warner) that owns
Rocker's team also publishes the magazine doing the interview, does
he even know anymore which role comes first?
</P>
<P>
   It is not terribly difficult to imagine Rocker riding in the car
with his interviewer, the tape recorder running, his mind racing,
his juices flowing. Knowing what athletes know about the harmonic
nature of locker room banter and drive-time humor, it is easy to
imagine this silly man suddenly casting himself as one of the guys
cracking wise with Don Imus or Howard Stern.
</P>
<P>
   I've said this before, and I'll keep saying it, too. In what
borders on insanity, there has been a greater national uproar over
Rocker's rock-headedness than over the murder allegations against
Rae Carruth and the calamitous cycle of athletes' violence against
women. More people keep popping out of Carruth's past to defend his
poetic and gentle character, to insist that these horrific charges
do not define the man. And while we must hedge our comments on
Carruth on the fair presumption of innocence, here is a national
posse ready to run Rocker out of baseball before anyone has
produced compelling evidence that indicates he practices what he
preached.
</P>
<P>
   Some athletes persuade us with words that bear little relation
to their actions. Latrell Sprewell, notorious coach-choker,
followed up that offense by racing his car up the exit ramp of a
California freeway, nearly killing two people. Many of the same
folks now calling for Rocker's scalp buy Sprewell jerseys for their
kids. Sprewell's rebel-without-a-cause reputation has surely played
a role in his redemption. Do Sprewell and Rodman and Stone Cold
Steve Austin factor into this Rocker story? I don't know. That is
for the Braves to find out.
</P>
<P>
   It is for the Braves to figure out if Rocker's comments were
heartfelt as, say, Reggie White's homophobic remarks of a few years
ago that went, by the way, unpunished. They know him better than we
do. Andruw Jones, out of Curacao, one of ``those people'' who got
into the country, roomed with Rocker when they played for the
Braves' farm team in Macon. The Braves' players who come from a
variety of Latin and Caribbean nations have idled away the hours
with Rocker in the clubhouse. They can better determine if what
Rocker said is in his heart, or if he is just another Frankenstein
reflection of the shock culture that diminishes us more than anyone
on the No. 7 train ever could. &QL;

PARCELLS RATES   A GAME BALL   FOR THE SEASON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Jets are merely 6-8 as they near the end of a season in
which they were supposed to contend for the Super Bowl. Yet getting
to 6-8 has been one of the finest achievements in Bill Parcells'
coaching career, a career that includes three Super Bowl
appearances and two championships.
</P>
<P>
   After their 1-6 start, the Jets have been more than competitive.
They are 5-2 over their last seven games, the second-best record in
that stretch among American Conference teams.
</P>
<P>
   Accomplishing this turnaround, even with their playoff hopes all
but dead, has actually energized Parcells. He has kept off weight.
He runs three miles two or three days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more tired last year with a winning team than I am this
year,'' he said last week while preparing the Jets for their Monday
night game against the Dolphins in Miami. ``I've tried to be
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes it as something like teaching _ if you've got the
right students, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being a schoolteacher,'' Parcells said. ``When you
have pupils that are eager to learn, it's easier to teach. You may
have seen films of me yelling on the sidelines. In one of them, I'm
telling Phil Simms, `Pay attention!'''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' fresh outlook indicates to some observers that he will
probably return. Certainly, his players feel that way _ especially
with quarterback Ray Lucas turning into one of the league's
surprise players, a new owner coming within a few weeks, and the
Jets playing more like the contenders they thought they would be
than the spoilers they are now.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, since arriving in 1997, Parcells has kept the Jets
steady, through good times and bad. By comparison, just look at how
the Jets collapsed the two years before he arrived _ no December
victories in the Rich Kotite era, players mumbling, the front
office in disarray, everyone, it seemed, pointing fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, though, have won their last two December games, giving
Parcells' Giants, Patriots and Jets teams a 38-21 mark during the
month. Over all, the Jets are 7-3 in December with Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more of a positive feeling around the locker room,''
said linebacker Chad Cascadden, who has been a Jet since 1995.
``Also, we were successful last year. I think this team has adopted
Bill's personality of not quitting. When Richie was here, I'm not
sure the team reflected his personality. Some guys were on their
own program.''
</P>
<P>
   Those players are gone. Those that remain _ there are 14 who
were here in 1996 _ have given Parcells few problems. There are no
locker-room dissidents, even though most will grumble from time to
time about the Parcells style.
</P>
<P>
   Jumbo Elliott has had a love-hate relationship with Parcells
going back to their Giants days. Parcells saw Elliott go to the Pro
Bowl as a Giant in 1993, but fined him as a Jet for being late to a
practice this season when Elliott had a stomach virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's always been very good in getting your focus back very
quickly, whether you've won or lost,'' Elliott said. ``If you win,
he doesn't let you think you're invincible; if you've lost, he gets
you to move on. But that 1-6 start could easily have been a 5-2. We
made some blunders at the ends of games. I've been around a lot of
teams with him and he's done a great job. Just this year he had to
change the game plan for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   That was no mean feat. ``One of the hardest things I had to do
this year is figure, how do you win?'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered what the club could do when its scoring was
compromised with the season-ending injury to Vinny Testaverde in
the opening game. Testaverde's absence compounded the injury to the
clutch receiver Wayne Chrebet, who missed the first five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you can't win,'' Parcells concluded. ``You saw it: 16-13
to the Colts, 16-6 to Jacksonville. A key penalty, a turnover on
offense the opening game. You put your hands down and say, `Look,
boys, this is what we've got to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   What the Jets did, among other things, was reassess their
strengths. In the process, Parcells turned the Jets into a team of
attrition rather than one that could make the big play to
complement the running of Curtis Martin. Every day Parcells put
players through fumble-recovery drills, interception drills,
holding-onto-the-ball drills, special-teams drills.
</P>
<P>
   The offense during Lucas' early tutoring did not even see a pass
carry 20 yards. The idea was not to make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   This subtle transformation in the depleted Jets took place
against what has proved to be the league's toughest schedule. Jets'
opponents have a combined won-lost mark of 82-58.
</P>
<P>
   The results of Parcells' attention to detail, and his
acquisition of tenacious players, show in many ways. The Jets rank
fourth in the NFL in takeaway-giveaway differential. The only clubs
ahead of them are Jacksonville (13-1), Tennessee (11-3) and Kansas
City (9-5). Lucas, who has started seven times in his career, has
the lowest interception rate in pro football. The Jets rank fourth
in the conference in keeping opponents pinned back after kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we don't win these next two games,'' said Parcells,
``I think the team has improved, so I can look positively upon
that. But right now all I'm concerned about is that Miami will be
prepared to counter the things we did the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, forget about that 28-20 victory two weeks ago.
Today's game hasn't been won yet. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first thing you notice is that everyone has
done the reading. Not a single student shies away from the seminar
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   You glimpse a graying lady switching eyeglasses between scanning
the text of ``The Optimist's Daughter,'' by Eudora Welty, and
glancing at the author's photographs of Mississippi. A balding
gentleman turns his left ear, the one with the hearing aid, toward
whoever is talking. A couple of canes are propped in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   This is definitely not your typical college class.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Plato Society, an educational haven for retirees,
they prefer not even to call it a class. Please, say study group.
Teachers? Call them coordinators. No papers, no tests. Just
learning, for learning's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very narrow-minded in my education. I came here to
broaden my education,'' explained Bud Hellman, 76, an engineer who
spent the fall studying the films of Stanley Kubrick. ``If I was to
live again, I'd want to be a student someplace, at one of these
beautiful modern campuses. This is my campus.''
</P>
<P>
   With the increased emphasis on standardized testing in
elementary and secondary education, and a push toward job training
even at liberal arts colleges, the purity of the intellectual
exercise at Plato is rare to behold. But it reflects an explosion
in the lifelong learning movement, as the first generation to
pursue higher education in big numbers _ thanks largely to the GI
Bill _ has settled into its Golden Years.
</P>
<P>
   Experts expect study among older citizens to continue to
skyrocket as baby boomers retire and live longer and healthier
lives. The fellowship in places like Plato can be crucial for
people who crave the sense of community they lost when they left
the workplace; research also suggests that vigorous mental
stimulation might help ward off senility and perhaps even
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``One theory is the `use it or lose it' theory: If you exercise
your brain cells, you're going to keep them,'' said Gary Small, a
geriatric psychiatrist who directs the Center on Aging here at the
University of California at Los Angeles. ``One of the key elements
is remaining engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   A sign of the trend is the surge in groups like Plato, which was
founded at UCLA 19 years ago as the Perpetual Learning and Teaching
Organization (modeled on a program started in 1962 at the New
School for Social Research in New York). In 1989, there were two
dozen such Institutes for Learning in Retirement affiliated with
Elderhostel, a national group best known for its traveling
educational seminars; today, there are 272.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers of participants are hard to come by, since many older
people who audit college classes are never counted, while others
pursue independent research in libraries or participate in ad-hoc
book clubs. But, according to the National Center for Education
Statistics, one in three Americans over 50 _23 million _ were
engaged in some sort of adult education last year, more than double
the 11 million (18 percent) who were involved in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a new wave of retirement communities being built
in conjunction with universities like Iowa State and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plato, somewhere, says that knowledge falls away from us and
we have a need to replace it,'' said Ronald Manheimer, who runs the
North Carolina Center for Creative Retirement at the state
university campus in Asheville. ``I don't know exactly what he had
in mind, but it's great insight for that period.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 375-member Plato Society is one among myriad
institutions providing education for retirees, experts say its
rigor is unique. That reflects its highly educated membership _ 56
percent have master's degrees or doctorates, and another 26 percent
graduated from college, according to a recent survey _ and its
high-minded mission: intellectual stimulation. Each member of a
study group leads one week's session; experts, like UCLA
professors, visit only at weekly lectures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the few rules in Plato's modern suite of rooms above a
take-out chicken restaurant near the UCLA campus is a ban on talk
of health, wealth or grandchildren. Despite members' impressive
roster of accomplishments, they never use honorifics. People
typically avoid their own expertise, instead perusing the course
catalog with whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Heller, an engineer who worked on the Manhattan Project,
runs study groups on Asian art. Ruth Gussen, a pathologist who is
now the society's president, specializes in French opera. Lawyers
take literature; pharmacists do philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   The ``resident medievalist'' is Ed Bressler, 73, an internist
who ``never heard of medieval, or Dark Ages, or anything
historical'' before joining Plato. ``I feel like Howard Carter when
he discovered King Tut _ three times a month,'' Bressler said.
</P>
<P>
   Leila Newman, 79, has a retirement schedule so packed with
tennis and bridge and teaching English to Russian immigrants that
she just signs up for whatever Plato is offering on Thursday
mornings. ``I've never been disappointed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bressler added: ``The process is far more important than the
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that members spend an average of 20 hours
preparing for their own study group presentations, and just under
three hours getting ready for the other sessions. This fall, there
was a group on the queens of England and one on terrorism, a
seminar on the first millennium and another on Islam in America, a
close reading of ``Ulysses'' and an intense look at Einstein. Once
in a while, Plato offers ``come as you are,'' in which members
present the topic of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a bunch of reasonably bright people together on
any topic, they will teach each other,'' Heller said. ``What we
don't know, we teach each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides their intellectual curiosity, Plato members bring a
barrel of experiences to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a session on 1960s protesters for a study group on ``The
American Century,'' a former university professor recalled the
dilemma of whether to give bad grades to draftable young men. Some
of the people discussing Charles Lindbergh were at the ticker tape
parade welcoming him back to New York. As for Kubrick, most of
those around the table saw ``Spartacus'' when it was first
released, in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become so much more sophisticated in our film
watching,'' said Irv Shimer, 70, who loved ``Spartacus'' in the
1960s but hated it upon review three decades later. ``You look at
an old picture and it's an old picture. It doesn't have the stuff
of a new picture, even a bad new picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Wally Graham, though, said he watched both times with the same
sense of wonder. ``I can't honestly remember much about 40 years
ago,'' he allowed. ``I have a hard time with last week.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one young face in the classroom, belonging to Eugene
Pino, a UCLA senior who is one of 246 honors students who have
taken Plato courses since 1986 in an arrangement that allows for
intergenerational relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's contributing, and the contributions are more
mature, it's coming from experience,'' he said. ``At UCLA, a lot of
times you hear, `It's just human nature.' These folks know what
human nature is.''
</P>
<P>

   Plato membership costs $395 a year, and after candidates are
approved by an interview panel, they can still get kicked out if
they are not lively participants. Publicity is mostly word of
mouth, though some said they were referred by doctors, a kind of
prescription to combat loneliness and brain atrophy.

   Between study groups, they have lunch in the lounge. On the
bulletin board, there are pictures of Plato tennis groups and
fliers announcing holiday parties. Some study groups go on retreats
_ a Steinbeck seminar traveled to Pacific Grove _ and people have
found romance in Plato.

   The unusually dry weather pattern will persist as jet stream
winds blow from the northwest in most sections east of the Rockies.
A vigorous disturbance moving through central Ontario will direct a
fresh supply of frigid air into the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of the colder weather will move from the
Appalachians to the coast during the afternoon. A gusty breeze from
the southwest will draw more seasonable conditions into the Middle
Atlantic region and coastal Northeast, though clouds will thicken
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp wind from the northwest will transport gelid air across
the Great Lakes resulting in snow showers from northern Michigan
and Wisconsin to central New York and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The South will be bright and noticeably milder, however the
chilly air will return Monday. Some clouds will cover southern
Florida and it will not be as cold as Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure in north Texas will circulate moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico into the upper Rio Grande Valley producing drizzle
and fog. A disturbance migrating westward across Arizona will force
the moistened air to ascend the southern Rockies. Bands of showers
will dampen New Mexico and northern Arizona with wet snow in the
higher elevations.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous high pressure system, with central pressure still
near 31 inches of mercury, will control the weather west of the
Mississippi Valley. Stagnant conditions with thick fog and
accumulating pollutants will persist over the interior Northwest,
but it will be dry.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WAITING FOR THE SNOW
</P>
<P>
   Not a flake of snow has been seen in Boston since March 15.
Besides being the latest date ever for the first trace of snow,
this 283 day period also marks the longest time that the city has
gone without any snowfall. Oddly, last year had established the
previous record when 274 days passed without any snow. The first
trace of snow occurred on December 22 in 1998. While these records
are impressive for the lack of snow in eastern New England, in the
winter of 1891-92, the first measurable snow, when 0.1 inches was
noted, did not happen until January 6 that season.

   It's the peak of the holiday season, and the air is filled with
apocalyptic warnings tied to the turn of the millennium. But there
is plenty more to worry about than serious threats like terrorism,
doomsday cults and Y2K calamities.
</P>
<P>
   As usual at this time of year, the perennial peril profiteers,
seasonal scolds and year-end yentas are busy issuing warnings and
advice on more mundane dangers. And with the clock winding down on

</P>
<P>
   Is your Champagne Y2K ready? Before you open a bottle of your
favorite bubbly to toast the promise of a new millennium this New
Year's Eve, make sure it's cold.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Ophthalmology, the world's largest
association of eye M.D.s (ophthalmologists), wants to remind you
that warm bottles of Champagne, coupled with bad technique, are
responsible for causing serious, blinding injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Every few months, academy spokesperson Anne Sumers M.D. sees the
devastating results: ... ruptured eyeballs, detached retinas, the
loss of an eye. Contrary to popular belief, Sumers says her
patients were not fooling around, recklessly aiming bottles at
people, but had simply reached for a warm bottle and popped the
cork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually doesn't happen with the first bottle of Champagne,
because it has been on ice, but with a third or fourth bottle that
hasn't been fully chilled. A warm bottle explodes much sooner and
with greater force than a cold bottle,'' said Sumers.

   PANAMA-CANAL _ PANAMA CITY _ After 85 years, the U.S. hands over
the Panama Canal at noon on Dec. 31 in a ceremony sure to kick up a
new round of debate among worried conservatives. Critics have never
been comfortable with the deal brokered 22 years ago by then-U.S.
President Jimmy Carter, fearing the Panamanians will overcharge
ships using the canal and possibly hamstring the U.S. military.
Lately, they've been outraged at a deal cut by the Panamanians to
let a Hong Kong company run the busy ports at either end of the
50-mile-long canal, saying the company is a front for the Chinese
military. Meanwhile Panamanians plan elaborate ceremonies for an
event they believe will showcase their emergence on the world stage
and symbolize their autonomy after decades of U.S. domination.

   CANAL-SECURITY _ PANAMA CITY, Panama _ A terrorist with a
suitcase full of explosives could probably shut down the Panama
Canal for years, American conservatives warn, crippling a vital
U.S. commercial and military link. How real is the threat, how
important is the canal to the U.S. and how vulnerable is the
waterway now that the U.S. military has closed its bases in Panama?
Critics also charge that a company with contracts to run ports at
both ends of the canal is a front for the Chinese military _
charges that Pentagon officials deny. We explore the issue with
comments from conservative activists and canal administrators.

   CANAL-WORKERS _ PANAMA CITY, Panama _ American school kids are
taught that the Panama Canal is one of America's proudest
achievements, an engineering marvel that ushered in the American
Century. But probably few people realize that it was the sweat,
muscle and blood of black Caribbean laborers that actually dug the
50-mile-long ditch. Of 5,000 workers who died during the American
effort, 4,500 were black West Indians, who endured segregated
living quarters, unequal pay scales and the terrible dangers of the
backbreaking job. We interview an 86-year-old black canal worker
whose father and grandfather labored on the project, telling the
story through his eyes. Will seek comments from other black
workers, as well. (MWilliams, Cox News Service). 20. WITH PHOTO

   FLA-CENTURY _ CENTURY, Fla. _ Through the 1800s, this sleepy
little town in the Florida Panhandle was called Teaspoon. But when
the calendar jumped to the 1900s, town elders proclaimed the town's
new name would be Century. So as clocks tick down toward the end of
a millennium, Century's ready for another big party, complete with
beauty pageant, horseshoe competition and the burial of a time
capsule. It's the first official New Year's celebration the town of
1,000 has organized in recent memory. The little town's biggest

   CHRISTIANITY-WORLD _ The spread of Christianity transformed the
Western world. As the third millennium approaches, the movement is
far removed from what it was at its inception. Today, almost one
third of the world's population is Christian. For believers, Jesus
is the hinge of history. But even by secular standards, Jesus is
the dominant figure of Western culture. In this last installment of
a yearlong project, we explore the growth of Christianity around
the world, especially its impact in Asia and Africa and
re-emergence in Russia. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 50.

and some say collaborator, that has now emerged as a powerful
political and economic force in the new Russia. (Holmes, Cox News

   CHRISTIANITY-ASIA _ SEOUL, South Korea _ This region of the

their beliefs. They face persecution everywhere. Vietnamese police
have raided a number of Christian gatherings across the country in
recent months, detaining and harassing scores of worshipers.
Vietnam's Christian population is unclear, although the country of
79 million has 8 million Catholics, the largest community in
Southeast Asia outside the Philippines. But in secular South Korea,
the number is growing and becoming one of the most active churches
in East Asia. (Kirk, Cox News Service) 40. MOVED TUESDAY.

   CHRISTIANITY-LATIN _ MEXICO CITY _ In this fervently Catholic

main purpose of the pope's trip to Mexico earlier this year _ his
fourth trip to this country _ was to address challenges to the
Catholic Church in the Americas, the most Catholic region in the
world. Mexico is considered a geographic powerhouse for the Vatican
because it is a bridge between South America and North America,
where the church is concerned about the spread of materialism and
secularism. And Mexico, whose Catholic population is second only to
Brazil in number, is home to the Basilica of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, the second-most visited Catholic sanctuary in the world
after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

 &HT;    Gugliotta medical riddle
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Gugliotta might play tonight when the Phoenix Suns are home
against Golden State. That in itself is wonderful holiday story.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-10 forward who starred at N.C. State has been cleared by
doctors to return to action after suffering a life-threatening
seizure only nine days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who suffer seizures only experience them once,''
Suns doctor Richard Emerson said. ``I feel very confident that this
is a single, isolated incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is what happened to Gugliotta minutes after scoring 17
points, grabbing 14 rebounds in a 110-102 Suns victory at Portland
Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta, then a few days shy of his 30th birthday, took a seat
in the middle of the team bus for the ride to the airport and the
flight home. He had a drink in one hand while he talked with his
wife on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly, he slammed the drink down, prompting young teammate
Toby Bailey to ask, ``What's up?''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta didn't respond, and another teammate and former Hawks
player Randy Livingston noticed Gugliotta held the soda can to his
ear, as if he were using it as a phone. ``Like he'd lost control of
his motor skills,'' Livingston related.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, something was wrong. Julie Fie, the team's vice
president for communications, was about to board the bus when new
coach Scott Skiles leaped off and screamed, ``We need a doctor!''
</P>
<P>
   They found a Portland team physician in the Blazers locker room.
Meanwhile, Livingston ran to an emergency medical truck parked
nearby. Doctor and paramedics scrambled aboard, checked Gugliotta
and immediately transported him to a nearby hospital. He was
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   During the ordeal, Gugliotta's breathing ``became shallow and
required assistance,'' Emerson said. He awakened at 4 a.m. in the
intensive care unit, completely unaware of the incident, and the
battery of tests performed on him have revealed no damage. The only
side effect was severe headache pain apparently caused by a spinal
tap procedure performed as part of post-seizure testing. That was
relieved with an outpatient visit.
</P>
<P>
   In general, a seizure is ``an electrical phenomenon in the
brain'' that could have any of a number of causes, Emerson said.
``Despite all our high technology, sometimes we never know why.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is completely normal,'' Emerson said. There is no
evidence of a tumor or other invasive mass in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta's wife Nikki said they were lucky, ``If it had
happened when they were in the air, he could have been in a lot of
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns doctor would not speculate on the outcome had Gugliotta
been stricken after the Suns' charter took off.
</P>
<P>
   NBA teams already are now in the process of putting in
defibrillators aboard team planes for use in the event of a heart
attack. However, Gugliotta would have needed an intubation device
to clear his airways and aid in breathing. That requires specific
training and the Suns might have to deal with that, owner Jerry
Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know.''

 &HT;    NBA NOTES: McGrady a wanted man
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the budding free agents the Chicago Bulls are said to
covet is Toronto forward Tracy McGrady. Raptors coach Butch Carter
says forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that Tracy is going to leave the Raptors,''
Carter said. ``I believe we will re-sign him. But if he does go
somewhere else, I'll be willing to bet you it won't be Chicago.
Tracy hates losing.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrady has flirted with the prospect of signing elsewhere when
he becomes a free agent this summer. He rejected a six-year, $64
million extension to re-sign with the Raptors last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McGrady publicly considered his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to come (to Philadelphia), and I definitely would
love to play with Allen Iverson,'' he told the Philadelphia
Inquirer. ``I don't have any control over all the other stuff that
factors into it, like my contract and all of that. But if I ended
up playing in Philadelphia, you wouldn't see me crying about it. Me
and (Iverson) _just think about that. Whew! I'd love it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrady can see past Philadelphia, however. ``I wouldn't mind
playing with Kobe (Bryant). I wouldn't mind playing with Shaq
(O'Neal). That's not like me saying I want to play with another
team. That's just the players.''
</P>
<P>
   But, how about those Bulls?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't call anybody's name who is on the Bulls, did
I?'' McGrady said.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen vs. Barkley
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, Scottie Pippen does have a kind word or two
for former Houston teammate Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Regretting his harsh preseason assessment of Barkley now that
the Round Mound has left the stage for good, Pippen says, ``that
was then, this is now'' and admits a personality conflict with
Barkley, ``a little bit of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't handle things _ and maybe myself more than anybody _
the way we should have. We probably should have spoken
person-to-person and handled it that way. I personally like Charles
and I enjoyed being around him. He's a character. He's like being
with a comedian or something. But he's a good-hearted person. I
hate that things got ticked off like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his first game back in Houston, the Portland star said,
Barkley's injury had an emotional impact on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're human, and things like that can be very emotional, not
being able to walk away from the game. Charles was looking forward
to playing this season. No matter how you look at it, he was
looking forward to going around and being taunted (by the fans) _
all those things he's really going to miss. People hate him so much
that everybody loves (to taunt) him. Everybody loves to hear what
he has to say, get a laugh from him or get him talking about
whatever. It would be tough for any athlete to go that way. He
wanted to go away on his own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs up
</P>
<P>
   With teammate Tom Gugliotta hit by a seizure and the Suns
recovering from the turmoil of a coaching change _ Scott Skiles in;
Danny Ainge out _ Jason Kidd stepped up and delivered three
consecutive triple doubles as the Suns won four in a row before an
overtime loss to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs down
</P>
<P>
   Stubborn, Kevin McHale's refusal to trade Gugliotta to the
Lakers has left Minnesota as a playoff wannabe this season. The
Lakers offered Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell. Put them with Kevin
Garnett, Joe Smith and Terrell Brandon and the Wolves would be on
the prowl.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to NBA?
</P>
<P>
   Dave Cowens worked two games as analyst for Sunshine Network
games at his alma mater Florida State. Cowens won't why he resigned
in Charlotte last winter, laughed when he was asked if he would
like to do TV work on a regular basis. ``That's not gonna happen.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he studied four game tapes before going to work. But he
wants to coach again and he will listen if an NBA team or a college
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``College? Oh, sure, I'd be interested. Absolutely,'' he
responded. ``I'm on hold this particular year. When changes are
made, hopefully something good will happen for me and my family.
But whether pro or college, instead of going and taking a job just
any place, what you want to do is get involved in a good
situation.''

   Trade talk
</P>
<P>
   Florida needs a goalie, though general manager Bryan Murray
won't know how desperate the situation is for two weeks, when
Trevor Kidd determines whether he needs season-ending shoulder
surgery. Kidd said that's a ``90-percent'' certainty, but might
have been trying to douse the high expectations created when Murray
was quoted the day before as saying Kidd's return was imminent.
There has been several rumors as to which direction Murray would go
for a replacement. The most-often heard rumor: Vancouver's Garth
Snow, who is expendable now that the Canucks have Felix Potvin.
Here's the problem with that scenario: The Canucks own the
Panthers' first-round draft pick next year from the Pavel Bure
trade. The worse Florida does, the better for Vancouver. If you're
Canucks GM Brian Burke, do you make a deal that could improve the
Panthers playoff positioning? Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin
remains an unrestricted free agent, but may cost more than the
Panthers are willing to pay _ in players and salary.
</P>
<P>
   Pleased in Pittsburgh
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has cooled off, but the returns on coach Herb Brooks
remain positive. Jaromir Jagr, who openly feuded with the fired
Kevin Constantine, said the change to Brooks' wide-open style of
play, ``is like going from Siberia to Florida.'' Owner Mario
Lemieux, who didn't support Constantine's hiring, said, ``The
offense is back in the organization and that's going to be exciting
for all of us to watch. It's a different game out there. The puck
is moving a lot quicker. There's a lot more movement on the ice,
and with the type of team we have, that's what we need. That's how
I played all my life.'' Lemieux said he felt a high-scoring team
was needed to attract fans to an outdated arena in a poor economy.
The Penguins were averaging 14,496 through 15 home games.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia general manager Bob Clarke needs to move a forward
now that Rod Brind'Amour is back from a broken foot. But Clarke
said he will not make any moves while coach Roger Nielson is
undergoing chemotherapy for bone marrow cancer. Mikael Renberg
seemed upset about being a healthy scratch when Brind'Amour came
back Wednesday against New Jersey but suited up for the Thrashers'
game Thursday night and had a goal and an assist. ... New Jersey
general manager Lou Lamoriello on reports that the Devils may be
purchased by the new YankeesNets entity: ``These things just go
around and around. We're staying away from these things like the
plague.'' ... The Devils' Patrik Elias scored one goal in his first
28 games, five in the next five. ... New Jersey's Brendan Morrison
remains upset Lamoriello has not fulfilled his trade wishes. He has
one goal and five assists in 17 games. He's been scratched for four
of the past seven and has upset teammates with his attitude. ...
Ray Sheppard got back in the lineup in Florida after being benched
seven games for mouthing about his limited time on the ice. ``I had
to do something to get his attention,'' coach Terry Murray said.
``Obviously the offensive part of his game wasn't falling into
place like we hoped. I hope there's a good reaction to it.''

   Early returns
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's signing of Pat Verbeek, known to some as ``The Little
Ball of Hate,'' has paid off. Verbeek is playing on the Red Wings'
top line with Brendan Shanahan and Steve Yzerman, and the three
have combined for 26 goals in 14 games. Shanahan, who is in a
salary drive, has five goals in the past five games and has hit 20
for the 12th consecutive season. Said the rarely complimentary
Scotty Bowman, ``That line has been strong. We kept trying to get
somebody to play right wing, and we tried different guys and
(nobody) seemed to be as good as Pat Verbeek. He's been solid. He
complements the way we play. He's a strong cornerman, and he's good
in his own end and it's resulting in the stats.'' Verbeek, who was
considered by the Thrashers before they signed Ray Ferraro and
Nelson Emerson as unrestricted free agents, has five goals and 10
assists and is a plus 17 in 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   Cautiously optimistic
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' record through 34 games (21-9-4) was the best start
in franchise history, but several players were being cautious with
their comments. Why? The Blues are 13-0-3 against sub .500 teams
and 8-9-1 against winning clubs, including 4-6-1 within the
conference. ``Our record against the top teams has to improve if we
want to go to the next step,'' said center Jamal Mayers. The
biggest reason for the Blues' hot play of late (4-0-2) is goalie
Roman Turek, who posted consecutive shutouts but lost the scoreless
string 58 seconds into a game at Nashville on Thursday night. The
streak reached 1:54:56.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Like the Thrashers, Vancouver has played nine different rookies
this season, eight of whom hadn't played an NHL game. ``I can't
believe the difference,'' veteran defenseman Murray Baron said.
``When I broke in, I didn't say a word because I was petrified.
These guys are enjoying it. There's no such thing as hazing
anymore. The only way to get them is the rookie dinner. It's not
good.'' ... Goalie Grant Fuhr, who has struggled since being
acquired by Calgary, underwent knee surgery to remove some scar
tissue and will be sidelined at least a month. The Flames said the
irritation in the knee is what caused Fuhr's slow start (5-9-2,
3.66, .858). Fuhr said he didn't need the surgery. ... Colorado's
Joe Sakic, who has missed 13 consecutive games and 18 of the past
20 with torn cartilage in his ribs, hopes to return Monday against
St. Louis. He is one point short of 1,000 in his career. ...
Avalanche defenseman Adam Foote rented a bus for $600 to transport
30 family members from Toronto to Buffalo for a game Thursday
night, then rode the bus back with them after the game. ... Detroit
remains far apart on contract talks with center Igor Larinov. ...
File this under atypical athlete injuries: Phoenix winger Greg
Adams had to undergo surgery to repair a deviated septum because an
infection had developed. He is the Coyotes' leading scorer with 33
points but will be out two to three weeks. ... Nashville goalie
Mike Dunham has started 11 of the past 12 games and is answering
the questions about his durability after being limited to 44 games
last season with injuries.

MONTREAL OWNER SWINGS WITH HIS CHECKBOOK; PLUS ITEMS ON JEFF JUDEN,
JIM LEYRITZ, ADRIAN BELTRE, RUSS DAVIS AND RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeffrey Loria was on the telephone to Japan one night last week.
Nothing unusual about an international call for him. But the person
on the other end and the reason for the long-distance call?
Definitely a change of pace for the new owner of the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were doing this thing with Irabu,'' Loria said, ``I
had to stop and remind myself I was dealing with a baseball player
and not an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu and Graeme Lloyd, an Australian, represent the
major acquisitions Loria has made in the early days of his expanded
life. Previously, his major acquisitions had names on them like
Marc Chagall, Fernand Leger, Henry Moore, Larry Rivers, Roy
Lichtenstein and Pablo Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Loria, 58 years old, is a New York art dealer, for whom the
modern masters have been as rewarding as Derek Jeter, Mariano
Rivera and Bernie Williams have been for a different kind of New
York dealer. Those masters have enabled Loria to assume control of
the Expos with a promise to remove the exit signs from the
clubhouse and raise the airtight ceiling on the team's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to strengthen this team in as many areas as I can,''
Loria said. ``As the new owner here, I feel I have an obligation to
move things forward. No more business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   With a shrinking attendance and a payroll that perennially has
been at or near the bottom, the Expos had become a prime candidate
to become the first major league team to move in more than a
quarter century. They gained a reputation for developing good
players but then trading them or letting them leave as free agents
because they said they didn't have the money to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   The roll call of former players resembles an all-star array:
Larry Walker, Moises Alou, Pedro Martinez, Marquis Grissom, John
Wetteland, Jeff Fassero, Ken Hill, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Loria, who earlier in the '90s owned a part of the Oklahoma City
Class AAA minor league team and then tried unsuccessfully to win
the Baltimore Orioles at auction, did not stumble into his
ownership role with the Expos. No one sidled up to him on 42nd
Street in Manhattan and sold him baseball's version of a fake
Rolex. So why the Expos?
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all I think they have a terrific organization,'' he
said. ``Player development there has always been first rate. The
city's a beautiful city. They've had a history of strong fan
support for baseball. One of the problems in recent years was the
team wasn't a winning team. They weren't a strong club, and players
were in flight.''
</P>
<P>
   How does he plan to turn all of those negatives into positives?
</P>
<P>
   ``By establishing stability, commencing a new marketing program
and bringing in a winning attitude and winning players,'' Loria
said, ``we can build this franchise to where it was in the '80s and
the early '90s. In '94 they were on track to win the pennant when
the strike came.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos will not have the lowest payroll in the majors next
season. In fact, their $16 million payroll of 1999 could double.
The acquisition of Irabu, a starting pitcher, and the willingness
to guarantee an option-year salary for as much as $4 million, plus
the signing of Lloyd, a reliever, for $3 million a year for three
years, testifies to Loria's intentions. Some other baseball
officials questioned the amount of Lloyd's contract, but Loria
believes the left-hander can make Ugueth Urbina an even more
effective closer and that step, in turn, can only make the Expos
more successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to acquire or trade players as long as it
improves the club,'' Loria said. ``What I'm about is quality
players and quality people, whether it's in the art world or the
baseball world. It's about quality. It's about trying to mix and
match the best and the ability to complement artists with other
artists in a collection or players with other players on the field
while still being fiscally responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Loria gained a hands-on reputation when he had the Oklahoma City
club, and he readily acknowledged his style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hands-on person and I'm going to be spending a lot of
time back and forth between New York and Montreal,'' he said. ``But
it's hands-on in consultation with your baseball advisors. The
decision to do the transaction with the Yankees was something that
I perhaps started in my mind, but our general manager and David
were right there in the decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beattie, the former Yankees' pitcher, is the Expos' general
manager, and David Samson, Loria's 31-year-old son, is the new
executive vice president, having been lured away from his position
with Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what you think you have to do to make things better,''
Loria said. At least he didn't say, as George Steinbrenner did when
he bought the Yankees, that he wouldn't be involved in the daily
operation of the team because he has too much to oversee in his
other business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a different style,'' Loria said, alluding to
Steinbrenner, whom he has known and liked for perhaps 25 years.
``Ultimately George has proven that energy doesn't hurt. Not only
has he proven that energy is necessary, but it helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides giving Beattie more money to work with and manager
Felipe Alou better players to work with, Loria is intent on selling
Montreal and Quebec on a new ball park. ``We're working on it right
now with the government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always optimistic. I'm a New Yorker. But Montrealers don't
like losing either.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much fun or success he has with the Expos, Loria
said he doesn't plan to give up his day job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been an art dealer all of my professional life,'' he
said. ``I have absolutely no interest in giving it up. I am still
enthusiastic about what I do in the art world. I'm still looking
for major outdoor sculptures and important paintings and sculptures
by the artists I love.''
</P>
<P>
   Victories and, ultimately, championships by the team he now
loves, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW YORK YANKEES, THE TAMPA YANKEES
</P>
<P>
   By winning 12 successive World Series games, the Yankees of the
last four years have demonstrated how good they are. But they have
to be good to overcome the two-headed monster that competes in
their decision-making process, New York and Tampa. Because George
Steinbrenner spends most of his time in Tampa, the front-office
team there often prevails over the New York front-office team.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the input of general manager Brian Cashman, with
support from manager Joe Torre, the Yankees have signed two players
to major league contracts for next season who can only get in the
way of more sensible planning. Based more on Steinbrenner's desire
than anything else, the Yankees gave Jim Leyritz a contract. The
New York faction believes Leyritz is finished as a contributing
player.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Yankees signed Jeff Juden, a pitcher who quickly
makes himself an outcast wherever he goes. When Juden played for
Montreal a couple of years ago, some players said they wouldn't
play if the Expos didn't release him. The Expos, the fourth team
Juden played for, traded him. The Yankees last season became the
eighth major league team he has played for in 10 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUSS DAVIS, FREE AGENT WITH POWER
</P>
<P>
   While teams wait to learn if Adrian Beltre will become a
free-agent third baseman sometime before next season, Russ Davis is
a free-agent third baseman right now.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, whom Commissioner Bud Selig allowed the Los Angeles
Dodgers to retain even though he found they signed him a year
early, can become a free agent only if the Players Association
files a grievance and wins. Davis is already a free agent because
the Seattle Mariners didn't tender him a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who went to the Mariners from the Yankees four years ago
in the Tino Martinez trade, was one of 28 players who were not
tendered contracts by last Monday's deadline. Butch Huskey (Boston)
and Ricky Bottalico (St. Louis) were others.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mariners were going to drop Davis, they might have done
it a year earlier, after he committed an American League-high 32
errors at third. But he reverted to defensive form last season,
making only 12 errors, second fewest among A.L. third basemen who
played 100 games or more (Eric Chavez of Oakland had 9).
</P>
<P>
   Last season Davis also maintained his home run-hitting
consistency with 21. In each of the previous two seasons, he hit
20. He is one of 43 players who has hit 20 or more home runs in
each of the last three seasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CRITIC'S REMARKS OFF BASE, TOO
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker's published remarks about Mets fans, New York
residents and assorted other groups, including immigrants and
foreigners, were dreadful enough without instant critics
compounding the matter. One of those critics was the New York
mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   At one of his daily news conferences, Giuliani linked Rocker's
attitude to the Atlanta Braves' ability to win only one World
Series in the '90s, even though they dominated the National League
in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Braves have some great players who are immigrants and
foreigners,'' Giuliani said, ``so maybe that kind of tension
created on a team is the reason why the team underperformed in the
World Series throughout the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the mayor: Rocker played on only the last two of the
Braves' eight consecutive division championship teams in the
decade.  &QL;

 McGRADY HAS FUTURE, MAYBE NOT IN TORONTO; PLUS ITEMS ON PATRICK By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He can do things in midair that most people would have trouble
doing on the ground. He is young, impossibly talented and a huge
reason everyone in the National Basketball Association believes a
Canadian expansion team can qualify for the playoffs for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   But Tracy McGrady is also the subject of numerous trade rumors,
from Philadelphia to Orlando. He plays alongside Vince Carter,
thereby ensuring that McGrady will not be a franchise player if he
remains a Raptor. And although Carter is easily McGrady's best
friend on the team, the relentless pursuit of marketing dollars by
Carter's management team has left scraps for McGrady, perhaps the
second-most exciting young player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that Toronto will re-sign McGrady, a free
agent to be whose contract situation has created a stir among his
teammates. Toronto made an offer to McGrady last summer, which fell
far short of the maximum allowed under the collective bargaining
agreement. He will be able to make as much as $86 million over
seven years, but it is still more likely that the Raptors will try
to sign him for less, with incentive clauses, if McGrady decides to
stay. In many ways, at the ripe old age of 20, he is the odd man
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like that aren't good for the team,'' said Charles
Oakley, the veteran forward and McGrady's and Carter's teammate.
``You never know what's going through his mind. How can you play
with a guy that management doesn't know what it's going to do and
he doesn't know what he's going to do? It makes it harder for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Raptors' below-the-maximum contract offer, Oakley added:
``Why do they do that? That's like bringing eggs to a barbecue.
Useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Butch Carter, the Raptors' coach, has been in the most
precarious situation. He has elected to bring the 6-foot-8-inch
McGrady off the bench despite the fact that the young forward wants
more minutes during a season in which he needs to increase his
market value. He has had to try to keep an athletic young player
from trying to do too much too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fight that less with Vince than I do with Tracy,'' Butch
Carter said. ``Not the contract issue, but I think he wants to play
a lot. And I really don't have anything in my plan that's going to
allow him to shoot the ball 20 times and him score a lot of points
and us lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's a much bigger fight mentally than I've ever had with
Vince. Vince is easier to rein in, because Tracy doesn't have a
go-to move. So it's a lot harder to get a guy like that going when
you don't have a great point guard to get you consistent shots. So
Tracy suffers for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who is in his second season, averages 36.5 minutes and
23.5 points a game, ranking sixth in the league in scoring.
McGrady, who is in his third season, has played 26 minutes a game
and is second on the Raptors in scoring with an average of 13.1
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for Tracy,'' Butch Carter said. ``I feel bad for
him, but I got to do what I got to do. He's a great person, but
this team right now can't allow him to shoot and do what he wants
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrady may have other things on his mind, too. Butch Carter
said he wished McGrady's representatives would do more to promote
their client, the way Vince Carter's management team promotes him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's created all kind of opportunities for the kid,'' Butch
Carter said of Vince Carter. ``That's something that's hurt Tracy.
No one has been up here to help Tracy land endorsement deals, so
it's hard for him to understand, `Why does Vince have billboards?'
Well, Tank Black came up here and paid for those billboards,''
Carter said, referring to Vince Carter's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put out a little bit to get something coming back. Tracy
is caught up in a cycle of people of telling him, `It's just
supposed to come to you.' It doesn't just come to you.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrady's agent, Arn Tellem, butted heads with Butch Carter and
Raptors management last summer when he accused the coach of not
showcasing McGrady enough. The two sides have been amicable for the
most part, but it should get interesting in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   It might be too much to ask McGrady, at his age and with his
prospects, to be patient. But there could be benefits to staying in
Toronto and building the team with Vince Carter. The two put on an
informal, abbreviated dunk contest before last Wednesday's game
against the Knicks, and it was as thrilling a pregame event as
there had been in a while at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been blocking it out, trying to concentrate on just
basketball,'' McGrady said last week. ``Something like that, you
can't control. I've tried to look at it like, the only thing I can
control is how I play on the court right now.'' &QL;

   FIGHTING EWING'S FINES
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Latrell Sprewell, of all people, Patrick Ewing is
probably going to get back some of the money he lost two weeks ago
for not speaking to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association levied fines of $10,000
against Ewing and $25,000 against the Knicks on Dec. 8, and on Dec.
9 the Knicks fined Ewing another $10,000. Last Thursday, the
National Basketball Players Association filed a grievance on behalf
of Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   The grievance contends that the penalties amount to double
discipline, the same kind meted out to Sprewell when he choked P.J.
Carlesimo in December 1997. In that instance, the league suspended
Sprewell for a year and the Golden State Warriors terminated his
contract. Eventually, his suspension was reduced and his contract
reinstated when an arbitrator found that Sprewell was essentially
punished twice for the same transgression.
</P>
<P>
   The players then bargained for a double-discipline clause in the
new labor agreement that was signed last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic case of it in Patrick's case,'' said Ron
Klempner, a players union lawyer. ``The league acted one day and
the team the next. I've got to think he's got a good shot at
winning this one.`
</P>
<P>
   Credit another assist to Sprewell. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   SHAQ WON'T BE PACKING FOR AUSTRALIA
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of comments Shaquille O'Neal made last week in
Toronto, Alonzo Mourning should pack his bags for Sydney,
Australia. O'Neal reaffirmed his decision not to compete in the
Olympic Games, saying: ``I'm not playing. I've already got two gold
medals from international play. That's enough. It's time to give
someone else a chance and take some time off.''
</P>
<P>
   Before O'Neal's most recent comments, Rod Thorn, the National
Basketball Association's senior vice president for operations and
chairman of the USA Basketball selection committee, had not given
up hope on his playing. Responding to a report in The Sacramento
Bee this month that O'Neal would surrender his spot, Thorn said
last week: ``Shaq says a lot of things, we'll have to ascertain if
this one is true. He never told us that. Until I hear definitively,
he's still being considered.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to those comments, O'Neal said: ``I don't plan to
call the league and inform anyone. I'm not playing. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mourning fills the vacancy at center, there will still be two
slots to fill on the 12-man roster. Thorn hopes to announce the
selections the first week of January. Grant Hill seems like a
shoo-in for one spot, but there will keen competition for the 12th
spot. Eddie Jones, Ray Allen, Kobe Bryant and Shareef Abdur-Rahim
seemed to be the favorites until Raptors officials began lobbying
hard for Vince Carter. If marketing potential is a deciding factor,
then Bryant and Carter may already be the finalists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S DOING THIS VOTING?
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby, the Knicks' dynamic young forward, is maturing
into a great role player, enough so that he could win the league's
sixth man of the year award if he does not become a starter. But
something is askew in the fan balloting when Camby receives the
fourth-most votes (76,349) among Eastern Conference forwards for
the All-Star Game and Karl Malone receives the sixth-most votes
among Western Conference forwards (50,932). Another sign of the
times: Sacramento point guard Jason Williams had 140,432 votes when
the first results were released last week, good for fourth among
West guards. John Stockton, who is quietly having a great year at
the age of 37, was sixth in the balloting, with 42,151 votes. More
people listed Vlade Divac and Lamar Odom on their ballots than they
did Stockton, a future Hall of Famer.

TOO MANY TOUCHDOWNS RATE 6 POINTS AND `R' FOR CELEBRATION; PLUS
ITEMS ON CHAD BRADZKE AND OTHERS   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ga., Md. , Ind. , Minn. , Ky., Tenn.)   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Koy Detmer celebrated each of
his three touchdown passes last week in an unusual way. After every
touchdown Detmer would, while standing, simulate what could only be
seen as a sexual act. On the field. During the game.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer calls the move the ``whuppin' stick'' and says the
action, which includes the swaying of his hips, is his way of
dancing. Detmer's little post-touchdown show isn't original. It's
been done on some of the more raunchy music videos for years. Only
now has the move made its way to the football field. A National
Football League team official who saw Detmer's ``dance'' on a cable
sports highlights show thought, as the broadcasters did, that the
act was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer is not the only player celebrating in ways that some NFL
executives think is excessive. According to a league official, the
NFL is so concerned about an increasing number of on-field
celebrations by players _ some innocuous, others rated R _ that it
is planning to send a memo to teams in the coming days warning that
excessive celebrations will no longer be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Game officials might then begin flagging players for dances and
other forms of celebrations more routinely, the executive said.
There may even be fines. The newer restrictions could begin in time
for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The league's competition committee might explore strengthening
already existing rules regarding celebration, or adding new ones,
no later than this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL recently banned the crude throat-slashing gesture that
was spreading like a virus. Now, the NFL feels that other forms of
celebrating are too graphic or becoming too numerous and need to be
corralled.
</P>
<P>
   In the three weekends since the NFL began fining players if they
made the throat-slashing move, it seems, anecdotally at least, that
the number of celebrations by players after touchdowns or other big
plays has increased significantly. One NFC Central player said he
had been told by teammates that players felt the NFL was constantly
trying to control their actions, and they hated it. The recent
increase in celebrations, the player speculated, was a way to
``stick it to the league'' in light of the ban on throat-slashing
gestures.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL may be criticized if it begins punishing players for
celebrating. That happened earlier this decade, when _ irritated,
as it is now, by excessive celebrations _ the league began to take
stronger measures, mainly flagging players, and members of the news
media called the NFL the ``No Fun League.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time the league should not be criticized, because
celebratory acts are spinning out of control. Some recent examples
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Atlanta several weeks ago, Falcons defensive back Ray
Buchanan intercepted a pass and returned it for a touchdown,
high-stepping all the way. He must have forgotten that the Falcons
have won only three games this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Against New Orleans last week, Baltimore Ravens defensive back
Corey Harris returned an interception 24 yards for a touchdown and,
before going into the end zone, taunted the player chasing him by
holding out the ball; it was almost stolen away. In the same game,
Ravens running back Priest Holmes excitedly threw his helmet to the
ground after scoring a touchdown. He was penalized for
unsportsmanlike conduct.
</P>
<P>
   _ Against Philadelphia, a New England player blocked a punt and
began celebrating. Meanwhile, an Eagles player picked up the nearby
ball and ran for a first down.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players are getting around the throat-slashing ban by putting
a hand to their necks, then not making the cutting motion.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are more and more group celebrations. In one being used
by an increasing number of teams after touchdowns, a half-dozen or
so players take a football, toss it in the air and fall down, as if
the ball had exploded.
</P>
<P>
   If players do not want these dances to cost them cash in the
near future, they had better get their celebrating out of their
systems. &QL;

<P>
   THE GIANTS' EXTRA FAN
</P>
<P>
   There have been moments this season when Chad Bratzke has stood
on the sideline and, between glances at his breathtaking teammates
on the Indianapolis Colts' offense, stared at the scoreboard,
wondering how his old team, the Giants, was faring. Bratzke's body
may be in Indiana, but his heart, in a way, remains at the
Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   This week Bratzke, a defensive end, is sure to scoreboard surf
again. He knows how big Sunday's game is for his old team. New York
plays host to Minnesota in a game the Giants must win to keep their
slim playoff hopes alive. Bratzke has no such worries because his
team is in. His team won the American Football Conference East. His
team might win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the twists of professional football. When Bratzke
signed with the Colts as a free agent after the 1998 season, there
were many in the sport who felt that Bratzke was nothing more than
a blue-collar player with a good attitude.
</P>
<P>
   He was never, ever, supposed to be any good without his former
teammate, the premier defensive end Michael Strahan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of becoming a cautionary tale, however, Bratzke has
developed into a top pass rusher. This season he set the Colts'
single-season record for sacks with 12. There is nothing
blue-collar about Bratzke anymore.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much he loves his new team, a part of Bratzke will
always be indebted to the Giants. It goes beyond the fact that he
remains close to a number of players and other people throughout
the organization. Bratzke says the Giants saved his career after a
devastating knee injury, and it was Giants players who kept his
spirits high during the excruciating rehabilitation process.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants signed Bratzke out of Eastern Kentucky University as
a free agent in 1994. Each day, and each game, he got better,
eventually working his way into the starting lineup. The tough part
for Bratzke came in 1997. That year, under Jim Fassel, the Giants
made the playoffs but Bratzke missed most of the season with the
severe leg injury that almost ended his career. As the Giants
marched on to the playoffs, Bratzke sank into a state of near
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got hurt, I thought my career was over,'' said Bratzke.
``I had torn ligaments, a fractured leg, and some nerve damage in
my leg as well. My thoughts were, `I'm done.' But Ronnie Barnes,
the trainer, and Dr. Russell Warren put me back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough time for me because the team was winning, and
the team didn't want me on the sideline during the games, because
they thought with me on crutches, I might fall, or someone might
accidentally run into me and my knee would be destroyed. It was
that fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratzke added: ``I didn't want anyone feeling sorry for me, or
seeing me so hurt, so I did my rehab workouts when the players were
in meetings or on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates realized Bratzke's state of mind and did everything
they could to cheer him, especially Strahan and linebacker Jessie
Armstead. ``Guys went out of their way to make me feel
comfortable,'' Bratzke said. ``My leg was so bad I couldn't drive.
I had a car service. One day I was leaving the stadium, and Jessie
leaned into the rear car window and said, `Don't ever forget,
you're a part of us.' He reached in and hugged me. Michael Strahan
was great, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, the Giants won the division, and although Bratzke was
happy  team, he did not feel like a contributor because of
his injury. That may be why Bratzke took an extra victory lap
around the RCA Dome after Indianapolis clinched the AFC East on
Dec. 19 by beating Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember where I was, so winning a division title here is
sweet, very sweet,'' said Bratzke. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW PLAYOFF TERRITORY
</P>
<P>
   This year some playoff games will be held in unusual territory.
St. Louis, which this past week secured home-field advantage
throughout the postseason, has never been host to a playoff game,
not even when the Cardinals played there.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis has at least a first-round bye and a home playoff
game, and has also never been host to a playoff contest. Tennessee
will most likely be host for a postseason game, which would be a
first for Nashville.

GIANTS FIGHT THE DEMONS OF A DEBACLE AGAINST THE VIKINGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Giants' primary focus may be on the tangible goal
of a playoff berth and the two victories that would earn it, but
it's hard to ignore the symbolism of the Minnesota Vikings' visit
to Giants Stadium Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It is one day short of the two-year anniversary of the Giants'
nationally televised implosion there in the final 90 seconds of a
playoff game against the Vikings, a devastating 23-22 defeat that
in many ways the franchise has yet to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the 1999 Giants Sunday can expunge some of the
lingering demons of that debacle, a collapse so swift, dramatic and
fraught with mischance that you would have thought the Giants were
wearing Boston Red Sox uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lost a 9-point lead in the final minute and a half,
then walked trancelike off the Giants Stadium field in a chilling,
freezing rain.
</P>
<P>
   Had they won, the Giants would have been headed to Green Bay to
play the defending Super Bowl champions, which, win or lose, would
have been an invaluable maturation experience for what was then the
National Football League's youngest roster. Instead, for weeks,
even months after the Viking loss, the Giants seemed a wayward
team, wondering what hit them after a season of so much promise.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to note that little of that promise was
fulfilled. The Vikings playoff game was not just a loss, it was a
wound to the team's youthful feeling of invulnerability. What hurt
most was that it was the Giants' defense, which had risen
throughout 1997 as the leadership core of the team, that failed on
several levels in the end.
</P>
<P>
   In the final quarter against the Vikings two years ago, the
defense came apart for all to see. First the players quarreled,
then they played soft, then they missed assignments and then they
simply could not stop the Vikings when given several chances.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the defense did not have accomplices in its downfall.
The Giants' offense, led by quarterback Danny Kanell, could not run
out the clock after the Vikings had punted with four minutes left
and the Giants ahead by 22-13. Brad Maynard's ensuing punt traveled
only 26 yards. Minnesota's Jake Reed ran past free safety Tito
Wooten _ whose sole assignment in the prevent defense was to not
let anyone get behind him _ for a touchdown. Then, Giants wide
receiver Chris Calloway, the team's most veteran, sure-handed
player, lost a bouncing onside kick aimed right at him to set up
Minnesota's game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   What is also interesting to note is that with the exception of
Maynard, every one of the aforementioned Giants is no longer with
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell never again played like a playoff-caliber quarterback and
lost his job 10 games later. Wooten's play fell off so
precipitously that the Giants shoved him into the expansion draft,
where even the Cleveland Browns did not want him. By the time
Wooten was eventually cut, Calloway had been set free.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had been 90 seconds from a consequential date in
Green Bay, where they would have arrived as the young and eager
National Football Conference East champions fresh off a playoff
victory. Eleven months later, they were 3-7 and reeling.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know if the Giants have completely lifted
themselves out of the wandering descent that followed the Vikings
loss. But Sunday's game, the first time the Giants and the Vikings
have played in the two intervening years, might go a long way
toward answering that question.
</P>
<P>
   Because the lesson of the Giants' loss on Dec. 27, 1997, was
that those Giants were not ready to play with the league's upper
echelon, something borne out by their play in the months
thereafter. Sunday's game could be the exam that reveals whether
these Giants are finally ready.
</P>
<P>
   There would be something fitting about the Giants greatly
improving their playoff chances with a victory over the Vikings at
Giants Stadium _ almost exactly two years after the Vikings had
stomped on the dawning feel-good foundation of the Jim Fassel era.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment not lost on some Giants. They know what they
lost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could recapture that magic from 1997,'' said
defensive tackle Keith Hamilton, an elder of the team in his eighth
NFL season and one of the most candid of all Giants. ``That was
special.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested to Hamilton that the Vikings had ruined
the 1997 season, Hamilton said: ``They didn't ruin it. We ruined
it. We came apart at the wrong time. We unraveled. I've never seen
anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Strahan, the Giants' three-time Pro Bowler at defensive
end, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame Minnesota,'' he said. ``That's our loss. We let
it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, the Giants' coach, conceded that the 1997 loss to the
Vikings still bothered him, but he did not consider it a motivating
factor for Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game that still sits there with me,'' he said. ``But I
don't think of this as a grudge rematch. You look on the field and
it's not the same guys.''
</P>
<P>
   On defense for the Giants, the missing include not only Wooten,
but also cornerbacks Jason Sehorn and Phillippi Sparks, who are out
with injuries, and the injured defensive tackle Robert Harris.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, there are a new quarterback and running back, three
new wide receivers and two new linemen.
</P>
<P>
   The big Minnesota passing combination is no longer Randall
Cunningham to Reed, but Jeff George to Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the last time Fassel's team was tested in a playoff
atmosphere _ which is what one can expect Sunday at Giants Stadium
_ it was two years ago against Minnesota. What has changed?
</P>
<P>
   As Hamilton said: ``We're not the youngest team in the league
anymore and we're running out of excuses. Now, we've got to decide
if we're an 8-8 team like last year or whether we're getting any
better.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, are the Giants picking up where they left off
the last time Minnesota came to visit just after Christmas, or are
they putting the past behind them to build a new era of prosperity?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. _ The 15-month struggle between Kaiser Aluminum
and the United Steelworkers of America is one of the biggest,
longest and fiercest labor disputes in years, but it is far more
than an old-fashioned labor war. It is a war of attrition, a test
of wills and a propaganda war against the billionaire Texan who
controls Kaiser, a man the union denounces as a latter-day robber
baron.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a battle over two clashing visions of the future of
the American workplace. Kaiser's workers say they deserve job
security in return for their hard work, while management favors
contracting out hundreds of jobs as part of a drive to minimize
costs and increase competitiveness, even if it means dropping
longtime employees.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, 1998, the steelworkers' union went on strike
against Kaiser's five aluminum plants after rejecting the company's
demand to cut health benefits and eliminate 240 jobs by contracting
work to lower-paying nonunion companies. Then in January, with the
strikers disheartened from four months without a paycheck, union
leaders told Kaiser that the strikers wanted to go back to work
while the two sides continued negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaiser took an unusual step, imposing a lockout and refusing
to let any of the union's members return unless the union accepted
Kaiser's demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slap in the face,'' said Dean Wise, a 21-year veteran
of the mills whose family is scraping by thanks to his wife's job
at Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   The company lockout was also a severe blow to Spokane, a
blue-collar city of 180,000, where Kaiser is the second-largest
private employer. Two of Kaiser's five aluminum plants and 2,000 of
its unionized 2,900 workers are based in this city, which is known
for bloody union battles early this century.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two mornings each week, in the shadow of the
evergreen-covered Mica Mountains, Wise braves the biting dawn chill
and pickets outside a gigantic erector set of a mill that heats
aluminum, stretches it out and rolls it smooth. Huddled next to an
oil drum filled with burning firewood, the pickets use bullhorns to
heap abuse on the replacement workers as they drive in and out,
calling them ``scabs'' and worse. Under federal rules, Kaiser's
lockout bars any union members from working.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who showed me pictures when their kids were born, now
they're crossing the picket line,'' said his wife, Wendy Wise, a
leader of a support group called Spouses of Steel. ``It's real
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers complain about how much the company has changed
since its glory days under Henry Kaiser, the industrialist who
built Hoover Dam, Grand Coulee Dam and many of the ships in the
World War II Navy. He was renowned for his generosity toward
employees and for being a pioneer in providing employer-financed
health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser is now controlled by a very different man, Charles E.
Hurwitz, whose Houston-based holding company, Maxxam Inc., controls
63 percent of Kaiser's shares. In the 1980s, he rocketed to
prominence as a corporate raider, acquiring Simplicity Patterns and
Pacific Lumber _ the target of thousands of environmental
protesters because of its aggressive cutting of California
redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is suing Hurwitz, seeking $820 million,
saying that he and his company contributed to the collapse of the
United Savings Association of Texas in 1988. The bailout of the
savings and loan cost taxpayers $1.6 billion and was the
third-largest in the nation's history. Hurwitz's spokesmen say that
the suit is unfounded and that the savings and loan collapsed not
because of mismanagement, but because of Texas' economic problems
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Hurwitz acquired control of Kaiser in 1987, and labor relations
have soured ever since as Kaiser has sought to reduce its work
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry J. Kaiser believed that the people who ran the plant
were valuable assets, and he treated them that way,'' said Tim
Charboneau, a millworker. ``Hurwitz just seems to want to throw
people away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Milchovich, Kaiser's chief executive, defended the company's
cost cutting, insisting that it aimed not just to increase profits,
but to preserve jobs long-term by keeping the company in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are high-cost plants battling for survival in a very
competitive industry,'' he said. ``To sit and argue over what level
of slop, what level of lack of productivity is appropriate in the
year 2000 and beyond in a very competitive business is ridiculous.
Who does that benefit? It certainly doesn't benefit employees, and
it certainly doesn't benefit the shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   For many workers, the lockout has cast a pall over the holiday
season, even with the union giving everyone $140 a week, running a
foodbank and providing emergency payments to make sure no families
lose their homes or primary vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some workers have stopped giving allowances to their teen-agers
because they can no longer afford it. Many families have been
forced to sell their second cars. And many workers grumble about
not being able to afford presents for their children or
grandchildren, although the United Steelworkers, with donations
from other unions, has arranged a $25 gift certificate for each
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm barely making it,'' said Rolfe Lauren, a machine operator.
``I've had to take $8,000 to $9,000 out of my savings to pay my
bills. It's tough right now. But sacrifices have to be made to win
this fight, and that's fine by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Children are also pitching in. Dan Giachetti, a metal
transporter, said, ``My 15-year-old daughter is doing a lot of
baby-sitting. She's doing this to help the family out anyway she
can. I'm humbled to tears. I don't tell her no because it's her way
of helping.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, though, some workers insist that Christmas 1999 is
their best holiday ever, offering reasons that are hard for
outsiders to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers have marveled not only at their own fortitude, but
at that of their friends. They say the struggle has forged lasting
friendships the way war does. And they are amazed that co-workers
they once dismissed as muscle-bound grunts have turned into leaders
and sometimes heroes.
</P>
<P>
   For many workers, this is a Christmas when solidarity and
togetherness are the most precious gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Viebrock, a data-entry worker, offered a bittersweet smile
when she acknowledged not being able to buy gifts for her two
daughters this Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about getting back to basics,'' she said. ``We've
talked about what Christmas really means, and materialism isn't
where it's at. It's about singing Christmas carols and making
Christmas cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The workers, who average about $14 an hour, voice a sense of
betrayal. They say that in 1984 they accepted a $4.50-an-hour cut
in wages and benefits to keep Kaiser competitive, with an implicit
promise that those concessions would be made up in good times,
something they say has never happened. A decade later, in 1994, the
workers agreed to new concessions, worth $50 million, under which
each worker took on more responsibilities, a move that resulted in
cutting the work force at one Spokane mill to 1,100 from 1,400.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked with them to trim jobs and combine jobs and they
said there'd be no more cuts,'' said Wes Beck, president of that
mill's union local. ``They said they wouldn't throw any more of the
work over the fence, and now they come back and say they want to
throw all these other jobs over the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials insist that the company made no such promises.
``The argument that there have been some broken promises or broken
trust is a false accusation,'' said Jeremy Sherman, Kaiser's chief
labor negotiator. He said the company would cut the number of
employees at the plants largely through attrition, and was offering
the workers a $3.13-an-hour wage increase over five years in
exchange for increased productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives say Kaiser needs to reduce costs continually
to compete with larger rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcoa is far stronger than Kaiser is,'' Sherman said. ``Its
plants are newer, larger and operate with far greater efficiency.
Unless Kaiser can find ways to compete more effectively, the world
of the future will not treat companies like Kaiser kindly.''
</P>
<P>
   But union leaders say that Kaiser was already prospering before
the strike, thanks to their concessions.
</P>
<P>
   To squeeze the company, the steelworkers have formed an unusual
alliance with environmentalists, backing their efforts to stop
Hurwitz's cutting of California redwoods. Together, they crowded
into Maxxam's shareholders meeting outside Houston in May, and they
ran two candidates, Howard Metzenbaum, former U.S. senator, and
Abner Mikva, a former White House counsel, for seats on Maxxam's
board. The union candidates lost, but they received 40 percent of
the votes not controlled by Hurwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The union has dispatched more than a dozen workers around the
country to urge Kaiser customers to stop buying aluminum from
Kaiser until it ends the lockout. In a blow to Kaiser, Pepsi
Bottling Co. announced this fall that it would stop buying Kaiser
aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the union is playing what could prove to be its
trump card. The union, with its environmental friends and its
allies in state legislatures and in Congress, is urging Bonneville
Power Administration to stop providing Kaiser with low-cost,
subsidized hydroelectric power on the ground that it is not a good
corporate citizen.
</P>
<P>
   If the union could persuade the power authority, a federal
agency, Kaiser's electricity rates would soar, making the company
immediately uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying that people who receive preferred rates
subsidized by everyone else should be held accountable,'' said
Larry Strom, a smelter worker. ``They shouldn't be locking out
their work force or trashing the environment. What's going on now
is not right.''

 (RESENDING THIS ROUND UP OF BIG BOOKS) 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

SECURITY PLAN   FOR TIMES SQ. CALLS FOR A `FROZEN ZONE'   AND 8,000
OFFICERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Against a backdrop of almost daily government
warnings about potential terrorist acts around the country, the
authorities are readying an elaborate plan to keep Times Square's
millennial celebration safe.
</P>
<P>
   Eight thousand police officers _ a force larger than most
municipal police departments around the country _ will be assigned
to an area around Times Square about half the size of Central Park.
The police plan to tow every car parked on the streets anywhere
within the mile-long, three-block-wide strip of Midtown, both to
clear the way for throngs of revelers and to thwart a possible car
bombing in the area, which will be closed to traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison and Bell Atlantic have welded manhole covers
shut, and the Sanitation Department will remove garbage cans from
every street corner in the so-called frozen zone around Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also are locking mailboxes in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir, appearing confident that the
elaborate preparations and the huge deployment of uniformed and
plainclothes officers will keep the New Year's celebration safe,
have sought to reassure New Yorkers despite the escalating series
of warnings about possible millennial terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrest in Washington State two weeks ago of an
Algerian charged with possessing bomb materials, and the arrest
this week in Vermont of a couple the authorities say have ties to
terrorists, federal agencies have increased airport and border
security and issued alerts about travel and possible mail bomb
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Safir has emphasized that there is no specific intelligence
information suggesting that terrorists are planning to strike in
Times Square or any other locations or events in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees, but we can take every precaution
that's humanly possible, and that's what we're going to do,'' Safir
said. ``I think the public should come to Times Square, and I think
they should not be deterred by all of this terrorist hype that is
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Safir described what he said was a painstaking
plan for Times Square this New Year's Eve, three years in the
making. It covers everything from keeping the Police Department's
six helicopters aloft for surveillance to extra training for
officers in the street to identify suspicious people as they file
through tightly controlled channels allowing access to Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   Officers also have been trained to watch carefully for revelers
bringing alcohol into the area, as part of the Giuliani
administration's strict enforcement of the open-container law.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said about 7,000 uniformed officers will be in the area,
overseen by nearly 700 supervisors, while about 300 plainclothes
officers mix with the revelers. Special surveillance teams with
bomb-sniffing dogs also will check the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the Police Department and other law
enforcement agencies are working to track and monitor potential
terror suspects in the New York area and prepare for the worst case
scenario, a large-scale assault somewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   These measures, seldom discussed and often cloaked in secrecy,
are the outgrowth of concerns that a terrorist attack could occur,
rather than of suspicions or specific information about a
particular threat, city and law enforcement officials said. The
concerns are rooted in the knowledge among senior law enforcement
officials that, as one put it, ``There are people out there who
hate us, who want to destroy us and have proven they have the means
to hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents and police detectives assigned to the Joint Terrorist
Task Force have been reviewing reports of interviews with
confidential informants and intercepted communications looking for
clues that could have been missed, clues that may point to possible
planned terrorist actions, according to several law enforcement
sources. The task force, which includes over 100 agents, detectives
and other federal agents, also are keeping close surveillance on a
number of suspected terrorists in the New York area.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Police Department plan, code-named Archangel, also will be in
effect on New Year's Eve, the sources said. The plan puts the
department on its highest alert possible and includes detailed
methods for responding to and investigating terrorist acts,
including biological or chemical assaults, the sources said. Safir
would not discuss the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The city's five district attorneys also have a plan to operate
in the event of a massive power outage or terrorist attack,
according to city and law enforcement officials. People arrested in
Manhattan and Staten Island, would be arraigned in Brooklyn, where
one of the borough's courthouses can be powered by a generator, and
Bronx suspects would be taken to Queens, where there is a
courthouse with its own limited power source, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have been stockpiling pens, legal pads and copies of
the criminal procedure law _ now usually read on computer terminals
_ to write up complaints by hand, officials said. Prosecutors'
offices have either purchased new carbon-copy complaint forms or
dug out boxes of the old forms that had been used before operations
were computerized, the officials said. Bottled water and other
supplies have also been stockpiled so the offices can operate
without interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the Police Department has made similar plans to
operate without power, stockpiling supplies, including more than
two dozen typewriters, military rations and magnesium lights.
</P>
<P>
   But the visible preparations will begin in the days before Dec.
31, as No Parking signs in the Times Square area go up, warning
motorists that come early Friday morning, cars parked there will be
towed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, shortly after 12:01 a.m. on the 31st, police will halt the
flow of traffic into the frozen zone around Times Square, from West
43rd to West 47th Streets and along Broadway and 7th Avenue,
officials said. They will expand the area, and tow any remaining
cars, up to West 59th Street, down to West 35th and east to Sixth
Avenue and west to Eighth Avenue during the afternoon as the crowd
grows.
</P>
<P>
   In that area, the police will set up emergency lanes down the
middle of each street so that in the event of an emergency,
ambulances and fire trucks can move through the crowds.

 New York Times Regional Newspaper Group   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the vantage point of its supporters, the
Clinton administration's river restoration program is flowing
smoothly, carrying federal aid to the neglected reaches of
participating communities. To opponents, the program is an illegal
expansion of federal powers.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative group this month asked the Supreme Court to hear
a challenge to the American Heritage Rivers initiative, which
President Clinton created in 1997 by executive order. And before
leaving town, lawmakers imposed spending limits on the White House
undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a program of that magnitude should go forward
without the consent of Congress,'' said Rep. Bob Schaffer, R-Colo.,
the author of a ban on diverting any defense dollars to river
projects. ``I think it stands as an illegal executive order.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton unveiled the concept of revitalizing the waterways
and the communities they touch, conservatives have attacked it as
an unconstitutional end run around Congress designed to expand
federal authority.
</P>
<P>
   But in communities that won the designation, bestowed on 14
river systems chosen from 126 nominees in 1998, the special federal
label is seen as a wellspring of aid, a unifying force and a point
of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been, in my opinion, one of the greatest opportunities
that ever happened to this area of the New River watershed,'' said
Patrick Woodie, who heads an organization coordinating
redevelopment along 350 miles of the Appalachian waterway, which
cuts through North Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The New is benefiting from $6 million in grants. Just as
important, Woodie said, the designation forced the three states to
work together to achieve their shared goals.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Jacksonville, Fla., were equally happy with the
designation for 290 miles of the St. Johns River, which brought $1
million in aid. ``We have been real satisfied,'' said Susan Wiles,
chief of staff to Mayor John Delaney of Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   But the program is a lightning rod for foes suspicious of
administration motives and a staple of conservative talk radio,
where it is criticized as everything from a political stunt to a
cover for U.N. confiscation of U.S. property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Heritage Rivers Initiative is a wolf in sheep's
clothing,'' said Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, R-Idaho, earlier this
year. ``Although it sounds harmless to some, the initiative gathers
the powers of 13 federal agencies to create yet another opportunity
for these agencies to affect local land use decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, based in
Denver, Ms. Chenoweth-Hage, Schaffer and two other members of the
House Resources Committee sued in District of Columbia federal
court to block the initiative. The complaint was dismissed on the
grounds that the lawmakers lacked standing to contest the
initiative, a decision upheld on appeal in July.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging those rulings, William Perry Pendley, head of
Mountain States, petitioned the Supreme Court on Dec. 2 to review
whether the creation of the rivers initiative deprived the four
lawmakers of their constitutional right to vote on the enactment of
new federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and river advocates are confident that
the legal assault will fail and wonder what the fuss is about,
given the positive response to the program. ``The river communities
really love it,'' said Loretta Neumann, director of the initiative.
``It is going quite well.''

   Ms. Neumann conceded that the effort could be hindered by the
new congressional spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   But she noted that the final budget bill also declared that
agencies could participate ``if it is a normal part of their
programs.'' Opponents worry that that language could now be cited
by the administration as evidence Congress approved the program.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neumann said it reflects the broad, bipartisan congressional
backing for the program that exists outside conservative circles.

Mississippi in Louisiana and Tennessee; the Upper Mississippi from
Minnesota to Missouri; the Connecticut River from New Hampshire

Massachusetts and Rhode Island; the mid-Atlantic's Potomac; the

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Weakened by illness and close to retirement, Cardinal
John O'Connor was determined to celebrate midnight Mass with New
Yorkers Friday, perhaps for the last time, and so all week he
conserved his limited energy.
</P>
<P>
   His legs were weak, his speech slurred and his face puffy from
the side effects of treatment for a brain tumor. But the cardinal
found a way, nonetheless, to play his accustomed role on one of the
holiest nights of the Christian calendar.
</P>
<P>
   In the vaulted spaces of St. Patrick's Cathedral, decked with
wreaths and sweet with incense, the spiritual leader of New York's
2.4 million Roman Catholics sat in a chair for his homily rather
than climbing to the marble pulpit. From that plain perch, his
voice strong, he offered a tentative goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much time will be granted me here in New York, I don't
know,'' O'Connor said to more than 3,000 worshipers, referring to
his impending retirement more than his brush with mortality. ``I
must use this opportunity to thank every single one of you for the
privilege of trying to serve you to the best of my abilities,
limited though that has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the cardinal, who holds the church's most visible post in
the United States, being modest about his 15-year tenure as
archbishop of the New York archdiocese? Or was he referring to the
four months of his illness, when he has been forced to skip several
Sunday Masses or limit himself to a brief homily? It was impossible
to tell, but of little interest to the worshipers, who were simply
glad to see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was praying he would make Christmas Mass because he wanted
it so badly,'' said Alice Krause, in a pew with her three children
while her husband served as an usher.
</P>
<P>
   According to Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the archdiocese,
O'Connor followed doctor's instructions ``not to overextend
himself'' in the days before Christmas, conserving his energy in
the hope that he could celebrate the 90-minute Mass, including long
periods on his feet preparing the Eucharist.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's condition since his brain surgery has been up and
down, good one day, bad the next. ``He had the mindset he would be
able to do it,'' Zwilling said. ``But there are also physical
realities. All I can say is he is a tough man.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal, regardless of his illness, faces retirement in the
very near future. In accord with church law, he submitted his
resignation to Pope John Paul II, his doctrinal soul mate, on his
75th birthday. The pope, however, has yet to accept it and so
O'Connor remains in his highly visible post. Upon turning 80 next
year, he automatically loses his vote in Vatican affairs, including
the election of the next pope. At that point, he is expected to be
replaced and step down.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, this Christmas Mass was likely his last.
</P>
<P>
   It began with the congregants facing the rear of the cathedral.
There, in a special ceremony, the huge brass doors were thrown open
to herald the start of the jubilee year 2000, as decreed by the
pope. It was during this ceremony that the cardinal took his place
at the high altar, an unaccustomed spot that reduced the need to
walk or climb stairs.
</P>
<P>
   When the doors opened, a rush of cold air filled the cathedral.
Outside, iridescent from the holiday lights, was the statue of
Prometheus at Rockefeller Center. Thousands of people drew in their
breath, then turned to the altar and the welcome sight of their
ailing cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Some guessed that O'Connor had made his entry when they were
turned, so it would go unnoticed that he needed help getting in and
out of his chair. But he immediately silenced the worried whispers
with a series of his customary jokes, spoofing a tabloid headline
about his Christmas plans and welcoming an old friend beaming from
the third row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am informed Ed Koch is in place,'' the cardinal said. ``So
we can proceed with the ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's homily, which can be provocative enough to attract
news coverage on many Sundays, was low-key and homespun. In setting
the stage for a plea for love and harmony, he spoke of his doctors
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, one a Jew and the other
Asian. ``Each one treats me, however, with such gentleness, with
such a sense of worth,'' the archbishop said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus ``suffered to make it possible for each of us to love,''
O'Connor continued. ``Without that suffering there would be no way
of our truly understanding and loving one another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But could anything, in the final analysis, really mean more
than that we love one another with a gentleness, with a true
profound love?''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the cathedral _ including people in mink coats and
others in rags, prominent worshipers like Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
and Imelda Marcos, and at least one couple who got engaged during
the Mass _ spoke of the cardinal's acts of love.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Bedin said she shared an elevator with O'Connor on a visit
to the Vatican, where she had gone for a blessing of a picture of
her deceased father. The cardinal, learning of her loss, offered to
say a private Mass on the spot and has counseled her since.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip Luloff, a psychiatrist at Mount Sinai Medical Center
and a friend of Ms. Bedin, said he had sought advice from the
cardinal about treating dying patients. Some were helped by the
religious leader's example in dealing with his own illness. Others
found comfort, Luloff said, in shaking his hand once they knew he
had shaken hands with O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Luloff, quick to identify himself as Jewish, said he was
exhilarated, not saddened, by the service. ``This man cannot say
goodbye,'' he said. ``He is part and parcel of New York.''

   (NYT14) UNDATED -- Dec. 25, 1999 -- NEWYEAR-SITTERS -- So many
children, so few sitters and so much money. So what exactly does
the supply-demand calculus work out to if parents are in the

Hard to say, since as yet there's no Internet baby-sitter
warehouse, no Click 'n' Sit.com, for easy tracking of prices. But

HIJACKERS DEMAND THAT INDIA RELEASE CLERIC AND KASHMIRIS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hijackers of an Indian Airlines flight that was taken on a
15-hour odyssey across three countries before landing in
Afghanistan demanded Saturday that India release a Pakistani
religious leader and several Kashmiri fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, who are believed to be Islamic militants
supportive of Kashmir's independence from India, are holding 161
captives.
</P>
<P>
   As the standoff headed into its second day, they received food
and fuel Saturday at Kandahar in southern Afghanistan and also
threatened to blow up the plane, an A300 Airbus seized while en
route to New Delhi from Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Taliban, Afghanistan's ruling militia, which
has its headquarters in Kandahar, told the BBC and The Associated
Press that the hijackers were demanding the release of Maulana
Masood Azhar, a Muslim cleric supportive of Kashmiri independence
from Indian rule, and several Kashmiri fighters. All of them are
reportedly being held in Indian jails.
</P>
<P>
   Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, the Taliban's foreign minister, said
that one of the hijackers had identified himself as Azhar's
brother, Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   He said the hijackers, who were armed with grenades, pistols,
and knives when they seized the A300 Airbus, had threatened to blow
up the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, who were armed with grenades, pistols and knives
when they seized the plane, have killed at least one man, and there
were unconfirmed reports of up to four other bodies on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The body of the dead man, whose identity was not certain, was
flown to New Delhi late last night, along with 27 passengers freed
when the plane was in Dubai during its odyssey on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One released passenger reportedly told relatives that the dead
man had ignored orders not to look at the hijackers and was stabbed
by one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban troops were guarding the plane Saturday, but Muttawakil
said the Taliban would not negotiate with the hijackers and
insisted that the United Nations do so instead. The Taliban has
said it will not grant the hijackers asylum, and it has denied any
connection with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want them to stay here and we have told the United
Nations this. They should intervene,'' Muttawakil said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a U.N. spokeswoman said the world body had not
received an official request from the Taliban but ``stands ready to
help in any way they can.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has designated its coordinator for
Afghanistan, Erick de Mul, to deal with the hijacking and he ``is
aware of the situation,'' the spokeswoman told The Associated
Press, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Indian prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said
his government would not bow to any hijacker demand. India has
asked the Taliban not to let the plane take off again.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling speculation about a possible rescue mission, India's
minister of external affairs, Jaswant Singh, said that he expected
``developments to take shape'' sometime Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim militant secessionists have been waging a bitter and
protracted insurgency in Indian-held Kashmir, demanding either
outright independence for the Himalayan state or union with Islamic
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Azhar, who traveled to India in 1992 to help anti-Indian
militants in Kashmir, belongs to a rich land-owning family in
Pakistan, according to Indian security officials.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in 1994 by Indian security in Anantnag, a small
town in the disputed northern state of Jammu and Kashmir. He is
being held in a high-security jail in Kot Bhalwal, near Jammu, the
state's winter capital.
</P>
<P>
   His group, the Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, which was formerly called
Harakat ul-Ansar, has tried several times to use kidnappings as a
way of freeing him, but failed. In 1995, the group kidnapped six
Western tourists, including one American. One was killed, one
escaped and four are still missing and now feared dead. Their
abductors demanded the release of 21 of their jailed comrades in
return for the six hostages. India refused.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the group claimed responsibility for a grenade
attack in Kashmir that killed three people.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers seized control of the plane shortly after it took
off from Katmandu, Nepal, at 4:25 p.m. local time Friday. The plane
then made stops in India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates
before landing in Kandahar Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Nepal's government Friday suspended all officials on duty at
Katmandu airport at the time of departure, and later reports said
that four airport workers had been arrested in connection with the
hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   India has long described Katmandu as the weak link in air
security in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the customs, immigration, civil aviation and police
officials that were on duty on that shift have been suspended and
face investigation,'' Tourism and Civil Aviation Minister Bijaya
Gachchedar told reporters. He did not give the number of people
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Muttawakil of the Taliban said that he had met two of the
hijackers, and he speculated that they were Kashmiri; passengers
freed in Dubai said that the group of five may also have included
an Afghan and a Nepalese.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports had suggested that the hijackers were Sikhs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sikh Council on Religion and Education, an organization
based in Washington, issued a statement Saturday condemning the
hijacking but also expressing concern about the assumption that the
hijackers are Sikh.
</P>
<P>
   Noting reports that some of the hijackers wore turbans, the
statement said that ``many other ethnic, nationalities and
religious groups wear turbans in Asia.''

IVORY COAST COUP DRAWS FRENCH RESPONSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the wake of a coup in Ivory Coast, France said
Saturday that it was sending small numbers of troops to the country
_ its former colony _ to protect the deposed president and to
evacuate roughly 20,000 French nationals should that become
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But Agence France-Presse reported Saturday night that Ivory
Coast's new ruler was refusing entry to the soldiers, saying their
presence could ``lead to a blood bath.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Abidjan, the country's largest city, warned
American citizens there to lock themselves in their homes. It said
looters were rampaging through the wealthy neighborhoods where
foreigners live, but seemed to be attacking only vehicles parked
outside.
</P>
<P>
   France has about 550 troops in a garrison where ousted President
Henri Konan Bedie was reported to have taken sanctuary from the
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Reports said 40 more soldiers were ready to arrive by helicopter
from Libreville, Gabon. A further 300 French soldiers were reported
ready to fly in from Dakar, the capital of Senegal, if needed. At
the moment there is no apparent threat to French residents of Ivory
Coast, but there has been looting and gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Paris has condemned the coup and granted protection to Bedie.
Agence France-Presse quoted a French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman,
Anne Gazeau-Secret, as saying that Bedie, at his request, was at
the Port-Bouet military base next to the Abidjan airport, under the
protection of the French 43rd Marine Infantry Battalion.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Robert Guei, the coup leader, had said earlier that Bedie
should leave the country quickly because his life could be in
danger, but had stipulated that his Cabinet could not leave.
</P>
<P>
   The French government, which years ago gave up trying to control
the affairs of its former colonies, has not demanded a restoration
of Bedie to power. Instead, it has called for the immediate
re-establishment of order and security. News reports here were
sketchy because it was Christmas Day and the coup caught almost
everyone by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast has long been an island of relative stability and
prosperity in the former French colonies. It is the world's biggest
supplier of cocoa, and it produces palm oil and other tropical
products. Many French sun-worshippers interested in vacationing in
Africa head first for Abidjan and use it as a jumping-off spot for
poorer countries. There are regular Air France and Air Afrique
flights. The new military leaders said Abidjan airport, closed by
the coup, would reopen on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Abidjan, the commercial capital, looks in some ways like a
French city; it has the same black-and-white arrow-shaped signs,
traffic circles and red-and-white stone road markers. There are
luxury hotels, nightclubs and restaurants, and the same stores and
brands that are in France can be seen there.
</P>
<P>
   Its government has been stable compared with those of other
former colonies like Congo, Madagascar or the Comoro Islands. As a
supplier of tropical products that cannot be grown farther north,
Ivory Coast has become an important part of the French economy.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, France had a much more interventionist policy in
Africa than Britain, Portugal or other former colonial powers did.
It diplomatically embraced rulers that it approved of, but it also
was ready to send troops _ often the Foreign Legion _ to prop up or
restore presidents it favored.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, that contributed to more stable rule in former
French colonies than existed in Portuguese or Belgian ones. But in
other ways, it contributed to resentment of rulers, who were
perceived as puppets of France.
</P>
<P>
   In Abidjan on Saturday, the leader of the new ruling junta,
Guei, imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew after two nights of looting and
sporadic gunfire in some districts. He warned that violators would
be shot.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Abidjan were reported empty Saturday. Its stores
had been closed for 48 hours, but a curfew on Friday night did not
stop looting. The French radio reported a small skirmish between
Ivorian soldiers and French gendarmes, but the details were
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie was overthrown on Friday when Guei, a former armed-forces
chief, took the reins of power after troops mutinied. He set up a
10-man junta and urged politicians of the governing Democratic
Party and the opposition to engage in what he called consultations
to form a government of national unity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Guei had been asking that France evacuate Bedie, whose calls for
resistance against the coup appeared to have been fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Agence France-Presse quoted military experts as saying that the
reinforcement of French troops in the region was aimed at securing
Abidjan's airport in case it was necessary to evacuate foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The French regional deployment comes with the risk of
destabilization of one of the pillars of Paris' influence in West
Africa. Officials said Saturday that warnings of caution had been
repeated regularly to French nationals in Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between France and the country, which was long seen as
a model African democracy and a relative economic powerhouse, have
deteriorated in the last few months because of differences between
Bedie and Alassane Ouattara, a former prime minister and deputy
director of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara, seen as a serious challenger to the long rule of the
Democratic Party, had sought to take on Bedie in elections next
year, but the president's government barred him from running, on
grounds that his parents were not Ivorians. This tactic of
excluding rivals from elections has become common in Africa in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Some French press comment on Saturday was equally severe with
regard both to Bedie and to France's approach to its former colony.
For the center-left newspaper Liberation, the tardy French reaction
to the deteriorating political situation was ``a triple failure in
political, military and diplomatic terms.''

EDITORIAL: NO RETREAT ON CLEAN AIR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, December 26:
</P>
<P>
   Early last summer, clean-air advocates were on the run.
Back-to-back rulings in May by conservative, anti-regulatory judges
in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had shredded much of
the administration's air pollution strategy, invalidating tough new
federal health standards and blocking efforts to reduce smog in the
eastern half of the United States. But in some mysterious way the
ruling seemed to stiffen the resolve of federal and state
officials, and ever since then the big polluters have been the ones
on the run. In the last week alone, the Clinton administration
issued several major rulings that will require big investments by
the oil, automobile and utility companies to reduce smog-causing
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The most important of these rulings will require automakers to
build cleaner vehicles and oil companies to refine cleaner
gasoline. Taken together, these measures should reduce pollutants
in standard cars by about 75 percent from today's levels. But the
most important aspect of the ruling is that it will subject
so-called light trucks _ sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and
minivans _ to essentially the same requirements as ordinary cars.
Until now, light trucks have been allowed to produce up to three
times the pollution of standard cars because regulators have
classified them as work vehicles, even though they now account for
about half of all new-car purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Both the automakers and the oil companies grumbled about the
costs of the new rules, which will add perhaps $200 to the price of
a sport utility vehicle and a few pennies to a gallon of gasoline.
But there was less grumbling than usual, for two reasons. One is
that all the major presidential candidates have endorsed tougher
rules. The other was a decision over a year ago by Carol Browner,
the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to spread
the cost of the cleanup by asking the oil companies to reduce the
sulfur content in gasoline. This will make it easier for the car
makers to meet the new targets because sulfur clogs up a vehicle's
catalytic converter, the device that cleans car exhaust of
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Another ruling, announced by Ms. Browner earlier this month,
would give 400 utilities and manufacturing plants in 12 states
until 2003 to cut by half the pollutants that are blown eastward by
prevailing winds, adding to smog in the Northeast. The ruling _
made in response to four northeastern states that are seeking
relief from windblown pollution _ is only the latest of several
efforts to crack down on the aging, coal-fired power plants in the
Midwestern and border states that lie at the root of some of the
country's biggest pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   In separate actions, for example, the EPA and New York's
attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, have sued more than 30 such plants
for allegedly failing to install anti-pollution equipment in
violation of the Clean Air Act. Meanwhile, Gov. George Pataki has
ordered New York's own power plants to cut the emissions that cause
smog and acid rain. The governor has also promised to impose new
emissions standards on cars sold in New York that he says will be
even stronger than those announced by President Clinton last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has happened since the disheartening court decisions
in May and despite dire predictions that in an election year
neither the administration nor politicians with possible national
aspirations, like Pataki, would risk offending pivotal Midwestern
states and big industries. These fears, fortunately, appear to have
been premature.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, December 26:
</P>
<P>
   The last millennium encompassed the great age of geographic
discovery, when hardy explorers penetrated the world's landmasses
and mapped the great oceans that, much to everyone's surprise,
turned out to cover 70 percent of the globe. So accessible has the
Earthace become that today adventurers scale Everest and
hike across Antarctica, tourists traverse Africa, and lone sailors
circumnavigate the globe. Even the ocean depths, the last great
frontier on Earth, have begun to yield their secrets to undersea
explorers, revealing a world seething with bizarre life forms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the millennium draws to a close, the frontier that
beckons lies far overhead. Thirty years ago, Neil Armstrong took
humanity's first small step on the moon, declaring it ``one giant
leap for mankind,'' only to have the space program retreat to
tinkering in low Earth orbit. The question for the next century is
whether this nation and others should invest heavily in space
exploration, sending astronauts to Mars and unmanned probes to
distant star systems, or use those resources instead to make the
planet we inhabit a place no one would dream of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   A thousand years ago, most people knew little of what lay beyond
their immediate localities. Then, in the 13th and 14th centuries,
Marco Polo and others followed overland routes to the Far East,
returning with wondrous tales and goods. When those routes were
closed, Western Europeans turned to the seas in search of new
pathways.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese, the first to make exploration a state
enterprise, pushed down the coast of Africa and around to India.
Columbus, seeking a westward route to Asia, discovered a continent
whose existence he had not imagined. Magellan found the sea route
around South America and died while circumnavigating the globe. The
great age of oceanic exploration lasted three centuries and brought
a change in perspective. The sea, once a barrier, was now a highway
that led everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on land, Spanish explorers pushed into most of
Central and South America, English and French explorers traveled
North America, and Lewis and Clark charted the American West. In
the 19th century, explorers reached the interiors of Africa and
Australia, and the coast of Antarctica. One decade into the 20th
century, the last recesses, at the North and South Poles, were
finally reached.
</P>
<P>
   The Age of Exploration had been largely a European enterprise,
driven by a mix of motives. The primary focus was a search for
trade routes and riches, buttressed by a missionary zeal to convert
the heathen, a drive for colonies, a thirst for knowledge about the
natural world and a lust for the glory of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of these motives are relevant to plumbing the ocean.
Salvagers seek to retrieve gold from wrecked treasure ships on the
ocean floor, and scientists seek new knowledge using undersea
technologies originally developed for military purposes. But
entrepreneurs who had hoped to mine the seabed for minerals can
only wait for the economics to look better. The difficulty of
operating in inky blackness under the crushing weight of the sea
has ensured that progress will be slow. With only one-tenth of 1
percent of the deep seabed explored, we know less about it than
about the surface of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   As space enthusiasts gaze longingly at the solar system and the
heavens beyond, they are entering a realm where few of the usual
motives for exploration apply. The race to the moon was propelled
by the struggle against Soviet Communism. Once that race had been
won, the nation turned to less far-reaching efforts, like the
international space station now under construction in low orbit.
That is not the sort of venture to set pulses racing.
</P>
<P>
   The best rationale for space exploration is to gain scientific
knowledge and to search for life forms elsewhere, a task performed
most cheaply and safely by unmanned probes. But the idea of sending
astronauts to other planets remains a powerful, animating force.
Some space officials predict that humans will be walking on Mars
within two decades, or at least by mid-century.
</P>
<P>
   Visionaries are good at dreaming up reasons for such an arduous,
three-year excursion _ the need to fulfill our destiny, to find
extra resources and living space, to guarantee survival of the
human species should an asteroid hit Earth. But the most compelling
reason for humans to set foot on Mars is for the sheer thrill and
glory of it. That passion should be indulged only when new tactics
and technologies bring the costs and risks down to bearable levels,
or private financing can be found. Meanwhile, there are even more
formidable challenges _ in eliminating poverty, eradicating disease
and educating the ignorant _ to be faced here on Earth.

COFIDIS TEAM CAPTAIN WALKS OUT ON HIS CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Cofidis bicycle team staged quite a bash here last
week, celebrating the holiday season by inviting dozens of friends,
riders, officials, employees and journalists to watch a show, lift
a glass or three and then tuck into dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cofidis is one of the better-managed teams, with bracing
involvement by its sponsor, a telephone credit system in France,
everything should have been first rate, with nothing out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Except this: Somebody chose to have the festivities at the
Cirque d'Hiver, the Winter Circus. Imagine the gallows humor as
people noted how so much about Cofidis has been a circus lately.
With everything else that has been going on, who needed Bogino the
acrobat, Helene and her parrots and the fire juggler?
</P>
<P>
   Life under the big top began Dec. 1, when the team's leader,
Frank Vandenbroucke, announced through spokesmen in Belgium, that
he was walking out on his contract, which had another year to run.
Riders rarely walk out on their contracts, especially not at the
end of the year when rosters have been decided and replacements are
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can ask, is Frank Vandenbroucke really adult and
responsible?'' said the director-general of the sponsor, Francois
Migraine. ``For sure he's a great champion, but he seems to lack a
certain balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the moral high ground, Migraine added that Cofidis would
not raid another team for a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Vandenbroucke, a 25-year-old Belgian often known as VDB, said
that he could not stay because of his two-month suspension by the
team after he was held by the Paris police in a drug case last
spring. He charged that the team had committed ``grave and
excessive faults'' against him and damaged his reputation by
suspending him, even though it was at full pay. Vandenbroucke was
not charged in the case, but admitted indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to jumping ship, the rider plans to sue Cofidis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the papers to be filed shortly in Paris,'' Alain
Bondue, the team's manager, said by telephone. Bondue said that
Vandenbroucke is seeking $1.84 million in damages, or roughly twice
his salary this year.
</P>
<P>
   Migraine said: ``We don't seem to have luck with our leaders.
``First it was Fondriest, then Armstrong, then Casagrande, now
this.'' Since the team began in 1997, Maurizio Fondriest and Lance
Armstrong were lost to injuries and illness and Francesco
Casagrande was let go last year after he failed a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Vandenbroucke seemed to be the answer, as he won the esteemed
Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic this year and finished 12th in the
Tour of Spain, winning two daily stages, and seventh in the world
championship road race. But at that road race in Italy in October,
he began listening to offers from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Since his announcement, Vandenbroucke has remained silent.
Periodically, a spokesman says the rider has been in contact with
various teams _ ONCE in Spain and the new Fasso Bortolo team in
Italy are usually cited _ seeking a job for next season, although
the Italian team's head, Giancarlo Ferretti, said that he was no
longer interested.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Vandenbroucke's salary demands and the probability
that Cofidis will have to be paid damages outweighed the 1,818
International Cycling Union points that the rider will bring with
him. Those points would give a new team entry to major races, where
entries are determined by team ranking. Those points will also be
subtracted from the Cofidis total, virtually dropping the team into
the second division.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, Bondue insisted. ``We'll do fine,'' he said. ``The
team was shocked, especially since he quit the day before we had a
training camp, but morale is high. Sometimes, when you lose a
leader, that frees everybody to ride his own race and maybe even
win it.'' &QL;

   Arrest at the U.S. Border Points to a Terrorist Ring
</P>

   When a customs agent began asking questions at a remote ferry
boat border crossing near Seattle, the nervous driver, Ahmed

<P>
   Only days after ending a hostage siege at a Louisiana prison,
six hostage-takers _ all of them Cuban inmates awaiting deportation
_ got their wish: a return flight home.
</P>
<P>
   Local prosecutors criticized the deal, saying it would encourage
similar uprisings by other Cubans imprisoned while Cuba decides
whether to accept them. But the Clinton administration insisted
that the unusual agreement with Fidel Castro ended a siege that had
threatened to turn bloody. A seventh Cuban hostage-taker was
detained after a woman inmate taken hostage said she had been
raped.

SCANDAL AND GREED MAKE ROOM FOR THE RICHNESS OF VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a certain fin de siecle urgency to the past year, the
sensation of rushing willy-nilly toward some brave new sports world
even more expensive, aggressive, chemical and hyperbolic than the
past.
</P>
<P>
   As the numbers hovered eerily between 99 and 00, the entire
world seemed mad with dot.com gold-rush avarice. Free agents jumped
teams with abandon, juveniles leaped from high school to
professional basketball, franchises went for epic prices.
</P>
<P>
   Scandal was everywhere. The Olympic movement, trying to revive
the alleged ideals of ancient Greece, was as jaded as the rest of
humanity. Some International Olympic Committee delegates and bid
cities were caught in a tango of corruption. Eventually, 10
delegates left the IOC and a handful of officials in Salt Lake City
took the blame for the sordid communal effort.
</P>
<P>
   As more evidence piled in from the past (Atlanta and Nagano) and
the future (Sydney), there were calls for Juan Antonio Samaranch to
resign as president. But Samaranch craftily produced so-called
reform measures, while remaining judge and jury of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   At year's end, fearing the loss of American corporate support,
Samaranch essentially told a congressional subcommittee: ``Trust
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of sport remained a competition among chemists, with hot
drugs and masking agents lurking in many athletes' systems.
</P>
<P>
   For all the chicanery, sport was occasionally compelling.
Perhaps the sweetest event in 1999 came from the overlapping worlds
of soccer and women's sports, both normally shunned by the big guys
of American journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup, with charismatic stars like Michelle
Akers and Briana Scurry, packed major stadiums in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The finals were held in the Rose Bowl, normally the province of
prancing female cheerleaders and strutting American football
players. On July 10, more than 40 million Americans watched on the
tube and 90,185 fans jammed the bowl as the United States defeated
China on penalty kicks after 120 scoreless but nonetheless gripping
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 positive and talented players became the nation's
darlings, raising hopes for a league and raising endorsement money
for women with muscles and elbows. Probably inevitably, before
year's end the women were threatening to abandon a January tour to
Australia because of contract problems.
</P>
<P>
   Another compelling event of the fin de siecle was the Ryder Cup
of golf, a biennial competition between the United States and
Europe. In Brookline, Mass., in late September, the United States
was trailing, 10-6, going into the final day of head-to-head
matches, but a 45-foot birdie putt by Justin Leonard on the 17th
hole helped the Americans win, 14{-13{.

<P>
   There was criticism that golfers and fans had celebrated
prematurely and blatantly, but the enthusiasm and skill of normally
sedate golfers could hook a larger public.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, in winning their third World Series in four years,
touched even some traditional Yankee-haters. Objectively, they did
not match their 1998 total of 125 victories. Subjectively, they did
even better, with feisty old Don Zimmer filling in (and sassing the
Boss on occasion) while Joe Torre was treated for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In this glorious summer, David Cone pitched a perfect game,
Darryl Strawberry rebounded from cancer and a flareup of his
addictions, and Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams and Orlando ``El
Duque'' Hernandez charmed the nation. The Yanks beat the Braves
four straight, and have now won 12 straight World Series games.
</P>
<P>
   Some big-market teams like the Yankees, the Braves and the Mets
flourished, while a few small-market teams like Cincinnati and
Oakland produced unpredictably good seasons. Big bucks did not work
for the insipid Dodgers of Rupert Murdoch and the dreary Orioles of
Peter Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets staged a rousing autumn, surviving a seven-game losing
streak and stunning Arizona in the postseason. Down three games to
none against Atlanta, they played three straight thrillers before
succumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez of Boston was the best pitcher in baseball with a
23-4 record and a 2.07 earned run average and 313 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   After their 70-66 home-run derby in 1998, Mark McGwire again
beat Sammy Sosa, 65-63, but there was the air of a sideshow because
neither's team was in contention. Midway through the season,
McGwire claimed he had stopped taking the legal but questionable
body-building substance androstenedione. He said he had not
disclosed his decision earlier because nobody asked.
</P>
<P>
   During the World Series, swaggering and suspended Pete Rose was
voted onto an all-century team, taking attention from the Aarons
and the Williamses.
</P>
<P>
   Two foreign baseball teams had a good year against the United
States. In the Little League World Series, Osaka, Japan, beat
Phenix City, Ala., 5-0, a year after Toms River, N.J., won it. And
with Fidel Castro cheering in Havana, the Cubans lost a taut 3-2
decision to the Orioles in March, but Fidel stayed home while his
state-supported amateurs totally embarrassed the Orioles in
Baltimore with a 12-6 victory in May. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the downscale NFL of second-tier cities and eternal parity,
Denver won its second Super Bowl and John Elway soon retired as
quarterback, and the Broncos have not been heard from since.
</P>
<P>
   Other powerhouses like San Francisco, Green Bay and Dallas also
slumped while upstarts like Jacksonville and Tennessee prospered
and young quarterbacks Kurt Warner and Peyton Manning turned
moribund St. Louis and Indianapolis into contenders for the next
Super Bowl in Atlanta. The league also faced a plague of legal and
emotional problems among its players.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants still had a mathematical chance for the coming
playoffs, after going through four quarterbacks in the three-year
regime of Jim Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets reached the conference title game in the 1998 playoffs,
losing to Denver. This season fell apart in the very first game
when Vinny Testaverde tore his Achilles' tendon while making a
simple cut on the killer carpet. Artificial turf will finally
disappear from Giants Stadium next season, at least one hopeful
sign in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Pro football's elaborate feeder system kept edging toward a
national playoff. Tennessee won the 1998 college championship with
a victory over Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl. Florida State
rebounded to reach the 1999 championship game with upstart Virginia
Tech.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Peter Warrick, a wide receiver with Florida State, was caught
accepting an illegal discount at a store, and lost his chance for
the Heisman Trophy, which was won by Ron Dayne of Wisconsin, the
leading ground gainer. Professional scouts will surely overlook
Warrick's transgression.
</P>
<P>
   A lockout killed two months of the 1998-99 season before the N
BA and its players union settled and presented their aerobics for
millionaires. Attendance and enthusiasm were generally down, but
two gents named Tim Duncan and David Robinson collaborated for San
Antonio's first championship, over the dysfunctional but surprising
Knicks. The Nets, still in New Jersey, still in the doldrums,
formed an alliance with a bloke named Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the NBA's ennui may have stemmed from the absence of
Michael Jordan, who lent his prestige to the players during the
lockout, then promptly retired. Charles Barkley's proposed
retirement was pushed up a few months when he tore his knee earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Comets, behind Cynthia Cooper, won the 1999 summer
Women's NBA championship, after the rival American Basketball
League folded on Dec. 22, 1998. Now the WNBA will expand by four
teams next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional feeder system for pro basketball was going
through a transition, and television ratings were down.
Connecticut, in its first Final Four, upset Duke for the men's
national championship, after which Connecticut's top player and
three of Duke's best players promptly turned professional with
eligibility left. Purdue's women beat Duke for their first
championship and nobody left school early.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Belt won its first Stanley Cup as the Dallas Stars
defeated the Buffalo Sabres on a disputed goal by Brett Hull. Wayne
Gretzky retired as hockey's greatest scorer as well as the best
spokesman any sport ever had. The Pittsburgh Penguins nearly went
under financially until Mario Lemieux, their retired superstar,
bought the franchise. In New York, the Rangers staggered with a
huge payroll, the Devils plodded along with a moderate payroll and
the Islanders, saddled with owners who would rather build malls
than sign players, skated off the edge of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer retained a modest fan base and stable
salaries and even produced a dynasty in D.C. United, which won its
third title in four years. A ghastly team in the New York area
severely handicapped the league. Manchester United stunned
Germany's Bayern Munich, 2-1, on two late goals to win the
Champions League and also won two domestic titles. In college
soccer, the Indiana men defeated Santa Clara, 1-0, and the North
Carolina women won their 15th title in 18 years, beating Notre
Dame, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The big news in golf was Tiger Woods' turning 24, having laser
eye surgery, excising his caddie, fine-tuning his swing, helping to
win the Ryder Cup and taking the PGA Championship as well as seven
other tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain won the Masters and Payne Stewart,
the American in retro golfing knickers, made a clutch 15-foot putt
on the 18th hole to defeat Phil Mickelson at the U.S. Open at
Pinehurst, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Paul Lawrie of Scotland, playing at rugged Carnoustie
in his homeland, started the final day of the British Open 10
strokes out, but Jean Van de Velde of France stumbled badly and
Lawrie won on the fourth hole of a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Woods beat Sergio Garcia of Spain, age 19, to win the
PGA in Medinah, Ill., as Americans chanted ``Sergio! Sergio!''
</P>
<P>
   Having come to know Stewart for his born-again friendliness as
well as his born-again golf game, fans grieved in late October when
he and three others were killed in a mysterious crash of his leased
plane in South Dakota, far from his planned route.
</P>
<P>
   In women's golf, Karrie Webb, age 24, won six tournaments and
led in earnings and was the LPGA player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from injuries and general lassitude, Pete Sampras
missed the Australian Open, won by Yevgeny Kafelnikov, and made his
usual early exit from the red clay of the French Open. Andre
Agassi, bouncing ba near oblivion and a divorce from Brooke
Shields, his body buffed from sessions with trainer Gil Reyes, came
back to win the French.
</P>
<P>
   At Wimbledon, Sampras beat Agassi to finally tie Roy Emerson for
the most Grand Slam titles with 12, but the wait goes on. In New
York, Sampras hurt his back in practice, leaving Agassi to win his
second Open, over Todd Martin. For the first time in his career,
Agassi finished a year ranked first in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams sisters became nearly as good as their father,
Richard, had predicted. Venus defeated her younger sister in the
Lipton final in the spring and finished the year ranked third,
while Serena won the U.S. Open and finished fourth. Martina Hingis
won in Australia and would finish first for the year, while Lindsay
Davenport won at Wimbledon and the Chase in November to finish
second.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the French Open and reaching the Wimbledon final,
Steffi Graf realized she no longer had the drive, so she retired,
immediately. By the U.S. Open, Graf and Agassi were, as the saying
goes, keeping company.
</P>
<P>
   No sport seemed more upbeat than the stock car version of racing
known as NASCAR, with its new NBC, Fox and TBS contract for $400
million a year. The sport also has Trumpian visions of expanding to
within screaming earshot of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The top driver in NASCAR was Dale Jarrett, 42, of the Robert
Yates Racing team, while Mika Hakkinen won the Formula One, Juan
Pablo Montoya won the CART championships and Kenny Brack won the
83rd Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the seas beyond Auckland, New Zealand, Paul Cayard's
America One and Dawn Riley's America True advanced to the fleet of
six for the America's Cup semifinals in January, but John
Marshall's Young America suffered hull damage and failed to
advance. Team New Zealand will defend its title in February.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Several traditional sports are staggering on reputations gained
decades ago. In boxing, Lennox Lewis of Britain received poetic
justice for his jobbing in March by taking a very narrow decision
over Evander Holyfield in November for the unified heavyweight
championship. After some unusually outrageous shenanigans, several
officials in New Jersey were under investigation. In December, a
journeyman boxer named Stephan Johnson, suspended in Ontario for
marginal CAT scan results, died after a fight in Atlantic City.
Many women, including a daughter of the damaged Muhammad Ali, began
boxing professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing is fairly aching for its long-delayed 12th Triple
Crown champion. Charismatic, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, won the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness, but broke down in the Belmont
stretch. A horrified 85,818 fans watched jockey Chris Antley
gallantly control the wounded horse, and surgery saved Charismatic
for a long life on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid won the Belmont and the year ended enigmatically
with Cat Thief winning the Breeders' Cup Classic and Artax winning
the Sprint. The sport lost a star when Julie Krone, the greatest
female jockey in history and a past Belmont winner, retired at
midyear. Definitely not retiring was Laffit Pincay Jr., who passed
Bill Shoemaker for most career victories.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of racing, on two bicycle wheels, saw the American
Lance Armstrong rebound from testicular cancer to win the Tour de
France, a race still haunted by the specter of doping.
</P>
<P>
   August's world track and field championships in Seville, Spain,
produced excitement when Michael Johnson set a world record of
43.18 seconds in the 400 meters, and American sprinter Maurice
Greene won three gold medals. The emotional highlight came when
Lyudmila Engquist, a Russian now running for Sweden, won the bronze
medal in the 100-meter hurdles only four months after undergoing a
mastectomy for breast cancer on her 35th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rooting for her, and I'm running against her,'' said Gail
Devers, 33, the American gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, embarrassed by Olympic scandals, did have cause to
celebrate: its men beat Pakistan to win the World Cup in cricket,
beat South Africa and France to win the World Cup of rugby and beat
France for the Davis Cup in tennis, and its women beat New Zealand
for the world netball title, whatever netball is.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Thompson of the United States set a world record in the
100-meter butterfly at the Pan Pacific Championships and was named
female athlete of the year by the U.S. Olympic Committee. (Lance
Armstrong and the women's soccer team were also honored.)
</P>
<P>
   Other retirements included: the graceful Jana Novotna, whose
1998 Wimbledon victory made up for an earlier teary collapse;
Darrell Waltrip, a three-time NASCAR series champion; Don Haskins,
who coached Texas Western to the 1966 NCAA basketball title over
Kentucky, using only African-Americans and striking a huge blow for
equality; football lineman Reggie White; baseball hitter Wade
Boggs; NASCAR driver Ernie Irvan, and Barry Sanders, who made an
end run from the Detroit Lions as the second-leading rusher of all
time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the great sports figures who died in 1999: Joe DiMaggio;
Wilt Chamberlain, the enigmatic basketball scorer; Walter Payton,
football's Sweetness; Payne Stewart; Kim Perrot of the WNBA Houston
Comets; Catfish Hunter, the droll Yankee from North Carolina;
Malcolm Marshall, the compact fast-bowling cricket star from the
West Indies; Marion Motley, the devastating fullback and linebacker
for the old Cleveland Browns; PeeWee Reese, captain for life of the
Brooklyn Dodgers; grand old golfer Gene Sarazen, and the generous,
reticent owner of the Jets, Leon Hess.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Hess' funeral, the Jets were for sale, at prices
most definitely fin de siecle. Charles Dolan, the proprietor of
Cablevision, and three other competitors seemed likely to drive the
price toward $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the money. The fabled Washington Redskins were sold for
$805 million to one Daniel Snyder, a 30-something with a penchant
for micromanaging. This figure remains, temporarily, the highest in
sports history.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the expansion Cleveland Browns sold for $530 million.
Larry Dolan, a Cleveland lawyer and brother of Charles, bought the
Indians for $320 million, just beyond the $311 million Rupert
Murdoch paid for the Dodgers in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the money come from? From television. CBS Sports is
paying $6 billion to keep the men's college basketball tournament
for 11 more years, despite declining ratings. The $545 million
annual fee ranks behind only the $2.2 billion paid to the NFL and
the $650 million paid to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, NBC will be paying an average of $750 million
for the 2000, 2004 and 2008 Summer and the 2006 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder great players command such staggering salaries that
their teams sometimes seem downright eager to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   At century's end, the most ludicrous example was Ken Griffey
Jr., perhaps the best player in baseball, who announced he wanted
to leave Seattle with a year left in his contract, ostensibly to be
closer to Orlando, Fla., where he has chosen to move his family.
His best option might be his hometown of Cincinnati, if only that
modest market could afford him.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey seemed fated to mope back to Seattle for one sour,
leftover season, a melancholy symptom of a money-mad world hurtling
toward a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   What are the prospects for sporting peace in the new age?
</P>
<P>
   Consider this fearsome bit of news: the volatile John McEnroe
has been named the U.S. Davis Cup captain, and will lead the Yanks
into Zimbabwe in February. While there has never been a war started
by a tennis match, at this fin de siecle juncture, anything seems
possible.

FOR HAPLESS AND GIFTLESS, IT'S (ALMOST) NEVER TOO LATE TO SHOP

   NEW YORK _ What sort of paralyzing procrastination could
possibly hold a man hostage the entire month of December and leave
him scrambling on Christmas Day itself in search of a present for
his wife?
</P>
<P>
   Well, just ask Carlos Serafina, foot-dragger extraordinaire.
With the yuletide shopping clock far past the zero hour, Serafina
was prowling the aisles of an uptown Rite Aid drugstore at 9 on
Christmas morning, trying to make a truly last-minute choice: the
Hamilton Beach blender or the box of Russell Stover mints. The
decision? Wisely, both. The gift-wrap? Sadly, none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I work six days a week _ morning, afternoon and night,''
said Serafina, a baker at an all-night bagel shop. ``So yes, okay,
I'm a little late. But after work I usually go straight home to
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Serafina was not alone at what could have been the most
shame-filled store in Manhattan Saturday. Shirkers and malingers of
all types were there _ not to mention those poor souls who were
simply caught off guard.
</P>
<P>
   Danixa Perez had barely rubbed the sleep from her eyes on
Christmas morning when she found out that an old family friend had
just arrived _ ahem, uninvited _ from New Jersey. Ten minutes
later, she and her brother Joe were standing in the cosmetics aisle
at the Rite Aid, at Broadway and West 110th Street, hoping to find
some perfume or a tube of skin cream that their friend might like.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's back at the house now helping Grandma cook up Christmas
dinner,'' Ms. Perez said, as her brother weighed the merits of a
plastic-wrapped loofah sponge. ``We had to come up with some
excuse. So we said we were going out to get some batteries for the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Scott had no excuse, however, but his transgression was
less severe. On Friday night, Scott, 67, a maintenance man, simply
forgot to take the silk blouse he had bought for his wife out of
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Scott stood in the cashier's line buying some wrapping
paper and cellophane tape, trying to figure out how on earth he was
going to out-Santa Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get this thing in the house any way I can,'' he
said, his face tense with concern. ``Maybe when the grandkids come
over. Then I'll just smuggle it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the length of upper Broadway was silent as smoke
throughout the morning _ a long alley of shuttered storefronts and
empty sun-splashed asphalt _ every few minutes, it seemed, another
11th-hour shopper came zipping down the sidewalk, making that
painfully embarrassing turn into Rite Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Didi Pope, 30, a saleswoman for Xerox, came to find a present
for her grandmother, Emma, and wound up buying several: a
Proctor-Silex coffee maker, a set of four matching 14-ounce ceramic
mugs and _ to complete the package _ a can of Maxwell House coffee,
French roast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get downtown to Kmart or something, but I live
right here,'' she said. ``Yeah, I know it's crazy, but I just ran
out of time this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Time was also on Carmen Rivera's mind, but not how you might
think. Browsing through the perfume section, Mrs. Rivera, 56, said
she had purchased all of her gifts well in advance this year. She
had turned up at the store on Christmas Day looking for something a
little different: good deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you find specials, certain items that weren't priced
like this before,'' said Mrs. Rivera's daughter, Alexandra, who was
considering a bottle of vanilla musk. ``You'd be surprised at how
cheap stuff gets today.''
</P>
<P>
   For Erwin Frankel, however, the visit to Rite Aid was not about
bargains. It was about finally righting ancient wrongs. Three years
ago, he promised to make a photo montage of his friend's family for
Hanukkah. Well, on Saturday he bought the disposable camera for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to talk about being late?'' Frankel said, glancing at
all the lesser procrastinators waiting behind him in line. ``I'm
not even buying a Christmas gift. I'm buying a Hanukkah present _
from 1995.''

POPE URGES REPENTANCE AND MUTUAL RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS name to ``Holy Year 2000''   in 1st and 11th grafs.) (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ On the first day of the Holy Year 2000, Pope John Paul II
delivered a Christmas speech Saturday that called for repentance in
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must, however, confess that humanity has sometimes sought
the truth elsewhere, invented false certainties, and chased after
deceptive ideologies,'' the pope said in his traditional Christmas
urbi et orbi (to the city and the world) address from his balcony
at St. Peter's Basilica. ``At times people have refused to respect
and love their brothers of a different faith or race, they have
denied fundamental rights to individuals and nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The frail 79-year-old pope, who on Christmas Eve pushed open the
holy door to St. Peter's, the symbol of the beginning of a holy
year, or jubilee, has long urged his followers to use the
millennium jubilee to redress personal wrongs and the misdeeds of
the Roman Catholic Church throughout the centuries. Saturday's
words served as a prelude for the kind of soul-searching in which
he intends to lead the church throughout the year 2000. He said
believers should be ``pilgrims in time,'' and remember the horrors
of the past. ``We visit all the places of grief and war, the
resting places of victims of brutal conflicts and cruel
slaughter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas is one of the most sacred events on the Christian
calendar, and for John Paul II, this year has a special
significance, as it marks what the church views as the 2,000th
anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ and the start of a holy
year that is the first one at the turn of a millennium. ``This year
there is yet another reason that makes more holy this day of
grace,'' the pope said. ``It is the beginning of the great
jubilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of believers gathered in St. Peter's Square
clapped and cheered their approval. All morning, thousands of
believers passed through the bronze holy door that is kept bricked
up until a jubilee, many of them making signs of the cross and
kissing the sculpted panels.
</P>
<P>
   A jubilee, which now takes place every 25 years, is a tradition
that dates back to 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII urged pilgrims to
visit Rome when the Crusades made traveling to the Holy Land too
dangerous. Now, as then, believers make the pilgrimage to seek a
plenary indulgence, a remittance of punishment for sins, which can
be earned by a pilgrimage to Rome or other holy sites. The pope has
broadened the avenue to an indulgence, allowing believers to visit
Jerusalem churches, their own dioceses and even the Rome airport
chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, after his speech, the pope delivered a Christmas
greeting in 58 languages, as he does every Dec. 25. He then blessed
the crowd and granted them _ and those who followed the event on
television and radio _ a plenary indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past three years, the aging pope did not celebrate
Christmas Mass inside the basilica, leaving that task to Cardinal
Angelo Sodano, his secretary of state. But to emphasize the special
nature of this Holy Year, the pope broke with tradition and decided
to open the holy doors of the four main basilicas in Rome
personally. Saturday evening, the pope was expected to open the
holy door of St. John Lateran, the original church of the popes
before St. Peter's was built. He will open the doors at the other
two basilicas in January.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the pope needed help climbing the steps to the
holy door, but by the end of the midnight Mass, he was clearly
invigorated. As he walked down the aisle to leave, he smiled,
stroked the heads of small children, and blessed the faithful who
grabbed at his sleeve and touched his robe. At one point, he
playfully snatched back his hand from the outstretched hand of one
person in the aisle, smiling mischievously.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the pope sounded a more somber note, lamenting in
strong words the arms race, abortion and euthanasia. ``At times,
the world neither respects nor loves life,'' he said, asking that
God enlighten people ``so that legislators and political leaders,
men and women, of goodwill, may be committed to welcoming human
life as a precious gift.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas celebrations were a personal milestone for this
pope, who has been planning for the Holy Year 2000 ever since he
was elected in 1978. At times, through sheer willpower, he has
overcome his numerous physical ailments to press an agenda that
would exhaust a far younger, healthier man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christ, you are the door,'' the pope said in closing his
remarks on Friday night. ``Through you, in the power of the Holy
Spirit, we wish to enter the third millennium.''

   LOS ANGELES _ The first thing you notice is that everyone has
done the reading. Not a single student shies away from the seminar
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   You glimpse a graying lady switching eyeglasses between scanning
the text of ``The Optimist's Daughter,'' by Eudora Welty, and
glancing at the author's photographs of Mississippi. A balding
gentleman turns his left ear, the one with the hearing aid, toward
whoever is talking. A couple of canes are propped in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   This is definitely not your typical college class.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Plato Society, an educational haven for retirees,
they prefer not even to call it a class. Please, say study group.
Teachers? Call them coordinators. No papers, no tests. Just
learning, for learning's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very narrow-minded in my education. I came here to
broaden my education,'' explained Bud Hellman, 76, an engineer who
spent the fall studying the films of Stanley Kubrick. ``If I was to
live again, I'd want to be a student someplace, at one of these
beautiful modern campuses. This is my campus.''
</P>
<P>
   With the increased emphasis on standardized testing in
elementary and secondary education, and a push toward job training
even at liberal arts colleges, the purity of the intellectual
exercise at Plato is rare to behold. But it reflects an explosion
in the lifelong learning movement, as the first generation to
pursue higher education in big numbers _ thanks largely to the GI
Bill _ has settled into its Golden Years.
</P>
<P>
   Experts expect study among older citizens to continue to
skyrocket as baby boomers retire and live longer and healthier
lives. The fellowship in places like Plato can be crucial for
people who crave the sense of community they lost when they left
the workplace; research also suggests that vigorous mental
stimulation might help ward off senility.
</P>
<P>
   ``One theory is the `use it or lose it' theory: If you exercise
your brain cells, you're going to keep them,'' said Gary Small, a
geriatric psychiatrist who directs the Center on Aging here at the
University of California at Los Angeles. ``One of the key elements
is remaining engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   A sign of the trend is the surge in groups like Plato, which was
founded at UCLA 19 years ago as the Perpetual Learning and Teaching
Organization (modeled on a program started in 1962 at the New
School for Social Research in New York). In 1989, there were two
dozen such Institutes for Learning in Retirement affiliated with
Elderhostel, a national group best known for its traveling
educational seminars; today, there are 272.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers of participants are hard to come by, since many older
people who audit college classes are never counted, while others
pursue independent research in libraries or participate in ad-hoc
book clubs. But, according to the National Center for Education
Statistics, one in three Americans over 50 _23 million _ were
engaged in some sort of adult education last year, more than double
the 11 million (18 percent) who were involved in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a new wave of retirement communities being built
in conjunction with universities like Iowa State and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plato, somewhere, says that knowledge falls away from us and
we have a need to replace it,'' said Ronald Manheimer, who runs the
North Carolina Center for Creative Retirement at the state
university campus in Asheville. ``I don't know exactly what he had
in mind, but it's great insight for that period.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 375-member Plato Society is one among myriad
institutions providing education for retirees, experts say its
rigor is unique. That reflects its highly educated membership _ 56
percent have master's degrees or doctorates, and another 26 percent
graduated from college, according to a recent survey _ and its
high-minded mission: intellectual stimulation. Each member of a
study group leads one week's session; experts, like UCLA
professors, visit only at weekly lectures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the few rules in Plato's modern suite of rooms above a
take-out chicken restaurant near the UCLA campus is a ban on talk
of health, wealth or grandchildren. Despite members' impressive
roster of accomplishments, they never use honorifics. People
typically avoid their own expertise, instead perusing the course
catalog with whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Heller, an engineer who worked on the Manhattan Project,
runs study groups on Asian art. Ruth Gussen, a pathologist who is
now the society's president, specializes in French opera. Lawyers
take literature; pharmacists do philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   The ``resident medievalist'' is Ed Bressler, 73, an internist
who ``never heard of medieval, or Dark Ages, or anything
historical'' before joining Plato. ``I feel like Howard Carter when
he discovered King Tut _ three times a month,'' Bressler said.
</P>
<P>
   Leila Newman, 79, has a retirement schedule so packed with
tennis and bridge and teaching English to Russian immigrants that
she just signs up for whatever Plato is offering on Thursday
mornings. ``I've never been disappointed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bressler added: ``The process is far more important than the
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that members spend an average of 20 hours
preparing for their own study group presentations, and just under
three hours getting ready for the other sessions. This fall, there
was a group on the queens of England and one on terrorism, a
seminar on the first millennium and another on Islam in America, a
close reading of ``Ulysses'' and an intense look at Einstein. Once
in a while, Plato offers ``come as you are,'' in which members
present the topic of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a bunch of reasonably bright people together on
any topic, they will teach each other,'' Heller said. ``What we
don't know, we teach each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides their intellectual curiosity, Plato members bring a
barrel of experiences to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a session on 1960s protesters for a study group on ``The
American Century,'' a former university professor recalled the
dilemma of whether to give bad grades to draftable young men. Some
of the people discussing Charles Lindbergh were at the ticker tape
parade welcoming him back to New York. As for Kubrick, most of
those around the table saw ``Spartacus'' when it was first
released, in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become so much more sophisticated in our film
watching,'' said Irv Shimer, 70, who loved ``Spartacus'' in the
1960s but hated it upon review three decades later. ``You look at
an old picture and it's an old picture. It doesn't have the stuff
of a new picture, even a bad new picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Wally Graham, though, said he watched both times with the same
sense of wonder. ``I can't honestly remember much about 40 years
ago,'' he allowed. ``I have a hard time with last week.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one young face in the classroom, belonging to Eugene
Pino, a UCLA senior who is one of 246 honors students who have
taken Plato courses since 1986 in an arrangement that allows for
intergenerational relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's contributing, and the contributions are more
mature, it's coming from experience,'' he said. ``At UCLA, a lot of
times you hear, `It's just human nature.' These folks know what
human nature is.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Plato membership costs $395 a year, and after candidates are
approved by an interview panel, they can still get kicked out if
they are not lively participants. Publicity is mostly word of
mouth, though some said they were referred by doctors, a kind of
prescription to combat loneliness and brain atrophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I get older, I'm frightened of narrowing horizons,'' said
Richard Gilson, 74, whose wife pushed him to join. ``My greatest
fear is that I'll go brain dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Between study groups, they have lunch in the lounge. On the
bulletin board, there are pictures of Plato tennis groups and
fliers announcing holiday parties. Some study groups go on retreats
_ a Steinbeck seminar traveled to Pacific Grove _ and people have
found romance in Plato.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came seeking intellectual stimulation,'' said Martin Jaffe,
a onetime systems analyst who wears his graying hair in a ponytail.
``But I also found society.''

VENEZUELA'S DEVASTATING FLOODS COULD SET BACK CHAVEZ'S
`REVOLUTION' 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACUTO, Venezuela _ On a day that was supposed to mark a new
beginning for Venezuela, this beach town was entombed by what looks
like a whole new layer of Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks of torrential rains triggered flash floods and
landslides Dec. 15 that roared down nearby Mount Avila and crashed
into Macuto and other locales. The floods left behind a congealing
mud stew of tree trunks, boulders, crumpled cars and human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other communities were washed away in Venezuela's
worst-ever natural disaster. Government officials estimate that
between 5,000 and 30,000 people died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be beautiful. But now, it's totally devastated,''
said Jaime Pacheco, as he walked across a newly formed plain of
brown, hard-packed dirt and debris that was once Macuto's beach.
</P>
<P>
   Besides remaking the topography, the mudslides could alter
Venezuela's political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Chavez has spent his first 10 months in office
railing against the wealthy elite, promising a peaceful revolution
on behalf of the poor and campaigning for a new constitution that
was approved by voters on the same day the mudslides struck.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, some analysts say that Chavez must tone down his
class-based politics, postpone upcoming elections and bring
Venezuelans together to rebuild the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This catastrophe changes the agenda,'' said Anibal Romero, a
political science professor at Simon Bolivar University in Caracas.
``Chavez has to create jobs, attract investment and fix the
infrastructure. And he has to do it fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the task was evident during a tour last week
along the Caribbean coast of tiny Vargas state, just north of the
capital city of Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   With sections of the main highway blocked by landslides,
bulldozers and backhoes were cutting paths into hillsides of dried
mud. On parts of the new route, trucks cruised above buried
rooftops and power lines. Pedestrians wore face masks to avoid the
dust and the stench of rotting human and animal remains.
</P>
<P>
   At La Guaira, Venezuela's main cargo port, shipping containers
knocked over by the floods still stood on end. Plastic bags,
mangoes, ripped clothes and even twisted car chassis lay scattered
on the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers of mud turned the Caribbean Sea a chocolate brown. In the
background, Mount Avila appeared scarred as if scratched by a cat.
The landslides had cut into its green slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A river came right into my house,'' said Daniluz Aguilera, 19,
who survived by fleeing to the top floor of a clinic in La Guaira.
``This is a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army paratrooper, threw himself into the relief
effort as if it were a war. Outfitted in camouflage fatigues and a
red beret, he flew to the worst areas to assess the damage and
comfort refugees.
</P>
<P>
   At one stop last week he told a group of survivors: ``I feel
from the bottom of my heart, from my soul, the worst pain I have
experienced in all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Visibly moved by the unfolding tragedy, first lady Marisabel
Chavez invited displaced children into the presidential residence
and set up an aid distribution center on the manicured grounds just
outside the walled compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her face is swollen because she has been crying all the
time,'' said Armando Pelaez, a volunteer at the aid center.
</P>
<P>
   Pelaez pointed out that the first family feels a special bond
with the victims because most are poor and working-class
Venezuelans who make up the bulk of Chavez's political support.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Freddy Hidalgo, a 43-year-old construction
worker, showed up at the aid center to check its database for
missing persons. He held up a photo of his 9-year-old adopted
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of two things,'' he said. ``Either we find her or we
find her body.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials said that many of the dead will never be found
because they were buried in the mud or washed into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   To help the living rebuild, Chavez suggested that the rich adopt
a family for the holidays. Rather than rebuild along the steep
folds of Mount Avila, the estimated 400,000 homeless people will be
offered new housing in seven agricultural areas around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a crowd of flood victims last week, Chavez referred
to one relocation site in western Miranda state, and said: ``Let's
make a town over there. You'll live quite a life, without fearing
floods or falling mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, though, questioned the plan because many of the victims
work in tourism, the fishing industry or at the La Guaira port and
have no experience in farming.
</P>
<P>
   Others blamed the government for putting politics ahead of
public safety.
</P>
<P>
   According to Diego Urbaneja, a former opposition congressman,
the Chavez administration ignored pleas from the governors of
Miranda, Vargas and Falcon states for federal help to evacuate
at-risk families on Dec. 15, the day the mudslides began.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the day Venezuelans voted on a new constitution
that could greatly enhance Chavez's powers. Rather than encouraging
people to seek shelter from unseasonable torrential rains, which
had been falling for two weeks, the government instead encouraged
people to brave the elements by extending the hours at the polling
places from 4 to 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government had been more concerned about the people
than about the elections, perhaps they could have saved more
people,'' said Maruja Tarre, a political analyst in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new constitution, another round of elections for state
governors, mayors and possibly for the presidency must be called
within 90 days. But Tarre said the vote should be postponed because
the government cannot now afford to spend millions on a nationwide
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Superstitious Venezuelans wonder if the approval of the new
charter and the mudslides were somehow related.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible that on the same day we were supposed to start
a new period in our history, we also had the most terrible natural
catastrophe in our history,'' said Romero, the political scientist.
``Many people think that this is a bad omen.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only bright spot is that the tragedy has, for the
moment, cooled political passions and brought people together.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took office Feb. 2, Chavez has portrayed Venezuela as a
nation divided between rich and poor, between friends of his
government and enemies. While campaigning for the new constitution,
Chavez lambasted business groups, the Roman Catholic Church and
media groups for their opposition to the new magna carta.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these same groups are playing a vital role in the country's
relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businessmen in helicopters saved hundreds. Churches opened
their doors to orphans. Those who had been portrayed as devils a
day earlier showed the nation what they are: true heroes,'' wrote
Julio Borges in the Caracas daily El Universal.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Chavez's politics of division could lose some of
its appeal, Romero said. He added that Chavez may instead be forced
to bond with big business and the church as he confronts the
nation's deepening economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a speedy recovery appears unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The Caracas business group Fedecamaras estimates that
reconstruction will cost between $15 billion and $20 billion. About
200,000 jobs were erased, and the Caracas stock market lost 8
percent of its value in the aftermath. Last week, the government
forecast that the economy would contract by a whopping 7.2 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a lesson for Chavez about the need for unity,''
Tarre said. ``Right now we are starting a very long process of
reconstruction. And he has to count on everyone.''

PLUNKETT HERO OF '71 ROSE BOWL GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many college campuses in 1970, Stanford smoldered with
unrest, protest and rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the country, things were tense. At one demonstration
in May that year, National Guard officers shot and killed four
students when an anti-war rally at Kent State in Ohio turned ugly.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, there was a plan to decrease the school's athletic
commitment. After all, what good is football when young men were
dying in Vietnam and young college women were being snuffed out by
a government losing control?
</P>
<P>
   Enter Jim Plunkett _ 1970 Heisman Trophy winner, Rose Bowl MVP,
consensus All-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to push a lot of that aside. I wanted to play football
and get my education,'' Plunkett said. ``With the Vietnam movement
and the anti-war protests, it was a very difficult time to
concentrate on a game.''
</P>
<P>
   But concentrate he did. On the football field in 1970, Plunkett
sparkled. He completed 191 passes for 2,715 yards. He ran for
another 183 yards, giving him 2,898 total yards. It was a school
and Pacific-8 conference record.
</P>
<P>
   His play earned Plunkett, now 52, the Heisman Trophy and led
Stanford then known as the Indians to the 1971 Rose Bowl, where
they faced the Ohio State Buckeyes. It was the team's first trip to
Pasadena in 19 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that was an awful long time,'' Plunkett recalled.
``At a team dinner on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, our
coach, John Ralston, passed out buckeyes to each one of us so we
could see how insignificant they really are.''
</P>
<P>
   In the game itself, Plunkett completed 20 of 30 passes for 265
yards and helped the Indians beat Ohio State, which came into the
game a 13-point undefeated favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The win _ and his play that day _ earned Plunkett the Rose
Bowl's Most Valuable Player honor. He finished his career with an
NCAA-record 7,887 yards of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett and his teammates also may have saved Stanford's
football program from oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think we helped turn it around,'' Plunkett said.
</P>
<P>
   Even to this day, Plunkett's teammates admit they were as happy
about the awards and recognition as he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think is great about Jim is you see a lot of athletes
nowadays that have these really big egos and you never got that
with Jim,'' said John Sande III, who was Plunkett's center. ``There
was never jealousy for the awards he got. He's one of those few
that are great athletes and are always humble. That's what I
remember: What you see is what you get. That's why he was such a
popular player.''
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett's career didn't end there. Following the season, he was
the NFL's top draft pick in 1971. Plunkett went to the New England
Patriots and was the AFL's rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The next season was disastrous and by the end of the decade,
Plunkett, who grew up in the gritty East San Jose neighborhood of
Alum Rock, was back in the Bay Area with the 49ers. He was cut and
his career appeared over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to remember those years,'' Plunkett said.
``Nobody struggled more. It was tough going for me for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Oakland Raiders took a chance on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Jim that I remember most is that he wasn't a
beautiful passer.... He had moments in which he looked awkward
because he would do whatever he had to do to make the completion,''
Raiders general manager Al LoCasale said. ``But he was extremely
efficient and pressure-proof in big games and tight games. Jim
Plunkett was Jim Plunkett. He would do the things he had to do to
win ball games.''
</P>
<P>
   After a season and a half as a backup to Kenny Stabler and then
Dan Pastorini, Plunkett took the reins five games into the 1980
season and led Oakland to a 27-10 Super Bowl victory over the
Philadelphia Eagles. He completed 13 of 21 passes for 261 yards and
three touchdowns and earned MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, with the Raiders playing in Los Angeles,
Plunkett again guided his team to victory this time a 38-9 rout of
the heavily favored Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hated to lose,'' Plunkett said. ``And I couldn't have
done it without the people around me. That showed in my career.
When I was surrounded by good people, I was on winning teams. They
have to be given credit too.''
</P>
<P>
   After he retired, Plunkett returned to the Bay Area. He lives in
San Mateo County with his wife and two children
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Jr., 16, and Meghan, 14. There, he owns a beer
distributorship and works as a television commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett plans a return to the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day to
see his former team take on the Wisconsin. While campus unrest has
long since quieted and the Stanford football team is in no jeopardy
of being swept away, there are a lot of eerie similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Stanford an 11-point underdog, the team hasn't
played in the Rose Bowl since January 1972, the year after Plunkett
left. A Heisman Trophy winner will be on the field, but wearing
Badger Red _ not the Cardinal version.
</P>
<P>
   Another Heisman trophy winner will be looking on and cheering
for his team. He knows they can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Stanford has a very good football team,'' Plunkett
said. ``If we beat a big favorite, I know they can do it.''

DOG-EARED MUSEUM PLANS A $69 MILLION OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JEFF WAGGONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Years ago, children who visited the New York
State Museum were apt to take a big lick of a 4-foot salt pillar on
display. That most salt licks are enjoyed by livestock and deer did
not limit the illicit interactive appeal to thousands of small
visitors, who over the years wore grooves in the rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we licked it _ I don't know if we were supposed to, but
we did,'' said John McEneny, now 56, a member of the state
Assembly, recalling how he and his childhood friends would while
away long summer days at the museum, with its dioramas of Mohawk
life and other exhibits on the natural and human history of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The case for public hygiene and a move to a new location ended
what might have been the museum's first and last tongues-on
display, a testimony to the state's once-booming salt industry. The
pillar was banished to one of the institution's own salt mines:
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the museum's collection of 6 million items was also
moved out of view there in the mid-1970s during the move from the
State Education Building to an austere marble-clad building in the
Empire State Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 163-year-old museum, which says it is the
nation's oldest state museum, has fallen victim to what its
director, Clifford Siegfried, calls benign neglect. He likens it to
a tattered and worn textbook, with fixed displays, many of them two
or three decades old, in a dark, almost mournful, setting.
</P>
<P>
   Annual attendance has dropped by half over the last decade, to
650,000 last year from a high of 1.3 million in 1990. State
financing has not kept up with inflation, resulting in staff cuts,
to 115 today from 167 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stop the slide, Siegfried and his boss, state
Education Commissioner Richard Mills, last month announced a $69
million overhaul of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   A state budget included $4.5 million to get the renovation under
way, but the museum is far from securing the full amount. Although
both Siegfried and McEneny are optimistic that the project will be
fully financed, the official word from Gov. George Pataki's
administration, said Suzanne Morris, a spokeswoman, is that ``the
governor will take a look at the proposal in terms of the overall
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is also planning its own private fund-raising
efforts, and this month it hired an Ohio firm, Gerald Hilferty &AMP;
Associates, to design the renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Over five to 10 years, the project will create skylights to
brighten the museum. Other changes will make exhibit areas easier
to change and add interactive displays in six large exhibits that
will each trace a theme.
</P>
<P>
   In one exhibit, ``Empire State,'' visitors will take a virtual
trip by boarding a replica canal boat for ``Fifteen Miles on the
Erie Canal,'' a display with projected images that recreate life
along the canal in the 1850s. Another exhibit, ``New York
Ecosystems,'' will feature a stream running from the mezzanine to
the first floor.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit ``Politics of Change'' will include a copy of the
1799 state law that gradually abolished slavery and a draft of the
Emancipation Proclamation, written mostly in Abraham Lincoln's
hand. Also being considered are displays on the 1969 Stonewall
uprising, considered a watershed in civil rights for gays.
</P>
<P>
   The three other large exhibits will be ``Shaping the Land,'' a
study of the ancient natural history of the state, and ``Peopling
the Land'' and ``Growing up in New York,'' two lessons on the

   The museum, older than the American Museum of Natural History
and the Smithsonian Institution, is among the 5 percent of the
country's museums that qualify as research museums.
</P>
<P>
   Siegfried also plans to move more of the museum's intellectual
vitality out of its laboratories and academic cloisters and into
its public spaces. That could mean making researchers available to
talk to visitors more often. Gerald Hilferty, of the design firm,
said the museum should provide the most ``literal, visceral
experience'' possible.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the salt pillar is back on display in a retrospective
of the museum's older exhibits. Its grooves are testimony to the
days when New Yorkers were much more intimate with their museum, an
intimacy its supporters hope will soon return.

COMMENTARY: IN AN UNLIKELY SETTING, A SEASONAL OASIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Holiday travel sounds like something you might do
while wearing a party hat and sipping one of those drinks with an
umbrella stuck in it.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, of course, it is overbooked flights, bomb-sniffing
dogs and unpleasant incidents of ``gate rage'' _ those nose-to-nose
arguments that make passengers and airline agents look like
baseball managers and umpires.
</P>
<P>
   The daily commute is a nuttiness that eventually begins to feel
familiar, even comfortable. But holiday travel is, as the surgeons
say, never routine.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Obando is a veteran. She's a ticket agent at Newark
International Airport. That's why she was in the airport's
meditation room early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first thing I do in the morning before I go to my
position,'' she said. ``For me, it's peace. For me, it's
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lord is compassionate. Passengers are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come with a lot of stress,'' Ms. Obando said. ``They
are in a hurry. They want to go places as soon as possible. We need
to be in a good frame of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The meditation room is the admiral's club for the frequent
faithful. A small, spare room in Terminal C, it is set up for
prayer of all kinds, including an altar for Catholic Mass and a rug
for Islamic prayer (plus a compass for finding east). It caters to
religious travelers stuck in the airport, and to the scared or
grateful.
</P>
<P>
   A flight attendant was there Friday morning, quietly adjusting
her uniform and making the sign of the cross before hurrying to her
gate. Later, an Israeli student came to say morning prayers, and,
eyeing the poinsettias in the room, joked, ``Are we going to have a
minyan?''
</P>
<P>
   Finding relief at an airport during this season of happy
dislocation is rare. First, there are the crowds. And there are so
many rumors of terrorism threats at Newark Airport that it is
difficult to keep them straight. (Was it really a pilot who said he
might have a bomb in his luggage or was it the guy on the Internet
with the bomb in the Holland Tunnel? What is this, open-mike night
for amateur terrorists?)
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, there is the feeling of being stuffed into a
kielbasa skin. Chris Gallagher, 27, had left work at a translating
service in midtown Manhattan at 3 p.m. on Thursday and six hours
later was still waiting with his grandmother at the end of a very
crowded seating area for their flight home to Milwaukee. Even the
big number of his gate told him that Newark Airport had gotten
outsized. ``C-130,'' he said. ``That's a ridiculous number for a
gate!''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that was the observation of a man who had waited four
hours for a two-hour flight. But just as people invariably
understate the length of their commutes, they tend to embellish the
duration and drama of their airport incarcerations.
</P>
<P>
   An Orange County, N.Y., man said he had woken up at 4:30 a.m. to
get his daughter on an 8:50 a.m. flight. And, he said, because of
delays at the airport, she made the flight only because ``I was
throwing her on the plane as the doors closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The mismatched strains of the season are everywhere at the
airport. A jazz band filled Terminal B with lively music the other
night, while behind the scenes, security agents were scanning
baggage for explosives.
</P>
<P>
   And while a periodic announcement ominously informed travelers
that unattended luggage would be inspected ``and may be
destroyed,'' countless arriving passengers flipped open their cell
phones and happily announced to relatives: ``Hi, can you hear me?
It's me! I'm at the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nice to step out of the flow for a moment, away from the
boarding announcements and the whirring of little suitcase wheels.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Isaac Schochor did. A 31-year-old Israeli studying
at Columbia University, Schochor was bumped from a 7:15 flight to
Miami on Friday morning. He had left New York too early to say
morning prayers and was preparing to pray in the meditation room,
standing between the altar and the prayer rug. The room is a little
like Israel. ``It's small and it has a lot of meaning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, at Newark Airport? He thought for a moment. ``I
wouldn't say it's more spiritual than JFK.''

INSURANCE PLAN HAS GOVERNOR AT ODDS WITH REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A major new entitlement program, paid for with a
major new tax. Sounds more like Bill Bradley than Trent Lott,
right?
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the political figure embracing the deal is a
Republican, Gov. George Pataki, and while the plan is likely to
sell well in New York, it puts Pataki at odds with most of his
party's leading figures around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, the governor and the Legislature announced
an agreement to subsidize health insurance for as many as half a
million low- and moderate-income people who do not qualify for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will be financed with most of the money New York will
receive from the national settlement with tobacco companies, but
even that is not enough to pay for the cost of such an ambitious
new program. So in addition, state lawmakers will raise the
cigarette tax by 55 cents a pack, to $1.11, highest in the nation,
generating an additional $500 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Each half of that equation _ government-subsidized health care
and a big increase, even in a sin tax _ is anathema to many
conservatives, and the combination is enough to make them blanch.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the presidential candidate, has
been one of the few prominent Republicans to champion an increased
federal tobacco tax, arguing that it was the best way to divert
teen-agers from smoking. But McCain's approach to helping people
pay for health care has been to advocate medical savings accounts
that give them some marginal tax breaks in buying their own
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On the presidential trail, only the two Democrats _ Bradley, the
former senator from New Jersey, and Vice President Al Gore _ are
talking about a new government effort to aid the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Several calls to George W. Bush's presidential campaign last
week about the New York plan were not returned, but Bush, the
Republican front-runner, has never advocated anything remotely like
it.
</P>
<P>
   New York, of course, is not Texas. This, after all, is the state
that four times elected Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, a national symbol
of liberal Republicanism, and three times voted for Gov. Mario
Cuomo, icon of Democratic liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is the most conservative governor in most New Yorkers'
lifetimes, but even after years of ascendant smaller-is-better
rhetoric, the state remains a place with an expansive idea of what
government should be.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even in New York, some conservatives found the deal hard
to stomach. The governor's staunchest supporter in the Legislature,
Assemblyman John Faso, the Republican minority leader, said, ``I
have a very strong disagreement with him'' on both the health-care
program and the higher tax.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's record as a tax-cutter is unassailable. Since he took
office five years ago, New York has lowered taxes far more than any
other state. But in some quarters, the aversion to taxation is so
strong that no increase can be brooked, even in the context of much
larger cuts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pataki is especially out of sync with Republicans in Congress,
who have rejected the cigarette-tax increase proposed by McCain in
1998, rejected a similar levy that President Clinton called for
this year and rejected various plans to broaden health coverage for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much less ideology at work and much more innovation at
work when you're in the governor's seat than when you're in
Washington,'' said David Gergen, a former aide to Presidents Reagan
and Clinton, and now a professor of public service at the Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard University. ``Pataki has become one
of the leaders in that crowd of Republican governors who believe in
using government aggressively to tackle big problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the nation's Republican governors, what Pataki has
done puts him in the minority. Only a handful of others _ in
Minnesota, Rhode Island and Wisconsin _ have enacted similar major
efforts for the uninsured; and Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey
has proposed one.
</P>
<P>
   And even by the standards of that group, the cigarette tax is
remarkable. Some other Republican governors have raised cigarette
taxes, but most by 10 to 20 cents. None, Democrat or Republican,
has pushed through an increase as large as 55 cents.

JOHN TAYLOR, AIRCRAFT EXPERT, DIES AT 77 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can purchase by
calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
(DW) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John W.R. Taylor, the longtime editor of ``Jane's All the
World's Aircraft,'' the authoritative guide to aviation, died on
Dec. 12 in a hospital in Surbiton, a suburb of London, where he
lived. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was not disclosed, but Taylor was
hospitalized with angina two days before his death, said Paul
Beaver, a spokesman for Jane's in London.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor spent 30 years, from 1959 to 1989, editing ``Jane's All
the World's Aircraft,'' the annual compendium of technical and
engineering data, photographs and historical information about
virtually all the airplanes that exist in the world. The
blue-covered book, part of the venerable Jane's Information Group,
which also publishes ``Jane's Fighting Ships,'' is regarded as the
bible of the industry. It is known for its accuracy and
comprehensiveness and is read by military, aircraft manufacturers
and intelligence agencies around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was particularly respected for his ability to obtain
information about military aircraft. His reputation was such that
during the Falklands War in 1982, Argentina provided him with
details about its airplanes even though it was fighting Britain.
``They felt that he was above politics,'' Beaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was also adept at gathering data about aircraft from the
Soviet Union, which, like Argentina, rated Jane's highly and
provided relatively accurate information on its planes even during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, Taylor had to rely on photographs taken
during parades and air shows to judge the capabilities of aircraft.
His skill at this method was so polished that he occasionally came
up with scoops that surprised the Western intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, for example, Taylor did an analysis of the Soviet
MIG-29 fighter. Seven years later, a group from Jane's visited the
Soviet Union and found that his physical measurements of the plane
came within an inch of his earlier projections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, the Soviet Union introduced the Tupolev Tu22 supersonic
bomber, and many analysts in the West estimated that it could reach
a speed of Mach 2.5. Taylor, by gauging the air intakes, made a
lower estimate _ Mach 1.4, which was later found to be much closer
to the actual speed.
</P>
<P>
   John William Ransom Taylor was born on June 8, 1922. He became a
draftsman and joined Hawker Aircraft in 1941, where he was a
designer on the Hawker Hurricane 2-D fighter that destroyed German
tanks in World War II. He later specialized in fixing design
defects.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, he joined Jane's as an editorial assistant; four years
later he became editor. After he retired in 1989, he was named
editor emeritus. Until the late 1960s, Taylor was almost the entire
editorial staff of the publication. ``It is seldom appreciated how
much is involved in producing an edition of Jane's,'' he wrote
dryly in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor wrote numerous books, among them ``Spitfire'' (with M.F.
Allward, 1946) and ``Passenger Aircraft and Airlines'' (with S.H.H.
Young, 1975).
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Doris; a son, Michael, of Ewell,
Surrey, and a daughter, Susan, of Ampthill, Bedfordshire.

ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL :  YOUNG COACHES ARE MAKING FAST BREAKS FROM
MENTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They play ``H-A-W-K-E-Y-E'' now instead of ``H-O-R-S-E,'' after
the two-ball dribble and footwork drills. And there are many nights
when 7-year-old Kory and 4-year-old Bryce join their father, Steve
Alford, Iowa's new coach, and their grandfather, Sam, his son's
assistant, in the coaches' office for slumber parties.
</P>
<P>
   The men break down game film; the boys watch videos. Old coach.
Young coach. Budding players.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alfords' case, it is in the blood. But on more than a few
benches during this college basketball season, 30-something coaches
who have inherited old traditions will try to elbow their
``basketball fathers'' out of the polls.
</P>
<P>
   From the Mike Krzyzewski family tree, Quin Snyder, 33, has taken
over at Missouri and Tommy Amaker, 34, in his third season at Seton
Hall, is attempting to move the Pirates to the top tier of the Big
East.
</P>
<P>
   From the Rick Pitino school, 34-year-old Billy Donovan has built
Florida into a top 10 program.
</P>
<P>
   And from the most royal basketball line of all, Matt Doherty,
37, leads Notre Dame after assisting Roy Williams at Kansas and
playing for Dean Smith at North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge will be finding the players with the same
passion for the game I have and making it even deeper,'' Steve
Alford, 35, said earlier this season of the task he and his young
peers face. ``And I think I have developed my own way of doing
that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The energy these young coaches bring to college basketball is
already evident in recruiting. Donovan has had two straight
star-studded freshman classes and has made Gator fans think beyond
football; Florida is 9-1 and ranked No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Amaker has already been declared the winner of next year's
recruiting wars by virtue of his early signings for Seton Hall
(whose 7-2 record includes victories over Quinnipiac and Stony
Brook). And Snyder is expected to turn Missouri into a home of
McDonald's all-Americans in the same way he did as an assistant at
Duke. So far, he is 7-3, and his last two victories came against
Alford's Iowa team and No. 15 Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But Alford _ whose Hawkeyes are 5-4, with a season-opening upset
of Connecticut, the defending national champion, alongside losses
to No. 1 Stanford and No. 17 Maryland _ is the most compelling
figure in this new generation of coaches. That is partly because he
has the most impressive basketball resume and partly because he is
estranged from his mentor, Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Alford was Indiana high school's Mr. Basketball in 1983; he won
a gold medal as a member of the U.S. Olympic team in 1984 and, as
an all-American guard, led Knight's Indiana Hoosiers to a national
championship in 1987. He also played four seasons in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   And he is the most seasoned coach among the newcomers. Alford,
in his ninth season as a head coach, compiled a 157-78 record at
Division III Manchester College and Division I Southwest Missouri
State, which he led to a 22-11 record and a berth in the round of
16 of the national tournament last year.
</P>
<P>
   While Krzyzewski, Pitino and Williams speak glowingly of their
coaching proteges, Knight does not speak about _ or to _ Alford.
The two have not shared anything more than a civil hello since
Alford left Indiana, and Knight has not returned calls or letters
from his former captain since Alford became a rival Big Ten coach.
</P>
<P>
   Alford is diplomatic about the strain in their relationship but
indicates that it probably has much to do with having had to share
the spotlight in a basketball-crazy state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed my career at Indiana and I learned a lot from one of
the game's greatest coaches,'' Alford said. ``I'd like to have a
better relationship. But that's up to him. But I do have a
relationship with basketball in Indiana that goes back to high
school. I worked hard to become a better player. I won some games
for us. I contributed to our national championship. That is where I
learned the game first from my dad, then from coach Knight.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did at Southwest Missouri State, Steve Alford took Sam,
who was his high school coach, with him to the Iowa bench. Kory and
Bryce attend Iowa practices, just as the young Steve did when Sam
was coaching at New Castle Chrysler High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be with my kids,'' Steve Alford said. ``I want them
to understand what I do and how much I love it.'' Alford also has a
2-year-old daughter, Kayla.
</P>
<P>
   But Alford also acknowledges the habits he formed under Knight,
for everything from pregame meals to how he conducts a walk-through
practice. ``But I use my own personality,'' Alford said.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that he smiles rather than glowers on the sideline,
and discusses rather than discourses at practice. But he shares his
former college coach's iron will.
</P>
<P>
   Before Iowa's season-opening upset of Connecticut, the defending
national champion and preseason No. 1, at the Ikon Classic at
Madison Square Garden, Alford took Rob Griffin, a junior-college
transfer, out of the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not just about the basketball floor,'' he said. ``We
are about academics and community. Rob tested me by missing a
couple classes and I had to pass that test along.''
</P>
<P>
   Alford also sounded like his old coach when he railed against an
experimental rule implemented for the tournament: the choice to
shoot free throws or take the ball out of bounds in the final
seconds of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a media guy, but when television starts asking to take out
part of the game that James Naismith put in a long time ago, it's
silly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Knight wants to acknowledge it or Alford wants to
embrace it, the Indiana way has taken root alongside the Carolina,
Duke and Kentucky ways in the crop of new coaches. College players
and the game's fans may meet some new bosses this season, but they
are likely to discover that they are the same as the old ones. Just
a little younger.

TONY BRYANT, 60, WHO HIJACKED PLANE TO CUBA IN 1969 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif.) (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Bryant, who was a Black Panther, an airplane hijacker, a
prison inmate in communist Cuba for 11{ years and later an
anti-Castro militant based in Florida, died on Thursday. He was 60.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, The Associated Press reported. Where he
died was not immediately disclosed, but he had lived in southern
Florida after being freed from prison and expelled from Cuba in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant grew up in California and joined the Black Panthers as a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he hijacked a National Airlines plane that was flying
from New York to Miami and forced it to fly to Havana. He told the
crew, ``I would rather be in prison in Cuba than here'' in the
United States. He has also been quoted as saying he had intended to
exchange the plane for Cuban heavy weapons that the Panthers could
use to stage a revolution in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The official Havana newspaper Granma said at the time that he
had been arrested at the Havana airport after committing robbery as
well as the hijacking. Years later, he conceded that he had robbed
some passengers, one of whom turned out to be a secret agent for
President Fidel Castro, with a briefcase crammed with $100 bills.
``I robbed the wrong man,'' Bryant said in a 1995 interview.
</P>
<P>
   When he was arrested, the Havana government released his full
name as Anthony Garnet Bryant, which led to the discovery of police
records in San Francisco that showed he had been convicted in 1961
for robbery and in 1964 for possession and sale of marijuana, and
had been sentenced to San Quentin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 he was one of 30 Americans who were pardoned and
released from Cuban prisons and flown to Miami. In his 1984 book,
``Hijack,'' he described watching executions and endless beatings
in Cuban prisons. In his later years he displayed scars on his
body, which he said were made by bayonets while he was in prison.
In a 1997 interview he said: ``I had believed that Cuba was a
revolutionary's paradise. I found a revolutionary's graveyard
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the prisoners was seen by Cuban and U.S.
officials in Cuba then as a gesture by the Castro government to
improve Cuban-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Miami, Bryant was tried for the hijacking but was
sentenced only to five years on parole after former fellow inmates
testified to his bravery as a prisoner. In his Florida years he
earned money as a lecturer and a radio and television talk-show
host, and he rose high in an armed, Florida-based anti-Castro
organization, Commandos L.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his companion, Jennifer Viscasilla.

HOTEL PROJECT PLANNED FOR LAMBS CLUB  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   By CHRISTOPHER GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the theoretical right to sell a developer the
ability to add 75,000 square feet of space to a newly constructed
building, the Church of the Nazarene should be swimming in cash in
the Times Square real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   But hindered by location and legal requirements, they'll be
happy if they get permission from the New York City Landmarks
Preservation Commission to build a few floors above their 1905
building at 130 West 44th Street, designed by Stanford White for
the Lambs Club. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lambs Club was founded in 1874 by a group of theater people
who met for dinner and conversation. They took their name from a
similar group in London, which had met earlier in the 19th century
at the house of Charles Lamb, the drama critic and essayist.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Lambs occupied a series of rented quarters, and
in 1888 began what they called their ``gambols,'' special
performances by members to which outsiders were invited. In the
late 1890s, under the actor DeWolf Hopper, the ``Shepherd'' _ or
president _ of the club, the gambols were used as fund-raising
efforts for a new building. In 1898, the gambol went on a one-week,
eight-city tour, raising $67,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1903 the Lambs bought a site at 128 and 130 West 44th Street,
near the emerging theater district, and retained Stanford White, a
club member, to design a clubhouse. The architect developed a rich
neo-Georgian design in brick, marble and terra cotta, with six
rams' heads and two rams' profiles worked into the facade.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the first floor were a grill room and a billiard room, with a
bank of telephones in the lobby, on the second floor a banquet
hall, and on the third floor a small theater. The top stories were
given over to offices and sleeping rooms for members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1914 The New York Times wrote ``while many of the clubhouses
of the Big Town display constantly the dignity and spirit of
Greenwood Cemetery on a rainy Saturday afternoon, the Lambs is as
full of snap and ginger as an outlaw bronco, a bunch of freshly
lighted firecrackers.''
</P>
<P>
   The club had about 1,400 members (past and present members at
the time included Mark Twain, Edwin Booth, the prolific playwright
and actor Dion Boucicault and David Belasco). In 1915 the clubhouse
was doubled in size, in an alteration designed by George Freeman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1920 census recorded actors, composers and movie producers
among the residents of the Lambs, of whom the most prominent was
Frank Mandel, who co-wrote the book for ``No, No Nanette.'' In 1949
the Lambs began a new television show on NBC, ``The Lambs
Gambols,'' which included bits like Raymond Massey doing a song and
dance routine.
</P>
<P>
   A year later the Saturday Evening Post was able to point to such
high points in the club's history as George M. Cohan's first
performance of ``Over There'' at a gambol, and an early version of
``Brigadoon'' played by the composer Frederick Loewe on a piano in
the grill. But much of the article was retrospective, for it was
clear that the Lambs had been hurt by the eclipse of the New York
stage by Hollywood.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 the club was designated a landmark, and a few years
later it sold its building to the Church of the Nazarene; the club
is now in shared space at 3 W. 51st St. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the church, a Wesleyan evangelical sect based in Kansas
City, Mo., is working on plans to gut the interior, creating a
hotel with perhaps 150 rooms and a rear addition of another seven
stories, invisible from the street. Bruce Reeves, a spokesman for
the church, says the church initially tried to sell its 75,000
square feet of air rights, but that there was no nearby site, a
requirement in such a transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Then it sought to have its 250-seat theater declared a landmark,
which would allow the transfer over a much wider area, but the
landmarks agency is precluded from considering interiors of houses
of worship.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, Reeves says the church has teamed up with Hampshire Hotels
and Resorts for the hotel project, which will use only 25,000
square feet of the building's air rights. Their architect, William
Q. Brothers, is working on a rear addition that will step back in a
simple, modern style _ ``something very light'' says Howard Zipser,
the lawyer representing both the church and the hotel group.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reeves says the church originally calculated that it could build
a nine-story addition, but to respond to the landmarks commissions'
concerns about visibility from the street, reduced the new
structure to seven stories. Terri Rosen Deutsch, chief of staff of
the commission, said that visibility of the planned new structure
was the agency's primary concern.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The church, which has from 100 to 250 parishioners at a typical
Sunday service, will retain offices and an assembly hall in the
building, and use of common areas. The church expects to file plans
with the Landmarks Preservation Commission early next year and, if
the commission approves, erect the new building in about a year _
where possible salvaging woodwork, plaques and other architectural
elements.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reeves says that the Church of the Nazarene did consider selling
instead of beginning what he estimates as a $10 million to $20
million project, but ``for us, there's a very strong emotional
attachment to that site.'' &QL;

JAPANESE OFFER LIMITED EXPERIENCE AND UNLIMITED DESIRE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When their fair-haired Australian captain barks the commands in
his native tongue, many of them don't understand a word. They are
racing in sailing's most visible and prestigious event against a
field of multifaceted sailors who have tasted success aboard
everything from dinghies to maxi-boats, yet several of them have
never trimmed a sail on anything other than an International
America's Cup Class yacht.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, before they signed on to be crew members aboard the two
Japanese boats representing the Nippon Challenge, most of them were
content in their landlocked jobs as truck drivers and, as they say
back home, salarymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, many of them have very, very little overall sailing
experience,'' Nippon's skipper, Peter Gilmour, said last week in a
telephone interview from Auckland, New Zealand. ``But the Japanese
people are fast learners.''
</P>
<P>
   They must be, for when the semifinal round of the Louis Vuitton
challengers trials begins next Sunday, the Nippon team will be one
of the six remaining squads squaring off to earn the right to face
Team New Zealand in next February's Cup finals. And many see Japan
as a serious threat to sideline its far more experienced
counterparts, including the Prada Challenge of Italy and America
One of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   How far Japan goes will depend largely on the vast skills of the
39-year-old Gilmour, who faces daily challenges _ like basic
communication _ beyond those of most cup skippers. ``I've lived in
Japan for a few years now so I have a casual understanding of the
language,'' he said. ``And I know all the sailing terms. So when
we're racing I speak English, they speak Japanese, and we all seem
to understand each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour acknowledged that his task had been eased by Japan's two
prior America's Cup appearances in 1992 and 1995, when it advanced
to the semifinals both times before being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The groundwork was done in previous campaigns,'' he said.
``We've added another 10 or 12 individuals to the group, but there
were already some good sailors on the team, even though they'd come
to it rather late in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour was the coach of the '95 team, which was fronted by the
mercurial New Zealander Chris Dickson. Married and the father of
three, Gilmour appears to bring a more stable presence to the
proceedings. As he pointed out, he and his wife, Christine, have
lived in Japan with their children for several years to meet cup
eligibility requirements, an experience he says he has relished.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour's home life may be settled, but on the race course he is
a fierce competitor. A leading skipper on the international
match-racing scene for several years, he burst onto the cup scene
in 1987 as a helmsman aboard Australia's defender Kookaburra, where
his reputation for aggression on the starting line began to
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   If Gilmour has a perceived weakness, it is his tendency to begin
events slowly, a pattern that repeated itself in the early rounds
of this campaign. The Japanese scratched out six victories in each
of the first two rounds before taking off in Round 3. Nippon's
eight victories in that round included a solid triumph over Prada,
one of only three losses for the Italians thus far.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gilmour said it was all part of a greater plan.
``I wouldn't draw too much from the round robins,'' he said. ``We
use them as a method of entry into the main part of the regatta,
which is the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention was always to use the slower of our two boats
early on, to see where we stood in the field. That was a conscious
decision we made in the beginning, because you tend to learn more
when you're racing from behind than you do when you're out front.
When things got going later on, we switched boats and had some
reasonable improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's first boat, Asura, was named after a Buddhist deity. The
second boat is called Idaten after a god of war renowned for its
brilliant speed. But will it be fast enough to propel Japan to a
Pacific Rim matchup with New Zealand in a cup final that would have
been unthinkable not very long ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see,'' Gilmour said. ``I do know
that the Japanese are very, very committed to winning the America's
Cup. At the same time, they realize the depth of effort that's
required. I get a sense that they're into it for the long haul, and
they won't give up until they're successful. They're patient,
hard-working people, and they'll just stick away at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour paused for a moment of contemplation. ``I just don't
know if it will play out that they're successful on my watch or
not.''

A LITTLE MIRACLE FOR CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a story of faith, hope, high-tech medical care, coping
with the unexpected, both kinds of luck and a one-week vacation
that turned into a four-month ordeal. Mostly, though, it's about
love.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, Jim and Steph anie Sadler of Phoenix flew to
New York to watch the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament. They were joined
by her parents, Richard and Doris Gurtler of Mesa, who were
celebrat ing their 40th wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie was 23 weeks pregnant with their first child.
Conceiving hadn't been easy. The couple spent three years and many
thousands of dollars on fertility treatments. They felt blessed by
the news that their first child was due on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   But that would soon change.
</P>
<P>
   Four days into the trip, she felt some cramping. The next day
her water broke, and she was admitted to Manhattan's Lenox Hill
Hospital, which has a state-of-the-art neonatal unit.
</P>
<P>
   For babies born at 24 weeks, the chance of death or serious
disabili ties is high, making every extra day in the womb critical.
Doctors did all they could to hold off contractions and delay
birth.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks in intensive care, Stephanie showed signs of
infection, and doctors decided to deliver the baby by Caesarean
section. Al though the survival rate is better at 26 weeks, the
risks remain large.
</P>
<P>
   In the operating room, Jim waited anxiously, eager for some sign
of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   He got it. Unlike most babies born that prematurely, who have
minimal lung function and go im mediately on respirators, this
little guy came out kicking and crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a fighter,'' Dr. Michael Giuliano announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, I felt a burst of joy impossible to
describe,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on their faith and mind ful of the story of the angel
sent by God to the Virgin Mary, they named him Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot of prayers into the pregnancy and the birth and
felt something miraculous had happened in our lives, too,'' Jim
said.
</P>
<P>
   Their struggle wasn't over, how ever. Like all preemies of that
age, Gabriel needed intensive care and was unable to travel. He
spent the next three months in Lenox Hill Hospital connected to
countless wires, monitors and IVs. He under went five brain scans,
seven spinal taps and seven blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bionic baby,'' they dubbed him.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie didn't leave New York, and Jim spent most of his time
there, too, setting up a temporary office in a room at the Marriott
Hotel, which learned of their situa tion and gave them a generous
discount.
</P>
<P>
   Jim, 35, and Stephanie, 34, met when they were students at
Arizona State University. A vice president with Comfort Systems USA
in Tempe, Jim said the baby's arrival motivated him to rebalance
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked 70 to 80 hours a week and traveled 100,000 miles a
year for the past 10 years. This experience has made me clearly
aware that my family matters most.''
</P>
<P>
   Their goal was to bring a healthy baby home by Christmas. As re
cently as two weeks ago, the chances didn't look good since Gabriel
came down with a viral infection. But it quickly cleared up, and
doctors said they could leave the next week, though not by plane
because of the changes in air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, they began a 55-hour Amtrak trip from New York to
Flagstaff. Stephanie's parents drove them the rest of the way home
Wednesday morning. Gabriel trav eled well with the assist of a
portable oxygen tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had done everything right during the pregnancy,
but when something like this happens, you realize you're not always
in control,'' Stephanie said. ``When I look into his face, I am so
grateful for what God has given us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sadlers spent a quiet Christ mas at home with family. Since
they hadn't much time for shopping and are facing some steep
medical bills, they didn't buy many presents this year, which seems
about right.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest gift they've ever hoped for _ all 5 pounds, 4
ounces of him now _ came early.

BEST, WORST OF NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We've barely passed the one-third mark of the
season, but in a league that allows 24 seconds to take a shot, it's
plenty of time to make snap judgments. Face it, most people
(analysts) determined some things (like Lamar Odom being rookie of
the year) in the first week.
</P>
<P>
   So let's figure out where some other players stand with a mere
50 games to change our opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Most valuable player: Shaquille O'Neal, Lakers. He started the
season getting criticized for poor free-throw shooting and losing
his temper. But today, he's in the top four in scoring, rebounding
and blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq would also be in the top three in minutes but for the two
games he was thrown out of.
</P>
<P>
   Most overrated player: Mitch Richmond, Washington. It's hard to
rip someone who has done so many good things for so long,
especially when you count Juwan Howard and Rod Strickland as
teammates. But after signing a huge new contract, a lot of people
in Washington's organization believe he has become much more
concerned about his own stats than helping the Wizards improve.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the Year: It's hard to go against Odom. Who else can
dish out seven assists and block seven shots like Odom did
Wednesday against Golden State?
</P>
<P>
   But he's in a dead-heat today with Houston's Steve Francis, who
is averaging 17 points and six assists while playing the game's
toughestposition, point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Worst Rookie of the Year: Frederic Weis, New York. While the
Knicks wanted frontcourt help, Weis wanted to play for his French
team, Limoges.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year: Danny Ainge, Phoenix. If you don't think
dealing with Penny Hardaway can ruin careers, just ask Ainge and
Chuck Daly.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge was getting tired of a lot of things with the Suns and
wanted to return to a normal existence. The weekend after he quit,
he attended his son's high school basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   That beats dealing with Hardaway any day.
</P>
<P>
   Worst contract of the decade: Cleveland Cavaliers. It's hard to
believe, but this is final year of the 10-year deal the Cavs
foolishly gave to Danny Ferry. Besides a solid decade of mediocre
play, the contract has also ruined Cleveland's salary-cap
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Chalupas chit-chat: Seattle guard Brent Barry and Minnesota
coach Flip Saunders had a little get-together before the teams
played this week about comments Saunders made when the teams met on
Dec. 8 in Key Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Barry hit a late 3-pointer that gave the Sonics enough points
(110) for fans to enjoy free Taco Bell chalupas. Saunders took
offense afterward to the alleged running up of the score, telling
reporters that Barry's shot was
</P>
<P>
   The personal attack angered Brent, who had apologized to the
Timberwolves after the game. Barry anticipated a similar apology
from Saunders.
</P>
<P>
   But Saunders denied making the comments despite confirmation
from two Minnesota writers to whom Saunders made the statement.
Barry said he was disappointed that Saunders did not apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Double talk: When asked before Wednesday night's game against
the Knicks why he had chosen to re-sign with Toronto this season,
Raptors forward Charles Oakley had a simple answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because no one else could guarantee me a championship,'' said
Oakley, who talked with the Lakers and the Knicks as a free-agent
in the summer. ``It wasn't about money.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh?

   Knockout trip: Last weekend, the Utah Jazz played Indiana with
boxing legend Muhammad Ali sitting at center court of Conseco
Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. The team then spent a few days at the
swanky Coconut Grove, Fla., hotel with Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   The pudgy looking former heavyweight champ took time to pose for
pictures and spent several minutes talking to Jazz star Karl
Malone.

   No punch: Sacramento's backcourt of Jason Williams and Nick
Anderson was recently outscored 111-12 in back-to-back games. Worse
for Anderson, he went scoreless in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has gone scoreless in four games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Another opinion: Atlanta center Dikembe Mutombo was one of the
few athletes in Atlanta who didn't read the controversial Sports
Illustrated article in which Braves pitcher John Rocker virtually
destroyed his relationship with other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I hear, I don't like it. I always say, I may forgive
you, but I will not forget,'' Mutombo said.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo said it was ironic that he is paid by the same owner
(Ted Turner) as Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strange world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonehead play of the week: The Bulls' Kornel David, who is
Hungarian, showed that he has some things to learn in the NBA, or
maybe just about plain, simple basketball.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bulls trailing Philadelphia by three points, David
received an inbounds pass from Ron Artest with 7.1 seconds
remaining and shot an off-balance 25-foot air ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very poor decision at the end of the game, in terms
of our shot selection and awareness of time on the clock,'' Bulls
coach Tim Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was obvious. Even a dead man could see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Here come the Knicks: Patrick Ewing may be a pompous pain for
coach Jeff Van Gundy at times, but the Knicks are 6-1 since he
returned from injury.

KOREANS SEE DARK SCENARIO IN A U.S. PRECAUTION _ GAS MASKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS name spellings in 5th, 7th   and 24th grafs) 
 (DW) 
 By CALVIN SIMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Ever since war divided the Korean peninsula
in 1953, residents of this bustling capital city, 30 miles from the
demilitarized zone, have lived with the threat that Communist
troops from North Korea could storm the border at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite doomsday scenarios that North Korea would attack this
city of 10 million people with every imaginable weapon, including
chemical and biological agents, few residents have taken such dire
predictions seriously, and for seemingly good reason.
</P>
<P>
   About half a million South Korean soldiers are guarding the
border, backed up by 37,000 American servicemen and some of the
most sophisticated military technology available. Recently, North
Korea has seemed more interested in diplomacy than making war.
</P>
<P>
   But a decision by the U.S. military in November to distribute
14,000 protective gas masks to dependents of American soldiers and
embassy staff members living in Seoul has raised concerns here that
despite its new diplomatic tone, North Korea is planning a major
assault that will include chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard that the United States was issuing gas
masks to its citizens in Seoul, I was deeply troubled because our
government has no plans to do the same,'' said Lee Shin Bom,
chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the opposition Grand
National Party. ``I asked myself what does the United States know
that our government isn't telling us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States says that the decision is not tied to
any increased threat or impending attack by North Korea, rumors
have spread across Seoul that an assault is imminent and is likely
to occur sometime near the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid,'' said Kim Yong Shik, a taxi driver who was
waiting for a fare near the U.S. military base at Yongsan. ``None
of us have gas masks like the Americans. We are like sitting
ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korean and U.S. military intelligence officials said in
recent interviews that North Korea had large stocks of chemical
weapons and missiles and artillery shells to carry those weapons to
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Should chemical warfare be used against an unprotected civilian
population in Seoul, enormous casualties would result, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of North Korea's chemical warfare capability vary
widely. A South Korean defense ministry report issued in October
estimated that North Korea's chemical and biological arsenal was
2,500 to 5,000 tons, including nerve gas, blistering agents and
anthrax. The ministry's latest figures were a fivefold increase
over last year's, which the ministry said were grossly
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials said that equipping the public with
protective masks could reduce the number of civilian casualties and
injuries to about one-tenth.
</P>
<P>
   But very few residents of Seoul own gas masks, and neither the
state nor local governments have plans to distribute them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are recommending that individual citizens purchase their
own gas masks to guard against an attack of chemical and biological
warfare from North Korea,'' said Chun Jung Soo, head of the gas
mask distribution team at Seoul City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't started any massive campaigns yet because this
would obviously lead to a panic among Seoul citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Chun said that although residents could buy gas masks from a
booth at City Hall or at retail outlets for about $25, sales were
low because most Koreans ``don't believe that a war will actually
break out.''
</P>
<P>
   Seoul city government plans to distribute about 1.7 million gas
masks over the next 10 years to civilian defense squad leaders,
volunteers who supervise neighborhood evacuations in the event of
an attack or other emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The city government said that it had distributed about 300,000
masks to defense squad leaders and that recent surveys indicated
that about 200,000 Seoul residents had bought gas masks on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Chun said the city government hoped that the U.S. military's gas
mask program would increase awareness among South Koreans of the
importance of masks.
</P>
<P>
   Col. David R. Apt, public affairs officer for the U.S. Forces
Korea, said that distributing gas masks to dependents of military
personnel was part of the Pentagon's effort to improve protection
of noncombatants stationed overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the ability to provide your dependents with this
protection, you'd be negligent not to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military is issuing M-17A2 masks and hood systems,
which are used by many active duty forces around the world to
protect against chemical warfare. It is the first time that such
protection is being provided for noncombatants in South Korea,
which is a test case for other U.S. military installations.
</P>
<P>
   Apt emphasized that the plan was not related to any specific
event and had been in the works for more than a year. He said that
the United States had deliberately delayed distribution of the
masks until November, when relations between North Korea and the
rest of the world seemed to be improving.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, North Korea has engaged in talks with officials
from the United States, Japan and Europe in what appears to be an
effort to improve its foreign relations, after decades of isolation
and hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo Suk Ryul, a defense expert for the Korea Institute for
Foreign Affairs and National Security, said that North Korea's vast
arsenal of chemical weapons posed a great threat that should not be
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo said that since foreign governments had already persuaded
North Korea to abandon its nuclear and long-range missile programs
in exchange for concessions, chemical weapons were now likely to
become the major issue in dealing with the Stalinist country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North has plenty of weapons, and if they decided to use
them, many South Korean people would be sacrificed,'' Yoo said.
``The bottom line is that everyone needs to be prepared to use a
gas mask.''

KANSAS CITY TOWN HOME FIRE KILLS MOTHER, CHILD; INJURES HER OTHER
TWO CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH and JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Tragedy marred a sunny Christmas morning when
a fire in an east Kansas City town home killed a mother and child
and critically injured two other children.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Russell, 27, and her 1-year-old son, Gavin Russell, died
in the blaze, Fire Department spokesman Brad Humston said.
</P>
<P>
   Injured were two other children of Russell's, 3-year-old Gabriel
Benson and Garrett Russell, 6 or 7.
</P>
<P>
   The two injured children suffered severe burns and smoke
inhalation. They were listed as critical Saturday night at
Children's Mercy Hospital, Humston said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, firefighters and emergency medical personnel wept at
the scene, and neighbors held a short, impromptu prayer service
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Kellee Wallace, a neighbor, cried as she received a comforting
hug from her 11-year-old daughter, Cadela Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly sad,'' Wallace said. ``This is Christmas Day. I
don't feel like celebrating any more. It doesn't feel like
Christmas any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire was in a two-story, three-bedroom town home at 2013
Park Tower Drive in the Blue Valley Court development. Humston said
that the mother and the dead child were in one bedroom and that the
two injured children were in a second bedroom. Both bedrooms were
on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us have kids of our own,'' Humston said. ``It's at
times like this that we see how vulnerable they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Humston said that the fire was under investigation late Saturday
and that officials did not expect to release information about the
cause until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was reported at 9:43 a.m. Firefighters arrived within
two minutes and the injured children were removed from the burning
building in less than five minutes, Humston said. The fire was
under control in about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said she feared the worst when firefighters pulled off
the front door of the town home and smoke and flames shot out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying desperately to get in there,'' she said.
``They did a wonderful job.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Harris, a next-door neighbor, said she and her two sons
ran from their home when the fire set off her smoke detector. Once
outside, she heard someone inside the burning apartment banging on
a bedroom window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very, very scared,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said she had taken her trash out at 1:30 a.m. Saturday
and had seen Russell and the three children playing with Christmas
gifts inside their town home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe it could happen that fast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Stemmons, who lives nearby, said she was preparing for a
typical Christmas Day when she looked outside and saw the blaze
ravaging the front of the victim's unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole doorway was just engulfed in flames,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stemmons summoned help, just as the Fire Department began
receiving calls about the blaze. Soon she learned there might be
two fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts me,'' said Stemmons, her voice shaking slightly. ``I
have a daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Rogers, a Kansas City animal-control officer who lives
nearby, said he saw smoke pouring from the burning building as he
was driving home about 9:45 a.m. Rogers said he then looked through
a window of the town home and saw a burning Christmas tree in the
front room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went round back and broke out a back patio window,'' Rogers
said. ``Smoke shot out and I couldn't see anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he reported the fire on his dispatch radio and tried
to get in the front door, but was unable because the door was too
hot.
</P>
<P>
   James Simmons, who manages the town homes for a property
management company, said Angela Russell was a hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very nice lady,'' Simmons said. ``She worked hard to
make a better life for herself and her children.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Tim Richardson, fighting back tears, said the blaze was
an especially tragic blow to a neighborhood that had been combating
crime and drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is such a thing, maybe the one good thing that will
come of this is it will bring the neighborhood closer together,''
Richardson said. ``We want to make sure everybody understands
they're not isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances of the fire victims were so distraught that aid
workers could not immediately talk with them, said Bill Miles, a
volunteer with the American Red Cross, Kansas City chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very depressed; they were crying; they've been holding
hands; you could hardly get anything out of them,'' said Miles, who
arrived not long after firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Miles was able to speak with some of the area residents
and offer them assistance in finding emergency living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel just as bad as they do,'' said Miles, of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the family of Angela Russell, three other families in
adjacent living units were forced out of their homes. Humston said
15 persons were affected.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross, which sent five volunteers to the scene, will
make sure families have a place to go.
</P>
<P>
   Humston said Russell's town home had an estimated $60,000 worth
of structural damage and $20,000 in damage to contents. A
neighboring town home had an estimated $10,000 in structural damage
and $3,000 worth of damage to contents. Another neighboring unit
had an estimated $3,000 worth of smoke damage to contents.
</P>
<P>
   Humston told neighbors at the scene that they should formulate
an evacuation plan in case of fire. A firefighter distributed
literature on the subject, and a battalion chief demonstrated
evacuation techniques to residents of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Similar information may be obtained from the Internet by logging
onto www.kcmo.org/fire and then clicking on ``Safety Information''
and ``Exit Drills In The Home.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Troy Nash visited the scene and offered moral
support to residents and firefighters. He said he wanted to work
with the Fire Department to make sure that every home in Kansas
City had smoke detectors and that residents became familiar with
fire evacuation strategies.
</P>
<P>
   While the fire turned Christmas into a tragic occasion, neighbor
Wallace said such a calamity ``makes you thankful for everything
you've got. Never take anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said she was going to begin working with her children on
a fire evacuation plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to happen to my family.''

   LASCHOOL-BOARD (Los Angeles) -- In the six months since a reform
slate took over the Los angeles Board of Education, the nation's
second-largest district has been partially disassembled and lays in
chaos. By Greg Gittrich (Will move on the ``n'' California and
``a'' national news wire.)
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER-GIFTS (Los Angeles) -- As her students squirmed through
the last few hours before winter break, teacher Gaby Calzadillas
examined her loot. Random tokens of her students' affection lay
heaped on her desk at Fenton Avenue Charter School. Body gel. A
wooden picture frame. A Pokemon card. One large bear. ``Oh, how
cute -- look, it's got `1999' on its paw!'' Calzadillas said. The
gifts may not always make sense, but the tradition of showering
presents upon teachers during the holiday season remains strong. By
David Baker (Will move on the ``n'' California and ``a'' national

</P>
<P>
   KWANZA-HOLIDAY (Los Angeles) -- Emphasizing family, community
and culture, the seven-day Kwanzaa celebration that begins today
leads African-Americans through a deeply reflective week where
family and philosophy overshadow presents. The few gifts that grace
the traditional Kwanzaa table in celebrants' homes are highly
symbolic: books and heritage symbols showing appreciation for
ancient African culture. Karenga founded the celebration in 1966 as
a black studies professor at California State University, Long
Beach. The festival has grown in popularity and is now celebrated
by more than 28 million people around the world. By Jesse Hiestand
(Will move on the ``n'' California and ``a'' national news wire.)
</P>
<P>
   NEWLAWS-CALIFORNIA -(SACRAMENTO) -- If any proof is needed of
the impending millennium, Californians only need to look at a host
of new traffic laws that will take effect in the Golden State on
Jan. 1. The most telling signal of a new century is a ban on that
old-fashioned tradition of drivers using their hands and arms
instead of blinkers to alert others before making a turn. More
changes on the horizon: bicycle signals on some traffic lights,
seat belts on farm vehicles, and street-legal electric scooters
that look like skateboards with handle bars. By Terri Hardy (Will

   FOUND-WOMAN (Los Angeles) -- Jolene Rae Donohue of Santa Clarita
was in serious but stable condition at Holy Cross Medical Center a

PHOENIX AREA HOMES VULNERABLE TO CRACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BETTY BEARD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - As the Phoenix area building boom restlessly stretches
toward the fringes, it is moving onto poorer soils and leaving
thousands of newer homes vulnerable to excessive cracks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some homes have already come apart and had to be partially
rebuilt or abandoned because builders didn't realize how
destructive these soils can be.
</P>
<P>
   These fine-grained clays get gummy and greatly expand when wet,
exert ing enough pressure to pick up a car or move a house
foundation an inch or two, cracking the walls and floors.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks have become more common, especially where flat expanses
of farmland have been plowed into neighborhoods. Many became no
ticeable after the heavy rains of early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And although local standards, codes and inspections are supposed
to reduce damage from these soils, the fact that even new homes in
the Phoenix area are cracking shows the system isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been approving just about anything that comes across
their desk with a stamp on it,'' said Carl Josephson, a Scottsdale
structural engineer. ``It's all a shared responsi bility to be
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Expansive soils are so spotty that Michael Goldwater, director
of the Registrar of Contractors, believes a soils test should be
done for every house lot.
</P>
<P>
   He said most builders now take precautions when building on
these soils. But he also acknowledged, ``lots of contractors try to
cut corners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They may do soils tests but only five holes for 600 houses. .
. . We get quite a few that don't go the extra yard,'' Goldwater
said.
</P>
<P>
   There's such a bad crack in the foundation of Gail Mitchell's
north east Gilbert home that her kitchen floor is split open as if
someone slashed the heart of her home with a dagger.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the street, an inch-wide gash has scarred the front
of another home. Over the past two years, cracks have turned up in
every house in the cul-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worrying us to death,'' Mitchell said. ``How would I ever
resell this house?''
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't appear to be current maps showing where the
expansive clay soils are because engineers turn up new problems all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   But some areas they have mentioned include Fountain Hills,
Gilbert, Chandler, southeast Mesa, Tucson, Flagstaff, Avondale,
Goodyear, Tolle son, Maryvale and some other parts of west Phoenix,
Scottsdale, Tempe and the Navajo Indian Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're becoming more of a prob lem because all the good sites
that didn't have expansive soil are al ready built on,'' said
Prescott geo technical engineer Glen Copeland. ``We're now getting
to areas where clay soils predominate. That's a fairly recent
occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   The same thing is happening nation ally. The American Society of
Civil Engineers estimates that half of the homes in the country are
built on expansive soils and half of those will have some damage.
The group claims these soils are responsible for more home damage
every year than floods, tornadoes and hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Not every crack in a house is a sign of expansive soils. It's
normal for houses to settle, and hairline cracks are common,
especially in homes with cathedral ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers who have examined homes in the Phoenix area say that
80 to 90 percent of cracks are cosmetic, whether caused by
expansive soils, old garbage pits, improperly com pacted fill,
green lumber, badly taped drywall or something else.
</P>
<P>
   The rest are structural, meaning major repairs may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   What makes expansive soils espe cially ominous is their
unpredict ability. They swell and shrink repeatedly through wet and
dry seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Only six months after Lety Haynes moved into her northwest
Gilbert home on Halloween 1996, the front door wouldn't open.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, cracks began appearing and then gaps. Walls began
separating from each other and from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's too embarrassed to let anyone see her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no inclination to decorate,'' Haynes said. ``All I can
think of is when can I get out. . . . It's so depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Josephson, the structural engineer, said parts of Haynes'
foundation need to be sawed out, replaced and reinforced. He
doesn't know the cost yet.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of 28 Gilbert homeowners who have sued their
builders, Trend Homes and Shea Homes (formerly UDC Homes), over
excessive cracks. Both companies have denied negli gence and say
they're willing to fix problems. The suits are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Joyce Kapsal, who filed both suits, said the problems
seem to occur with a variety of builders.
</P>
<P>
   She said filing lawsuits is often the only way to get builders
to respond because their insurance carriers balk at paying money.
</P>
<P>
   As the lawsuits show, there is a lot of finger pointing, with
builders, sub contractors, inspectors and home owners blaming each
other.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best solutions to living with expansive soils appears
to be widely ignored: keeping them dry. It's imperative that any
structure built on expansive soils be designed to keep water away
from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Gibbons, president of Con struction Inspection and Testing,
said many builders don't know about the soils. And if they do, they
fail to pass on recommendations to buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an education problem that everyone needs to be
aware of,'' Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   The company does the bulk of the residential soils testing in
the Phoe nix and has been named in both lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said most cities and lenders require soils tests before
subdivisions can be built.
</P>
<P>
   Before Haynes' 25-acre subdivision in Gilbert was built, CIT
took six borings and found expansive soil. It recommended that
foundations be reinforced, lots be graded to drain away, and
recommended against ov ercompacting the existing soils, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be essential to prevent moisture from infiltrating
beneath the footings and slabs,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the house was built and cracks developed, an
independent study done by Copeland, of Prescott, hinted at
negligence by both builders and owners. He found that the floor
slabs were built three months after the pads were built, which
could cause them to dry out too much unless they were wet down. He
also determined that some of the perime ter footings were too
light.
</P>
<P>
   Also, drainage holes that are sup posed to drain water from the
side yards were either clogged or the ground wasn't graded right to
let them drain. These openings are normally put at the bottom of
block fences.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons also said city inspectors share in the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``City engineers don't make sure homeowners don't alter their
drain age. City inspectors don't come out to make sure that
happens. That's a weak spot in the industry. We try to make sure
builders are educated so homeowners know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert inspectors check the average new home under construction
seven or eight times before a buyer moves in.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray Patten, Gilbert's director of building and code
enforcement, con ceded that homes are often inspected before lots
are landscaped, which can result in poor drainage away from homes.
</P>
<P>
   Patten didn't even know about the 28 cracked homes in Gilbert.
He said he was aware of only two homes in the city with bad cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Josephson said that there are better foundations that can
alleviate a lot of problems with expansive soils but that cities
don't seem to know about them.
</P>
<P>
   But homeowners also have to make sure that landscapers and pool
com panies don't alter drainage.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Satterfield, president of Shea Homes Arizona, said: ``We
have found no matter how much we talk about it that unfortunately,
people alter their grades and drainage, either with mounds or pools
and end up with water around their founda tions. It's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about it during the escrow period and the walkthrough.
It's in a home-buyer video and warranty manual.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution that's been known since the late 1960s _
post-tension foun dations _ have just become more widespread in the
Phoenix area over the past three years for homes. Del Webb Corp.,
Shea and Trend are among the builders offering them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely gained momentum, really, in the last year,''
said Jim Rogers, Arizona division manager of Suncoast Post-Tension,
a Houston-based company that builds these slabs throughout the
country. He said builders started taking notice after Del Webb
began building them at Anthem and Sun City Grand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reinforcing concrete with rebar, builders put cables
in the concrete. As it sets, workers stretch the cables to help
hold the concrete together. These foundations have been used in
Texas for about 30 years, are widespread among newer homes in
Tucson and are now spreading to Denver and Phoenix, said Rogers and
Gerard McGuire, executive director of the Post Ten sioning
Institute in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Porter, president of Trend Homes said, ``I think the whole
building industry is moving toward that.''
</P>
<P>
   But those steps don't help homeown ers who have already seen
their dream homes tainted by cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Berk, a Scottsdale attorney, once handled a case for a
California couple who spent $200,000 for a house in Gilbert's Val
Vista Lakes development, which is known for lush landscaping around
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 house began moving and cracking so much that cabinets
be gan separating. Soil experts later confirmed that the builder
didn't follow recommended procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The owners never were able to move in, and the suit was
dismissed earlier this year because of a separate procedural issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just fell apart in front of their eyes,'' Berk said. ``It
sits vacant to this day.'' &QL;

STATE'S 2000 SLATE OF REGULATIONS KEYS ON TRANSPORTATION SAFETY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- If any proof is needed of the impending
millennium, Californians only need to look at a host of new traffic
laws that will take effect in the Golden State on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling signal of a new century is a ban on that
old-fashioned tradition of drivers using their hands and arms
instead of blinkers to alert others before making a turn.
</P>
<P>
   More changes on the horizon: bicycle signals on some traffic
lights, seat belts on farm vehicles, and street-legal electric
scooters that look like skateboards with handle bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to clean up some laws. And, it was time to look at
alternative ways to get from one place to another,'' said Sen.
Betty Karnette, D-Long Beach, who chairs the Senate Transportation
Committee. ``When you go to a dinner party and people spend an hour
talking about transportation, you know it's a high priority.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1999 legislative session, state lawmakers enacted
more than 1,000 bills, most of them becoming effective on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, more than 175 were changes to the Vehicle Code. A
spokeswoman for the Automobile Club of Southern California said
legislation this year reflects motorists' concern about increasing
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people's commutes get longer and longer, there is more
discussion about how to tackle the problem,'' said Auto Club
spokeswoman Marie Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Among the several new bills which legalize and regulate the use
of electric scooters, the Legislature declared that ``it is of
paramount import to find ways to reduce the state's severe traffic
congestions and air pollution problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers agreed to promote the use of low-emission or
no-emission vehicles, such as the scooter, said Traci Perry, chief
of staff for Sen. Wes Chesbro, D-Santa Rosa, the author of SB 441.
</P>
<P>
   Described as a skateboard with handlebars, the scooters are
capable of reaching speeds of up to 15 mph. Used extensively in
Pacific Rim countries and Europe, the scooters are perfect for
residents of small cities or college commuters, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make it easier for folks to get out of their cars
and into an alternative form of transportation that's fun and
cheap,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   New statutes require the scooters' riders to wear helmets and be
at least 16, but they do not need to have a driver's license or buy
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Jan. 1, drivers of electric cars can cruise in the
state's car-pool lanes at any time with no minimum number of
passengers required. Qualifying cars must show a special decal,
which will be distributed through the Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Cities will now be able to make way for bicyclists under new law
AB 134. Designed after a pilot program in the college town of
Davis, the law authorized the installation of special traffic
signals at intersections in areas with large concentrations of
cyclists.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to move bicycles more safely through the
intersection, the law provides for their own red, yellow and green
signal. The pilot program in Davis successfully reduced the number
of bicycle-related crashes, according to a legislative analysis of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Safety was the impetus for much of the new traffic legislation,
including the law prohibiting signaling turns by hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young drivers don't even know what those signals mean
anymore,'' Karnette said.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers of vehicles without turn signals or with turn signals
that don't work may still use their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature, after years of debate, pushed through a bill
this year that will require seat belts on school buses manufactured
after Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   And it went further, mandating seat belts on farm vehicles by
May 1, 2000. It was an idea few had seriously considered until 13
agriculture workers died in a crash near Fresno, said Assemblyman
Dean Florez, D-Bakersfield, the author of AB 1165.
</P>
<P>
   With the push for safer roadways, stiffer penalties will face
some drivers in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers under 21 can have their licenses immediately suspended
if they are stopped and found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.01
percent, a change from the current 0.05 level.
</P>
<P>
   Other amendments clarify that passengers in a vehicle are also
prohibited from drinking or possessing open containers of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The new laws also establish a base fine of $100 for a driver's
first railroad grade-crossing offense. The penalty increases to
$200 and $250 for the second and third offenses.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RULES OF THE ROAD
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other changes in California laws affecting roads,
traffic and vehicles that will go into effect on Jan. 1. Each is
identified by the Senate or Assembly bill containing the new
provision and the lawmaker who sponsored it:
</P>
<P>
   AB 1121 (Assemblyman George Nakano, D-Torrance) -- Reduces the
vehicle license fee by an additional 10 percent, for a total
reduction since 1998 of 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   SB 171 (Sen. Martha M. Escutia, D-Montebello) -- Sets up a pilot
low-cost auto insurance program in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   SB 1296 (Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles) -- Prohibits an
automobile insurance or homeowner insurance company from refusing
to renew a policy solely because of a pending claim.
</P>
<P>
   SB 681 (Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Daly City) -- Allows a motorist
involved in an auto crash resulting only in damage to property to
move the vehicle to a safe location off the main lanes of the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   SB 63 (Sen. Hilda L. Solis, D-El Monte) -- Reduces the minimum
occupancy requirements for vehicles using the diamond lanes on the
San Bernardino Freeway from three people to two.
</P>
<P>
   SCR 17 (Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Pasadena) -- Designates the
interchange of the Golden State and Ventura freeways as the ``Gene
Autry Memorial Interchange.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LAWS OF THE LAND
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other new laws that will take effect Jan. 1,
including the number of the Senate or Assembly bill that embodied
the change and the legislator who sponsored it:
</P>
<P>
   AB 60 (Assemblyman Wally Knox, D-Los Angeles) --Restores daily
overtime pay after eight hours on the job.
</P>
<P>
   SB 15 (Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles) -- Outlaws the
manufacture, sale and transfer of handguns that fail to met
rigorous safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   AB 26 (Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco) -- Creates
a statewide domestic partnership registration for homosexual
couples and heterosexual couples over age 62.
</P>
<P>
   AB 55 (Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco) -- Requires
health plans to let patients seek an independent medical review
when services are denied or delayed.
</P>
<P>
   AB 531 (Assemblywoman Nell Soto, D-Ontario) -- Requires service
stations to offer free air and water to customers
</P>
<P>
   AB 1355 (Assemblywoman Sally Havice, D-Artesia) -- Creates a new
environmental conservancy for the watersheds of the lower Los
Angeles and San Gabriel rivers.

IVORY COAST COUP DRAWS FRENCH RESPONSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 6th graf and replaces 8th graf with updated information) 
 (lb) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PARIS _ In the wake of a coup in Ivory Coast, France said
Saturday that it was sending small numbers of troops to the country
_ its former colony _ to protect the deposed president and to
evacuate roughly 20,000 French nationals should that become
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But Agence France-Presse reported Saturday night that Ivory
Coast's new ruler was refusing entry to the soldiers, saying their
presence could ``lead to a blood bath.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Abidjan, the country's largest city, warned
American citizens there to lock themselves in their homes. It said
looters were rampaging through the wealthy neighborhoods where
foreigners live, but seemed to be attacking only vehicles parked
outside.
</P>
<P>
   France has about 550 troops in a garrison where ousted President
Henri Konan Bedie was reported to have taken sanctuary from the
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Reports said 40 more soldiers were ready to arrive by helicopter
from Libreville, Gabon. A further 300 French soldiers were reported
ready to fly in from Dakar, the capital of Senegal, if needed. At
the moment there is no apparent threat to French residents of Ivory
Coast, but there has been looting and gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Armed soldiers have been joy-rid- ing in stolen cars and taxis
for two days, and have used their rifles and hand grenades to blow
open the doors of downtown shops in the city of 3 million people.
Saturday, orders were broadcast over the radio telling all soldiers
to report to their units by Saturday evening and to turn in all
civilian vehicles at the central barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Paris has condemned the coup and granted protection to Bedie.
Agence France-Presse quoted a French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman,
Anne Gazeau-Secret, as saying that Bedie, at his request, was at
the Port-Bouet military base next to the Abidjan airport, under the
protection of the French 43rd Marine Infantry Battalion.
</P>
<P>
   General Robert Guei, the coup leader, former armed forces chief,
had earlier said that Bedie should leave the country quickly
because young officers who began the coup wanted to kill him.
Saturday night, he amended that, saying a nine-man national
steering commit- tee _ all military men _ would meet Sunday to
decide whether the for- mer president could leave. He has already
stipulated that Bedie's Cabinet, many of whom are in the hands of
mutineers, will stay.
</P>
<P>
   The French government, which years ago gave up trying to control
the affairs of its former colonies, has not demanded a restoration
of Bedie to power. Instead, it has called for the immediate
re-establishment of order and security. News reports here were
sketchy because it was Christmas Day and the coup caught almost
everyone by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast has long been an island of relative stability and
prosperity in the former French colonies. It is the world's biggest
supplier of cocoa, and it produces palm oil and other tropical
products. Many French sun-worshippers interested in vacationing in
Africa head first for Abidjan and use it as a jumping-off spot for
poorer countries. There are regular Air France and Air Afrique
flights. The new military leaders said Abidjan airport, closed by
the coup, would reopen on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Abidjan, the commercial capital, looks in some ways like a
French city; it has the same black-and-white arrow-shaped signs,
traffic circles and red-and-white stone road markers. There are
luxury hotels, nightclubs and restaurants, and the same stores and
brands that are in France can be seen there.
</P>
<P>
   Its government has been stable compared with those of other
former colonies like Congo, Madagascar or the Comoro Islands. As a
supplier of tropical products that cannot be grown farther north,
Ivory Coast has become an important part of the French economy.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, France had a much more interventionist policy in
Africa than Britain, Portugal or other former colonial powers did.
It diplomatically embraced rulers that it approved of, but it also
was ready to send troops _ often the Foreign Legion _ to prop up or
restore presidents it favored.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, that contributed to more stable rule in former
French colonies than existed in Portuguese or Belgian ones. But in
other ways, it contributed to resentment of rulers, who were
perceived as puppets of France.
</P>
<P>
   In Abidjan on Saturday, the leader of the new ruling junta,
Guei, imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew after two nights of looting and
sporadic gunfire in some districts. He warned that violators would
be shot.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Abidjan were reported empty Saturday. Its stores
had been closed for 48 hours, but a curfew on Friday night did not
stop looting. The French radio reported a small skirmish between
Ivorian soldiers and French gendarmes, but the details were
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie was overthrown on Friday when Guei, a former armed-forces
chief, took the reins of power after troops mutinied. He set up a
10-man junta and urged politicians of the governing Democratic
Party and the opposition to engage in what he called consultations
to form a government of national unity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Agence France-Presse quoted military experts as saying that the
reinforcement of French troops in the region was aimed at securing
Abidjan's airport in case it was necessary to evacuate foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The French regional deployment comes with the risk of
destabilization of one of the pillars of Paris' influence in West
Africa. Officials said Saturday that warnings of caution had been
repeated regularly to French nationals in Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between France and the country, which was long seen as
a model African democracy and a relative economic powerhouse, have
deteriorated in the last few months because of differences between
Bedie and Alassane Ouattara, a former prime minister and deputy
director of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara, seen as a serious challenger to the long rule of the
Democratic Party, had sought to take on Bedie in elections next
year, but the president's government barred him from running, on
grounds that his parents were not Ivorians. This tactic of
excluding rivals from elections has become common in Africa in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Some French press comment on Saturday was equally severe with
regard both to Bedie and to France's approach to its former colony.
For the center-left newspaper Liberation, the tardy French reaction
to the deteriorating political situation was ``a triple failure in
political, military and diplomatic terms.''

SOUTH CAROLINA CONFRONTS PROBLEM OF URBAN SPRAWL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Pa., Ga., Fla., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By LYN RIDDLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Just outside this city of 60,000 lie huge
stretches of subdivisions where a few years ago cattle grazed or
loblolly pines grew wild, reflecting a pattern of sprawl around
midsized cities that has led state leaders to call for more control
on development and greater attempts to preserve open space.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hodges, the governor of South Carolina, has agreed to take
part in a conference scheduled here for March 26 to 28 on how
sprawl affects the state. The organizers hope to bring together a
disparate group, some of whom are usually on opposing sides _ such
as home builders and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   It is a discussion that many call long overdue, but one that is
touchy in a state that has swept forcefully out of economic
doldrums with some $28 billion in industrial construction since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we have to do is identify sprawl as a
problem,'' said Kit Smith, a Richland County councilwoman who has
pushed for land-use planning in her county, which includes
Columbia, the state capital. ``There is such a dichotomy in this
state of rural and growth areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressures of development vs. preservation are being felt
elsewhere in the country as well. A study released earlier this
month by the federal Department of Agriculture showed that 16
million acres of the nation's farmland, forests and open space had
been developed from 1992 to 1997. And six of the 10 states that
gobbled up most of the open space were in the South.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina ranked ninth with 539,700 acres, more than double
the annual conversion rate of the previous 10 years. Texas was No.
1; Pennsylvania, No. 2; Georgia, No. 3, Florida, No. 4, and
California, No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one of the most wasteful states in the nation in terms
of land,'' said Dana Beach, director of the nonprofit South
Carolina Coastal Conservation League, based in Charleston, which
researches and promotes coastal preservation.
</P>
<P>
   But, said John Cone, director of the Homebuilders Association of
South Carolina, ``the fact is we still have huge, huge, huge
amounts of open space in the state.'' For example, he said, the
Agriculture Department found that the amount of farmland had
remained the same over the five-year period its report covered.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 13 percent of this state, generally considered to be
rural and agricultural, has been developed, the agriculture
agency's study showed. But that pales in comparison with highly
developed industrial states such as New Jersey, with 41 percent of
the land mass developed, or Massachusetts, with 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The state's primary growth areas surround its biggest cities _
Charleston near the coast, Columbia in the central section and
Greenville in the northwest, near the Blue Ridge Mountains. Myrtle
Beach, a vacation resort area along the state's northern Atlantic
coast, has seen tremendous growth as well, primarily in hotels and
second-home resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent growth spot has been York County, just south
of fast-growing Charlotte, N.C. But York County, planners say, has
jumped ahead of other areas in recognizing they are losing their
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Its County Council created York County Forever, a commission
designed to protect one acre of land for every acre developed. The
goal is 10,000 acres in five years. The county set aside $357,000
for this year, the commission's first, to buy land and to pay for
conservation easements in key areas _ riverfronts, farmland and
open space.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Ferguson, the chairman of the commission, said the group
soon will have executed deals on 3,500 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for our county to retain its character,'' Mrs.
Ferguson said. ``Southerners have a real affinity for the land.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greenville, 1,018 subdivisions with 28,543 homes have been
approved for construction in the last nine years, according to the
Greenville County Planning Commission. The growth pattern here
mimics the pattern that changed the nation's urban centers decades
earlier, with the first subdivisions ringing the central city and
then, as the houses aged and more people moved in, developers moved
farther out.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60,000 people moved into this county in the last decade,
pushing the population to about 380,000, while the population of
the city of Greenville remained virtually the same, planning
commission records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numberwise, we are the fastest growing county in South
Carolina,'' said David Montgomery, the economic demographics
planner for the planning commission.
</P>
<P>
   F. James Forbes, director of the Greenville County Planning
Commission, said the county was trying to steer developers toward
urban centers, rather than outlying areas, without much success so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Home builders, especially national companies, have gravitated
toward the southern part of the county, which has no zoning. The
only approval needed there is by the planning commission, which
must make sure the infrastructure can handle development.
</P>
<P>
   Only about half of Greenville County is zoned, while some
high-growth counties such as Cherokee, along Interstate 85, the
busy link between Charlotte and Atlanta, have no zoning at all.
But, said Cone of the home builders' group, as public officials
develop regulations they must remember that the market is what
drives the developers' business.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have decided they want to have a little piece of land
with grass and trees and a couple of cars,'' he said. ``That's the
way the South is.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Sprawl has brought South Carolina's governments big-city
problems, Ms. Smith said, such as traffic, water pollution and
budgets spread thin to provide police, school, sewer and water
service to outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raise taxes every year in Richland County,'' she said.
``When you build way out, it's the most expensive place to deliver
services. There is always a social cost, an environmental cost and
a financial cost to development.''
</P>
<P>
   Her county has begun to require developers to consider not only
what they are going to put on their own land, but how development
relates to the community as a whole. Often, she said, subdivisions
are built beside a newly built and academically successful school
without direct and easy access to it.
</P>
<P>
   She would like to see communities where residents can walk to
school and stores, even to their work. In addition, she said,
agencies must coordinate planning of land use, road building,
school construction and sewer and water line extensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still this myth that large lots protect the rural
landscape,'' she said. ``They don't. They churn it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Smith said, small changes add up. Old-fashioned
grid designs for roads, rather than the disconnected subdivision
thoroughfares, she said, give drivers more choices and thus cut
down traffic on individual roads.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she had talked with Inez Tenenbaum, the state's
superintendent of education, about rewriting regulations that now
require 25 acres for each school and prohibit two-story buildings.
Such regulations bar putting schools on a smaller piece of property
when necessary, said Ms. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more sprawl has taken place because there hasn't been
redevelopment of urban areas,'' said Dan Glickman, the federal
secretary of agriculture, shortly after his agency's study was
issued. People are moving farther and farther out because they are
looking for green spaces, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's primarily a local and state issue,'' he said. But, he
added, he wants to reorient the nation's farm policy away from a
commodity-driven approach and toward conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he considered his agency's report a ``wake-up call,'' he
noted that 70 percent of the nation's land was in private hands.
The value of open space and farmland, he added, is ``not for some
anachronistic purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about how you want to grow,'' said Ms. Smith. ``What
will attract industry is good neighborhoods and good quality of
life. We still have a chance to do it right in South Carolina.''

GEORGE JAFFIN, 94, LAWYER AND ARTS BENEFACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George M. Jaffin, a retired Manhattan lawyer and art
patron who started one of the United States' first large-scale
law-school loan forgiveness programs for public-interest lawyers,
died Thursday at a White Plains hospital. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffin, a native New Yorker who lived in Scarsdale for the last
59 years, spent nearly his entire adult life working as a real
estate investor and lawyer, founding a firm now known as Jaffin,
Conrad &AMP; Finkelstein.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his role as a contributor to and fund-raiser for
Columbia University, the Hospital for Joint Diseases, the Juilliard
School and the Museum of Modern Art, among other New York
institutions, that gained him the most recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffin is considered the financial architect of the Hospital for
Joint Diseases, said its board chairman, William Perlmuth,
contributing or convincing others to donate tens of millions of
dollars over the last 30 years, money that allowed the hospital to
enhance its medical research and to move in 1978 from East Harlem
to its current location at 17th Street and Second Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffin served for many years as chairman of the hospital's
development committee. On his 80th birthday, when an affluent
friend asked what he wanted as a gift, Jaffin suggested a $1
million donation to the hospital, which was promptly made, said
Jaffin's daughter, Lois Levine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospital would not have the range of services or
facilities it offers today without the fund raising George Jaffin
accomplished,'' Perlmuth said.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of three children whose parents immigrated from
Eastern Europe to the United States at the turn of the century,
Jaffin spent his youth in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   He started his professional career while still a law student at
Columbia by working with his father as an apartment-building
developer in the Bronx. He set up his own law firm a year after his
graduation, but gradually became disillusioned with the emphasis so
many young lawyers in New York place on pursuing high-paying
careers, Ms. Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, after consulting with the Columbia Law
School dean, Jaffin contributed $1.5 million to establish the loan
repayment program, which covers most of a graduate's debt if the
lawyer remains in a public-interest job for a decade. It was
considered one of the first such programs in the nation, said
Albert Rosenthal, who was the law school's dean at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial pressure on law students pushes many of them
into private practice, with large law firms, working for large
amounts of money,'' Rosenthal said. ``George Jaffin wanted to give
them another choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffin later endowed a chair at the law school dedicated to the
instruction of public-interest law, known as the George M. Jaffin
professor of law and social responsibility. He also raised money to
finance the Meyer Shapiro chair in art history at Columbia,
primarily by selling art that he solicited from more than 60
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet Rabb, who held the first Jaffin chair, recalled Jaffin's
pleasure upon learning that she and her students, as part of their
training, were representing disadvantaged New York City clients in
immigration, fair housing and employment matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not only that students did something that was good,''
said Ms. Rabb, who is now general counsel at the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services. ``George wanted them to see that it was
really rewarding, satisfying and pleasurable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffin developed friendships with several prominent artists, in
part through his work representing them as a lawyer. He was a
regular patron of the Israeli artist Yaacov Agam, donating work by
Agam to the Museum of Modern Art, Hebrew Union College and, most
prominently, to the Juilliard School, which displays a zigzag
stainless-steel sculpture outside its Lincoln Center headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffin is survived by his wife of 70 years, Janet; a son, David,
of Germany; and two daughters, Doris Greenberg, of Chappaqua and
Ms. Levine of Brooklyn.

NORMAN ROTHSTEIN, 63, BROADWAY PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Fla., Ga., Texas)  (lb) 
 By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Norman E. Rothstein, a producer and general manager
for more than 40 years on and off-Broadway and in the national and
international theater, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Julie Hughes, a
New York casting director.
</P>
<P>
   Rothstein was involved in one major capacity or another in more
than 300 plays and musicals, from the original Broadway productions
of ``My Fair Lady,'' ``The Sound of Music'' and ``Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?'' to the Pulitzer Prize-winning off-Broadway dramas
``The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man in the Moon Marigolds'' and ``No
Place to Be Somebody.'' The list also includes the Broadway and
touring revivals of ``The Little Foxes,'' with Elizabeth Taylor;
``The King and I,'' with Yul Brynner; and ``Peter Pan,'' with Sandy
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A governor of the League of American Theaters and Producers, the
Broadway trade group, Rothstein was a principal negotiator for the
league on contracts with the theatrical craft unions. He was also a
consultant to Walt Disney Co. for the renovation of the New
Amsterdam Theater on West 42nd Street, an important element in the
revival of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Rothstein, a native of Brooklyn, fell in love with the
performing arts at an early age. He was a theater major at the
University of Massachusetts. While in the Army, he worked on stage
productions for servicemen. After military service, he started out
in theater in Milwaukee before returning to New York in the late
1950s as a stage manager for ``My Fair Lady,'' ``The Sound of
Music'' and ``Virginia Woolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothstein's first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his
wife, he is survived by a son, Jeffrey, of New York; a daughter,
Elisa Rothstein of Los Angeles, and a granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s Rothstein was managing director of the
Mineola Playhouse on Long Island. Among the many Broadway, national
or international productions for which he was general manager,
executive producer or both were ``Black and Blue,'' ``Torch Song
Trilogy,'' ``On Your Toes,'' ``The Tap Dance Kid,'' ``The Pirates
of Penzance,'' ``Grease,'' ``Pippin,'' ``Tango Argentino,'' ``Tango
Pasion,'' ``Flamenco Puro,'' ``Hello, Dolly!'' and ``Andre Heller's
Wonderhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   He was general manager for more than 90 off-Broadway productions
and tours, among them ``Marigolds,'' ``No Place to Be Somebody''
and ``Your Own Thing,'' as well as for Broadway appearances and
international tours for concerts and dance companies. Among them
were the Beijing Opera, the Netherlands Dance Theater, the Dutch
National Ballet, the Dance Theater of Harlem and the Martha Graham
Dance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Rothstein was also a consultant to 42nd Street Redevelopment
Corp. on the renovation and reuse of historic Times Square
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Theater construction or renovation projects outside New York in
which he played a role include the Miami Beach Theater of the
Performing Arts, the Fox Theater in Atlanta and the Tower Theater
in Houston.

TALES OF THE 20TH CENTURY PLAY ON AS 1999 WINDS DOWN

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 KANSAS CITY, Mo.: human history.  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star

<P>
   Outbreak of information
</P>
<P>
   That democracy, the personal computer and the Internet
simultaneously spread around the world strikes historian James
Gleik as no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The global sharing of information and aspirations made
tyranny, if not instantly obsolete, at least that much less
plausible,'' Gleik writes in ``Our Times: The Illustrated History
of 20th Century America.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech industries, sprouting like daisies, served as new
world testaments to what economist Paul Krugman called ``the
romance of capitalism: The idea of the heroic entrepreneur who
builds a better mousetrap, and in so doing becomes deservedly
wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Versions of the Internet date back to the late 1960s. Its use
prior to the 1990s was mostly limited to Defense Department
bureaucrats and college professors. Then, in 1993, the worldwide
computer grid became a ``superhighway'' as the U.S. National
Science Foundation replaced its technological backbone with a
system called T3 _ 30 times faster than the old system.
</P>
<P>
   Again, our achievements carried consequences. Cyberspace
attracted some of America's most twisted villains of the '90s:
Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and Columbine High School
killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, to name three.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing a means for spreading pornography,
racism and bomb recipes, the personal computer changed the way
regular people viewed their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be more likely to think of ourselves as machines _ as
supercomputers _ than ever before,'' Gleik writes. ``(We now say:)
`Let me process that. Time to reprogram my thinking. I've got
sensory overload.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton spoke cybertalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was downloading what I remembered,'' he told a grand jury in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The question put to him: What was Clinton's intent when, amid
allegations that he had an affair with a former White House intern,
he told his secretary, ``I was never alone with her, right?''
</P>
<P>
   The president was downloading.
</P>
<P>
   In time, raw details of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky
could be accessed via the Internet. With the click of a mouse, we
could see every word of independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
report _ including, sadly, the word ``cigar.'' Something about this
aspect of the information age made us wince.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's detractors pushed for his impeachment on charges of
obstructing justice and lying under oath. After months of denials,
the president confessed to the affair and pleaded for government to
move on to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal swelled into a 14-month exercise in information
overload. Its outcome would not redirect history's course (a Senate
majority refused to remove Clinton from office, as expected.) But
the episode revealed things about ourselves at century's end, for
many of us simply shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Despite relentless media coverage, despite the pundits who said
impeachment proceedings would ``tear the country apart'' and
present ``a constitutional crisis,'' despite even Starr's report on
the Internet, opinion polls showed Americans holding their ground
through the whole sordid saga.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market continued to soar _ higher, in fact, than we
had ever known. Computer whizzes fresh out of college were striking
it rich in the Silicon Valley. Nationwide, the number of female
executive vice presidents had more than doubled in just a decade.
Black income was rising, too, and nine of every 10
African-Americans surveyed in early 1999 said they were happy _ way
up from 56 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lewinsky? Yes, we're upset, a majority kept telling
pollsters. Now let's drop it.
</P>
<P>
   In the final year of the 1990s, both the Constitution and the
American majority prevailed. Quality of society
</P>
<P>
   More about the American majority: 63 percent polled by the Pew
Research Center said they thought life was better in 1999 than a
half-century earlier. Eight in 10 said things improved
substantially for women, African-Americans and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   And, curiously, 56 percent said teen-aged life had gotten worse.
</P>
<P>
   School violence was the crime of the decade. According to Pew,
twice as many Americans paid close attention to the Columbine
massacre than to the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   What worries boomer culture most, perhaps, are things it cannot
control. A public that, in this decade, came to rely upon Prozac,
Ritalin and Viagra to conquer the most vexing of human maladies
found itself clueless as to how to keep fame-seeking teens from
sneaking weapons to school.
</P>
<P>
   We're doing fine, says the bulk of boomers. It's the next
generation that troubles us.
</P>
<P>
   People have been saying that throughout the century. But today,
their fears rattle against a backdrop of global change. Experts
point to the absence of a Cold War rival and suggest that Americans
are now looking for enemies within our own institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In the information age we fear for our privacy. In our dreams of
curing cancer and slowing the age process through gene therapy, we
fear genetic engineering. In the nation's efforts to scale back
federal welfare, we fear a society of have-nots teetering without
safety nets.
</P>
<P>
   In a multicultural workplace of men and women, we fear saying or
doing the wrong thing _ an uneasiness heightened by
sexual-harassment allegations against Supreme Court nominee
Clarence Thomas, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Compare ``Seinfeld,'' the sitcom of the '90s, to ``Father Knows
Best,'' and nothing looks familiar. Yesterday's gone.
</P>
<P>
   Good, David McCullough said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Truman would rather be
living in 1999 than in any other period of the century, he said in
a recent interview. Having seen the Depression, a world war, the
advent of TV, the civil rights movement, medical wonders, the
Internet and ``a long list of great movies,'' McCullough, 66, can't
wait to see what happens next.
</P>
<P>
   As for the next generation to assume power, consider: Today's
young adults and teens volunteer more time than their parents do,
watch less TV and are more likely to have close friends of
different races, studies show.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``millennials'' rival baby boomers in number. Born
between 1976 and 1994, theirs is a demographic that includes
Jedediah Purdy. At 23, he wrote this year's best-selling ``For
Common Things: Irony, Trust and Commitment in America Today,'' an
essay on sincerity and ecological stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Those old enough to vote tend to be absent. But give them time.
Some experts characterize today's college crowd as
``balanced-budget populists'' who eschew two-party dogma for fair,
practical solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like conservatives, they favor fiscal restraint. Like
liberals, they want to help the little guy,'' says Ted Halstead,
president of the New America Foundation in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's young adults will be remembered either as a
late-blooming generation that ultimately helped revive American
democracy by coalescing around a bold new political program...or as
another silent generation that stood by.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century will tell.

SANTA ANITA SEASON SET TO BEGIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ For Cat Thief and the rest of the
thoroughbreds listed in Santa Anita's opening day program, Y2K is
already here.
</P>
<P>
   When Cat Thief, the 1999 Breeders' Cup Classic winner, lines up
outside six others for the Malibu Stakes this afternoon, he'll be
just another soon-to-turn-4-year-old getting ready for the 2000 San
Fernando Stakes (Jan. 15), Strub Stakes (Feb. 5) and Santa Anita
Handicap (March 4).
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves Cat Thief and jockey Pat Day vulnerable to
opponents who have more to gain by winning the $200,000 Malibu, who
might have trained harder for the Grade I race, or who are better
suited to 7 furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the concern,'' trainer D. Wayne Lukas said of turning
back from 1 miles, the length of the Nov. 6 Classic at Gulfstream
Park in Florida, to seven-eighths. ``He's got a lot of raw ability,
but we're coming out of a lot of two-turn races.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas hopes Cat Thief's freshness and ``tactical'' speed will
keep him in range of the confirmed sprinters early in the Malibu,
and his class will kick in late. The Overbrook Farm colt is the
first reigning Breeders' Cup Classic winner to run in the
traditional Santa Anita opener; Ferdinand won the nation's richest
race nearly a year after his victory in the 1996 Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   But Cat Thief, a 5-2 morning-line favorite, could get a battle
from any of his opponents: sprinters Five Star Day, winner of the
Vernon O. Underwood Stakes at the recent Hollywood Park meet, and
Love That Red, the California Cup Sprint champion; Desert Hero,
training sharply for his first start since running fourth to Cat
Thief in the Swaps; Bob Baffert-trained Prime Timber and Straight
Man; and Painter, debuting for trainer Ron McAnally after winning
all six starts in Argentina from 5 furlongs to 1 mile.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief _ or the horse who upsets him in the Malibu _ will be
only the first star of the 87-day Santa Anita meet that will
stretch to April 24.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, the 1999 Santa Anita Derby winner, is among
those pointing for the San Fernando and Strub, both for horses
turning 4 years old on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Older horses with a chance to run in the $1 million Santa Anita
Handicap include Budroyale, second to Cat Thief in the Classic,
Malek, Puerto Madero and River Keen.
</P>
<P>
   The road to the $1 million Santa Anita Derby on April 8 _ and
the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on May 6 _ developed an
unanticipated bump for the leading contender when Breeders' Cup
Juvenile winner Anees was reported Friday to have a tender hind
foot.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, apparently a bruise, could cost Anees ``a couple of
days or a couple of weeks'' of training, Thoroughbred Corp. racing
manager Richard Mulhall said. ``The plan was to run him in the
Santa Catalina (Jan.30). That may be out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stakes-winning 2-year-olds 3-year-olds of 2000
</P>
<P>
   who are at Santa Anita include Baffert's Captain Steve and
Forest Camp, and Lukas' High Yield and fillies Surfside and Cash
Run.
</P>
<P>
   Today's nine-race card starts at noon. Day, Lukas and Overbrook
Farm have the heaviest morning-line favorite in 3-year-old Cape
Canaveral, 8-5 for an optional claiming sprint based on the promise
he showed in winning the San Miguel last January before being
sidelined with a shin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita will be open every day but Tuesday in its first
week. Baffert and jockey David Flores will try to defend their
1998-99 Santa Anita championships. Laffit Pincay, who broke Bill
Shoemaker's record for career victories on his way to capturing the
Hollywood Park riding title will add to his 8,844 wins even as he
celebrates his 53rd birthday on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Off-the-track attractions in Santa Anita's second year under
Frank Stronach's ownership include the opening of a gourmet
restaurant and a day in Pincay's honor.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, named Front Runner, overlooks the homestretch
and features a 215-foot bar. It will be open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on
racing days.
</P>
<P>
   The track will hold Laffit Pincay Day on Jan. 15, giving away
posters and souvenir magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The lone change in the wagering menu, effective with a state law
change Jan. 1, finds the superfecta offered on as many as four
races a day instead of one. Superfecta bettors must pick the first
four finishers in order.

TALES OF THE 20TH CENTURY PLAY ON AS 1999 WINDS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Over and over, the rock song played. The
balloons fell. The baby boomers danced, looking groovy but stiff.
``You'll see things in a different way,'' went the lyrics of
Fleetwood Mac's ``Don't Stop,'' a 1970s hit that now heralded a new
generation taking over.
</P>
<P>
   `` Don't stop thinking about tomorrow...
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was July 16, 1992. The partyers cutting up the stage at the
Democratic National Convention included nominee Bill Clinton _ soon
to be the first U.S. president born after World War II _ and his
law-practicing spouse, the consummate working mom.
</P>
<P>
   To this generation belonged the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The boomers never stopped thinking about tomorrow. In fact, some
would argue they've done more thinking, consulting, logging on and
focus-grouping than, well, taking action. But on that night, for
all the Democrats' pop theatrics, their closing anthem got it
right.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was gone, for better or for worse.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the Soviet Union, losers of a Cold War mostly waged by
the American generation that won World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was Johnny Carson, 30-year king of talk TV. He had just
turned his show over to a boomer, Jay Leno, who immediately ordered
up a new theme song and redid the set.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks earlier, Martin Luther King's dream of racial harmony
appeared to be fading fast. A very different King, Rodney, uttered
a memorable phrase as he trembled in the face of a Los Angeles
riot: ``Can we all get along?''
</P>
<P>
   And President Bush, a Pacific war hero, was just months away
from handing the Oval Office keys to Clinton, who openly opposed
the war that shaped his own generation.
</P>
<P>
   As that summer of 1992 played out, America's unquestioned
dominance in world affairs showed not on the battlefield but, in
surreal fashion, on the basketball court. The U.S. Olympic ``Dream
Team'' of professional superstars outscored their rivals by an
average 44 points.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Boris Stankovic of the International Basketball
Federation spoke of more than hoops when he said: ``We, of course,
know the U.S. will win everything for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   So, just as high hopes, general prosperity and technical
triumphs marked the start of America's century, they now seem to
mark the end _ despite societal problems old and new.
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas City Star poll showed more than 60 percent of area
residents optimistic as their country nears the 21st century. Only
12 percent said they were pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The last century has taught us, however, that success in some
areas can mean tragic costs in others. Consider Dream Team player
Magic Johnson, himself a baby boomer. Johnson's celebrity lifestyle
led to his admission in 1991 that he had contracted the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   The boomers have larger houses, more cars, more phones and far
more information than their parents had, but how well are they
managing life?
</P>
<P>
   Four of every 10 persons polled by The Star cited the ``decline
of families'' as the biggest moral problem facing America in 1999.
Another 22 percent pointed to ``a lack of spiritual values;'' 15
percent singled out ``putting too much emphasis on money and
possessions.''
</P>
<P>
   And, despite the 1990s clarion call for ``community,'' more than
40 percent of area respondents said they were not close friends
with any of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's gone, and that's making many Americans nervous.
Visions of the generations
</P>
<P>
   President Bush, 65 when the decade began, was awkward at
courting boomer culture. He shrugged off the ``vision thing,'' wore
glasses instead of contacts, had a bubbly, white-haired wife who
wrote a book about...their dog.
</P>
<P>
   His most memorable slip of the 1992 campaign occurred at a
grocers convention in Florida. At a mock checkout counter, the
president handed over a quart of milk, a light bulb and a bag of
candy, then he marveled as an electronic scanner priced each item.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for checking out?'' Bush asked in awe. In fact,
grocers had used scanners since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Challenger Clinton wore his hair feathered back, a patented
boomer. Campus activist. Vietnam-era draft resister. Policy wonk.
Poll-savvy. ``Feel your pain.'' If Bush knew nothing about
electronic scanners, Clinton's running mate, Al Gore, struck some
voters as an electronic scanner in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush's generation _ what newscaster Tom Brokaw called ``The
Greatest Generation'' at century's end _ sending men to the moon
was as much a military conquest as a technological feat. Beating
the Soviets, of course, meant putting lives on the line, turning
Air Force pilots into astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton's generation, space exploration became an enterprise
of ideas, tempered by horrific footage of the shuttle Challenger
exploding. The official mantra at NASA in the '90s was ``faster,
better, cheaper,'' hardly a call to arms.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997 one small step for man had been replaced by the
remote-controlled roll of a wheel, as a robotic box named Sojourner
wobbled across the surface of Mars. Scientists hailed victory, only
to be rebuffed two years later when the Mars Polar Lander failed to
phone home.
</P>
<P>
   Warfare itself became a seemingly bloodless, push-button affair
for the world's sole remaining superpower. Not a single American
soldier died in the final U.S. military stand of the 1900s _ NATO's
campaign against Serbian forces and ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. In
what resembled a fantastic video game, our smart bombs took out
Serbs by the thousands, as they did to Iraqis in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   From Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, the modern warrior
could race out Friday at noon in a stealth bomber, attack Belgrade
and be home within 30 hours, enabling him to watch a daughter's
soccer game Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The syndrome of the quick, painless war has become very acute
in the '90s,'' said Donald Abenheim of the Hoover Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Realistic or not, it's a notion without precedent in human
history.

FOR DEER HUNTING ON DAY 1, DAWN IS LAST ON THE SCENE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   PETE BODO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EQUINUNK, Pa. _ It seemed that dawn finally decided to take a
day off, but that's how a hunter always feels in the early-morning
hours of opening day of deer season. I sat in the sturdy tree stand
built on the edge of the north field on Steve Renehan's mountaintop
property high above the Delaware River, watching the darkness. And
I knew that some time soon, in 2 minutes or 4 or 8 or 10, I would
begin to discern shapes.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it seems impossible that those shapes represent
concrete objects, much less the corporeal reality of living things
as beautiful as whitetail deer. The shapes are much more like the
patches and blotches children playfully make themselves see by
squeezing their eyes shut. But inevitably, the inchoate forms
multiply, and a landscape emerges from the dark. And with any luck,
deer are part of the tableau.
</P>
<P>
   I strained my eyes, trying to identify the stone wall where I
sat late one afternoon years ago, in the midst of a raging snow
squall, laughing out loud at how amazing it was, just being there.
And off to my right, the slender trunks of the poplars became
individuated in the grayness. It was just there that I shot my best
buck ever.
</P>
<P>
   I have a long history in the north field, going back to the time
when a different, mutual friend, Chris von Strasser, still owned
it. In fact, I was proud to give the place its former name,
Kellam's Heights Club.
</P>
<P>
   Now the north field, along with the rest of the remote 400-acre
parcel, belonged to Steve. He works hard at making the wild land a
richer, friendlier place for a deer herd. He spends a lot of time
clearing brush, planting crops and building tree stands. And on
this opening day, we hoped to kill a few deer off his land. Some
people can't understand why we would want to do that, but that's
all right. It is only the hunter who must know what he is doing,
and why.
</P>
<P>
   Developing light is almost musical in its profundity, and it has
startling power. Gradually on this day, it revealed the margins of
the meadow carved out of the north field, the hard, straight edges
delineated by a plow. The clover changed slowly from black to
green. In time, half a dozen dark shapes materialized over 200
yards away, in the gray morning mist, where I knew the meadow
abruptly ends and yields to spent brown goldenrod and standing
yellow hay. But it was still too dark to see any of that.
</P>
<P>
   The shapes were about the right size to be deer. They seemed to
be moving around, but then anything does, if you stare at it long
enough in poor light. Perhaps there was nothing there at all. It
was still impossible to tell. But light is also cumulative, and
soon I found myself blinking and frequently turning my eyes away
from the shapes, in effect clearing my eyes, hoping they would be
fresher and sharper when I looked back. I was hoping but not quite
daring to believe that those shapes, those six little black stick
figures way out there, were indeed whitetails.
</P>
<P>
   One of the figures bolted across the meadow, and I knew for
sure. Not only were they deer down at the end of the field, in fact
one of them was surely a male, or buck _ the only kind hunters are
allowed to kill during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Even with binoculars, it was still too dark, and the buck was
too far away, to make out horns. But it wasn't necessary. The
large-bodied deer had the thick, swollen neck that bucks develop
during the rut, or breeding season. And it was clearly running the
does, at least one of which must have been in estrus and growing
receptive to his clumsy advances. Between dashes, the buck
slouched.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the deer, one considerably smaller than the other,
trotted briskly to the far corner of the meadow. The slouching buck
watched, and then he made another run at the does. He was harassing
the smaller deer, a six-month-old fawn. Its mother grazed,
unconcerned, as did the other three does nearby.
</P>
<P>
   It was both fascinating and pleasant to watch because there
wasn't enough light, and the deer were too far away, for me even to
contemplate that most serious of questions: do I shoot this buck?
</P>
<P>
   Mist rose from frosted goldenrod, a slash of orange light fell
across the stand of beech on the ridge, and from across the valley,
the searing crack of a high-powered rifle rent the stillness. I was
so busy watching the deer that I had almost forgotten it was
opening day.
</P>
<P>
   In the breaking daylight, things began to happen swiftly. The
buck swayed, grunted softly, and charged the fawn again. This time
the fawn darted toward its mother. The big doe switched her tail
and peevishly began to canter directly toward me. She kept coming,
and I kept watching, in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   And then she stopped, just 50 yards from my stand, and lowered
her head to feed. The fawn followed her, and my chest swelled with
a sense of gravity and, perhaps, preordination. I heard the big doe
rip out a mouthful of clover, every color before me grew more
vivid, and now the buck was on the move, lumbering toward the does
in a heavy gallop, his hooves audibly striking the black soil.
</P>
<P>
   As I raised the rifle, the two does detected me and froze. Their
posture alerted the buck, who pulled up short. Through the scope I
saw the sun gleaming on the six tines of the buck's antlers. I shot
another memory, out in the north field, on opening day of another
deer season.

 KANSAS CITY, Mo.:   
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weeks earlier, business elves donated the track lighting
equipment. Museum-expert elves, from the Nelson-Atkins Museum of
Art, shared their expertise on how to illuminate Michael's
Mountains with light.
</P>
<P>
   Artist elves from the Kansas City Artist Coalition spent a
weekend painting mountains with layers of blues, browns and
purples. Out of their brushes sprang mountains with pointy tops,
mountains with snowy white peaks.
</P>
<P>
   The artist elves also added Michael himself to the painting.
Said one artist elf days before this night: ``We're inspired by
Michael, so we put him in the painting, too.''
</P>
<P>
   They also painted a wolf sitting next to him, because Michael
had wanted a real dog. But the space of an apartment and the
demands of his medical therapies would be cruel to an animal, said
the elf artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wolf represents strength and courage and great
friendship,'' said the elf. ``We hope he likes it.''
</P>
<P>
   One elf looks on, quietly. His Santa hat is different from the
others. It's green, not red, and on its brim are the words ``Chief
Elf'' embroidered in gold. He leans on a cane, bespectacled with a
gray beard.
</P>
<P>
   With the weariness of the night showing in his eyes, he takes a
deep breath before he says: ``When you're 10 years old and dying,
it's nice that people remember you on this day. Since we can, it
would be immoral to not try.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Elf, an Olathe, Kan., man who insists on anonymity,
founded the Elves of Christmas Present 10 years ago as a way to
teach his own children the true meaning of Christmas _ instead of
the ``gimme, gimmes'' of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The group tries to make Christmas extra special for children who
are very ill or who have lost a loved one. Last Christmas Eve the
group converted a second-floor apartment into bedrooms for a family
whose father had died a month before.
</P>
<P>
   This year they have made several other Christmas stops, in
addition to building Michael's Mountains. Some families on their
route received toys. One family's monthly mortgage payment was
paid. One 16-year-old received a car. One little girl waiting for a
double-lung transplant received a motorized wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Christmas magic is for the children, the elves say
they receive the best gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I tell all elves _ you'll never forget this
Christmas,'' the Chief Elf says. ``Years from now you'll forget
what presents you received, but you won't forget this night.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m. the last screw is in place, the last plastic tree
adjusted to catch the light just so, and the sound machine that
mimics a bubbling brook with birds singing is plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merry Christmas,'' whispers each elf as they leave. And in a
blink of an eye, the little apartment is quiet, save for the sound
of the radio.
</P>
<P>
   The children sleep on.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:50 a.m. a mountain of wrapped packages waits under the
tree. Terri McMahan, a single mother, sips another cup of coffee,
waiting for her children's sleepy eyes to flutter open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special Christmas for us,'' she says. ``It's
probably going to be Michael's last.''
</P>
<P>
   With Michael's diagnosis in July, doctors offered little hope.
Modern medicine zapped Michael's brain with a lifetime dosage of
radiation. He was given massive doses of steroids and other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   With the treatments, the chance existed that the brain-stem
tumor might shrink. Without the treatments, he had no hope at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's dying,'' says McMahan, with a sigh. ``We're all
very open about it. It's just a waiting game now.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatments had side effects on Michael. Radiation caused his
right arm to go numb. Now he drags his left foot when he walks. He
can't hear from his left ear anymore, and his pupils sometimes
cross, giving him double vision.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs have also caused his weight to balloon from 55 pounds
to 120 in just five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tears me up to see his little body like this,'' his mother
says. ``Those little stretch marks...He can't walk hardly with all
the weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my little hero. All the things he's gone through. He's my
little man.'' Her words stop when a noise sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Michael is awake.
</P>
<P>
   McMahan races up stairs. Bleary-eyed, Michael stands before his
bedroom, unsure of the scene before him. His right hand hangs limp
on his hip. His left hand wipes the sleep from his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In his bedroom, where a plain white wall stood before, mountains
loom. Mountains with blues, browns, purple majesties. Mountains
with pointy tops and snowy peaks. A little boy gazes out from the
scene, with a wolf sitting next to his side looking on with tender
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, what's this?'' asks Michael, as his words mumble into
soft cries, then silence. He stares, now wide-eyed, looking from
his mother to the painting and back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael, it's your mountains,'' McMahan says softly. ``It's
your mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Birds chirp. Water gurgles. Michael tilts his good ear toward
the sounds. He stares again at the painting. He limps closer for a
better view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are those trees for real?'' he asks, looking at the plastic
evergreen tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are your trees,'' says Terri. ``See the little birds in
them?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael stares and stares. Nearby are two stuffed animals, gifts
from some schoolchildren who heard his story from their art
teachers. He pets the face of one stuffed animal, then stares once
more at his mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this awesome Michael?'' says Terri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah...awesome,'' he says as he tilts his head to the top of
the mural. He stares some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merry Christmas, Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, ever so slowly, a smile etches across his face.

UNABLE TO GO THE MOUNTAINS, THE MOUNTAINS COME TO HIM

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There's something about mountains, he told
his mom.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McMahan, 10, kept asking about the colors of mountains:
the blues, the browns, the purple majesties. He stared for hours at
pictures of mountains. Why does a child growing up in Kansas obsess
about mountains?
</P>
<P>
   A mountain, he told his mom, is the closest place on earth to
God.
</P>
<P>
   That's important to Michael, who is fighting an inoperable brain
tumor that is stealing his dreams and his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   After a doctor told him he was dying, Michael began drawing
pictures of mountains with pointy tops and layers of color;
mountains with snowy white peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Michael was offered a trip to the Rockies, but his
doctors said no, it was too risky. Complications could develop from
the thin air; the changes in pressure could cause more swelling.
</P>
<P>
   But wishes can come true, especially on Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Because Michael couldn't go to the mountains, the mountains came
to Michael. On Christmas Eve, Michael's mountains grew overnight in
his bedroom while he slept nearby.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tall order, but not for the Elves of Christmas Present,
hundreds of nameless souls who move mountains every year to make
Christmas extra special for a few children.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve, the streets of Leavenworth are silent but not
dark. Christmas lights twinkle from front doors, rooftops and
living-room Christmas trees.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:15 a.m. a semitrailer chugs into the parking lot of the
Valley View Apartments. Out spring dozens of men and women, some
wearing red Santa Claus stocking hats, who gather around the
McMahans' front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're here,'' whispers Kris Petrone, a friend of the
McMahans. ``The elves are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri McMahan quickly tiptoes upstairs and sneaks a peek at her
four sleeping children. Michael is sharing a bed with Lance, 8, and
Nicole, 7. Like baby bunnies in a nest, all three are sprawled in
deep slumber. April, 9, is asleep in her room across the hall. A
radio drones out Christmas carols where the three children sleep.
The hope is that the radio will also mask the sounds of the
mountains about to be born.
</P>
<P>
   In minutes the little town house apartment bustles with
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shhh-h-h-h-h-h,'' sounds a chorus of elves to the others'
giggling, when McMahan opens her front door. Six burley elves
maneuver three canvas panels up the stairwell. Each panel is 7 feet
9 inches tall and holds a part of the mountain painting. Men
wearing canvas aprons enter with drills and tool boxes. Women are
armed with rulers and plastic evergreen trees. A tiny elf enters
wearing a stocking cap that reads: ``Rookie Elf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first time,'' the child says, with a giggle.
</P>
<P>
   But McMahan wears the biggest smile of them all. Dimples sprout
from her cheeks deep enough to drop a nickel into.
</P>
<P>
   Each elf has a special task. Some elves are professional
carpenters in their other lives. As one carpenter elf drills, he
clasps his hand around the tool in a vain attempt to mask its
noise.
</P>
<P>
   Zipfzzzt. Zipfzzzt. The drill bites into the white wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the next panel lined up straight?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, go lower,'' whispers a helper elf. ``Lower, yeah,
that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other elves, who are electricians, stand by to install track
lighting.

BETTY CAGE, 82, QUIET FORCE BEHIND BALLET COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Betty Cage, an administrator of the New York City
Ballet who played a quiet but important role in creating the
company, died Dec. 19 at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in
Manhattan. She was 82 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Her title for many years was simply general manager, but Ms.
Cage was a linchpin of the City Ballet. She avoided the limelight
and was unknown to the ballet-going public. A woman of few words,
she presided over generations of dancers, choreographers and
backstage personnel with a wryly detached wit and a calm, almost
uncanny sense of approaching trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cage was, as Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of the City
Ballet, described her role in ``Thirty Years,'' his history of the
organization, ``at once labor negotiator, certified public
accountant, legal expert, mother superior, confessor, psychiatrist
and practicing witch (white magic).'' She was, Kirstein wrote,
``proficient in the science and pursuit of the possible and
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Minneapolis, Ms. Cage grew up in Buffalo and then moved
to New York. She worked in a law office before becoming an
assistant editor at John Bernard Myers' literary journal View and
an assistant to Frances Steloff at the Gotham Book Mart, jobs that
gained her entry into the world of New York poets, artists and
intellectuals involved in dance in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that Kirstein met Ms. Cage at the Gotham Book Mart,
where he is said to have invited her to work with Ballet Society, a
precursor to City Ballet. Ms. Cage arrived in 1947 and retired in
1985. Her first job there was as an assistant to Frances Hawkins,
the business manager at Ballet Society.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Ms. Cage formed a close professional
relationship with Morton Baum, who, as chairman of the City
Center's finance committee in 1948, extended a crucial invitation
to the ballet company to become a resident of the theater. Ms. Cage
also helped to engineer the City Ballet's 1964 move to Lincoln
Center. In 1985 she founded the Dancers Emergency Fund at City
Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cage was an avid practitioner of tai chi, the Chinese system
of movement. She collaborated with her husband, Edward Maisel, on
``Tai Chi for Health,'' published in 1972. Ms. Cage also taught
unofficial tai chi classes at the City Ballet-affiliated School of
American Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband.

ROGER FRISON-ROCHE, 93, MOUNTAINEER AND WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Frison-Roche, a French mountaineer, explorer and popular
writer who carried out the first live radio broadcast from the
summit of Mont Blanc, died on Dec. 17 in Chamonix in the French
Alps. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Frison-Roche's books were widely translated and sold in the
millions. His first mountaineering novel, ``First on the Rope,''
has sold more than 3 million copies since its publication a
half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his novels were set on Mont Blanc, Europe's highest
peak. In addition to ``First on the Rope,'' his books included
``The Big Crevice'' (1952), about a dying guide listening to calls
from members of a search party who cannot hear his cries for help.
He also wrote nonfiction books about his Alpine travels.
</P>
<P>
   Frison-Roche was known, too, for his works set in the North
African desert, like ``The Lost Trail of the Sahara'' (1952), which
was translated into English by Paul Bowles, and ``Lights of the
Arctic'' (1957).
</P>
<P>
   Frison-Roche was born in Paris on Feb. 10, 1906. He left school
early and in 1923 moved to Chamonix, where his parents had lived,
to work in a travel agency and then as a mountain and ski guide. He
later founded a rock-climbing and mountaineering school, and became
known for organizing and winning races to the tops of mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932 he produced the first live radio program from the summit
of Mont Blanc for Radio Lyon. He also wrote for newspapers about
mountaineering, and in 1935 was sent to , Algeria as a
correspondent for La Depeche d'Alger. The assignment, and 17
expeditions into the Sahara, gave him material for his first book,
``The Call of the Hoggar.''
</P>
<P>
   He was then asked to write a series for young people. The
installments became ``First on the Rope.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 he was a war correspondent in Tunisia, but the next year
he left to join the Resistance. This experience gave him material
for another novel, ``The Mountain Soldiers of the Night''(1968).
</P>
<P>
   Frison-Roche's wife died in 1994. He is survived by a daughter
who lives in Chamonix.

   MONTREAL _ In the shadow of a mosque on Rue Jean Talon, shoppers
in spice-scented Arab markets and sippers of highly sugared coffee
in small cafes were feeling the heat, even as a bitter Arctic wind
whipped through their adopted city Saturday. They complained
nervously of unmarked surveillance vans prowling their streets, of
bomb-sniffing dogs, of arrest warrants, police raids and close
questionings.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the talk was rumor or exaggeration, but there's no
masking the real resentment, outrage and even fear racing through
Montreal's Arab community _ especially among ethnic Algerians _
amid an intense international investigation into a suspected
terrorist plot against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel singled out, targeted,'' said Abderrahim Alachaher, a
former schoolteacher from Algeria who now owns a grocery store
called Chez Cordoba. ``Once again, it seems all of us must be
thrown together with a few bad men.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood is one of several that are heavily populated by
Algerian nationals in Canada's second-largest city. About 20,000
people from the North African country live in Montreal, and the
vast majority arrived this decade, escaping the civil strife and
economic instability that have gripped their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years I've been in Canada, and I've been hard-working
and built a business for my family,'' said Mourad Nasari, owner of
an electrical repair service. ``Now comes trouble. And I am
frightened Canadians are looking at us with different eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``trouble'' he referred to is on the front page of nearly
every newspaper in North America: On the eve of the millennium,
police in the United States and Canada have mounted a massive
investigation into activities of suspected Algerian Islamic
radicals after the arrests of three people with ties to Algeria in
Vermont and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The two men and one woman in federal custody are from Montreal
and, according to US prosecutors, have links to Algerian radical
groups. Meanwhile, French counterterrorism experts have
investigated whether Montreal is becoming a major center for
Islamic terrorist groups as a floating international population of
Islamic radicals, some suspected of committing crimes in Europe,
exploits Canada's admittedly loose immigration rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Security Intelligence Service warned last year that
the country has become an important sanctuary for scores of
extremely dangerous organizations and their operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Elcock, director of the intelligence agency, stated in
testimony before the Canadian Senate, ``Terrorist groups are
present here whose origins lie in every significant regional,
ethnic and national conflict there is. The nature of our society
and related policies concerning refugees and immigrants make us
particularly vulnerable to terrorist influence and activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, following the arrests of the past two weeks, the attention
of the FBI and Royal Canadian Mounted Police _ together with the
intellegence services of Canada, the United States, France and
other nations _ is focused heavily on Montreal as the point of
connection for suspected plotters.
</P>
<P>
   The first arrest came on Dec. 14, when US Customs officials
apprehended Ahmed Ressam, a 32-year-old Algerian national, as he
arrived in Port Angeles, Washington, aboard a ferry from British
Columbia. In the trunk of his car were nitroglycerine, timing
devices and enough explosive material to flatten a building.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam arrived in Canada in 1994 carrying a false French
passport and soon slipping into Montreal's Algerian underground as
a suspected member of a ring specializing in car break-ins and
computer thefts, authorities allege.
</P>
<P>
   The next arrests came Dec. 19, when Lucia Garofalo, 35, and
Bouabide Chamchi, 20, arrived at a remote border post in Beecher
Falls, Vt. They were taken into federal custody after specially
trained dogs detected trace amounts of explosives in Garofalo's
vehicle. The pair have been charged with fairly minor violations of
immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's Algerian husband was deported from Canada in 1993.
Authorities say she recently crossed the border to New England
accompanied by two Algerian males. Authorities have said they fear
she may have carried bomb-making materials or terrorist operatives
on that early December trip.
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi, also of Montreal, is an Algerian who entered Canada
illegally in 1997 as a shipboard stowaway.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border investigators led by the FBI are looking hard at
Montreal's Algerian community, especially at those with links to
the Armed Islamic Group, responsible for massacres and atrocities
in rural Algeria as well as violent crimes in France, which ruled
Algeria until 1962. Canadian police and intelligence officials
allege radical Algerians have formed cells in Montreal to raise
money for fundamentalist Islamic causes through theft, extortion
and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But many Algerians and other Arabs complain bitterly that they
are being tarred by media and police. ``A whole community is being
stigmatized for the acts of a few,'' said Jerry Khourri, executive
officer of the Canadian Arab Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Until this decade, Montreal's Algerians numbered only a few
hundred, mainly university students. But larger numbers started
pouring into Canada in the 1990s as fighting flared between Islamic
fundamentalists and Algeria's military government.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, according to refugee officials, the newcomers tend
to be well-educated, Western-oriented professionals, skilled
workers afraid of persecution from both sides in their homeland's
struggle. They are attracted by Quebec's French-rooted culture _
not too dissimiliar from the culture of middle-class Algerians _
and Montreal's cosmopolitan ambience.
</P>
<P>
   But police say there are also increasing numbers of Algerian
radicals entering the country to join the loosely organized ranks
of Islamic extremists financing their activities through crime.
They like Canada because the country has welcomed Third World
nationals who claim to be fleeing persecution _ almost all are
granted at least temporary residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Algerians chose Canada because of its commitment to
democracy and human rights. We live in harmony beside all kinds of
people, and we work very hard to get ahead,'' said Alachaher, the
grocery store owner. ``So to be depicted as dangerous or criminal _
this hurts us, this frightens us.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; NUREYEV: His Life &LR;  By Diane Solway. Morrow, $16. The author
draws on extensive interviews and research to provide fresh
material on the Russian dancer's life and career, particularly his
Soviet years and his defection in 1961. This balanced biography is
``informative and filled with vivid anecdotes,'' Jennifer Dunning
wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PECULIAR MEMORIES OF THOMAS PENMAN &LR;  By Bruce Robinson.
HarperPerennial, $13. The hero of this darkly funny first novel by
the writer and director of ``Withnail and I'' is a 13-year-old
asthmatic schoolboy searching for identity as he copes with his
exotically dysfunctional family in working-class England in the
grim 1950s. He is an obsessive snooper, and what he's most keen to
find is the key to his grandfather's extensive pornography
collection. ``Never before has the painful, knotty journey to
maturity been depicted with such gusto, and never has the venerable
Bildungsroman received such riotously profane treatment,'' Patrick
McGrath wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SECRECY: The American Experience &LR;  By Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
Yale University, $10.95. In this withering tour of nearly a century
of official secrecy, the New York senator argues that the use of
classified information and misinformation has caused much more harm
than good. ``It is a dismaying tale,'' Sam Tanenhaus wrote in 1998,
though Moynihan tells it ``with uncommon liveliness and a mordant
wit.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; ALL THE LAWS BUT ONE: Civil Liberties in Wartime &LR; , by
William H. Rehnquist (Vintage, $14), the chief justice of the
United States reviews prominent cases in which civil liberties
issues have arisen during times of war, from the 1860s to the
internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II. ``Rehnquist
presents full and fascinating human profiles'' and conveys ``what
it must have been like to grapple with these issues in a time of
crisis,'' Jeremy Waldron wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INGRATITUDE &LR;  By Ying Chen. University of California, $13.95.
This compact novel is narrated from the grave by a woman who
committed suicide to punish her mother and thus escape the
traditional Chinese culture of obedience. The result is ``a
sustained philosophical exploration studded with passionate
outbursts, a glimpse of a consciousness liberated from family and
social expectations,'' Elizabeth Schmidt wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ARK BABY &LR;  By Liz Jensen. Overlook, $13.95. This raucous, unruly
novel is a satirical jab at Darwinism and the notion of scientific
certainty through 150 years of British life, up to the early years
of the new millennium, when a fertility crisis threatens the
survival of Homo britannicus. ```Ark Baby' is written in an
exuberantly naughty style that suggests Jensen shares a certain
kinship with writers like Peter Carey and Fay Weldon,'' Alida
Becker wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIP HOP AMERICA &LR;  By Nelson George. Penguin, $13.95. A New York
music critic traces the evolution of rap music and its influence on
culture and society, in the process chronicling his own intense
love-hate relationship with hip-hop. In 1998 the reviewer Laura
Jamison called this ``an invaluable, entertaining and well-written
account.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; ELEVATING THE GAME: Black Men and Basketball &LR;  (University of
Nebraska, $15), George explores the history of basketball and how
the integration of black players from colleges around the United
States advanced the game. The result is a ``folksy yet scholarly
study'' and ``a rich, welcome addition to sports literature,''
Michael E. Ross wrote in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEETINGS WITH THE ARCHANGEL: A Comedy of Spirit &LR;  By Stephen
Mitchell. HarperPerennial, $13. The celestial visitor in question
stops by to deliver a primer on the afterlife and give the novel's
narrator a chance to review his spiritual progress, as well as
provide the author with an opportunity to display his religious
learning. In 1998 the reviewer David Guy called this a
``fascinating and beautifully written'' book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JOY OF MAN'S DESIRING &LR;  By Jean Giono. Counterpoint, $16. This
earthy French novel about the loves and toils of a group of
peasants in the rugged, isolated hills of Provence is a pagan
allegory about the fragile communion between man and nature. ``It
is a beautiful story of renewal ... set in terms of a kind of
cosmic faith, and in a lovely and fearless imagery,'' Katherine
Woods wrote in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CANONE INVERSO &LR;  By Paolo Maurensig. Owl/Holt, $12. This Italian
novel, steeped in musical imagery and themes, revolves around a
haunted 17th-century violin and its effect on the friendship of two
boys in Central Europe during the 1930s. Last year the reviewer
Jonathan Keates admired ``the mournful beauty of this sparely
proportioned, soberly recounted story.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GRIEVING TIME: A Year's Account of Recovery From Loss &LR;  By
Anne M. Brooks. Herodias, $11. This slender, heartfelt book is a
monthly journal kept by the author after her husband's death from
cancer. The ``entries are sometimes startling in their candor,''
one critic wrote in 1985. ``It will linger in the mind and give
comfort'' for a long time.

THE DECADE THAT NEVER WAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am overjoyed to inform you that you just awoke from a 10-year
nap, and that all of your Los Angeles sports memories from the '90s
were bad dreams, like that parallel reality George Bailey lived in
``It's A Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Peter O'Malley did not sell the Dodgers to Mr. Potter, uh,
Mr. Murdoch, and the Rams didn't move to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   So allow me to tell you what really happened in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   1991: The Lakers and coach Mike Dunleavy advanced to the NBA
Finals, where they lost to Michael Jordan and the Bulls. After the
loss, Magic Johnson told Jordan this isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's resolve became even stronger after his Nov. 7
announcement, on the eve of the '91-92 season, that he had HIV. His
doctors said doing what he loves is as important as medications.
</P>
<P>
   In what proved to be an important show of solidarity, Utah's
Karl Malone supported Magic's decision.
</P>
<P>
   1992: With Magic playing terrific, the Lakers returned to the
NBA Finals again but lost in seven games to Jordan and the Bulls.
USC fired Larry Smith after losing the Freedom Bowl to Fresno State
and rehired John Robinson, who promised a return to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   1993: With the Lakers in the last days of Showtime, Dunleavy
spurned an offer to coach the Milwaukee Bucks and says it's time to
return the title to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Magic and James Worthy dethroned the Bulls in six
games. Magic showed no sign of illness.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, meanwhile, won their first Stanley Cup title, beating
the Montreal Canadiens. The key moment came in Game 2. A game up
and leading by a goal late in the third period, the Canadiens asked
to check Marty McSorley's stick.
</P>
<P>
   Kings trainer Peter Demers deftly swapped McSorley's stick
before his last shift. The stick was OK, the Kings won Game 2 and
closed out the Canadiens in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers went 81-81. But at the last minute, G.M. Fred Claire
decided against trading Pedro Martinez to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Brown left the Clippers after taking them to the playoffs
twice. The NHL gave Disney an expansion franchise, and president
Michael Eisner laughingly tells reporters he almost named the team
after a Disney movie, ``The Mighty Ducks,'' before settling for
Anaheim Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   1994: UCLA gave Terry Donahue his ninth straight bowl win by
beating Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl, 22-21, on Wayne Cook's
last-play touchdown pass. ``You don't know how close I came to
running,'' Cook said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy took Milwaukee's offer. The major leagues went on
strike. The Raiders returned to Oakland after the Coliseum
Commission refused to renovate the Coliseum. ``We've sunk enough
money into this pit,'' City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams tried to leave, too. Georgia Frontiere agreed to move
to St. Louis, but the NFL stepped in. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue
said, ``We're just not going to go on without a team in the second
largest TV market.'' A frustrated Frontiere promised to build a
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   1995: Some say it was L.A.'s greatest year ever. UCLA and Jim
Harrick won the NCAA basketball title. The Dodgers won the N.L.
West behind Pedro Martinez and Hideo Nomo and lost the NLCS in
seven tough games to Atlanta. Kings owner Bruce McNall tearfully
announced he is broke and transfers title of the team to Wayne
Gretzky, making him the first player-owner.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers hired Phil Jackson. Magic moved to forward with Nick
Van Exel and Eddie Jones in the backcourt and the Lakers won
another title, Magic's seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels were the big story. They jumped out to a big lead
and coasted home 12 games ahead of Seattle. Gary DiSarcina credited
manager Marcel Lachemann for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels went 27-16 down the stretch, beat Cleveland for the
A.L. title, and played in their first World Series. Gene Autry rode
a horse onto the field before Game 3 and the Angels played tough
before losing a 1-0 decision in Game 7 to Tom Glavine and the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   1996: USC and John Robinson won the Rose Bowl. But after the
game, Robinson, hinting at a lack of support from the
administration, quit and became the Oakland Raiders head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won his eighth and final title. Lachemann, saying he's
never liked managing, retired late in the season, and the team
rehired Jim Fregosi. USC promoted Mike Garrett to special liaison
to the president, named George Raveling A.D., and lured Jeff Fisher
away from the NFL to become the Trojan coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, meanwhile, ran away with the N.L. West. Tom
Lasorda, fit and trim after going back on his Slim-Fast diet, kept
the team together amid rumors Peter O'Malley was selling the team.
With Pedro and Ramon Martinez winning 11 postseason starts, the
Dodgers beat Atlanta in the NLCS and won their first World Series
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's '96 basketball season ended with a loss to Princeton.
Before '96-97 begins, a contrite Jim Harrick announced he committed
an NCAA violation and will step aside as head coach until the
Pac-10 and NCAA concludes an investigation. Steve Lavin was named
interim coach. The players dedicated their season to Harrick.
</P>
<P>
   1997: The NCAA gave UCLA a light probation, restricted Harrick
to campus recruiting, and the Bruins rallied behind Harrick and
assistant Lavin to reach the Final Four, losing in the semifinals
by two.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers reloaded by signing Shaquille O'Neal and drafting
Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   In hockey, Wayne Gretzky retired as a player so he could
concentrate on rebuilding the Kings. Anaheim, meanwhile, reached
the second round before four gut-wrenching losses to the Red Wings.
Disney signed Ron Wilson and Paul Kariya to new contracts, then
acquired Jaromir Jagr from the Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won the A.L. West, beat the Yankees when a fan leans
over a fence to turn a Rex Hudler double into a home run, and then
swept the Marlins for their first World Series title. Autry, saying
he feels 14 again, broke off sale talks with Disney.
</P>
<P>
   1998:Peter O'Malley, buoyed by progress on landing an NFL
franchise, admitted he might have sold the Dodgers at one time but
instead sold 49 percent of the Dodgers to Murdoch and began
construction on a new football facility even though the NFL hadn't
decided between L.A. and Houston. O'Malley also signed Pedro
Martinez and Piazza to long-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won the A.L. West again but lose the ALCS to the
Yankees, who won 114 games during the regular season. But the
Dodgers, with Cy Young winner Pedro Martinez winning Games 1, 4 and
7, upset the Yankees in the World Series. Matt Luke's pinch-hit
home run in the 11th won it for Lasorda and crew.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, despite leading the A.L. in steals in '97,
returned to the NBA for one more season and rejoined his former
coach, Jackson, in L.A. with Shaq and Kobe. The Lakers went 76-6
and 15-0 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams made the playoffs for the third straight year but lost
to Green Bay in the NFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   1999: UCLA and Cade McNown, who ended the '98 regular season
with a sensational 56-49 shootout win over Miami to finish 11-0,
upset Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl to win its first national title
since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins basketball team under Harrick and assistant head
coach Lavin returned to the Final Four. Bill Clinton visited the
tourney, and with Harrick at his side, asked America to forgive him
for his error in judgment with that woman. The Dodgers and Angels
won their respective leagues and met in the first-ever Freeway
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   USC, behind Carson Palmer and Kareem Kelly, won the Pac-10. The
Rams clinched the N.L. West in December and appeared headed for a
Super Bowl against the resurgent Raiders, who have gone 28-7 since
Al Davis sold the team.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL awards an expansion franchise to O'Malley. The team will
begin play in 2000 in the Coliseum until the new stadium next to
Dodger Stadium is finished in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who moved to Buffalo in 1994, folded.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As her students squirmed through the last few
hours before winter break, teacher Gaby Calzadillas examined her
loot.
</P>
<P>
   Random tokens of her students' affection lay heaped on her desk
at Fenton Avenue Charter School in suburban Los Angeles. Body gel.
A wooden picture frame. A Pokemon card. One large bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, how cute--look, it's got `1999' on its paw!'' Calzadillas
said.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts may not always make sense, but the tradition of
showering presents upon teachers during the holiday season remains
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that many of these children come from working-class
families with little cash to spare. Somehow, Calzadillas' children
in Lake View Terrace, 24 miles east of downtown Los Angeles,
managed to bring her something for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not be the most affluent kids, but they've got big
hearts,'' said Joe Lucente, Fenton's co-director.
</P>
<P>
   That tradition has come under scrutiny this year as the Los
Angeles Unified School District, reeling from administrative
scandals, crafts a new ethics policy for employees. The consultant
charged with writing the new policy said he will likely include
recommendations on accepting gifts from students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Josephson said there's a possibility some parents may
try to influence teachers through expensive gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like, `Here are some tickets to the Lakers game, and gosh,
Johnny would really like to be on the Academic Decathlon team,'''
said Josephson, founder and president of the Josephson Institute of
Ethics.
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly adds he has never seen such a thing happen here.
And Josephson said he doesn't want to wreck a tradition so many
parents and teachers genuinely love.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to go crazy on this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At many schools, the expensive gifts that concern Josephson are
out of the question. In schools where many children come from poor
families, cookies, cake and tamales are often the gifts of choice.
Cosmetics and candles, too, remain low-cost favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Spomenka Cikara, who teaches English to immigrant children at
Knollwood School in Granada Hills, 21 miles northwest of L.A.'s
downtown, eyed a small collection of presents recently with
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel guilty,'' she said. ``Guilty because I know their
situations at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Other gifts may seem odd at first, until teachers realize the
emotions or thoughts that went into them. Lisa McIntyre at
Knollwood once got an enormous nightgown from a little girl who,
although she didn't know her teacher's size, thought the immense
stretch of pink material was beautiful. She also got a necklace
made of strips of magazine paper meticulously rolled into beads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still wear that sometimes,'' McIntyre said.
</P>
<P>
   Pricey gifts can be far more awkward to receive. Vic Pallos,
spokesman for the Glendale school district, said one local parent
who ran an import business once brought several teachers expensive
purses. The principal returned them to the parent, with apologies.
</P>
<P>
   But turning back a gift isn't easy. In Korean culture, for
example, rejecting a gift is seen as a serious insult, Pallos said.
And 12 percent of Glendale's students come from Korean families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers are in a difficult position here,'' Pallos said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Glendale and Los Angeles school systems already have
policies barring teachers and other employees from accepting gifts
given with an expectation of a favor in return. LAUSD employees
also can not receive more than $100 per year from a single person.
</P>
<P>
   Knollwood teacher Daneh Gallo has seen the full spectrum of
gifts. One year, the parents of her twenty students chipped in to
get her a $100 gift certificate to a mall.
</P>
<P>
   She loved it. But ask her for her favorite gift, and she
remembers something simpler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I got a card I'll keep forever, saying `you've made
a real difference in our family,''' Gallo said. ``That's the
best.''

SCHOOL REFORM DERAILED BY HASSLES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Story moves in two takes) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Exactly three weeks after a slate of
reform-minded candidates took control of the Los Angeles school
board, they gathered at a therapeutic residential treatment center
in Hollywood that serves abused and neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   The July 22 sitdown was billed as a daylong retreat that would
help create a bond among the seven board members, and the location
fit poetically with the reformers' accusations that 710,000
children enrolled in the Los Angeles Unified School District had
been mistreated by the past administration.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by a few key downtown administrators, the motley
participants sat around a table, repeatedly complimented each other
and occasionally scribbled down determined but happy mission
statements for the future of the nation's second-largest school
district.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a sign of things to come. And it was, but
in an entirely different way than portrayed at the time by the
smiling faces of the part-time politicians and entrenched
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Busy with more important matters that sunny summer day, Los
Angeles Unified's top business administrator, David Koch, sent a
stand-in rather than attend.
</P>
<P>
   The district's top lawyer, Richard Mason, at one point wryly
refused to share a personal story with the crowd, saying it was
``attorney-client privilege,'' a blatant reference to complaints
that he had been concealing information from the public.
</P>
<P>
   And shortly before lunchtime, Superintendent Ruben Zacarias
walked into the room and looked around. He was an uninvited guest,
well aware that he faced nearly impossible odds to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, the board booted Koch and Mason, and
Zacarias found himself announcing his early retirement--an ousting
eased by a $750,000 golden handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Since sitting in the retreat circle, the reformers' energies
have been consumed by massive administrative problems, financial
abuses, two scathing audits, and the fate of the district's
albatross, the Belmont Learning Center, which sits partially
completed atop an oil field that seeps potentially deadly and
explosive gases.
</P>
<P>
   By their own admission, it has been a long six months, and
actual instructional and curriculum reforms have taken a back seat
to cleaning up the administrative mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in far worse shape than I imagined,'' said board
member Caprice Young, one of four ``reformers'' elected earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In six months, we've made great progress, but clearly we have
a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Board President Genethia Hayes, the strong-willed leader of the
reform majority, agreed, saying: ``I never envisioned any of this
happening so quickly. It was my hope to reorganize and revitalize
the district completely. But if someone had said that in October we
would have been making those major changes, no, I didn't anticipate
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also didn't anticipate finding a district without anything
that even looked like a functioning management structure where
people were being held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated because he couldn't just to appoint a board to fix
Los Angeles' failing public school system, Mayor Richard Riordan
set out to do the next best thing in the closing months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire mayor decided to buy the election.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-May, unprecedented contributions from Riordan and an
elite cadre of businessmen he put together figured prominently in
the successful campaigns of three newcomers--Hayes, Young and Mike
Lansing-- and one incumbent, David Tokofsky.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was simple. Together, the four would form a reform
majority on the seven-member Board of Education. They could get
things done if they stuck together.
</P>
<P>
   Only it didn't work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   At the board's first meeting, Hayes, a new president feeling out
her power, appointed board member Valerie Fields as her second in
command. The move surprised many district insiders who were
confident Tokofsky would receive the post, especially after being
denied the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, Fields increasingly aligned with the three
newcomers, as Tokofsky drifted away, assuming his traditional role
as watchdog and devil's advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Those roles were solidified when Tokofsky opposed the foursome's
decision to oust Zacarias in October, citing a lack of public
notice and poor process, two of the board's biggest problems during
the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised by it because David Tokofsky was
always the one on the board who was the watchdog for the public
about all of the things that he perceived were wrong with the
institution,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then to discover it was Valerie Fields who had the strength
and courage through all of this--David's decision still puzzles me.
I would have thought that David would have understood the necessity
of moving when you have the will of the board ready to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Tokofsky tell it, he made up his mind to bolt the
foursome when he disagreed with Hayes over how to resolve the fate
of Belmont, the nation's costliest high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may share Genethia Hayes' goals,'' Tokofsky said, ``but I
realized we differed strongly on the means to those goals from the
day she wanted to implement that gag order.''
</P>
<P>
   That gag order, which the board would later claim was unofficial
and then concede was unenforceable, was announced July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the board had gone behind closed doors with
the LAUSD administrators to discuss scrapping Belmont. A majority
of the panel had publicly stated they were troubled by the climbing
costs of the unfinished campus and were worried about the safety of
putting kids in a school built on the environmentally troubled
downtown property.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: -- the environmentally troubled downtown property.
</P>
<P>
   The board was ready to kill Belmont and put the scandal behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when a LAUSD number cruncher told them it would
be ``cheaper to keep building the school than to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer comfortable with scrapping Belmont, the board voted to
slow down construction, announced a gag order on all matters
relating to the project, and decided to create a citizens
commission to help guide the district to a final decision by
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   The district has sunk $175 million into the project and internal
estimates show it could cost an additional $112 million to
complete. No decision has been made yet on the future of the
stalled project, and a board vote isn't expected for many more
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a 6-1 vote back in July to kill that project,''
Tokofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have driven a stake through the Belmont beast at the
outset of the new board. Rather, we punted it to some commission
that came back with an ambiguous decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted 4-3 to advise the board to finish Belmont,
but attached a number of conditions to its recommendation. Muddling
the matter further, former District Attorney Ira Reiner, who served
in a nonvoting role as commission executive director, sided with
the opposition. Reiner called Belmont a ``disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the experts were more in unison about whether it can be
made safe,'' Lansing said. ``It's too bad that there is really no
consensus on this issue from the people who are supposed to know
better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, none of us on the board are experts, and we have
to make a final decision on Belmont. The bottom line is we've taken
the right steps to put the project at a place where we have more
information and a decision can be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Victoria Castro, who represents Belmont's
attendance area, is the only vocal advocate for the project on the
school board.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has steadfastly fought to complete the school, arguing a
safety system could prevent methane and hydrogen sulfide gases from
entering the classrooms. She did not respond to requests to be
interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Julie Korenstein, the most ardent Belmont opponent,
said the politics have changed and a final decision has become
increasingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of pressure being applied by outsiders for this
school to be finished,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of that pressure comes from O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, the
powerful downtown law firm being sued for malpractice by the new
board over its advice on key matters related to Belmont, including
the district's decision to buy the tainted property and hire a
developer without competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   In November, O'Melveny &AMP; Myers hired lobbyists from Cerrell &AMP;
Associates to drum up support on the school board to complete
Belmont. Armed with sound bites from environmental pundits, the law
firm has set out to prove the school can be opened safely and
cost-effectively, which in turn would protect its reputation and
sharply reduce its liability.
</P>
<P>
   The board's bold decision to sue O'Melveny was the first fallout
from a scathing internal audit of Belmont by the district's chief
investigator, Don Mullinax.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 14 audit led to the board's decision to remove Koch
and Mason, and contributed to ending Zacarias' career. Eight other
senior employees have been suspended with pay pending disciplinary
hearings. One administrator has quit.
</P>
<P>
   In a second report this month, Mullinax detailed misspending of
millions, sweetheart deals and other financial abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a superintendent who was not willing to accept the new
management structure and need for change,'' Hayes said. ``When you
put a structure in place and you ask a superintendent to make it
work and there is a flat-out refusal from the superintendent, you
have to do what you need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of board votes, Hayes, Young, Lansing and Fields
stood together to first strip Zacarias of authority and then force
him into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The chaotic two-week power shift saw real estate attorney Howard
Miller, who had just been brought in as a facilities czar, elevated
to the newly created post of chief operating officer, and
introduced Ramon C. Cortines as the district's interim
superintendent when Zacarias retired in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   It also left many Latino community leaders, who view Zacarias as
an educational deity, cursing the board's lack of public notice and
perceived lack of respect for their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash, which first materialized in several angry
protests, has spun into organized efforts to break up the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only regret is that the Latino community felt so insulted
by our decision to replace the superintendent,'' Hayes said. ``That
wasn't our intention. That is what happened. I regret that and I
will always regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   The administrative coup also severely damaged an already
strained relationship between the reform foursome and the remaining
members. In the heat of the administrative changes, Castro called
for Hayes to resign as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the schism was momentary and we need to get past it,''
Hayes said. ``I know that I am working very hard and I believe that
Vicky (Castro) is working very hard, as well as everyone else on
the board.''
</P>
<P>
   For student achievement to improve, Tokofsky said, the board
must pull itself together and put aside personality differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to come to an agreement that things will proceed based
upon seven people's input,'' he said. ``Otherwise the collateral
damage caused by not following good process will keep us from our
core mission of improving curriculum, instruction and student
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six months after their retreat, board members still are
finding consensus-building elusive, but they do agree on the need
to find a strong and skilled new superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find a superintendent with a vision to change this
district's culture,'' Young said. ``The history of the last 30
years is that turf battles and bureaucracy has taken precedence
over the kids in the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying that has now stopped--but the bottom line is the
kids still can't read.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully aware that breakup movements are gaining momentum and time
is running short for the LAUSD, board members hope to be able to
replace Cortines with a nontraditional candidate as early as April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that we can change this institution,'' Hayes said.
``We are going to need the public's help. Now is not the time to
give up on the LAUSD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why try to break up the district now? For the first time, we
are improving things and have the best opportunity to use the size
of the district for our advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time to join with us, to help us and to keep
hammering away. We have a long way to go.''

SCHOOL REFORM DERAILED BY HASSLES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Story moves in two takes) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Exactly three weeks after a slate of
reform-minded candidates took control of the Los Angeles school
board, they gathered at a therapeutic residential treatment center
in Hollywood that serves abused and neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   The July 22 sitdown was billed as a daylong retreat that would
help create a bond among the seven board members, and the location
fit poetically with the reformers' accusations that 710,000
children enrolled in the Los Angeles Unified School District had
been mistreated by the past administration.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by a few key downtown administrators, the motley
participants sat around a table, repeatedly complimented each other
and occasionally scribbled down determined but happy mission
statements for the future of the nation's second-largest school
district.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a sign of things to come. And it was, but
in an entirely different way than portrayed at the time by the
smiling faces of the part-time politicians and entrenched
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Busy with more important matters that sunny summer day, Los
Angeles Unified's top business administrator, David Koch, sent a
stand-in rather than attend.
</P>
<P>
   The district's top lawyer, Richard Mason, at one point wryly
refused to share a personal story with the crowd, saying it was
``attorney-client privilege,'' a blatant reference to complaints
that he had been concealing information from the public.
</P>
<P>
   And shortly before lunchtime, Superintendent Ruben Zacarias
walked into the room and looked around. He was an uninvited guest,
well aware that he faced nearly impossible odds to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, the board booted Koch and Mason, and
Zacarias found himself announcing his early retirement--an ousting
eased by a $750,000 golden handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Since sitting in the retreat circle, the reformers' energies
have been consumed by massive administrative problems, financial
abuses, two scathing audits, and the fate of the district's
albatross, the Belmont Learning Center, which sits partially
completed atop an oil field that seeps potentially deadly and
explosive gases.
</P>
<P>
   By their own admission, it has been a long six months, and
actual instructional and curriculum reforms have taken a back seat
to cleaning up the administrative mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in far worse shape than I imagined,'' said board
member Caprice Young, one of four ``reformers'' elected earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In six months, we've made great progress, but clearly we have
a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Board President Genethia Hayes, the strong-willed leader of the
reform majority, agreed, saying: ``I never envisioned any of this
happening so quickly. It was my hope to reorganize and revitalize
the district completely. But if someone had said that in October we
would have been making those major changes, no, I didn't anticipate
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also didn't anticipate finding a district without anything
that even looked like a functioning management structure where
people were being held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated because he couldn't just to appoint a board to fix
Los Angeles' failing public school system, Mayor Richard Riordan
set out to do the next best thing in the closing months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire mayor decided to buy the election.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-May, unprecedented contributions from Riordan and an
elite cadre of businessmen he put together figured prominently in
the successful campaigns of three newcomers--Hayes, Young and Mike
Lansing-- and one incumbent, David Tokofsky.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was simple. Together, the four would form a reform
majority on the seven-member Board of Education. They could get
things done if they stuck together.
</P>
<P>
   Only it didn't work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   At the board's first meeting, Hayes, a new president feeling out
her power, appointed board member Valerie Fields as her second in
command. The move surprised many district insiders who were
confident Tokofsky would receive the post, especially after being
denied the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, Fields increasingly aligned with the three
newcomers, as Tokofsky drifted away, assuming his traditional role
as watchdog and devil's advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Those roles were solidified when Tokofsky opposed the foursome's
decision to oust Zacarias in October, citing a lack of public
notice and poor process, two of the board's biggest problems during
the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised by it because David Tokofsky was
always the one on the board who was the watchdog for the public
about all of the things that he perceived were wrong with the
institution,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then to discover it was Valerie Fields who had the strength
and courage through all of this--David's decision still puzzles me.
I would have thought that David would have understood the necessity
of moving when you have the will of the board ready to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Tokofsky tell it, he made up his mind to bolt the
foursome when he disagreed with Hayes over how to resolve the fate
of Belmont, the nation's costliest high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may share Genethia Hayes' goals,'' Tokofsky said, ``but I
realized we differed strongly on the means to those goals from the
day she wanted to implement that gag order.''
</P>
<P>
   That gag order, which the board would later claim was unofficial
and then concede was unenforceable, was announced July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the board had gone behind closed doors with
the LAUSD administrators to discuss scrapping Belmont. A majority
of the panel had publicly stated they were troubled by the climbing
costs of the unfinished campus and were worried about the safety of
putting kids in a school built on the environmentally troubled
downtown property.

FESTIVAL FOCUSES ON FAMILY, CULTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jesse Hiestand  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Emphasizing family, community and culture, the
seven-day Kwanzaa celebration that begins Sunday (Dec. 26) leads
African-Americans through a deeply reflective week where family and
philosophy overshadow presents.
</P>
<P>
   The few gifts that grace the traditional Kwanzaa table in
celebrants' homes are highly symbolic: books and heritage symbols
showing appreciation for ancient African culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the heart of our celebration of Kwanzaa is the practice of
pausing and turning inward as persons and a people and thinking
deeply about the wonder and obligation of being African in the
world,'' said Maulana Karenga in his annual message.
</P>
<P>
   Karenga founded the celebration in 1966 as a black studies
professor at California State University, Long Beach. The festival
has grown in popularity and is now celebrated by more than 28
million people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa ends Jan. 1 with a feast on the Day of Mediation, a
period of self-questioning that ideally should last throughout the
coming year, which according to the ancient Egyptian calendar is
the year 6240, according to Karenga.
</P>
<P>
   Though a relatively new cultural celebration, Kwanzaa draws on
ancient winter agricultural festivals marking the harvesting of
crops and sharing of good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   A modern-day emphasis on the environment preserves that legacy,
with some Kwanzaa observers using the occasion to clean up their
neighborhoods, parks or beaches, said Chimbuko Tembo of Us, the
nonprofit African-American cultural center which Karenga chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time we stop and take particular appreciation for all
the beauty we have around us in terms of creation and other
people,'' Tembo said. ``It's not a religious holiday, so people who
are followers of traditional African religions, Christmas, black
Jews or Muslims can all come together around our African-ness.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa, which means ``first fruits'' in Swahili, honors seven
principles: unity, self-determination, collective work and
responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Families mark the occasion with five activities, including
reinforcing their bonds, commemorating the past, recommitting to
cultural ideals and celebrating the good life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody of goodwill can certainly appreciate the aspects of
Kwanzaa,'' Tembo said.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional symbols of Kwanzaa are set up on a table that is
first covered with a straw mat symbolizing the foundations of
African culture.
</P>
<P>
   Fruits and vegetables represent crops and the rewards of
collective labor, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A candleholder symbolizes people who continue to live in Africa
and the seven candles represent the seven principles. Ears of corn
are laid out to symbolize children, and a unity cup honoring
ancestors is used to pour libations. Last, the table contains gifts
of books and heritage symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa, an African-American cultural celebration that runs from
Dec. 26 through Jan. 1, honors one of the following seven
principles, translated from Swahili, each night, with the lighting
of a candle:
</P>
<P>
   Umoja _ unity
</P>
<P>
   Kujichagulia _ self-determination
</P>
<P>
   Ujima _ collective work and responsibility
</P>
<P>
   Ujamaa _ cooperative economics
</P>
<P>
   Nia _ purpose
</P>
<P>
   Kuumba _ creativity
</P>
<P>
   Imani _ faith

KNICKS LOSE COOL AND THEN THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Indiana Pacers had enough motivation and
adrenaline Saturday night to push them against a team that stepped
between them and a title in an intense Eastern Conference final
last season without the New York Knicks supplying them with more
venom.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks' Kurt Thomas only served to further rile the
Pacers when he appeared to instigate a skirmish in the third
quarter. What had been a close game was then blown open by the
Pacers, who came together as the Knicks came undone in a 101-90
loss at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks (17-11) were led by Latrell Sprewell's 23 points,
while the Pacers leaned on 26 from Reggie Miller. Allan Houston,
whose night was weighed down with foul trouble, finished with 10
points. The Knicks were at their greatest disadvantage at the
free-throw line. The Knicks had 25 attempts, making 15; the Pacers
had 40 and made 32.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever these teams meet, there is bound to be some
confrontation. Usually, it is just bodies banging and words flying
in the heat of a tense rivalry. But with 8 minutes 52 seconds left
in the third quarter and the Pacers ahead 54-50, Jalen Rose and
Thomas got tangled up running down the floor and their tempers
boiled over.
</P>
<P>
   After the two collided at midcourt and a whistle blew, replays
showed that Rose approached Thomas, who then threw as many as two
forearms at Rose's head. Rose, who was hit in the face, did not
appear to retaliate but was thrown out of the game, along with
Thomas, for fighting. The league's president of basketball
operations, Rod Thorn, will no doubt review the incident and could
suspend Thomas and Rose.
</P>
<P>
   On a night that began so well for the Knicks, the momentum then
shifted and they became unglued as the third quarter slipped away
from them. Suddenly, the Knicks were without a big body, and the
Pacers were down a top scorer and playmaker. As Rose left the floor
with a look of disbelief, the crowd stood in a roar of support.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of buckling without Rose, the Pacers picked up their
intensity while the Knicks unraveled. With four minutes left in the
third quarter, Larry Johnson picked up a technical for arguing a
call and watched Miller hit the technical foul shot to put the
Pacers ahead, 64-56.
</P>
<P>
   With Houston having a miserable night and Sprewell's quick start
a faint memory, the Pacers took a 73-64 lead entering the fourth
quarter. The Knicks' plan had been disposed of by the Pacers, foul
trouble, the ejection of Thomas and the open shots Miller was able
to get.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell tried to defend Miller, as did Chris Childs, but he was
humming along with 21 points through three quarters. The same
Knicks who had begun the game strong were in need of a strong dose
of poise. They were allowing the Pacers to run free on the
perimeter and connect on 3-pointers and not coming back with a
reply.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Knicks were the calm ones. Coach Jeff Van Gundy's
experiment with a big backcourt launched into its third straight
game with its best start yet. With Houston by his side _ and often
feeding him the ball _ Sprewell took advantage of his matchup with
Mark Jackson and then slipped around Miller, too. But Sprewell's
greatest assist came from the multiple misses by the Pacers, who
began the game 1 for 14. A handful of those misses were turned into
transition baskets by Sprewell, who scored 11 of the Knicks' first
13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the mood of the team on their flight here _ which was
described as quiet by Van Gundy, who noted that no one wanted to
spend Christmas Day ``at the Westin Hotel in Indianapolis'' _ the
Knicks shook whatever holiday homesick blues they had and took a
15-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers seemed almost too pumped up in their revenge-seeking
mode after going down to the Knicks in the conference finals last
season. Once the Pacers settled down, things began to change. With
Houston's foul trouble taking the edge off the big lineup, the
aggressive Pacers began getting to the free-throw line, doubling
Sprewell, putting pressure on the ball and coming up with
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby, who defined his young career with his performance
in last year's conference finals, picked up some of the slack with
a couple of nifty post moves; he finished with 13 points and 15
rebounds. But as the Pacers began working the ball into the post
through Rose and Jackson, the Pacers began to make up ground by the
end of the first quarter and trailed by 28-22.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't Miller who brought the Pacers back in the second
quarter, it was Sam Perkins. He was part of a second unit that
caught the Knicks. Getting lost in transition, the lumbering
Perkins sneaked away from the Knicks and popped a 3-pointer to
bring the Pacers within 30-27 with 9:35 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks turned to Johnson for a couple of baskets, but soon
became onlookers to a 16-4 run the Pacers used to take a 48-42
lead. The Pacers' first lead, 43-42, came with 3:18 left in the
half, after Patrick Ewing lost a rebound as he hit the floor. Dale
Davis snatched the ball from his hands and snapped a pass to
Miller, who was fouled on a 3-point shot by Johnson. Miller's shot
did not fall but his three free throws did.

RESCUED CRASH VICTIM IN STABLE CONDITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Orith Goldberg  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For two days, Jolene Rae Donohue lay on the
driver's seat of her car with its roof smashed against her body,
until her rescue that many called a Christmas Eve miracle.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Donohue was listed in serious but stable condition
at Holy Cross Medical Center in suburban Los Angeles, where instead
of focusing on her injuries, she wished others a happy holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' Donohue told a friend. ``Have a Merry Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, her car had rolled down a 70-foot embankment
south of the eastbound 210 Freeway, near the Golden State Freeway
northwest of downtown Los Angeles..
</P>
<P>
   The injured 52-year old Santa Clarita woman went undetected as
thousands of people drove by.
</P>
<P>
   ``(She was) on the outskirts of this giant city and no one saw
her, ``That, to me, is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Friday, a passing motorist stopped near the
embankment and discovered the trapped woman when he briefly walked
away from the road, said Leary.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers had to work about 20 minutes to free Donohue, who
complained of neck pain and being cold, Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was doing really well, ``All of her vital signs were
really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue was last seen a party Wednesday night in La Crescenta.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, her son David, of Sun Valley, filed a missing
person report with the Santa Clarita Sheriff's station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (missing party) was supposed to return home, but has not
shown up, ``The (reporting party) has contacted any relatives she
may have gone to, but nobody has seen or heard from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue was headed to her Santa Clarita home on the westbound
210 freeway, when the green 1998 Mazda 626 she was driving at an
estimated speed of 65 mph crossed the dirt divider for unknown
reasons and traveled the wrong way across the eastbound lanes of
the 210 Freeway, California Highway Patrol officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The car continued into a dirt embankment south of the eastbound
lanes, east of the Golden State Freeway, flipping over and landing
upright about 70 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until passing motorist John Teslich of Stockton
stopped on the freeway about 12:10 p.m. Friday that Donohue was
discovered. Teslich apparently flagged down a UPS driver for help.
</P>
<P>
   Leary was already in the area because there had been some
traffic collisions and stopped when he saw a motorist wave him
down.
</P>
<P>
   Leary said the man he spoke with at the location said he made
contact with Donohue and called her son, who had said his mother
had been missing for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue seemed quite coherent, Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had told me she had been there for two days,'' Leary said.
``I looked at the blood on her face and it was dried and I noticed
the car's engine was cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing she didn't know was where she was and what day
it was, ``She just woke up and there she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Leary and other firefighters quickly went into action,
requesting aid from both Los Angeles County and Los Angeles city
fire departments. About 25 firefighters from both agencies came to
help.
</P>
<P>
   They cut the roof off the car and gently removed Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all worked out...'' Leary said.

   Donohue was last seen a party Wednesday night in La Crescenta.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, her son David, of Sun Valley, filed a missing
person report with the Santa Clarita Sheriff's station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (missing party) was supposed to return home, but has not
shown up, ``The (reporting party) has contacted any relatives she
may have gone to, but nobody has seen or heard from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue was headed to her Santa Clarita home on the westbound
210 freeway, when the green 1998 Mazda 626 she was driving at an
estimated speed of 65 mph crossed the dirt divider for unknown
reasons and traveled the wrong way across the eastbound lanes of
the 210 Freeway, California Highway Patrol officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The car continued into a dirt embankment south of the eastbound
lanes, east of the Golden State Freeway, flipping over and landing
upright about 70 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until passing motorist John Teslich of Stockton
stopped on the freeway about 12:10 p.m. Friday that Donohue was
discovered. Teslich apparently flagged down a UPS driver for help.
</P>
<P>
   Leary was already in the area because there had been some
traffic collisions and stopped when he saw a motorist wave him
down.
</P>
<P>
   Leary said the man he spoke with at the location said he made
contact with Donohue and called her son, who had said his mother
had been missing for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue seemed quite coherent, Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had told me she had been there for two days,'' Leary said.
``I looked at the blood on her face and it was dried and I noticed
the car's engine was cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing she didn't know was where she was and what day
it was, ``She just woke up and there she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Leary and other firefighters quickly went into action,
requesting aid from both Los Angeles County and Los Angeles city
fire departments. About 25 firefighters from both agencies came to
help.
</P>
<P>
   They cut the roof off the car and gently removed Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all worked out...'' Leary said.

HIJACKERS DEMAND THAT INDIA RELEASE CLERIC AND KASHMIRIS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The hijackers of an Indian Airlines flight that was taken on a
15-hour odyssey across three countries before landing in
Afghanistan demanded Saturday that India release a Pakistani
religious leader and several Kashmiri fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, who are believed to be Islamic militants
supportive of Kashmir's independence from India, are holding 161
captives.
</P>
<P>
   As the standoff struggled through its second day, they received
food Saturday at Kandahar in southern Afghanistan and also
threatened to blow up the plane, an A300 Airbus seized while en
route to New Delhi from Nepal. There were conflicting reports on
whether the plane had been refueled.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Taliban, Afghanistan's ruling militia, which
has its headquarters in Kandahar, told the BBC and The Associated
Press that the hijackers were demanding the release of Maulana
Masood Azhar, a Muslim cleric supportive of Kashmiri independence
from Indian rule, and several Kashmiri fighters. All of them are
reportedly being held in Indian jails.
</P>
<P>
   Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, the Taliban's foreign minister, said
that one of the hijackers had identified himself as Azhar's
brother, Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   He said the hijackers, who were armed with grenades, pistols,
and knives when they seized the A300 Airbus, had threatened to blow
up the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, who were armed with grenades, pistols and knives
when they seized the plane, have killed at least one man, and there
were unconfirmed reports of up to four other bodies on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The body of the dead man, whose identity was not certain, was
flown to New Delhi late last night, along with 27 passengers freed
when the plane was in Dubai during its odyssey on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One released passenger reportedly told relatives that the dead
man had ignored orders not to look at the hijackers and was stabbed
by one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban troops were guarding the plane Saturday, but Muttawakil
said the Taliban would not negotiate with the hijackers and
insisted that the United Nations do so instead. The Taliban has
said it will not grant the hijackers asylum, and it has denied any
connection with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want them to stay here and we have told the United
Nations this. They should intervene,'' Muttawakil said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a U.N. spokeswoman said the world body had not
received an official request from the Taliban but ``stands ready to
help in any way they can.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. coordinator for Afghanistan, Erick de Mul, was heading
to Kandahar from Islam- abad, U.N. officials said. He was expected
to arrive Sunday. But the officials said his mission was to provide
``humanitarian aid,'' , not to negotiate with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Indian prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said
his government would not bow to any hijacker demand. India has
asked the Taliban not to let the plane take off again.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling speculation about a possible rescue mission, India's
minister of external affairs, Jaswant Singh, said that he expected
``developments to take shape'' sometime Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim militant secessionists have been waging a bitter and
protracted insurgency in Indian-held Kashmir, demanding either
outright independence for the Himalayan state or union with Islamic
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani government re- leased a statement Saturday con-
demning the hijacking. ``Pakistan condemns all acts of terrorism,
in- cluding hijacking,'' the statement said. ``Pakistan cannot
allow any- body to embroil it in such dastardly acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Azhar, who traveled to India in 1992 to help anti-Indian
militants in Kashmir, belongs to a rich land-owning family in
Pakistan, according to Indian security officials.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in 1994 by Indian security in Anantnag, a small
town in the disputed northern state of Jammu and Kashmir. He is
being held in a high-security jail in Kot Bhalwal, near Jammu, the
state's winter capital.
</P>
<P>
   His group, the Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, which was formerly called
Harakat ul-Ansar, has tried several times to use kidnappings as a
way of freeing him, but failed. In 1995, the group kidnapped six
Western tourists, including one American. One was killed, one
escaped and four are still missing and now feared dead. Their
abductors demanded the release of 21 of their jailed comrades in
return for the six hostages. India refused.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the group claimed responsibility for a grenade
attack in Kashmir that killed three people.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers seized control of the plane shortly after it took
off from Katmandu, Nepal, at 4:25 p.m. local time Friday. The plane
then made stops in India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates
before landing in Kandahar Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Nepal's government Friday suspended all officials on duty at
Katmandu airport at the time of departure, and later reports said
that four airport workers had been arrested in connection with the
hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   India has long described Katmandu as the weak link in air
security in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the customs, immigration, civil aviation and police
officials that were on duty on that shift have been suspended and
face investigation,'' Tourism and Civil Aviation Minister Bijaya
Gachchedar told reporters. He did not give the number of people
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Muttawakil of the Taliban said that he had met two of the
hijackers, and he speculated that they were Kashmiri; passengers
freed in Dubai said that the group of five may also have included
an Afghan and a Nepalese.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports had suggested that the hijackers were Sikhs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sikh Council on Religion and Education, an organization
based in Washington, issued a statement Saturday condemning the
hijacking but also expressing concern about the assumption that the
hijackers are Sikh.
</P>
<P>
   Noting reports that some of the hijackers wore turbans, the
statement said that ``many other ethnic, nationalities and
religious groups wear turbans in Asia.''

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING THIS ROUND UP OF BIG BOOKS) 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

BILL BOWERMAN, 88, NIKE CO-FOUNDER, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)   (rk) 
 By   RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bowerman, a renowned track coach at the University of
Oregon who spawned a revolution in athletic footwear and helped
build a worldwide marketing powerhouse as the co-founder of Nike in
the mid-1960s, died at his home in Fossil, Ore. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Bowerman died in his sleep late Friday or early Saturday,
according to a Nike spokesman, Scott Reames.
</P>
<P>
   From 1917, when Keds, the first popularly marketed sneaker, was
introduced, until the 1960s, sports footwear underwent little
change. Then came the team of Bowerman and Phil Knight, a former
runner at Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Bowerman and Knight sought to develop athletic shoes that were
lighter and had more traction than long-standing designs. Propelled
by the waffle-soled shoes designed by Bowerman and by astute
marketing, and buoyed by the explosion of interest in running and
physical fitness in the 1970s, they built Nike, based in Beaverton,
Ore., into the world's leading athletic shoe and sports apparel
maker. It became a multibillion-dollar company, endorsed by
superstars like Michael Jordan and recognized around the world for
its swoosh logo.
</P>
<P>
   In Bowerman's 24 years at the University of Oregon, he won four
N CAA track and field championships, and he coached 44
all-Americans and 19 Olympians, most notably distance runner Steve
Prefontaine.
</P>
<P>
   A descendant of pioneers on the Oregon Trail in the 1840s,
Bowerman was born in Portland, Ore., and raised in Fossil and
Medford, Ore. He ran track and played football at Oregon, coached
at a high school in Medford and then served as an officer in Italy
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Bowerman became the track coach at Oregon, where Bill
Hayward had coached from 1904 until 1947. A man with a commanding
presence, Bowerman seemingly overlooked no detail, even
hand-crafting his athletes' shoes, as he built his own reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Bowerman went into business with Knight, a
middle-distance runner under him in the late 1950s, each putting
$500 into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports. That year, they sold
1,300 pairs of Tiger running shoes imported from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Following a dispute with the Japanese manufacturer, they began
designing their own shoes in 1971, contracting with Asian
factories. They renamed their company Nike _ for the Greek goddess
of victory _ and adopted the swoosh.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Bowerman developed the waffle outsole, the
outgrowth of an experiment in which he poured a rubber compound
onto his wife's waffle iron.
</P>
<P>
   The first waffle shoes were introduced at the 1972 U.S. Olympic
Trials in Eugene, Ore. _ home of the University of Oregon. This
forerunner was called the Moon Shoe, probably because the
distinctive impression it made in the dirt was akin to Neil
Armstrong's footprint on the moon three years before.
</P>
<P>
   The rubber studs of the waffle sole brought a springiness
welcomed not only by world-class athletes, but also by amateurs.
The shoes, as Time magazine put it, were ``soon grabbed by the army
of weekend jocks suffering from bruised feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowerman coached the U.S. men's track team at the 1972 Olympics
in Munich at which Israeli athletes and coaches were massacred by
Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The track team had a disappointing performance _ Prefontaine
finished fourth in the 5,000 meters _ and Bowerman would call those
Games the ``worst experience I've had in my entire educational and
athletic life.'' The following March, he retired from coaching, but
he remained with Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always trying to figure out ways to make a shoe
lighter,'' Knight, Nike's chairman, would recall. ``He figured
carrying one extra ounce for a mile was equivalent to carrying
something like an extra thousand pounds in the last 50 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowerman served on Nike's board from 1968 until June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by by his wife, Barbara; three sons, Jon, Jay and
Tom, and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Nike announced it would display a silhouette of
Bowerman in his familiar Tyrolean hat on its Nike running shoes.
The swoosh will still be there, but smaller.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, with the running boom showing no signs of abating,
Bowerman took some credit. He said the average running shoe gave
about half as much weight to lift with every step as those worn in
the early 1960s. As he put it, ``You can bet there wouldn't be so
many people running today if they had to carry all the extra
baggage we had back then.''

NEW BRUINS SAME AS OLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They have a new lineup, they've got a new offense,
they're more mature, and they're bigger and stronger. But after
eight games, the season already feels familiar _ like the UCLA
Bruins are once again destined for 20 wins, third place in the
Pacific-10 and an underachieving performance in the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they're talented enough to win their home games and beat
mediocre teams on the road. But based on what they've shown so far,
the Bruins won't be challenging for the Pac-10 title anytime soon,
and it appears they'll struggle against disciplined, well-coached
teams in the Tournament. Like Miami. Like Detroit Mercy. Like
Gonzaga. Like Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive season, the Bruins' practice habits
are poor, their fundamentals are lacking, and their half-court
offense is on life support.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't run the new system (the ``1-4 high'') any better
than they executed their freewheeling motion offense from 1997-99.
</P>
<P>
   Proof is in the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Of UCLA's eight opponents, four were outmanned: Fairfield, Iona,
Morgan State and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Two more, DePaul and South Florida, were athletic but poorly
coached teams that engaged the Bruins in a frenzied, fast-breaking
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Only Gonzaga and Colorado State forced UCLA to execute its
offense against fundamentally sound, well-designed defenses. In
both cases, the Bruins failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   They scored 43 points against Gonzaga, a record-low in Pauley
Pavilion, and 54 against Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   They had 15 assists and 28 turnovers in the two games combined.
</P>
<P>
   They shot 32 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers translate to embarrassment in Maples Pavilion and
McKale Center. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The 1-4 attack is highly structured. Using screens and passes,
it's designed to spread the defense and funnel the ball to center
Dan Gadzuric and power forward Jerome Moiso in the low post. If the
defense plays man-to-man, Gadzuric and Moiso look to score. If the
defense double-teams, they pass to open 3-point shooters.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great concept. But the reality is that no offense
predicated on structure, precision and skill is going to work for
the Bruins, at least as they are currently composed. If they had
five Jason Kaponos, then fine. He's skilled enough to handle it.
The 1-4 also works reasonably for Moiso, although he's more
comfortable 12 feet from the basket than six.
</P>
<P>
   But a structured offense does not work for point guard Earl
Watson, shooting guard Ray Young or Gadzuric, and that's 60 percent
of the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   __When Watson is roaming the court, scoring from the wings,
rebounding and creating havoc with his tenacity, he's an
all-conference player.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Tyus Edney, Cameron Dollar and Baron Davis, Watson is
not a natural point guard. He's shackled by any system that demands
exactitude and restricts his ability to improvise. Often, he seems
frustrated by the 1-4 high.
</P>
<P>
   __Young, much like former Bruin Toby Bailey, is a fabulous
athlete who's unstoppable on the fast break or slashing to the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   But the half-court offense is short on slashing and long on
skill. Young is an inconsistent perimeter shooter (like Bailey),
he's a sloppy passer into the low post, and he hasn't shown he can
score off the dribble. He, too, seems better suited to the motion
attack.
</P>
<P>
   __Gadzuric is great on the offensive boards, he can dunk with
the best of them, and he'll even hit an occasional jumper. But give
him the ball in the post with his back to the basket and a quality
defender on his hip _ that's what the offense calls for, after all
_ and he has no answers.
</P>
<P>
   Why? In 15 months at UCLA, Gadzuric has not developed one
effective low-post move. Not a jump hook, not a turnaround,
nothing. Clearly, bad habits are to blame. Ninety minutes before a
recent game, Gadzuric was seen hoisting left-handed 3-point shots
toward the west basket of Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   He did this for 10-15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford will let him take all the 3-pointers he wants.
</P>
<P>
   The man-to-man isn't UCLA's only problem. Its zone offense was
as inert against Gonzaga as it was against Detroit Mercy in the
NCAA Tournament nine months prior. It's no surprise: attacking a
zone requires precision and skill, crisp passes, hard screens,
off-the-ball movement and deft perimeter shooting _ qualities the
Bruins display when the fancy strikes them. &QL; 
X X X
</P>
<P>
   At this point, two weeks before Pac-10 play begins, the Bruins
have three options:
</P>
<P>
   They can scrap the 1-4 high and return to the motion attack.
This seems unlikely, both for practical purposes _ it's a bit late
to start over _ and for the panic message it would send.
</P>
<P>
   They can maintain their current standards and habits, beat bad
teams, struggle against mediocre teams, lose to good teams and
never seriously challenge Arizona and Stanford for the Pac-10
title.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can join the elite. This requires a massive shift in
approach and execution, but it's not impossible. To do it, the
Bruins must improve their fundamentals and sharpen their practice
habits, which means correcting mistakes that are often overlooked:
stupid passes, sloppy screens, bad footwork and bad shots.
</P>
<P>
   The alley-oop, for instance, works one time in four, yet Watson
and Ryan Bailey try it again and again. Young continually throws
errant passes in games because he throws them in practice. The
Bruins leave their feet on defense in games because they feet their
feet in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Romar, the former UCLA assistant and Pepperdine coach,
once told a story of his summer as an assistant on an all-star team
coached by Utah mastermind Rick Majerus. Majerus was such a detail
freak, Romar said, that he'd berate players for taking shots one
inch closer to the basket than designated.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's staff doesn't need Majerus' temper, but greater attention
to detail in practice would help the Bruins execute better in games
_ especially against fundamentally sound, well-prepared opponents
who feast on every mistake.
</P>
<P>
   So no, the Bruins' destiny is not locked in a 20-10, third-place
vault. Their postseason fate is not sealed in a half-court cell.
There's plenty of time to join the elite, but they had better get
busy.

FESTIVAL FOCUSES ON FAMILY, CULTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jesse Hiestand  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Emphasizing family, community and culture, the
seven-day Kwanzaa celebration that begins today leads
African-Americans through a deeply reflective week where family and
philosophy overshadow presents.
</P>
<P>
   The few gifts that grace the traditional Kwanzaa table in
celebrants' homes are highly symbolic: books and heritage symbols
showing appreciation for ancient African culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the heart of our celebration of Kwanzaa is the practice of
pausing and turning inward as persons and a people and thinking
deeply about the wonder and obligation of being African in the
world,'' said Maulana Karenga in his annual message.
</P>
<P>
   Karenga founded the celebration in 1966 as a black studies
professor at California State University, Long Beach. The festival
has grown in popularity and is now celebrated by more than 28
million people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa ends Jan. 1 with a feast on the Day of Mediation, a
period of self-questioning that ideally should last throughout the
coming year, which according to the ancient Egyptian calendar is
the year 6240, according to Karenga.
</P>
<P>
   Though a relatively new cultural celebration, Kwanzaa draws on
ancient winter agricultural festivals marking the harvesting of
crops and sharing of good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   A modern-day emphasis on the environment preserves that legacy,
with some Kwanzaa observers using the occasion to clean up their
neighborhoods, parks or beaches, said Chimbuko Tembo of Us, the
nonprofit African-American cultural center which Karenga chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time we stop and take particular appreciation for all
the beauty we have around us in terms of creation and other
people,'' Tembo said. ``It's not a religious holiday, so people who
are followers of traditional African religions, Christmas, black
Jews or Muslims can all come together around our African-ness.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa, which means ``first fruits'' in Swahili, honors seven
principles: unity, self-determination, collective work and
responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Families mark the occasion with five activities, including
reinforcing their bonds, commemorating the past, recommitting to
cultural ideals and celebrating the good life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody of goodwill can certainly appreciate the aspects of
Kwanzaa,'' Tembo said.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional symbols of Kwanzaa are set up on a table that is
first covered with a straw mat symbolizing the foundations of
African culture.
</P>
<P>
   Fruits and vegetables represent crops and the rewards of
collective labor, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A candleholder symbolizes people who continue to live in Africa
and the seven candles represent the seven principles. Ears of corn
are laid out to symbolize children, and a unity cup honoring
ancestors is used to pour libations. Last, the table contains gifts
of books and heritage symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Kwanzaa, an African-American cultural celebration that runs from
Dec. 26 through Jan. 1, honors one of the following seven
principles, translated from Swahili, each night, with the lighting
of a candle:
</P>
<P>
   Umoja _ unity
</P>
<P>
   Kujichagulia _ self-determination
</P>
<P>
   Ujima _ collective work and responsibility
</P>
<P>
   Ujamaa _ cooperative economics
</P>
<P>
   Nia _ purpose
</P>
<P>
   Kuumba _ creativity
</P>
<P>
   Imani _ faith

GROUND BEEF IS RECALLED FOR E. COLI
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ark., La., Tenn., Fla., N.M.)  (rk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A beef processing company that had consistently failed the
Agriculture Department's new safety standards announced Saturday
that it was recalling 180,000 pounds of ground beef that might
contain a deadly form of the E. coli bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Supreme Beef Processors of Dallas, said the
Agriculture Department notified it Saturday that one sample of the
beef tested positive for E. coli O157:H7. No illnesses were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department had tried to close the company's
processing plant on Nov. 30, but a federal judge said he had to
decide whether the government had the authority to enforce the new
food safety standards. The agency does not have the authority to
force a recall.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling on Dec. 10, the judge, A. Joe Fish of U.S. District
Court in Dallas, said meat from the plant had not caused any
outbreaks of food poisoning and that if the plant were shut down
the company would be out of business. The ruling came in a lawsuit
by Supreme Beef challenging the agriculture agency's authority to
conduct the new tests.
</P>
<P>
   Food safety experts say the recall could have important
ramifications for the lawsuit and ultimately for the government's
authority to perform bacterial testing. The outcome of the case
could determine whether the new system will remain in effect or
whether the Agriculture Department will be forced to return to
methods no better than the poke-and-sniff system that have been in
effect since the beginning of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled ground beef was sold in 1-, 2- and 5-pound packages
with a sell date of Dec. 28 or earlier in Texas, Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Florida and New
Mexico. Consumers can return Supreme Beef Processors or Spiritas
Farms packages with the establishment number 7143 to stores for
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, before the recall, two large retailers who buy ground
beef from Supreme, Wal-Mart and Albertson's, said they were
continuing to do business with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Allen, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, said last week: ``We are
relying on USDA to do their job and inspect and approve beef and we
are not going to carry anything they don't inspect and approve.
They are not being forced to approve an unsafe product. If it is
unsafe why isn't there a recall?''
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Beef supplied 45 percent of the ground beef used in the
national school lunch program until Nov. 30, when the Agriculture
Department canceled its contract with the company, saying the beef
did not meet the agency's minimum standards.
</P>
<P>
   Under the government's tougher science-based standards for meat
and poultry that went into effect in 1995, Supreme Beef had failed
three tests for salmonella contamination in eight months. The tests
for salmonella are the government's only check to ensure that a
plant is following the new regulations. Supreme Beef is the only
company that failed three tests since the regulations went into
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the Center
for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group in
Washington, said the recall showed ``that where there's smoke
there's fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``High salmonella rates indeed point out plants at risk for
producing adulterated meat,'' she said. ``Supreme Beef should
withdraw their lawsuit challenging salmonella testing.''
</P>
<P>
   After the judge's ruling on Dec. 10, Steven A. Spiritas, the
president and chief executive officer of the company said, ``The
department had no justification to take action against our company
when we are producing safe and wholesome meat products.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Spiritas said: ``The recall is not related to our
ongoing dispute with USDA over its salmonella performance standard.
We voluntarily issued the recall because of our concern about food
safety. However the salmonella standard is not about food safety.''
Salmonella, he said ``has nothing to do with the safety of the meat
we produce.''
</P>
<P>
   From 50 to 100 Americans die from this form of E. coli every
year. The most vulnerable are the very young and the very old and
others with weakened immune systems. Americans became aware of the
bacterium's virulence when four children died after eating
undercooked hamburger at Jack in the Box restaurants, primarily
near Seattle, in 1993. Last summer, two people died and more than
600 people became ill from E. coli poisoning linked to well water
at the Washington County Fair in New York.

KNIGHT'S COURT TIME COULD BE LIMITED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Travis Knight's season, derailed twice by ankle
problems, started anew Saturday, and now he'll face a tougher
hurdle: finding playing time.
</P>
<P>
   With his 7-foot frame, Knight would seem an asset on a Los
Angeles Lakers team lacking big men. But coach Phil Jackson is
happy with his current rotation and doesn't foresee many minutes
for Knight, who was activated from the injured list prior to tipoff
against the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I'd play him, actually, to be honest with
you,'' Jackson said. ``Right now John (Salley) is doing a decent
job backing up Shaquille (O'Neal) for the six or eight minutes (per
game).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Shaquille sitting out 12 or 15 minutes a game
unless it's an injury that would sideline him, and then it would be
a matter of concern for us. But we have a pretty good rotation
right now. And we're pleased with the nine-, 10-man rotation that
we're getting on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight's other position is power forward, but Jackson has a nice
one-two punch with A.C. Green and Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least now, I can move and I can give coach some options,''
Knight said. ``Before, I wasn't really an option, but now
hopefully. ...''
</P>
<P>
   He also hopes the sprained right ankle that has dogged him since
the exhibition season is fully healed this time. Knight suffered
the injury Oct. 13 but avoided starting the season on the injured
list. Playing the first month, instead of rehabbing, proved to be a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it felt good when I did come back, and it was my
decision to come back,'' said Knight, who averaged 5.1 minutes in
15 games. ``Sometimes you want to play so bad that you end up
making a mistake, which is unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The ankle ``feels a lot better'' this time, Knight said. ``The
time off (15 days) just gave it a chance to heal, get some of the
scar tissue out, and that helped a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Jackson still feels undermanned at center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have a backup center,'' he said ``I think
everybody (in the front office) thinks that would be important for
us, to have another big body on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Big assist: Derek Fisher had extra incentive to set up his
teammates Saturday _ every assist meant $2,000 for Big Brothers of
Greater Los Angeles. Fisher pledged $1,000 per assist, with a
dollar-for-dollar match from the Lakers Youth Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   A little extra pressure to dish the ball? ``Actually, yes,''
Fisher said before tipoff. ``I'm always looking to make the extra
pass anyway, but tonight will definitely have a much more special
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Fisher said he planned to make a significant
donation no matter his assist total.

HOSPITALS PREPARE FOR ALL THE POSSIBILITIES
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-TIMESSQUARE-SECURE) 
(rk) 
 By   JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, the
biohazard suits have been fitted, and the decontamination showers
have found an outdoor home near the emergency room bay. Almost two
dozen doctors, nurses and other hospital staff members have been
through a rigorous two-day training program in protecting
themselves and treating victims of a chemical weapons attack,
should they be wheeled into the emergency room on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal law enforcement agents stress that they are
not expecting such a terrorist attack, but many of the New York
region's hospitals say they have prepared their emergency rooms for
that possibility. For instance, they have stockpiled antibiotics to
treat victims of an anthrax attack, bought special equipment and
prepared ventilated rooms so that a victim of a chemical attack
cannot contaminate other patients inside.
</P>
<P>
   Many hospitals have quietly been adopting procedures and
equipment to deal with terrorist attacks since the World Trade
Center bombing in 1993. But on the eve of the year 2000, which some
security experts say may be a tempting opportunity for terrorists,
hospitals like Maimonides are enhancing their procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton warned Americans to be on guard for
such attacks, after the indictment of an Algerian man who the
federal authorities say tried to enter Washington state from Canada
carrying bomb-making materials.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Steven Davidson, the chairman of the department of
emergency medicine at Maimonides, in Borough Park, said:
``Candidly, I think all of us need to recognize that there will be
people who are seeking publicity and acting inappropriately, and
New Year's Eve is the time they might do it. I think it is prudent
to make appropriate provisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential terrorist attacks are among many disasters that local
hospitals have considered for that night. Most have run several
drills that test backup plans should the electricity and telephone
lines fail; backup generators, emergency phones and radio systems
are in place. Hospital officials also say they are ready if there
is a loss of water.
</P>
<P>
   The role of hospitals will be so crucial that night, not because
of the things that can but probably will not happen, but because of
what will most likely come their way, like dozens of cases of
alcohol poisoning. Staff levels will be higher than in memory for
the holiday. Almost all of the local hospitals' chief executives
and administrators will be on hand, hospital press officials said,
and medical staffing will be roughly 10 to 25 percent above normal,
with plenty of others on call.
</P>
<P>
   But chemical warfare and plane crashes or other transportation
calamities are not as high on the list of potential worries as are
computer problems and failures of systems like power or
communications, hospital administrators say. Most New York
hospitals already pride themselves on having busy and sophisticated
emergency rooms that are ready at all times for huge disasters;
their press officials often take pains to brag about the hospitals'
roles in responding to catastrophes. Potential technical foul-ups,
however, are what most operations people in every industry have
focused on in preparation for the year 2000 changeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have clearly planned for a disruption in communications,''
said Susan Waltman, general counsel for the Greater New York
Hospital Association. ``We have satellite telephones, 800-megahertz
radios, and there is a hospital channel in the mayor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Hospital Center has stocked extra intravenous
fluids and other medicines, and has trained doctors from other
parts of the hospital in how to handle a terrorist emergency by
using volunteer victims splayed out on stretchers.
</P>
<P>
   At NYU Downtown Hospital in Lower Manhattan, disposable thermal
blankets for newborns were ordered in the event of a power failure,
and ``Last Shift of the Century'' T-shirts were ordered in the
event of a fashion emergency. ``All of senior management is on duty
and on site that night,'' said Ellen Karasik, the hospital's
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Many hospitals declined to discuss their preparations for a
potential terrorist attack. Ms. Waltman of the hospital association
said, ``One of the rules of emergency preparation is not to talk
publicly on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's Office of Emergency Management has been working
with hospitals for two years, preparing them for just such an
attack, said Jerome M. Hauer, director of the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to build their infrastructure for
bioterrorism,'' Hauer said, ``but not in any way solely focused on
New Year's Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals have been trained in how to identify symptoms and
illnesses in a biological attack, and in decontamination procedures
in the event of chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
   But medical staffs would be much more stymied by a biological
attack, in which illnesses are released into the environment in
some covert way, medical and terrorism experts say. Illnesses
resulting from bioterrorism often seem like the flu or some other
disease and are therefore hard to identify and immediately contain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any scenario with biological agents is contingent on forward
or heightened surveillance,'' said Lisandro Irizarry, head of
emergency medicine at the Brooklyn Hospital Center, which has
campuses in Fort Greene and Prospect Park South.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have four or five or six patients who suddenly show up
with pneumonia, that may tip you,'' he said. ``So would early cases
of influenza.''
</P>
<P>
   Many hospital administrators are taking it all in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in a permanent state of heightened readiness
since the World Trade Center bombing,'' said Myrna A. Manners, a
spokeswoman for New York Presbyterian Hospital. ``All of the
essential staff are on alert and prepared.''
