<HEADLINE> Egyptian President's Attacker to Be Tried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Mustafa Hamza, suspected of
masterminding a 1995 assassination bid against Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, will be tried in absentia for
planning a series of deadly attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian State Supreme Security Court today decided to
adjourn until September 1 the trial of Hamza along with 21 other
members of the military wing of the Gamaa Islamiya, the main armed
fundamentalist group in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The court, whose verdicts cannot be appealed, made the decision
after listening to the testimony of two state security
investigation officers as witnesses for the prosecution today, the
Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 22 have been accused of planning attacks on senior
government officials, police and tourists between June 1994 and
March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Other charges include the foundation of an illegal group aimed
at ruining the constitution, precluding public authorities from
exercising their duties and assaulting freedoms and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Hamza, two other defendants, Atef Abdel Aziz and
Mohammed Mustafa Hassan, are still at large.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill of indictment, Hamza sent orders and
funds to the group from Sudan, where he has taken refuge. But
Khartoum says Hamza is no longer in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Before they could carry out the attacks, 19 of the militants
were arrested from March 1995 onward in the Cairo and Delta areas
and in the southern Egyptian province of Minya.
</P>
<P>
Hamza, who is considered Gamaa Islamiya's military chief
abroad, was sentenced to death in absentia in 1993 for involvement
in the assassination attempt against Information Minister Safwat
Al Sherif.
</P>
<P>
He is one of three Egyptians whose extradition from Sudan has
been demanded by the U.N. Security Council so they can be tried in
Addis Ababa for the June 1995 assassination attempt on Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
In the incident, five or six gunmen shot at Mubarak's motorcade
shortly after arriving in Addis Ababa on June 26, before he
returned home safe on the same day.

<HEADLINE> British Government Probes HK Governor Patten: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- An investigation has begun in the
British government into allegations that former Governor of Hong
Kong Chris Patten leaked classified intelligence documents, a
government minister said today.
</P>
<P>
"All I know is that the issue...rather the individual is under
investigation by the authorities," Minister Without Portfolio
Peter Mandelson told BBC Radio.
</P>
<P>
"That will be done in a proper, objective and authoritative
way," Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
Confirmation of the official probe came after The Sunday Times
said Foreign Office officials are pressing for Patten to be
prosecuted under Britain's Official Secrets Act. It said MI6,
Britain's overseas security service, is investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said authorities "have no alternative but to
investigate it when allegations are made that secret intelligence
material has been passed to individuals outside."
</P>
<P>
"It would be irresponsible for the government not to take the
action when there appears to have been a leak of intelligence
material of this kind," he added.

ATHENS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Ato Boldon of Trinidad slowed his
tempo with 40 meters to go but he was still quick enough to lead the
first semifinal group with a time of 10.00 seconds at the 6th World
Athletics Championships here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old rising star, who shocked the world yesterday in the

In the second semifinal, Maurice Green of the United States clocked
9.90 ahead of Donovan Bailey of Canada, 9.91, and Frank Fredericks of
Namibia, 9.93.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, world record holder and Olympic champion, and Green, whose
best time is 9.90, are also gold medal hopefuls in the showdown.

<HEADLINE> EU to Conditionally Allow GSP for Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
expressed its readiness to accept some derogation from rules of
origin in importing Bangladeshi garment products on some
conditions, an official handout said here today.
</P>
<P>
The EC's acceptance, on condition of withdrawal of erroneous
GSP (generalized system of preference) certificates from 1993-96,
came today in response to a letter from Bangladeshi Commerce and
Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed, said the handout.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been enjoying the GSP facilities in the EU
countries since 1986 with duty-free entry without any quota
restrictions. But the products must be made of indigenous
materials to get the facilities.
</P>
<P>
In case of knitwear, as per rules of the GSP, entrepreneurs may
import raw materials like wool and cotton but they must go through
three stages like preparing yarn and fabrics for knitwear
products.
</P>
<P>
The EU, however, imposed some restrictions on exporting
knitwear from Bangladesh late last year on a plea that about 8,000
forged GSP certificates were issued to some knitwear exporters who
have not gone through three-stage local transformation.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from Bangladesh led by Tofail Ahmed visited
Brussels in January this year and called on the EC to consider
relaxation of the country of origin rule.
</P>
<P>
On July 29, Tofail in his letter again urged the EU to find
some ways, if necessary at political level, to resolve the
problems with a flexible attitude.
</P>
<P>
EC official Mario Monti in his letter to Tofail said the EU is
ready to accept a two-stage local transformation instead of the
three-stage one provided the GSP system is applied correctly in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, according to official sources, has yet to decide on
this critical issue because of the apprehension that once the
forged GSP certificates were officially admitted, this will not
only create image problem for Bangladeshi exporters but also may
make them liable to pay compensation.

<HEADLINE> Flood Danger Eases in Eastern Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The threat of massive flooding in
eastern Germany has eased for the first time since nearly three
weeks ago as water levels began to recede slowly overnight along
the whole stretch of the swollen Oder River on the German-Polish
border.
</P>
<P>
But local officials stressed that the situation remained
dangerous because water mass continued to put high pressure on the
waterlogged dikes.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers and soldiers were still working hard to repair
leaks in water defenses throughout the most vulnerable Oderbruch
region in the north as the latest reports said that two new cracks
were discovered in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It would take at least another week for floodwaters to fall to
a safe level, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The flood over the past weeks has ravaged thousands of homes
and claimed the lives of 105 people in Poland and the Czech
Repubic. Germany has so far escaped the worst of the disaster with
only several villages flooded but no casualties.

<HEADLINE> PNA Tries Hard to Prevent Violent Attack: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
said today that the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is doing
everything in its power to prevent Islamic extremists from
launching violent attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security
Service in the West Bank, told reporters that the PNA has done
more than Israel is aware of, according to a report of the
state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
However, he declared that the PNA will not accept dictates
from the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub said that in order to wipe out terrorism, Israel must
back up and support PNA President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the Israeli and Palestinian security
officials are working together to investigate the double suicide
bombing in Jerusalem Wednesday. A total of 13 Israelis were
killed and some 170 injured in the terror attack.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub said that the current situation is not suitable for a
full resumption of security cooperation between the two sides,
which broke off after Israel began construction of the Har Homa
Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub's counterpart in the Gaza Strip, Mohammed Dahlan, said
in Gaza Saturday that the Palestinians would not take orders from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Palestinian side has cut off
security coordination with Israel. He added that such
cooperation would not resume until Israel implements agreements
it signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bank of England Governor Might Be Reappointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Eddie George's term as governor of
the Bank of England still has a year to run, but candidates are
already queuing up to become his successor.
</P>
<P>
Mervyn King, the bank's director of economics, has made no
secret of his desire to become governor. Gavyn Davies, head of
economics at Goldman Sachs and a close adviser to Chancellor
Gordon Brown, has also been linked with the post.
</P>
<P>
However, reports here today said that Prime Minister Tony Blair
has intervened to end speculation that Eddie George will be
replaced as Bank of England governor.
</P>
<P>
Treasury insiders say the prime minister has accepted City and
business advice that George's continued role as governor is an
essential prerequisite for financial stability and economic policy
credibility.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed in the City that Blair's intervention
put an end to a campaign to insert Gavyn Davies as governor, but
the campaign to secure a governor who is perceived to be more
Treasury-friendly has not fizzled out altogether.
</P>
<P>
There is mounting speculation that George will be reappointed
for two years rather than the full term. The prospect of
appointment to governor in the year 2000 is thought to be
sufficiently tantalizing to retain the interest of potential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
However, City specialists said a two-year appointment would be
illegal under current legislation. The law dictates that the
governor must be appointed by the queen on the prime minister's
recommendation for a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
A two-year appointment could only be secured by a side deal
involving a promise from the governor that he would retire less
than half way through his second term.
</P>
<P>
Before the general election, George, who will be 60 next year,
hinted that he may not want to serve a second full term. Recently,
however, he has made it clear he is determined to serve a full
five years.
</P>
<P>
Confirmation that George is to be reappointed as governor will
bring relief to the City and financial markets, which had become
uneasy at the speculation apparently designed to undermine his
position.
</P>
<P>
George has received public and private backing from the
international banking community. It is this pressure that has
forced Blair to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the decision by Blair to take such an
active interest in the appointment is being interpreted in some
quarter as a sign of growing tension between the prime minister
and the chancellor.

<HEADLINE> Housing Prices in UK at 8-Year Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Housing prices in Britain are at
their highest level since 1989 and have risen by 1.8 percent since
June, according to Nationwide's house-price index.
</P>
<P>
Housing prices are now 12.2 percent higher than they were this
time last year. The increase is greatest in London and has been
caused predominantly by a shortage of properties in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Sales throughout the country, however, are "historically" low
at the moment, said Nationwide, but are expected to improve over
the next few months as higher prices encourage more properties on
to the market.
</P>
<P>
Paul Sanderson, Nationwide's head of research, said there were
already signs of this happening in London, reinforced by a sharp
decline in negative-equity cases.
</P>
<P>
"First-time buyers who were able to buy better houses and
leapfrog the cheaper properties in the 1980s are now being pushed
further downmarket," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sanderson said that the market was not as strong as the price
rises suggested and said the increase in house prices was expected
to drop to 9 percent by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Weis Wins Men's Hammer Gold in World Athletics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Heinz Weis of Germany tossed 81.78
meters to win the men's hammer gold medal at the 6th World Athletics
Championships here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The German, who set the year's best mark of 83.04 before the meet,
beat Andrey Skvaruk of Ukraine on the final round with his mighty
winner. Skvaruk, who led the first five outings, finished second at
81.46, his best mark this year.
</P>
<P>
Vasiliy Sidorenko of Russia, the 1994 European champion, took the
bronze with a 80.76 heave, well out of his season's best 82.90.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Balazs Kiss of Hungary wound up fourth at 79.96.
World silver medallist Igor Astapkovich of Belarus was beaten into
fifth place at 79.70.
</P>
<P>
Weis beamed after the victory, saying:"With my new coach I have
learned to take high risks and still retain a perfect throw. That is
the secret of my victory. This helped me get over my first weak throw,
which we all had because of the long pause between warming up and
competition."
</P>
<P>
Skvaruk said that the start of the final showed that all the
competitors were very nervous. "Now I have nearly lost my voice by
supporting the flight of my hammer. Each time after my throw, I
shouted 'go, go, fly, fly!' I will celebrate after going home."

<HEADLINE> Go-slow by Air Traffic Controllers Continues in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Air traffic services in three
major airports in Kenya were today still paralyzed following a
go-slow over pay rise by air traffic controllers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Several airlines, both local and international, were forced to
cancel their flights and travellers were stranded at the airports
in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu.
</P>
<P>
Clearance to land for Arriving flights were delayed for
several hours and some flights were even diverted to neighboring
Tanzania, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
Air transport services were plunged into complete confusion
after the air traffic controllers downed tools at midnight of
last Friday, three days after their meteorological department
counterparts went on strike.
</P>
<P>
One of the striking controllers said, "our key demand is that
the basic salary of an air controller should be 261,000 Kenyan
Shillings (about 4,300 U.S. Dollars) here in Kenya."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our strike indefinitely until our demands
are met," he added.

BEIRUT, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops raided two

guns today, official Lebanon News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But, the report did not say if there were any casualties.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the attacks, the Israeli troops and their
militia allies, the South Lebanon Army, blockaded the village of
Marun el-Ras, which borders northern Israel, and arrested nine
villagers, including two girls.
</P>
<P>
They also searched their homes, and set up a checkpoint
at the entrance of the village, forbidding them from coming in

</P>
<P>
Lebanese security officials said that Israeli troops recently
found dozens of mines planted near the village and more than
40 rockets.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of victims of air
crashes in Russia totaled 66 in the first half of the year against
35 killed in four air crashes in the same period of 1996, the
Russian Federal Aviation Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax cited the service as saying the majority of air
accidents were registered in the southern and central regions of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Service experts said human error still
accounted for the majority of air accidents, or 79 percent, while
malfunctions in aircraft equipment accounted for 17 percent of air
accidents.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase flight safety, Russia should adopt a
federal law on a state system to ensure the safety of flights of
civil aircraft aimed at raising the role of the state in managing
air transport under new economic conditions, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of such a law, they noted, would help stabilize
the level of safety of flights and aviation services within the
next three to four years.

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeking Links With Ukrainian Navy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Council Secretary
Yuri Baturin said today that the main tasks of the Russian Black
Sea Fleet during military reform are to increase its combat
readiness and step up interaction with the Ukrainian navy.
</P>
<P>
The key problem is not reform itself but the implementation of
the agreements signed by the Russian and Ukrainian prime
ministers in Kiev on May 28, the Interfax news agency quoted
Baturin as saying.
</P>
<P>
"After everything (as regards the Black Sea Fleet) is divided,
it is necessary to learn how to interact," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Baturin noted Russia and Ukraine have so far not settled
problems pertaining to the air navigation servicing of Black Sea
Fleet ships and air power, navigation support in the Black Sea and
the Sea of Azov, the distribution of radio frequencies and the
recognition of the Black Sea Fleet's ownership rights to housing
in Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
Baturin said that he disagreed to the statements that after its
division, the Black Sea Fleet had ceased to be a military unit to
be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
"During the fleet's division, 388 of the 525 ships and vessels
were passed on to Russia. Fifty of the 68 military ships became
Russian," he said.
</P>
<P>
The fleet is not only ships but also infrastructure, Baturin
said, adding that "the Russian fleet's corresponding interests in
Sevastopol have been ensured."

<HEADLINE> AIDS Spreading in Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Republican Center
for the prevention of AIDS, Valery Glozovsky, said today that the
HIV infection is spreading rapidly in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported from Minsk, capital of
Belarus, that last year alone, the number of HIV-positive cases
diagnosed rose tenfold against the overall figures for the period
from 1987 through 1995.
</P>
<P>
In total, 492 HIV-positive cases were reported during
January-June 1997.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,627 people suffering from AIDS have been
registered to date in the country, including 1,102 people in the
town of Svetlogorsk, Gomel region.
</P>
<P>
According to Glozovsky, Svetlogorsk is a town of drug addicts
and the AIDS epidemic is spreading chiefly out of this town.
</P>
<P>
"HIV-infected persons mostly include young people using drugs
intravenously," the head said. Such developments may spawn
unpredictable consequences leading to "infected young people dying
of AIDS in five to seven years," Glozovsky warned.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is spreading in particular because narcotic drugs are
cheap in the country: they cost up to 100,000 Belarussian rubles
(about 3.3 U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
By now there have been no cases of children becoming infected
in Belarussian medical care establishments, Glozovsky said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Declaration of War Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu rejected today the Palestinian claim that the
security measures taken by Israeli cabinet were "declaration of
war" against all Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the weekly cabinet session that the peace
process could not advance if the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) did not launch war on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the future of the peace process depends on PNA
President Yasser Arafat, adding that Israel could not keep its
commitments unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
In his telephone conversation Saturday with U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross, who is to arrive here at the end of the week on a
mission to revive the Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation,
Netanyahu declared that everything hinges on the PNA's actions
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks after hearing the briefings by
Israeli security officials on the cabinet on the situation in the
Palestinian territories, who said Arafat still had not ordered a
large-scaled crackdown on terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai claimed that the PNA was
only conducting small and localized operations against the
anti-Israeli organizations, such as the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) and Islamic Jihad, instead of a wide-scaled
campaign to smash the terrorist and its support infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel was keeping the pressure on Arafat to step
up crackdown on terrorist organizations. He added that Israel
has frozen transfer of funds to the PNA and any future
unfreezing was dependent on PNA's war against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan said the government should
inform the United States and European countries that if terrorist
activities came from the Palestinian-controlled areas, Israel
would exercise its right of self-defense by sending security
forces into the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Eitan added that it was desirable that both U.S. and
Europe exert pressure on Arafat to take actions so that
Israel would not have to implement the option of sending
troops back to Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security
Service in West Bank, refuted Israeli accusations today, saying
that the PNA is doing its utmost to prevent terrorist attacks and
will not accept dictates from the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
PNA security chief in Gaza Strip Mohammed Dahlan also said
that Palestinians would not take orders from Israel. He said
Palestinian security forces have cut off security cooperation
with Israel, which would not resume until Israel implements
the peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that current security meetings between the two
sides were conducted only within the framework of the
investigation into the Wednesday twin suicide bombings in
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, which killed 15 people and
wounded 170 others.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has claimed responsibility for the terror attack,
although Israel is questioning the authenticity of the claim.
Israeli and Palestinian security forces have since carried out
a widespread crackdown on Hamas and Islamic Jihad by rounding
up a number of their activists.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces were put on high alert today amid
intelligence warnings about possible new terror attacks. Police
reinforcements were deployed in major cities such Jerusalem and
Tel Aviv, setting up road blocks at city entrances to
increase security checks. Police have received hundreds of calls
from the public to report on suspicious bags and cars, which
were suspected to be bobby-trapped by terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ensures Jordanian Route for Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has assured Amman of the
continuous using of Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba as a key route
for receiving humanitarian goods despite of the planned opening of
a supply line through Syria.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Iraqi Minister of Commerce Mohammed Mehdi Saleh made
the promise at a meeting with his Jordanian counterpart Hani
Moulki here today.
</P>
<P>
Radio Jordan quoted Moulki as saying that Iraq will double its
imports via Aqaba -- more than that witnessed in the first phase
of the oil-for-food deal reached between Iraq and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil over a six-month period to buy back food and medicines badly
needed in the U.N. sanctions-stricken country. The first phase
started last December and has been renewed for another six months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's promise came as Baghdad applied to the U.N. for the
opening of the Iraq-Syria border. This route, if approved by the
U.N., will facilitate the flow-in of the Syrian-made goods cheaper
than Jordanian products and provide European exporters a route
shorter than the Aqaba one.
</P>
<P>
The action has triggered fear among the Jordanian businessmen
of losing business with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Saleh also promised to increase imports from Jordan, but
stopping short of elaborating on specific volume, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been Jordan's largest trade partner for years, with
its exports of goods and services to Iraq totalled 220 million
U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also asked to transform the 11 million dollars worth of
service items in its 255 million dollars trade protocol with
Jordan, which was signed at the beginning of this year and exempt
from the oil-for-food deal, into commodity items, Moulki added.
</P>
<P>
Via Aqaba port, Iraq imported civilian goods and military
equipment during the Iraqi-Iranian war in the 1980s and Jordan
made more than 1 billion dollars every year from entrepot trade
through Aqaba port bound for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the Aqaba port lost its glory when the U.N. sanctions
was imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Iraq has
relied more on its border with Turkey as well as its own Um Qasr
port, both of which were approved by the U.N. under the
oil-for-food deal.

LAGOS,August 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's fertilizer production
fell to 607,339.6 tons in 1996 from 1995's 1,072,561.3 tons, down
by 43 percent, the News Agency of Nigeria said today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a report of the Central Bank of Nigeria as

plants averaged merely 45 percent, compared to nearly 88 percent

<P>
The National Fertilizer Company in Onne also saw a 43 percent
decline in its production of urea and ammonia, with a total
output of 604,583 tons.
</P>
<P>
The fall in production has caused a shortage of fertilizers,
the bank report said, adding that inadequate funding and the lack
of raw materials and plant spare parts are responsible for the
situation.

bolted off the blocks fast and maintained the lead to win the men's
100 meters gold medal with a season's best time of 9.86 seconds at the
6th World Athletics Championships here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
His winning time is the fourth best all time, and only 0.02 seconds

</P>
<P>
Olympic champion and world record holder Donovan Bailey of Canada
was second in 9.91 ahead of another American Tim Montgomery's 9.94.
</P>
<P>
The pre-race favourite Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago lost his
edge in the final somehow, finishing fifth in 10.02. His leg seemed
injuried at the end of the race.
</P>
<P>
Olympic silver medallist Frank Fredericks of Namibia was fourth in
9.95.
</P>

The showdown to decide the fastest man in the world was expected to
produce a new world record, and many thought that Boldon would beat
the 9.84 mark with ease. The Olympic bronze medal winner ran 9.87 in
the second round yesterday and looked in a super form.
</P>
<P>
Greene, who clocked 9.90 at the U.S.A. Championships last June,
showed his strength in the semifinal with a 9.90 clocking. It is his
first medal in world major competitions.

<HEADLINE> Arabs to Convene Emergency Meeting on Peace Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Permanent delegates to the Arab
League will hold an emergency meeting here Tuesday to adopt a
unified Arab stance on recent Israeli practices against the
Palestinian people, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary session is convened at the request of
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat, who
accused Israel of picking up a war with the Palestinians by
adopting mass-punitive measures following Wednesday's suicide
bombings in a crowded market in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
PNA permanent delegate to the Arab League Mohamed Sobeih said
today these "arbitrary measures" against the Palestinian people"
are aimed at triggering off violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Such provocative measures by Israel are used at times of war
and not peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting will tackle a ten-item memorandum
submitted by the Palestinian side on the Israeli procedures and a
note from Meguid on the same issue, Sobeih said.
</P>
<P>
Saying the Arab support for the Palestinian rights is a sure
thing, Sobeih called upon the Mideast peace sponsors to bear their
responsibilities in salvaging the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the Jerusalem attack which killed 15 people, Israel
immediately imposed a closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
barring tens of thousands of Palestinians from jobs in Israel and
restricting even Palestinians' movements between their autonomous
West Bank towns.
</P>
<P>
It has also closed the Palestinian international
crossing-points with Egypt and Jordan and suspended the transfer
of Palestinian tax and customs revenues to the PNA coffers.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks Normalization of Ties With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today expressed his desire for normalizing relations with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
In his congratulation message to Mohammad Khatami, who was
confirmed as Iran's new president today, Demirel expressed his
belief that maintaining and developing good neighborly relations
are in the national interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
The Turco-Iranian ties have experienced a bitter period since
February when the two countries expelled diplomats each other.
</P>
<P>
Former Iranian ambassador to Ankara was accused of attending
a controversial religious rally and commending Shariah (Islamic
Law).
</P>
<P>
Turkey also blames Iran for supporting the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party rebels who are termed as the most dangerous
threat to the border security of southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Khatami, well-known for his
moderate political tendency, will help break the tense situation
between Ankara and Tehran.

<P>
ATHENS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Marion Jones of the United States won
the women's 100 meters gold medal here Sunday at the 6th World
Athletics Championships with a year's fastest time of 10.83 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Zhanna Pintussevich of Ukraine was second in 10.85 ahead of
Sevatheda Fynes of Bahamas, 11.03.
</P>
<P>
Jones' winning time is the year's fastest and 0.06 seconds faster
than her personal best.
</P>
<P>
Merlene Ottey of Jamaice, 37, finished a disappointed seventh in
11.29. Bad luck hit Ottey again this time, robbing her perhaps the
last chance to win the world 100m title.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican sprinting star was twice nipped at the line by Gail
Devers of the United States at the previous meet and last year's
Olympics. After 20 years as a world class dasher, her dream of winning
the crown of the world fastest woman hasn't been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
In today's final, Sevatheda jumped the gun but Ottey didn't hear
the foul gun. The Olympic silver medallist ran as fast as she could
till 70 meters. The mistake coused her too much power and strength. In
the showdown, when she realised she couldn't get a medal, she just
slowed her pace.

<HEADLINE> Hussein Urges All to Overcome Crisis Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 3 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan here today
called for all the parties concerned to work together in an effort
to overcome the crisis created by the suicide bombings last week
in West Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hussein made these remarks while receiving a group of Israeli
lawmakers at the Royal Court.
</P>
<P>
The group arrived here earlier today for talks on ways to
reactivate the stalled middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
There was an urgent need to pursue the peace process and
remove all hurdles standing in its way, so it could achieve its
goals, Radio Jordan quoted the king as saying.
</P>
<P>
After the suicide bombings that killed 15 people in an outdoor
market last Wednesday, Israel toughened the security upon the
Palestinian self-rule area, which accelerated the tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
This has been the newest terrorist violence happening in the
Israeli territories since the peace process was stalled in March
this year due to Israeli government's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, one of the major mediators in the peace process, has
contacted Israel and the United States in an effort to find a
solution for the tension.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. Jordan and
Egypt are the only countries in the Arab world that achieved peace
with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Raps Burundi Military Regime for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania today condemned
the military junta of Major Pierre Buyoya for executing five
people in connection with the killings of innocent civilians
after the assassination of civilian President Melchior Ndadaye.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation said Tanzania believed that the
military junta has no mandate to hold executions because it was
not democratically-installed.
</P>
<P>
The Statement said the Tanzanian government also believed that
the executions, held last Thursday meant that the military junta
has started killing innocent civilians they thought were hostile
to them.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania has always been calling for an end of killings in
Burundi so that the planned all-parties peace talks on Burundi
succeed," it said.
</P>
<P>
The government said the act of execution was a manifestation
that military strongman Buyoya wanted to disrupt initiatives by
former President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, the mediator of the
Burundi crisis.
</P>
<P>
All parties to Burundi's crisis are expected to meet for
negotiations in Arusha, northern Tanzania on August 25, this
year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from disrupting Nyerere's initiatives, the statement
said, the act of execution also hindered efforts by special
envoys to the Burundi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government has also asked the international community to
condemn the execution by Buyoya which was aimed at strengthening
himself.

<HEADLINE> US to Help African Countries Clear Land-mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States is reviewing
its policy on Africa in order to assist more countries in
clearing millions of deadly land mines which kill and maim
thousands of lives annually.
</P>
<P>
After touring mine fields in the Victoria Falls area, visiting
U.S. forces deputy commander in chief for Europe and Africa,
James Jamerson today said his government, already assisting
Namibia, Mozambique and Rwanda, is considering widening the area.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of expanding our assistance to other African
countries will be made very soon and Zimbabwe's candidature is
very favorable," he said, adding, "the U.S. and Zimbabwe are
already cooperating militarily in the fields of training,
peace-keeping and humanitarian relief."
</P>
<P>
"As you are aware, Zimbabwe is part of the U.S. initiative of
the African crisis response focused on provision of basic
soldiery equipment, training, peace-keeping and relief efforts,
Jamerson said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "the U.S. is currently talking with its western
allies to enhance the African military capacity for these
duties.''
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. government has no plan to deploy its forces
in Africa as in other continents.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) needs at least 13.6 million
U.S. Dollars to rid the country of the estimated two million
mines scattered along the border areas.
</P>
<P>
General Jamerson is on a three-day visit to the country, which
he described as maintaining military contact between the two
countries. He will hold meeting Monday with Zimbabwean Defense
Minister Moven Mahachi and high ranking defense force officers.
</P>
<P>
He has already been to Senegal, Cote d'Ivore and Gabon and
will leave Tuesday for Namibia, Mozambique and Uganda to conclude
the 10-day African trip.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Palestinians to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- As Israel beefs up security to
guard off more terrorist attacks, senior U.S. officials put more
pressure today on the Palestinian leadership to fight extremists.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said on CBS "Face the
Nation" that Palestinians must step up security controls to prove
they are serious about fighting terrorism, a condition under which
the Middle East peace talks could proceed.
</P>
<P>
"One can't expect 100 percent results when you're fighting
terrorism. But there can be a total, 100 percent unrelenting
effort," he believed.
</P>
<P>
"I think the effort's been uneven. It has to intensify" to ease
Israelis' anxiety, he added.
</P>
<P>
Berger also urged Israel, for its part, to assure the
Palestinians that it is not trying to pre-empt later negotiations
by building more Jewish housing units in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement following a double suicide market bombing
in Jerusalem last week, which killed 15 people and wounded more
than 150 others.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat immediately condemned the bomb
attack, vowing to fight the terrorists with all his strength. The
Palestinian National Authority (PNC) has arrested a large number
of Hamas activists, according to early reports.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has been opposed to the peace talks with Israel. Its
military wing has claimed responsibility for the latest suicide
bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We have to have a higher degree of security cooperation. This
is not only in the interest of Israel; in my judgment, it's in the
interest of the Palestinian people," Berger stressed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat went to Cairo Saturday to seek Egyptian backing amid
reports that Israeli troops might storm back to the PNC-controlled
areas to punish the Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader called the Israeli threat a "declaration
of war" against the Palestinians. The exchange of harsh
accusations has made the situation in the troubled region more
tense.
</P>
<P>
In Israel today, the security forces set up roadblocks and
checkpoints on roads leading to Jerusalem in precaution against
possible new terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich called today for
harsher steps to combat terrorism, including raids to the
Palestinian territory and arrests of PNC leaders.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on "Fox News Sunday," Gingrich said that Arafat had
lost credibility in Congress, which would decide after a
month-long recess if the Palestinians would deserve continued U.S.
aid after a law in this respect expires on August 12.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat told CNN today that
the PNC had dealt a severe blow to terrorists or would-be
terrorists. But he added that it remained unclear who exactly
perpetrated the last week attack.
</P>
<P>
Washington postponed a trip to the Middle East by special
coordinator Denny Ross following the bomb attack, despite the Arab
and Palestinian cry for prompt U.S. actions to salvage the
Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Blocks Congolese Refugees From Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has blocked about
500 Congolese (K) refugees from sneaking out of the camps at
Kigoma in western Tanzania to former Zaire until formalities of
their return are finalized by the relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Kigoma regional Commissioner Yusuf Makamba told the official
Daily News over the telephone from Kigoma today that 400 were
blocked last Friday and about 50 more last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Makamba said, "the 400 Congolese refugees and the other group
of 50 were blocked from boarding boats plying in Lake Tanganyika
suspected to be taking them home."
</P>
<P>
The regional commissioner said all the refugees who were
intercepted were returned to their respective camps.
</P>
<P>
He explained that refugees started sneaking out of the camps
after knowing that President William Mkapa who visited Democratic
Congo last week had agreed with his host -- President Laurent
Kabila that the Congolese refugees should return home.
</P>
<P>
Makamba said he was part of the President's entourage and that
it was decided during the talks of the two leaders that the
refugees would return home through a process.
</P>
<P>
He said that it now upon the United Nations High Commission
for Refugees (UNHCR) and the ministry of home affairs to finalize
formalities and issues "movement order" for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
"The refugees must leave Tanzania (Kigoma) formally and
officials in Congo have to receive them formally. They have
stayed here as refugees for quite a while ad there are norms
governing such movement which the government of Tanzania and
Congo must observe," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the regional commissioner said, "It is important
that the UNHCR repairs the roads ad other things for good
preparation of returning the Congolese. UNHCR trucks will make
several trips to the camps to pick them (refugees) and roads are
currently is in a very bad state."
</P>
<P>
"If the refugees will be allowed to leave tomorrow the UNHCR
will never come back to repair these public roads as a result the
peasants will suffer for no apparent reason simply because the
issue is being mishandled by the UNHCR," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 100,000 Congolese refugees in Kigoma region
who fled their country late last year following the civil strife
that culminated in the removal of Mobutu Sese Seko"s regime last
May.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Recovers Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The average price of a basket of
OPEC seven crude oils rose to 18.29 dollars per barrel last week
from 17.82 dollars a week earlier, the oil cartel's secretariat
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The price has edged up gradually since the end of June after
oil ministers from OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries) agreed to freeze their production quotas for six
months in a bid to boost prices.
</P>
<P>
The monthly average price in June was 17.37 dollars per
barrel. The average price so far this year is 19.01 dollars, lower
than OPEC's benchmark 21 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The July rise reverses a declining trend evident since the
start of the year.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have fallen steadily from a peak of 25 dollars a
barrel in January partly because of the prospect of Iraq entering
the oil market again after a temporary lifting of sanctions by the
United Nations and partly because over overproduction by OPEC
members, most of whom have been breaking their quotas designed to
keep prices up.

BRUSSELS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has banned
all imports of fishery products from Bangladesh, India and
Madagascar for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
The ban, effective last Friday, will last at least till

structure of establishments, hygiene quality of raw material and
in processing operations."
</P>
<P>
Fishery products already bound for EU countries, however, may
be admitted before August 15 after satisfactory sample tests.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia to Launch New Ruble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
announced today that Russia will issue new ruble notes next year
with face values 1,000 times greater than the current notes.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank will issue new notes and coins on January 1 to
replace the old ones and one new ruble will equal 1,000 current
rubles, Yeltsin said in a Kremlin statement.
</P>
<P>
"The three excessive zeroes will disappear from the
notes, ... one will pay one ruble for the product that had a 1,000
ruble price-tag on it," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Old notes will remain in use next year, and then be phased out
of circulation by January 1, 1999. To avoid any panic on currency
exchanges, Yeltsin said, old notes can be exchanged in banks until
2002.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the reform is a result of improved currency
stability after years of inflation curbing measures. "Today we
reliably control money circulation and control inflation. People
know that we no longer have a rapid growth of prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In doing so we declare that there will be no more
inflation," he said. "An end has been put to it."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Russia has recovered from the crisis of
hyperinflation which engulfed the country in the early
1990s. Inflation soared to 2,500 percent in 1992, a year after the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Ruble notes currently range from the relatively worthless 100
rubles (0.17 U.S. cents) to 100,000 rubles, which sounds
impressive but is only worth 17 dollars. The new notes will have
dominations of five rubles (86 U.S. cents), 10 rubles (1.7
dollars), 50 rubles (8.6 dollars), 100 rubles (17 dollars) and 500
rubles (86 dollars), Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank will also issue one, two and five-ruble coins
and restart using Kopeck coins. One hundred Kopecks will equal one
ruble.
</P>
<P>
Federal and regional budgets and other calculations for 1998
will be in new rubles, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Economic Minister Yakov Urinson said that
redenomination will not affect prices, but financial experts said
a sudden rise in prices is possible.

<HEADLINE> SAARC to Hold Fair and Meeting for Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The second trade fair of the
South Asian Association For Regional Cooperation (SAARC) will be
held in Pakistan on February 16-20, 1998, while commerce ministers
from the member states will meet to discuss free trade in the
region, the SAARC secretary-general said here today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a 25-member delegation of the SAARC
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) at the Kathmandu-based
SAARC Secretariat, SAARC Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan stressed
the increasing role of the private sector, in particular the SCCI,
in accelerating trade and economic cooperation and achieving a
South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA).
SAARC members agreed at a May summit to set up the SAFTA by 2001.
</P>
<P>
SAARC members began their third round of trade negotiations in
late July to move from the South Asian Preferential Trading
Arrangement to SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the SAARC secretariat quoted Salman
F. Rahman, president of the SCCI based in Karachi, Pakistan, as
saying that the SCCI will continue to take active interest in the
SAARC activities, particularly in the field of trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the SCCI will be actively participating in the second
SAARC trade fair and will concurrently hold the second SAARC
Economic Cooperation Conference in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the SCCI is planning activities for promotion
of tourism in the region.
</P>
<P>
The first SAARC trade fair and the first SAARC commerce
ministers meeting were held in January, 1996 in New Delhi, India.
</P>

SAARC now groups India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen said today that parliament will vote on Wednesday to
decide who will succeed ousted first prime minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
In a statement signed today, Hun Sen called for exiled
opposition legislators, officials and military officers to return
home by Wednesday to take part in the vote.
</P>
<P>
"The royal government wishes to appeal to you (legislators)
once again to join the meeting of the National Assembly which is
expecting to vote on your confidence in the candidate for
nomination of first prime minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia on
Wednesday," the statement, read on national television, said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen promised that supporters of the ousted prince would
remain in their former positions and that they and their families
would be guaranteed safety and security.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was now calm and the parliament was functioning
normally, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the call two days after meeting a delegation of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Phnom Penh
and called for the return of exiled opposition figures.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN team asked Hun Sen to make an announcement at "the
highest possible level" that FUNCIPEC officials and MPs would be
able to return home safely and without fear of "persecution or
intimidation" to take part in the political process, including
the choice of a new premier.
</P>
<P>
The royalist FUNCINPEC party named Foreign Minister Ung Huot to
succeed Ranariddh, who was deposed by his rival Hun Sen after
heavy fighting in the capital in early July between troops loyal
to the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Some 18 opposition FUNCINPEC members have fled the country
since the fighting, amid allegations of arrests, torture and
extra-judicial murders of the party's officials who did not get
away.

<HEADLINE> Shevardnadze Warns Russia over Abkhazia Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze today warned Russia that any lifting of economic
sanctions against Abkhazia would strain Georgia-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
"If Russia in a unilateral way annuls the economic sanctions
adopted against Abkhazia, this could lead to serious complications
in Georgian-Russian relations," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted
the Georgian president as telling national radio in Tblisi.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia, a breakaway enclave in Georgia, declared independence
in July, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that the economic sanctions against Abkhazia
were introduced in light of the decision of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) Council of Heads of State.
</P>
<P>
He said the unilateral lifting of the sanctions would be
unacceptable and would damage the authority of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze called "illogical" the statements by some Russian
politicians that economic sanctions on Abkhazia are no longer in
Russia's interests and that it is time to discuss lifting them.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that only a summit of CIS leaders could decide the
sanctions issue.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy to Meet Afghan Faction Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Continuing his mission of
persuasion for peace in Afghanistan, UN Special Envoy Nobert Holl
will meet leaders of the northern alliance on Tuesday in
Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 km northwest of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Holl, who leaves here for the stronghold of the alliance
opposing the Islamic Taliban militia on Tuesday morning, will take
up the issue of releasing some senior Taliban officials detained
in Mazar-e-Sharif, a UN official said today.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a political commission will also figure in the
talks between Holl and the alliance leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance led mainly by Afghanistan's former
military chief Ahmad Masood and Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik has
forwarded the idea of setting up a political commission for the
formation of a broad-based government in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban have advocated that the political
commission should include all Afghan groups, small and large, and
not just the northern alliance.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad Omar, supreme leader of the Taliban, has also set the
release of their prisoners as a pre-condition for entering into
meaningful peace talks while the anti-Taliban alliance demanded
the demilitarization of Kabul before agreeing to a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UN official also dispelled the impression that
the appointment of Lakhdar Brahimi for assessing the Afghanistan
situation for UN's further action is an expression of
no-confidence in the Holl mission.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, former Algerian foreign minister, has been assigned by
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send back an in-depth account
of the Afghanistan situation before the UN General Assembly
session in September.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian diplomat is expected to arrive here next week. He
will assess the UN peace-making efforts and hold talks with Afghan
factions and consult with "relevant countries."

<HEADLINE> Denktash's Decision to Attend Talks Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government today
welcomed the decision by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to
attend the second round of U.N.-sponsored direct talks, scheduled
for August 11-16.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome Denktash's decision to go to Switzerland. Each
side will outline its views and arguments at the talks next
week," government spokesman Manolis Christofides said at his daily
press briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side, he added, "will discuss in good faith
every aspect of the Cyprus problem to find solutions to each one
of them."
</P>
<P>
Denktash's decision to take part in the direct talks was
announced earlier today after he consulted with his self-styled
cabinet in northern part of Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally a breakaway
state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which
was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Denktash threatened not to go to the talks unless
the European Union suspended the accession negotiations with
Cyprus, due to begin early next year.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Denktash met last month
at Troutbeck, near New York, in the first round of direct talks
sponsored by the U.N. for the first time in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
They had two meetings last week in Nicosia under the auspices
of the U.N. Resident Representative on the island, Gustave
Feissel, to discuss humanitarian issues.

<HEADLINE> HK Police Intercept Illegal Vietnamese Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Police intercepted 11
illegal Vietnamese immigrants on Lantau, Hong Kong, today, and
will repatriate them as soon as possible, a security department
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In response to reporters' inquiries, the spokesman also said
that "the police are searching for any other illegal Vietnamese
immigrants who may have escaped."
</P>
<P>
The captured Vietnamese immigrants are still being
investigated, he noted, stressing that all the illegal immigrants
intercepted "will be repatriated to Vietnam as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
"The illegal Vietnamese immigrants come to Hong Kong to seek
illegal employment and make money. Whether there is any first
asylum policy or not would not have any impact on the attraction
of Hong Kong for them," he explained.
</P>
<P>
A source in the Information Department of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region's government told Xinhua tonight that there
are a total of 3,400 illegal Vietnamese immigrants now in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Among them, some 1,800, found to be non-refugees, would have to
return to Vietnam soon either voluntarily or under an Orderly
Repatriation Program (ORP) as agreed with the Vietnamese
government in 1991, the source said, adding that some 1,300
others, found to be refugees, are waiting for resettlement in
related countries.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier statistics from the local information
department, over 200,000 Vietnamese "asylum seekers" have arrived
in Hong Kong since 1975, and from 1988 it was apparent that most
Vietnamese arriving in Hong Kong were "economic migrants," who had
no hope of overseas resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, when a breakthrough was achieved in securing a
practicable solution to the Vietnamese immigrants, most of the
illegal Vietnamese immigrants have returned home voluntarily or
have been repatriated.

<HEADLINE> HK's Olympic Champion Windsurfer Awarded with Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's famed woman
windsurfer Lee Lai-shan was on Monday awarded with prize money
from the local sports authority and an Olympic golden pin from the
International Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
The Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (ASF&AMP;OC) of
Hong Kong awarded the 26-year-old athlete 1,237,000 HK dollars
(158,600 U.S. dollars) for her achievement, including her victory
in the women's Mistral boardsailing event at last year's Atlanta
Olympic Games. It was Hong Kong's first ever Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
And the Windsurfing Association of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong
Yachting Association were each presented with 206,200 HK dollars
(26,400 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
All the prize money was from the proceeds of the Olympic
Postcards put on sale in Hong Kong last October by the local
General Post Office for the ASF&AMP;OC.
</P>
<P>
Lee was also awarded with an Olympic Golden Pin, a special
honor from the IOC for all Olympic gold medalists.
</P>
<P>
With 86 medals already to her credit, Lee has set her next
major target at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok. And that is just
what the ASF&AMP;OC wants her to do next year. "The gold medal at the
Bangkok Asian Games is now up to grab and that is the medal we
want her to win," said ASF&AMP;OC President A. de O. Sales at today's
awarding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"You could put it in the same deposit box with your Olympic
gold medal, for which I bet," Sales joked.
</P>
<P>
With that goal achieved, Lee would complete her collection of
top honors -- gold medals from the world championships, Olympic
Games, Asian Games and Asian championships.
</P>
<P>
But an Olympic triumph does not necessarily mean that she could
outshine others again at the Asian Games. At least Lee herself
does not look that way.
</P>
<P>
Having missed out that title two times, the Asian Games
silver-medalist said, "There is no guarantee that this time I will
win."
</P>
<P>
"The Olympics and Asian Games are completely different, in
terms of conditions and opponents," she said after today's
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"I'll do my best to win, but that'll be tough, " she said.
</P>
<P>
Lee and her teammate and boyfriend Sam Wong Tak-sum returned
from the Isewan Cup in Nagoya, central Japan this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"My performance there was not satisfactory, but at least I've
learnt in what shape I am now," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lack of preparations was one of the reasons for her less
impressive show at the event, she admitted. She finished second
in the Open category in Nagoya.
</P>
<P>
She had not practiced on sailboard for long since she went to
Canberra in March this year to complete the penultimate collegiate
course of the sports management degrees.
</P>
<P>
Lee and Wong came back to Hong Kong just days before the
handover for ceremonies and celebrations around July 1 this year,
and only from then on she resumed serious training to improve her
form.
</P>
<P>
Lee said she plans to leave here later this month for
Zhanjiang, South China, for the coming Asia-Pacific championships.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good warm-up for the Bangkok Asian Games," she said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Suffers Billion Dollar Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a trade
deficit of 2.7 billion ringgit (about 1.08 billion U.S. dollars)
in the first half of this year, mainly due to a huge deficit in
June, according to official statistics released today.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficit in the first half of last year was 687.8 million
ringgit (about 275.12 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In June alone, the country posted a trade deficit of 2.8
billion ringgit (about 1.12 billion dollars) against a surplus of
156.2 million ringgit (about 62.48 million dollars) in May, the
Statistics Department said in its external trade summary for
January-June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report said the deficit in June was caused by the purchase
of ships and tankers and commercial aircraft, collectively worth
2.2 billion ringgit (about 880 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Imports in this year's first half were worth 101.1 billion
ringgit (about 40.44 billion dollars), 4 percent higher than the
97.2 billion ringgit (about 38.88 billion dollars) registered in
the same period last year, the Statistics Department said .
</P>
<P>
Exports in the period rose by 1.9 percent to 98.4 billion
ringgit (about 39.36 billion dollars) from 96.6 billion ringgit
(about 38.64 billion dollars) in the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Statistics Department said the deficit was partly
attributed to increased imports in transport equipment and office
data processing equipment which valued at 1.4 billion ringgit
(about 560 million dollars) and 1.1 billion ringgit (about 440
million dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
On export, the department said thermionic valves and tubes,
photocells, and parts continued to be the country's largest export
earners, accounting for 18.4 percent of the total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
For the first half, Malaysia's major trading partners included
Japan, the United States, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand,
Germany, the United Kingdom, China and the Netherlands, which
collectively accounted for 79.9 percent of Malaysia's total trade,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK to Prove Success of 'One Country, Two Systems' by Facts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- "The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will prove by facts
that the concept of 'one country, two systems' can make a
success," said Michael Suen Ming-yeung, who took the office of
Secretary for Electoral Affairs of the HKSAR government today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua recently, the 53-year-old
Suen repeatedly stressed that the key to Hong Kong's long-term
prosperity and stability lies in the full implementation of the
principle of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" with a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Temporarily seconded to the HKSAR Chief Executive's Office in
March, Suen participated in the preparatory work for the formation
of the HKSAR government, which was sworn in on July 1 when China
resumed the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"This was a rare episode in my life," Suen said of his
experience in the past several months with excitement. "Hong
Kong's return to the motherland is a momentous historic event, and
it's a great honor and pride to get involved in it and contribute
my share."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that over the past four weeks since the
establishment of the HKSAR, business has been as usual in the
local community.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has changed in Hong Kong except that the Union Jack
and the Hong Kong flag were replaced by the Chinese national flag
and the regional flag of the HKSAR," he noted. "We can see that
the concept of 'one country, two systems' initiated by Mr. Deng
Xiaoping is being carried out."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese central government has given the HKSAR
government a high degree of autonomy in dealing with the SAR's
internal affairs and this reflects the central government's full
confidence in the capabilities of the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have also seen that the SAR government, shortly after
its establishment, has begun to handle a number of very important
yet difficult problems, making a good start for the operation of
the SAR," he added.
</P>
<P>
When the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed in 1984, he
recalled, some people thought Hong Kong's economy was doomed and
they emigrated overseas.
</P>
<P>
Now that Hong Kong continues to enjoy social stability and
economic prosperity, he said, many former emigrants have come back
along with an increasing number of foreign investors, and local
people have gained much more confidence in the future after seeing
that they can continue to have anything they had before the
handover.
</P>
<P>
"This is just like what an ancient saying goes: facts speak
louder than eloquence," he commented.
</P>
<P>
Conceding that there are now still some people in the foreign
media that remain doubtful about the implementation of "one
country, two systems" in Hong Kong, he said that it is unnecessary
to give them an explanation.
</P>
<P>
"Just let them come back to Hong Kong in one year's time, and
facts will speak for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, a major task for the HKSAR government in
the coming period is to prove by facts to the whole world that the
goal of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong" with a high degree of autonomy can be achieved and will
serve as the most fundamental factor in maintaining Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Chinese State Council announced appointments and
removals of some of the principal officials of the HKSAR, among
whom Suen was transferred from Secretary of Home Affairs to
Secretary for Electoral Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Suen said there should be no difficulty for him to do the new
job well as he worked as secretary for constitutional affairs (the
predecessor of secretary for electoral affairs) in charge of
electoral work from 1989 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he also had experience in electoral affairs when
he was seconded to the Chief Executive's Office. Therefore, the
on-going preparatory work for the election of the first
Legislative Council of the SAR is a familiar job for him.
</P>
<P>
According to Suen, the major work of the Department for Home
Affairs includes safeguarding Hong Kong citizens' rights granted
by the HKSAR Basic Law, serving as a channel of communication
between the government and the public, helping formulate relevant
information policies and encouraging local residents'
participation in public affairs.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his new job, Suen said he will try his best to do
it well. He said that the coming election of the first Legislative
Council is the first election of the SAR and is crucial to the
implementation of the policies of "one country, two systems" and
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a high autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"The election will attract broad attention. People want to see
if the first election of the SAR is open and fair," he said. "It
must be done well, and I believe we can do it well."
</P>
<P>
He said that an important thing for a good election is the
general participation by Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
"More citizens should be mobilized to register as voters and
actively cast their votes. The more people participate, the more
convincing the results will be. The methods of the election must
be open and fair and acceptable to the masses of Hong Kong
citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
Suen, who joined the civil service after his graduation from
the Hong Kong University in 1966, said that he spent most of his
career in contacting and communicating with the general public.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a principal official of the SAR, what he
considers most is how to better serve the SAR and its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Senior civil servants must have a sense of commitment, for whom
the most important thing is to protect the overall interests of
Hong Kong and make their own contributions to the success of "one
country, two systems" policy in Hong Kong, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Iran Exchange Soldiers' Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Iran today exchanged the
remains of their soldiers killed during the war between the two
countries from 1980 to 1988, Iraq News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held in the Shalajma border region, east of
the Iraqi province of Basra, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency did not say how many dead bodies were exchanged. But
an Iranian News Agency report said the remains of 15 Iranian
soldiers and 47 Iraqi soldiers were handed over.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of soldiers' remains was accomplished under a
bilateral agreement signed in Tehran on September 14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has found the dead bodies of more than 25,000 Iranian
soldiers since the end of the war, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has affirmed that some 20,000 Iraqi prisoners of war are
still detained in Iran, and Iran claims that there are still at
least 5,000 Iranians held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Exchange of prisoners of war and the remains of the missing
soldiers are still main obstacles to the normalization of
relations between the two countries.

BAGHDAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has accused the United
States of having sent one of its warplanes to drop an incendiary
flare over an Iraqi city, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"A U.S. warplane dropped at noon on July 26 an incendiary

"The incendiary flare dropped on a resident's house in the
Hussein district, a residential district in the city of Basra,"

<HEADLINE> Russian Ballerina to Make Debut in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian ballerina Nina
Ananiashvili is expected to radiate confidence and exhibit her
technical virtuousity in tomorrow night's China debut.
</P>
<P>
Nina Ananiashvili and International Stars Co., a troupe with
some of the world's top ballet dancers, will present a lucky
Beijing audience with a performance featuring classical beauty and
dazzling pyrotechnics in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The company's 10 members have enjoyed great fame with their own
troupes, many of which have been in existence for over 200 years.
</P>
<P>
Frank Anderson, former director of the Royal Danish Ballet,
serves as the company's artistic director.
</P>
<P>
"This is our first performance in Beijing," said
Anderson. "Members of the company come from the world's best
ballet troupes."
</P>
<P>
Beijing is the fifth stop on a performance tour which has taken
the company to Japan, Europe, Scandinavia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Anderson, "Ananiashvili conceived the idea and
selected dancers for International Stars Co. in 1991."
</P>
<P>
Ananiashvili, 34, has strived for excellence and has constantly
refined her dance interpretations. The ballerina offers audiences
a quality of completeness, excellent role interpretation and
exquisite ballet movements in her presentations featuring pure
Russian classicism.
</P>
<P>
Western dance critics have praised Ananiashvili as the greatest
ballerina in today's bullet world.
</P>
<P>
Ananiashvili joined the Moscow Bolshoi Ballet (Moscow Great
Theater Ballet Company) at the age of 17 and starred in Hamburg
performance of "Swan Lake." The German audience honored her
excellent performance of the little swan with a resounding round
of applause lasting well over 30 minutes.

The Georgian-born ballerina attempts to continually expand her
talent and knowledge. "One is lost when standing still," said
Ananiashvili, a welcome guest performer for outstanding ballet
companies worldwide, including the Paris Opera Ballet, the Royal
Danish Ballet and New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
Ananiashvili has co-starred with Western counterparts in all
well-known modern Western ballet excerpts, an accomplishment quite
rare for ballet dancers from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to be here," said Ananiashvili. "Members of our
company enjoy performing together and like to make people feel
happy. All members are premier dancers with their respective
companies, a fact which will be discernible during our
performance."
</P>
<P>
Extensive promotional efforts by the National Ballet Troupe of
China (NBTC) and foreign ballet companies have greatly enhanced
the popularity of ballet in China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to NBTC director Zhao Ruheng, "The art of ballet has
no boundaries. We think in the same language as foreign dancers."
</P>
<P>
Zhao, China's most famous ballerina, studied under famous
Russian ballet dancers with the Maryinsky Bolshoi in
St. Petersburg. "It's a great honor to watch classical Russian
ballet," said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that international exchanges and
cooperation will continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The NBTC and Swedish Royal Ballet jointly sponsored a ballet
performance in May this year and the performance was well received.
</P>
<P>
The International Stars troupe also includes well-known dancers
such as Alexsei Fadeyechev and Yuri Posokhov from the Moscow
Bolshoi, Tatiana Terekhova and Vadim Pisarev with the Kirov
Bolshoi, Inna Dorofeyeva from Deutsche Oper am Rhein, and Marie
Lindqvist and Anders Nordstrom from the Swedish Royal Ballet.

<HEADLINE> U.S. UPS Workers on Strike in Wage Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 185,000 members of
the Teamsters union of the United States went on strike Sunday
night against United Parcel Service (UPS) that will disrupt
deliveries of documents and packages across the nation.
</P>
<P>
The walkout, followed the collapse of last-ditch negotiations
Sunday night in Washington, was the first nationwide strike in the
90-year history of UPS, which delivers 12 million parcels and
documents a day.
</P>
<P>
UPS estimated that a scattered, one-day walkout in 1994 cost it
50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We will do whatever we can using our management and other
nonunion people to operate to the extent that we can," UPS
spokesman Ken Sternad said.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based company, which has 302,000 employees in the
United States, will make medical and pharmaceutical supplies and
other emergency deliveries its first priority, and also expects to
keep up its international service, Sternad said.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Pilots Association, which represents UPS' 2,000
pilots, said it would honor the Teamsters picket lines.
</P>
<P>
As UPS takes 80 percent of the nation's parcel market, its
competitors wouldn't be able to take up the industry giant's
entire load.
</P>
<P>
The rival Federal Express Corp. had already reported a sharp
increase in business in recent days, and imposed limits including
cutting drop-off times by two hours, suspending money-back
guarantees and declining new regular accounts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service announced temporary measures today,
including limiting customers to four parcels a visit. Postmaster
General Marvin Runyon said "an extraordinary increase in volume"
was expected.
</P>
<P>
In the dispute, the Teamsters want the company to create more
full-time jobs for its part-time workers, eliminate the use of
outside contractors, increase wages and improve pension benefits
and job safety.
</P>
<P>
UPS has offered to create 1,000 full-time jobs over the life of
a proposed five-year contract, for which part-timers would be
given first preference. The proposed contract would increase top
hourly pay for full-time workers by 1.5 dollars to 21.45 dollars
and the hourly wage for the lowest paid part-time employees three
dollars to 11 dollars by 2001.
</P>
<P>
UPS also want to replace the Teamsters pension program with one
of its own, the payout of which would be 50 percent higher than
the program now available. The company's plan would pay retirees
100 dollars a month for every year of service up to 3,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
But union officials said the UPS proposal were inadequate for a
company in which 57 percent of its work force is made up of
part-time workers and the latter do the same work as full-timers
but earn less. Union officials also said that the UPS pension
program was a deal killer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soldiers' Remains Returned by DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The remains of four U.S. soldiers
killed in the Korean War were handed over to the U.S. army
stationed in South Korea on Monday at the truce village of
Panmunjom by the Korean People's Army.
</P>
<P>
The new commander of the 8th U.S. Army, Lt. Gen. Randolph
W. House, and an official from the U.S. Defense Department
attended the handover ceremony at the village on the border
between South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The remains were unearthed last month by a U.S. excavation team
visiting Unsan County, in the DPRK's North Pyongan Province, some
30 kilometers from the Chinese border, according to the
U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
Unsan County was the scene of fierce fighting during the
1950-53 Korean War, claiming the lives of about 350 U.S. soldiers
in October 1950.
</P>
<P>
There have been three excavation missions to recover the
remains of U.S. soldiers this year following an agreement between
the United States and the DPRK. The DPRK handed over the remains
of 210 U.S. soldiers between 1990 and 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August, 4 (Xinhua) -- The new generation of
domestically manufactured light weapons used to equip the Hong
Kong Garrison of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) will gradually
be distributed throughout the nation's military.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the PLA say the new generation of weapons,
mainly fully automatic rifles and machine guns, equal advance
quality ratings in the world in terms of both performance and
major technical indexes.
</P>
<P>
Chinese-made light weapons, mostly small bore models, are
smaller, lighter, more powerful and have a longer range than
comparable foreign weapons.
</P>
<P>
New materials and techniques were used to develop the new
highly effective multifunctional weapons. The weapons feature
mechanical sighting devices for both day and night firing, and
some models are equipped with grenade launchers. Main parts for
rifles and machine guns are interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
China's highly advanced armaments manufacturing techniques are
also used in the production of numerous other weapons such as
heavy machine guns, snipers rifles and grenade launchers.

<HEADLINE> Prices Seen to Increase in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen believe that prices
will increase next month in the Philippines should the
depreciation of the country's currency peso and higher interest
rates continue in the ensuing months.
</P>
<P>
Industrialist Raul Concepcion told reporters that August is a
crucial month because unless the Philippine Central Bank can
reverse the trend, "everything will go up next month."
</P>
<P>
Concepcion, who is chairman of the Consumer and Oil Price
Watch, said manufacturers will be forced to scale down their
production and prices will go up as their inventory levels at old
prices will be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
With higher prices due to these factors and the recent oil
price hike, he said, the labor sector will then start clamoring
for a new round of wage adjustments.
</P>
<P>
A special committee, composed of officials from the departments
of energy and trade and industry, will be tasked to monitor the
prices of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
According to Concepcion, the country's business circle has
asked the central bank to help stabilize the peso by taking the
following measures:
</P>
<P>
-- compel exporters to surrender their export proceeds within
30 days from receipt of proceeds;
</P>
<P>
-- business and industry should be allowed to purchase foreign
exchange only for the payment of current maturing foreign debt and
not hedge for the future; and
</P>
<P>
-- priority on the sale of foreign exchange should be given to
import and export trade-related transactions over remittance of
dividends, profits and invisibles.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank was forced to allow the peso to
float on July 11 due to massive attacks by currency speculators
who shifted to the peso after the July 2 depreciation of the Thai
baht.
</P>
<P>
The peso has so far fallen nearly 10 percent in its value since
its de facto depreciation.

MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana today urged the Western nations to provide assistance to
Russia as the country is poised for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who arrived here Sunday on a private visit, praised
Russia's economic reforms during his meeting today with First
Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Nemtsov told reporters that he had
reiterated Russian opposition to NATO's eastward expansion,
including the incorporation of the three Baltic states into the
Western military alliance. Russia has threatened to revoke its
recent pact with NATO if that happens.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia seeks stronger economic ties with western
Europe and supports a single European market, although Moscow
remains opposed to anti-dumping measures against some Russian
products announced by the European Union last week, he said.
</P>
<P>
Presently, Russian trade volume with the European Union
accounts for 40 percent of its total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the anti-dumping measures would cost
Russia one billion U.S. dollars a year if implemented.

<P>
Celebrating its 30th anniversary two weeks ago, IITA announced
it had developed a "super cassava" variety with an output of 40
tons per hectare, tripling the yield of the current varieties.
</P>
<P>
Cassava is most common at the dinner table of Nigerians. IITA
has developed many products derivative from cassava, including
bread, cookies, doughnut, strips and noodles. Many of the
products are being consumed by Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The products, according to IITA's Head of Biochemistry
Department Mpoko Bokanga, are of the same quality with those made
from wheat.
</P>
<P>
But the importation of wheat has been posing serious threat to
the local market.
</P>
<P>
As the country's present capacity is already enhanced to
produce more than 30 million tons of cassava annually, it is high
time the government discouraged wheat import, he added.
</P>
<P>
IITA Director General Lucas Brader shared the same view,
saying that virtually all the maize grown now in the country was
resistant to the disease which used to cause an average of 10
percent loss per year.
</P>
<P>
This research development will make more maize available for
use as alternative to wheat, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At least an extra two million tons of maize is produced
yearly, which means an annual saving of 300 to 400 million
dollars, enough to feed 10 million people," he added.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Needs New Internal Balance, Singapore Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The expansion of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to include Laos and
Myanmar means that the regional group needs to find a new internal
equilibrium, Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"If ASEAN maintains its record of playing a role in
contributing to peace and stability in the region, ASEAN's
standing in the international community will be enhanced. It will
also increase the influence and bargaining power of ASEAN
vis-a-vis other states and regional groups," the foreign minister
said in his keynote address at the two-day ASEAN Roundtable 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The key message I wish to leave at this Roundtable is that we
cannot take for granted that ASEAN will succeed. ASEAN faces many
serious challenges in the years ahead," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
One of the challenges that ASEAN faces, he said, is whether
ASEAN can retain the close knit and almost "telepathic"
understanding it has built up over the last 30 years, or in other
words, whether ASEAN's detractors are right in saying that a
"two-tier" ASEAN will develop.
</P>
<P>
Another concern, he said, is that whether an enlarged ASEAN can
continue to forge consensus on key international issues, or
whether ASEAN's cohesiveness will fray.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also underlined what he called "a unique
challenge" that has been posed by the entry of Myanmar. He noted
that the European Union says it cannot cooperate with Myanmar,
while ASEAN on its part has said that dialogue partners should not
discriminate among ASEAN member states in development assistance.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the outlook for ASEAN, which marked its 30th
anniversary this year, continues to remain bright, but much work
remains to be done, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which admitted Vietnam in July 1995, was again expanded
last month with Laos and Myanmar joining in. Apart from these
three new members, ASEAN also includes Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, and Brunei.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Expels Portuguese Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Ambassador to
South Africa Vasco Valente has been given 48 hours to leave the
country for leaking a letter from President Nelson Mandela to his
Indonesian counterpart Suharto which was mistakenly delivered to
the Portuguese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The leaked letter called for the release of jailed East
Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association today quoted unidentified
officials as saying that the 48-hour notice period was given last
week after consultation with the governments of Portugual and
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
It is understood Valente left on Saturday, but it cannot be
confirmed by Portuguese diplomats yet.
</P>
<P>
So far, the South African government declined to make official
comment on the expulsion of Valente.
</P>
<P>
Highly-placed sources here said the expulsion had not soured South
African-Portuguese relations as diplomatic ties had not been
broken. South African Ambassador in Lisbon Kingsley Makubela
would remain in the post while the Portuguese government would
merely replace Valente, they said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Iran's New President Khatami Sworn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Mohammad Khatami, a liberal
clergyman, was sworn in here today as Iran's new president before
a conservative-dominated parliament which may paralyze his
presidency for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Khatami who will take Iran to the 21st century will have
his first fight with the Parliament over the choice of his
ministers. The new president would introduce his cabinet to the
parliament on August 9 and 10.
</P>
<P>
Despite many speculations in the Iranian press about who will
serve in Khatami's government, so far Khatami has kept the choices
to himself and has not made any public announcement except Hassan
Habibi, who was appointed his first vice-president today.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Khatami would have a hard time gaining
the Parliament's approval for important ministries such as
defense, information, foreign affairs, interior and culture.
</P>
<P>
This is because the rightist camp headed by Khatami's rival
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri controls about 150
seats of the 270-seat Parliament while Khatami's supporters from
the moderate camp and leftist group only enjoys a minority of
about 110 seats in the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, these key posts such as interior minister
and foreign minister have been usually directly controlled by
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. But, Khatami seems to
challenge Khamenei and try to change the pattern by stressing the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Khatami won by a landslide victory on May 23, gaining
over 20 million votes and defeating his arch rival conservative
Parliament Speaker Nateq-Nouri who received only 7 million votes.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's victory came as a jolt to the conservative camp
who considered Nateq-Nouri a front-runner early in the race.
</P>
<P>
"The bitter defeat has made the conservative camp truly
determined to get back at Khatami at every step," one local
observer told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
But Khatami's problems are not limited to the Parliament.
Problems of unemployment, high inflation, economic stagnation,
civil liberties, strained relations with the west and some
neighbors and other issues are all challenging for Khatami who can
only maneuver within the framework of the give-and-take formula
set by the supreme leader Khamenei despite the powerful mandate
given by the 20 million plus voters.
</P>
<P>
If Khatami clashes with Khamenei, the Parliament which goes
along with Khamenei's directive can impeach Khatami. Khatami may
then become the second Iranian president which would be ousted
by a decree from the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to be in Mr. Khatami's shoes. He has to walk a
tightrope, if he compromises too much with the Leader and the
conservative camp, then he has forgotten his campaign promises to
the nation," an editor at a Persian daily said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"If he insists on his mandate for change, he might end up in
the same manner that Bani Sadr did," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran's first president . Bani Sadr was ousted in June 1981 for
clashing with the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He later fled the country and is now
an outspoken critic of Tehran's government in exile in
France.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Cocoa Production Expected to Up 17 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Global leading cocoa grower and
exporter Ghana is expected to produce 350,000 tons of cocoa in the
1997-1998 season, an increase of 17.1 percent from the last season.
</P>
<P>
Cocoa export in the period is also projected to be more than that
in the last season to about 350,000 tons. Foreign exchange earning
from the export of cocoa is estimated at 57 million U.S. dollars, next
only to the 580 million dollars from that of gold, said a
report from Accra reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-1997 production season, Ghana exported 338,000 tons of
cocoa, a hefty increase of 43 percent over the previous season.
</P>
<P>
Cocoa is Ghana's traditional export product which earns more than
30 percent of the country's export revenue.
</P>
<P>
To further encourage cocoa production, the Ghanaian government
recently offered growers a 50-percent increase in cocao purchasing
price, from 590 dollars per ton to 885 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Softens Charges Against PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu today repeated his charges against the Palestinian
National Authority with regard to fighting terrorism, but in a
softened tone.
</P>
<P>
While accusing the PNA of having done nothing to break up the
Hamas and Islamic Jihad infrastructure in the autonomous areas,
Netanyahu admited that Israel still does not know the origin of
the two suicide bombers in last week's Jerusalem market blasts
which killed 15 people, including themselves.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu apparently realized that he had gone a bit too far in
lashing out at his peace partner because of the fact that it had
proved wrong to jump to the conclusion that the two terrorists
were from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
A furious Netanyahu had harshly attacked the PNA following the
bombing attack, saying that the Palestinian self-rule government
had done nothing against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Having softened his tone, however, Netanyahu insisted that it
is likely that the terrorists were aided by residents of the
(Palestinian) territories.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that the PNA must decide if it wants to be a
regime that gives shelter to terrorists, like Iraq or Iran, or
wants to be a government combating terrorist like Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks when he was speaking with the
visiting U.S. Republican Senator Phil Gramm. In response to a
reporter's question later, Netanyahu denied that he was opposed to
a pending visit by President Ezer Weizman to Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said that was surprised to read this morning the Ha'aretz
newspaper report that he objected to the U.S. invitation to
Weizman, a move regarded here as a sign of President Bill
Clinton's unhappiness about the premier's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said this morning that he has not yet decided whether
he is going, but declared that no one would tell him what to
do.

<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign military attaches based
in Beijing visited the Revolutionary Military Museum today to view
an exhibition of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) modernization
program.
</P>
<P>
The group showed great interest in the numerous pictures,
models and equipment on display.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition featured the latest developments in six areas --
politics, logistics, military proficiency, technology, reserve
forces and foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, the largest of its kind since the founding of
the People's Republic of China in 1949, is being held to mark the
PLA's 70th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Various members of the group commented favorably on PLA efforts
to open wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition highlights the PLA's ties with the armed forces
of over 100 countries, including both developed and developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition also tells the viewers that some 1,200 PLA
officers and soldiers have participated in six United Nations
peacekeeping missions in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Headquarters of the
General Staff, General Political Department and General Logistical
Department of PLA, and the National Defense Science, Technology
and Industry Commission, opened on July 25 and will run through
the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Life in HK Back to Normal After Typhoon Victor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Life is gradually returning to
normal after Hong Kong was hit Saturday by the worst typhoon in 14
years.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Victor moved away from Hong Kong early Sunday morning
before killing one person and injuring at least 55.
</P>
<P>
The first typhoon of the season, which packed winds of between
110 and 120 kilometers per hour, was centered over Hong Kong
Saturday night and it moved northward into South China's Guangdong
province at 03:30 Sunday, according to Hong Kong Observatory.
</P>
<P>
The No. 9 Typhoon Signal was raised Saturday afternoon, the
first time since 1983. It was lowered to No. 8 shortly before
midnight after Victor was weakening into a severe topical storm.
The No. 8 signal was lowered early Sunday morning, replaced by the
No. 3 Strong Wind Signal.
</P>
<P>
A 44-year-old British engineer drowned off Stanley beach when
he dived into two-meter-deep waves to try to rescue two students
who were washed into the sea during the peak of the storm. The
two were later pulled by police rescuers to safety from the rough
seas.
</P>
<P>
At least 55 people were reported injured but most were treated
in hospital for minor injuries and released.
</P>
<P>
In a similar case 14 years ago, Typhoon Ellen killed 10 people
and injured over 300 others.
</P>
<P>
Local transport services such as buses, ferries, trams, Mass
Transit Railway, planes and taxis which were brought to a virtual
standstill late Saturday and early Sunday, were resumed later
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Passengers stranded at the Kai Tak Airport due to 320 flights
delayed, canceled or diverted to nearby airports, took alternative
flights Sunday or Monday. Some 9,000 people were estimated at the
airport at the height of the tempest.
</P>
<P>
Some of the flights were ordered to keep flying for up to two
hours before landing at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Most of the roads which were closed due to landslides, fallen
trees and construction scaffoldings, have been opened to traffic.
</P>
<P>
But traffic congestion is likely to persist for a few more
days. A road in Cheung Sha Wan was blocked by a landslide, which
dumped some 1,000 cubic meters of mud and almost buried a taxi
passing by. A total of 14 landslides were reported Sunday after
the pouring rain across the region, registered at about 400
millimeters.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was directly hit by a typhoon for the third time in
history.
</P>
<P>
But weather watchers have predicted the region was still under
the influence of Victor's outer rain bands, with moderate winds
and cloudy skies with occasional showers to come in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
Residents can also feel the affects. Vegetable prices are
about 10 percent higher because the typhoon has destroyed
half of the local production. Farmers are trying to fetch
whatever they can from the flood water to meet the market
demands.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Levy Meet on Containing Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will meet with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Tuesday in a
bid to contain the volatile situation in the Mideast and salvage
the teetering peace march.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today that he had
invited Levy to Egypt for talks on ending the deteriorating peace
crisis following last week's suicide bombings in a Jerusalem
market which killed 15 people and injured 170 others.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether the current Egyptian-Palestinian-U.S.
contacts could serve as a new starting point for the peace
process, Moussa said that "all depends on what the parties
(Palestinians and Israelis) can offer within the framework of the
implementation of the Oslo agreement."
</P>
<P>
"The two parties are requested to implement the agreement while
observing calmness, composure and self-restraint," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross is expected in the region
late this week for talks with Arab and Israeli officials on a new
U.S. initiative. Ross' scheduled trip here last week was put off
after the double suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassyouni told Voice of
Arab radio today that current Egyptian efforts are exerted to have
the transitional stage implemented and obstacles to the peace
march removed.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Israeli contact will coincide with an Arab League
council meeting to be held here tomorrow at the request of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to study the crucial
situation facing the Palestinians as a result of Israel's tough
measures and closure in the wake of the bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership called those measures and
culminating Israeli threat to re-enter areas of Palestinian
self-rule as "a declaration of war" against the PNA and the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Since last Wednesday, Israel has imposed a closure on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, barring tens of thousands of Palestinians
from jobs in Israel and restricting even Palestinians' movements
between their autonomous West Bank towns.
</P>
<P>
It also closed the Palestinian international crossing-points
with Egypt and Jordan and suspended the transfer of tax and
customs revenues to the PNA coffer.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been trying to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
which stalled after Israel broke ground on a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem in March.

<HEADLINE> AlliedSignal Targets Growing Air Industry in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- AlliedSignal Aerospace, one of
the world's leading suppliers of aircraft components, is making
inroads into the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region to capture a
significant share of the booming aerospace business.
</P>
<P>
Dan Burnham, president of AlliedSignal Aerospace, said here
today: "The anticipated growth rate in air travel in this corner
of the world is spurring a wealth of new aerospace component and
service opportunities."
</P>
<P>
As much as 40 percent of the world's new civil jetliner sales
between now and 2013 could be destined for the airlines in the
Asia-Pacific region, he quoted Boeing projections as saying.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he focused on the AlliedSignal's presence in
China, whose growing air travel industry could account for 70
billion US dollars worth of new commercial aircraft during the
next two decades.
</P>
<P>
Burnham said that his company is taking steps to ensure its
success in winning a share of this huge and thriving market. It
has initiated Human Resources programs to train local staff, and
built repair, overhaul and manufacturing facilities in cooperation
with local partners.
</P>
<P>
AlliedSignal Aerospace has set up joint ventures in Xiamen and
Shanghai to provide aircraft component repair and overhaul
services. More ventures are under negotiation to develop and
manufacture aircraft control systems.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to position ourselves as an integral part of local
industry, not simply a distant global aerospace player," said
Burnham.
</P>
<P>
AlliedSignal Aerospace signed a contract here today with the
Hong Kong government to supply an advanced surveillance radar,
called Precision Runway Monitor system, to the double-runway New
Airport now under construction at Chek Lap Kok and scheduled to
open its first runway in April 1998.

<HEADLINE> Advanced Radar System to Be Installed at New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- An updated radar system, which
can keep a close eye on flights that make simultaneous parallel
approaches to multiple runways, will be installed at the New
Airport, now under construction at Chek Lap Kok, an outlying
island in the west of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) system will be supplied by
AlliedSignal Aerospace under a contract signed here today between
the U.S.-based company and the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
Scanning five times faster than the conventional surveillance
radar, the new system tracks and displays each aircraft, updates
position and velocity of approaching flights at the rate of once
per second.
</P>
<P>
Claimed to be the only fully certified radar system for
parallel runway approaches, the system is able to help increase
airport capacity, improve safety and lower operating costs by
reducing aircraft delays.
</P>
<P>
Dan Burnham, president of AlliedSignal Aerospace, told a news
briefing here today: "The PRM system will play a key role in
helping Hong Kong's new airport become one of the major hubs in
Asia."
</P>
<P>
To have the whole system built in Hong Kong, including staff
training and simulators, will cost 13 million U.S. dollars. A
technician from AlliedSignal Aerospace said that the system is
cost effective at large international airports with a huge flow of
passengers and closely-spaced runways.
</P>
<P>
AlliedSigal Aerospace will start to install the PRM system at
Chek Lap Lok in the first quarter of 1999 and complete the work by
the end of year, when the second runway will go into operation.
The first runway is expected to open in April, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The PRM system has been set up at airports in Minneapolis-St.
Paul in the United States and Sydney, Australia. Four more have
been planned for airports in New York, St. Louis, Philadelphia and
Atlanta in the U.S.

may lose their jobs as a result of participating in the strike.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide strike has been designed to speed up the
constitutional reform process.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC issued a five-day ultimatum on August 2 to the
government, urging the government to show seriousness over the
reform issue or face the strike.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Environment Minister Henry Kosgey noted
that the issue of constitutional reform should not be hijacked by
self-appointed leaders.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's parliament is "the only place" where the matter could
be handled, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here on Sunday, 10 trade unions accused
the NCEC of hijacking the labour movement in the country by
calling for a strike.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions affiliated to the Central Organization of
Trade Unions of Kenya said in a statement that strikes was a
function of trade unions and not of political parties.
</P>
<P>
Officials of trade unions called on workers, leaders and the
labour movement to shun the strike and warned the NCEC to stop
inciting workers against their employers and the government.

SINGAPORE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Australian Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer reaffirmed here today Australia's
commitment to multi-culturalism and dismissed the Pauline Hanson
controversy as a non-issue.
</P>

"Australia is not a racist country and it is wrong to form
impression about the country from the remarks of one maverick
politician," he told reporters when asked to comment on Pauline
Hanson's controversial remarks.

<HEADLINE> New Anti-Triad Law Comes Into Effect in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A new law aiming to fight against
organized crimes more effectively went into effect today,
following a recent wave of violence that wounded three.
</P>
<P>
Passed last month by the Macao Legislative Assembly after
several weeks of consultation with local communities and
government departments, the law is said to have given the security
forces and the judiciary more power in combatting crimes.
</P>
<P>
The new law has 42 articles, describing in detail 21 kinds of
activities that constitute "organized crimes." They include
homicide, abduction, smuggling of population, forcing others as
prostitutes, aiding illegal immigration, illegally trading, and
making, using, carrying, and smuggling of arms.
</P>
<P>
The law also permits police to have broader power of
investigating and evidence gathering. Under the new law, the
courts will be able to deal more promptly with suspected crimes and
police forces can use "infiltrated agents."
</P>
<P>
The law states that those who are found to have initiated a
triad will be sentenced to between five to 12 years in
imprisonment, and leading members of underground society will also
get up to 12 years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
The new law is based on a previous anti-organized crimes act,
which over the past several years had failed in curtailing such
activities.
</P>
<P>
Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira said last week that the new
legislation "shows the determination of the government to combat
activities of criminal gangs."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a commentary in today's "Macao Daily News" urged the
authorities to take effective measures to rectify the security
forces, and to eradicate infiltrated "triad elements."
</P>
<P>
It also said that the new law must be implemented to the
letter.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Coal Export Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will have more
profit from coal export this year due to higher tonnages exported
to India and the first-time exports to Indonesia and the
Philippines, according to a report issued by South Africa Coal
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The report said South Africa's exports of coal fell last year
after a loss of market share in the Far East. It also attributed
the decline to domestic problems, such as high seasonal rainfalls
at the beginning of last year and freight bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's coal output last year was about 261.5 million
tons, of which about 206 million tons were saleable within the
country and 60 million tons exported, according to the local
Mineral Bureau.
</P>
<P>
While Indian markets grow, the traditionally strong European
Union market is expected to shrink 3.4 million tons to 134
million this year, the report quoted European Commission
statistics as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Despite the higher coal export, South African coal producers,
the Mineral Bureau said, would have to fight to maintain their
market share.
</P>
<P>
"Should promises of increased production and exports of
low-cost coal from new producers in Colombia, Indonesia and
Venezuela materialize, South African exporters will struggle to
maintain or increase their share of the market," the bureau said.

<HEADLINE> Direct Phone Service Opens between Two Koreas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Inter-Korean direct phone lines
opened this afternoon linking Seoul with Shinpo, the nuclear
reactor construction site in Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The eight telephone lines, four for private use and the other
for official purposes, connected the two Koreas as the first time
after the peninsula was divided for more than 50 years, the Yonhap
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The lines were opened to enable South Korean workers and
officials who have been dispatched to Shinpo for the reactor
project to discuss official matters with the (South) Korea
Electric Power Corporation, the main contractor of the project,
and to talk privately with their family members in the South.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), an
international consortium formed by the U.S., South Korea and
Japan, is in charge of building two light water reactors for DPRK,
under a DPRK-U.S. agreement.
</P>
<P>
The opening of direct communication lines symbolizes the de
facto launch of the project, said the Yonhap.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is ready to open international direct dialing
service with DPRK through fiber optic cable and Intelsat whenever
it is needed, said an official of the South Korea
Telecommunication Corporation.

<HEADLINE> Afro-beat King Dies of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian popular musician Fela
Anikulapo-Kuti, known as the Afro-beat King, died of
complications of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), his
family announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement made by his elder brother Olikoye Ransome-Kuti
said that he died at around 5:30 P.M. on Sunday in a hospital in
Lagos.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate cause of death is heart failure but he had many
complications arising from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS)," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Fela is the first prominent Nigerian known to have died of
AIDs, though the country's AIDS/HIV population is estimated to be
as high as two million.
</P>
<P>
Fela had been ill for a long time before his death at the age
of 59.
</P>
<P>
He was born on October 15, 1938. He formed his first band in
1959 in London, where he was attending the Trinity College of
Music in Oxford from 1959 to 1962.
</P>
<P>
Fela leaves behind him over 40 music albums. Known as the
Afrobeat king, he is the most popular musician in Nigeria and his
influence went beyond his own country.
</P>
<P>
Most of his works are believed to have political undertones
which led to his strained relations with the authority.
</P>
<P>
His private life is most controversial. He was reportedly
married to 27 wives and is known to be using Indian hemp for
which his home was raided by the police for two times, the second
time just several months ago.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warship Arrives in Hong Kong for Port Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- USS Blue Ridge, the flagship of
the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet, arrived here today for a short port
call, thus becoming the first foreign warship to come to Hong Kong
since the July 1 handover.
</P>
<P>
The amphibious control vessel is expected to stay here for five
days to obtain some supply and minor repairs. Its 1,000 officers
and sailors will go ashore for rest during the stay.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, two other U.S. navy vessels, USS Patriot and USS
Guardian, will arrive in Hong Kong for the same purpose. The two
warships with altogether over 160 officers and men on board are
scheduled to leave on August 11.
</P>
<P>
Before the handover, U.S. navy ships came to Hong Kong at an
average of over 50 times a year, unloading 50,000 officers and men
into bars, restaurants and shops.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Chinese government permits U.S. warships to
berth in Hong Kong, as before, for rest and repair reflects the
principle of "one country, two systems" and is beneficial to the
development of the Sino-U.S. bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), any access of foreign warships to
the HKSAR ports should obtain permission from the central
government of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's handover, any application for access of
foreign warships to HKSAR is handled by the Chinese Foreign
Ministry Commissioner's Office in HKSAR. While examining the
application, the Commissioner's Office informs the HKSAR
government and the People's Liberation Army Garrison in HK of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Once the application is approved, the related country's
consulate general in Hong Kong can approach the concerned
departments of the HKSAR government to make concrete arrangements
such as sea-lanes, piloting and radio frequency.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Enterprises Urged to Adapt to Regional Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-scale
enterprises (SMEs) in Southeast Asia have been urged to adapt to
the regional dynamics and changes and avail themselves of the
benefits of the larger ASEAN market.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz said at the opening of the ASEAN-SMI showcase here today that
ASEAN industrial cooperation is expected to be strengthened and
provide opportunities for resource pooling among industrial
establishments in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Nations).
</P>
<P>
SMEs, which constitute about 80 percent of the total
establishments in the individual domestic economies, should
however build up the necessary capacities and capabilities to
enhance the inter- and intra-industry linkages both at home and
regionally, she said.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah urged the SMEs to invest in process and product
innovation and place priority on research and development and move
on to higher planes of technological development and application.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the SMEs in the region must begin to
establish an ASEAN and East Asian SME Network in order to optimize
benefits that they can derive from various regional initiatives
and programs, particularly in industrial development.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the realization of the ASEAN Investment Area
concept will further induce investment flows into ASEAN as well as
intra-ASEAN investment cross-flows.
</P>
<P>
She was of the view that the dismantling of both tariff and
non-tariff barriers in markets elsewhere can provide new
opportunities for SMEs, provided they have the requisite
preparedness to compete in the export market.
</P>
<P>
It is projected that in the year 2003 some 88 percent of
products under the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT)
scheme, the implementation mechanism of the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA), will be at tariff lines of five percent or below, Rafidah
said.
</P>
<P>
Forty-one percent of the CEPT products is expected to be at
zero duty, eight percent at three percent tariff and 47 percent at
five percent tariff level, the minister said, adding that by the
year 2000 the average rate of ASEAN CEPT for the top five sectors
will be between zero and five percent.
</P>
<P>
The sectors include machinery and electrical appliances,
mineral products, base metals, textiles and chemicals.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Sworn in as Fifth President of Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate cleric Mohammad
Khatami, 54, was sworn in here today as the fifth president of the
Islamic Republic of Iran since its founding in 1979.
</P>
<P>
In his swearing-in ceremony at the Majlis (parliament), the new
Iranian president attempted to offer a softer image of his country
by calling for dialogues with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said at the ceremony, present in which were his
predecessor President Hashemi Rafsanjani and some 600 ministers,
high-ranking officials and foreign diplomats, that Iran would not
seek to initiate tension in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The government considers the dialogue between the
civilizations a necessity and would try to avoid creating
tension," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he assured the hardliners at home that he was
committed to the ideal of radical Islam.
</P>
<P>
"We want to defend the Moslems around the world, especially
the Palestinian nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who entered the presidential race on a liberal
platform, said that he would fight for freedom and individual
rights.
</P>
<P>
"I have sworn on the Holy Koran and before you that ... I will
support the freedom and the rights of the individuals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing that the Executive Branch can do at this
juncture would be to try to institutionalize the law and most
importantly the constitution in order to serve the people," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The relatively liberal president also vowed to fight for a
balanced economy in which poverty would be absent.
</P>
<P>
"Elimination of the scourge of poverty is among the
responsibilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran," Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who served as Iran's minister of culture between 1982
and 1992, called on intellectuals and the press to evaluate and
critique his performance during his tenure which ends in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"I ask the press, the academe and people of culture ... to
increase public participation in the decision-making process by
their continuous evaluation and critique," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new president, who was elected by a landslide victory
after gaining nearly 70 percent of the votes on May 23, said that
the people were the main asset of the Islamic system in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The massive popular support for Khatami came as a surprise to
many, including those in the well-established and powerful
conservative camp here. His arch challenger, hardline Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, who was considered a front-runner
at the early stage of the race, suffered a humiliating defeat by
collecting some 25 of the ballots.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony today, Nateq-Nouri vowed that the parliament
would try its best to help Khatami's government to start its
work.
</P>
<P>
"We the parliamentarians have a religious and legal duty to
... help the new government start its work," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is widely believed here that the hardliner-dominated
parliament will this majority to interfere in the new president's
administration, first of all, the formation of his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has so far refused to discuss his choice of ministers
with the parliament. Reports here said he will introduce his
cabinet members to the parliament on August 9 and 10.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Makes Breakthrough in Fertilizer-Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The University of Zambia has made
a breakthrough in manufacturing local fertilizer after more 20
years of research with successful extraction of basal fertilizer
from phospherous rocks.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Fertilizer Technology Development Committee (ZFTDC)
Chairman Glasswell Nkonde said here Sunday that the fertilizer is
reay for mass production if investors are willing to take the
challenge, according to Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said phosphate fertilizers have always been imported at
exorbitant prices and if the mass production of the local
fertilizer is done, the commodity can be sold to people at
reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
Nkonde said that the fertilizeer has been tested throughout
the country in agriculture research centres and has proved to be
even superior to the imported ones due to the high quality of the
phospherous rocks in the country.

<HEADLINE> Australia Launches World's First HIV Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Australia formally launched
today the world's first experiment which offers enormous hope in
the fight against AIDS and other serious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Science and Technology Minister Peter
McGauran said the experiment, the world's first of its kind,
involves human trials of the revolutionary "gene shears"
technology, as a potential treatment of HIV, which causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Gene shears, or ribozymes, are naturally-occurring enzymes
which are capable of "switching off" specific genes. Test-tube
trials have already proven it can be used to prevent replication
of HIV.
</P>
<P>
The human trials, which will be undertaken in two stages, at
St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, and at a hospital in Los Angeles,
USA, will determine the safety and ability of gene shears in
destroying HIV in infected patients.
</P>
<P>
The experiment will involve six sets of identical twins. One of
each pair is HIV-positive and will receive white blood cells,
equipped with the anti-HIV gene shear, from the uninfected twin.
In the second stage, the infected twin will be infused with bone
marrow engineered with the gene shear.
</P>
<P>
"Gene shears have been acclaimed by the international
scientific community as one of the most significant breakthroughs
in molecular biology this decade, with suggestions it could be on
a par with the discovery of penicillin," McGauran said.
</P>
<P>
"Its potential applications are enormous, particularly in the
area of human health, but also in food and animal industries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The technology will be tested against a range of other human
diseases over the next three years. Field trials into
virus-resistant vegetable crops are already well-advanced.
</P>
<P>
McGauran said gene shears are also proof of the importance of
basic science.
</P>
<P>
The technology was first patented in 1987 by the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Australia's
leading research body, and has been further developed through the
establishment of Gene Shears Pty Ltd. and in partnership with
pharmaceutical giant Johnson and Johnson.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Claimed Over 1,200 Lives In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,200 people died and 18,000
others injured in road accidents in Zimbabwean last year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the national road traffic safety
awareness week at the weekend, Humphrey Malumo, President of the
Insurance Institute of Zimbabwe said 1,205 people reportedly
died in 38,777 accidents.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that 100 serious accidents occurred in the
country daily.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of the 38,777 accidents could have been
prevented if road-users had been more careful, he said.
</P>
<P>
Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police Fortune Zenengi
reiterated that road accidents were particularly a problem in
developing countries and were consequently detrimental to the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Republic Police, Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Board,
Vehicle Inspection Department and Automobile Association of
Zimbabwe will jointly focus on encouraging road-users to be
considerate on the roads.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Open Businesses Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in
China's Zhejiang Province have been trying their luck overseas
after they have faced more competition on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
By now, township enterprises in the province have opened
businesses in more than 20 countries and regions, which serve as a
springboard for other township enterprises to enter the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is one of the major areas with flourishing township
industry. Last year, 63 percent of its value-added industrial
output and more than half its exports came from township
businesses. And 14 percent of the workers and staff are
professionals who are much better qualified for market competition.
</P>
<P>
Shaoxing County is one example of how this works. In 1993, the
Zhejiang Youlan Group spent 300,000 yuan on a trade company in
Russia, whose textile products now do well on the East European
market. Then, 15 more businesses followed suit and have invested
nearly four million US dollars abroad.
</P>
<P>
Competing globally not only helps township enterprises sell
their products, but also helps them acquire market information and
advanced technology. More than 70 percent of the entities overseas
are showing a profit.

<HEADLINE> Poland Adopts New Environmental Protection Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Polish National Assembly
(parliament) has passed a new environmental protection law, giving
more power to local governments to deal with environmental issues,
according to the Polish Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, all the pollutant enterprises should
strictly hold the pollution level set by the provincial governors,
who are authorized to name the names of the violators.
</P>
<P>
The governors are also empowered to sound alarms when the smoke
level is high in the air and take measures to limit the number of
cars on the street, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, experts note that although Poland has made great
efforts to improve its environment, it still has a long way to
go. Now, as many as 11 percent of the country are seriously
polluted, with about one third of its population living in the
polluted areas.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Man Shot Dead Near Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A 61-year-old Palestinian man
was killed in a overnight shooting near the Jewish settlement of
Karmel, south of Hebron, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian eye witnesses said the man, who was identified as
Issa Misif from the village Yatta, was walking by the roadside
with his flock of sheep, when shots were fired at him from a
passing Israeli car.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces are investigating the death of Misif,
whose body has been taken for autopsy. The initial check
revealed that he was shot twice in the chest by a pistol.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources said they did not believe Misif was a
land dealer, nor was he suspected of being a collaborator with
Israel. Land dealers and collaborators are common targets of
terror attacks by Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
Some suspected the killing of Misif was a revenge attack
carried out by Jewish settlers in retaliation for the Wednesday
twin suicide bombings in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, which
killed 15 people and wounded 170 others. The militant
anti-Israeli Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has claimed
responsibility for the attack, though Israel remains dubious
about the authenticity of the claim.
</P>
<P>
"We assume it was a revenge killing by settlers for the attack
in Jerusalem last week. People are very angry, but no everybody
knows about it yet," said Ahmed Abu Kbeida, a resident from
Yatta.
</P>
<P>
But Opher Sivan, spokesman for Israeli police in West Bank,
cautioned against speculation about the identity of the killers,
saying "everything claimed in the media is pure speculation at
this point."
</P>
<P>
Following the Wednesday bombings, Israeli security forces have
been keeping high alert across the country amid intelligence
warnings about new terror attacks.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Urges Cambodian Lawmakers Abroad to Return Home </HEADLINE>

<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen today urged the dozen or so lawmakers, who chose
to stay abroad after the recent fightings in Phnom Penh, to return
home as soon as possible to participate in the election of a new
first prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the stone-laying ceremony of a medical building
here, Hun Sen said, "Among the 120 National Assembly members, more
than 10 are still remaining abroad. I appeal to them to come back
to Cambodia as quickly as possible to take part in the on-going
National Assembly sessions and vote for a new first prime minister
and other cabinet members."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the lawmakers should return to prepare for
the general elections in May 1998, he said, pledging he would
ensure their personal safety and political rights.
</P>
<P>
"We will not only protect the personal safety of these
parliament members, but also ensure their right to free political
activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question concerning Prince Ranariddh, Hun Sen
accused the first prime minister of smuggling weapons and making
illegal contact with the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh's unlawful acts must be put on trial in a court, he
said, "but if King Sihanouk gives an amnesty to Ranariddh, I will
agree."

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Mediate Political Crisis in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has invited delegations of the Lesotho government
and opposition parties to meet in Pretoria to solve their
differences, local daily the Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three major opposition parties invited by Mandela, who is
also chairman of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), are the Basotuland Congress Party (BCP), the Basotho
National Party and the Marematluo Freedom Party, the report
quoted a BCP spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe and Chairman of the
Political and Reconciliation Unit of the SADC, and his Botswanan
counterpart Ketumile Masire who is former chairman of the SADC,
will also be present at the meeting, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has been embroiled in a political crisis since June 9
when Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle, hitherto leader of BCP, the
majority party in parliament, left the party along with 40
parliamentarians to form the Lesotho Congress for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
The move by Mokhehle has infuriated opposition parties,
non-governmental organizations and some lawyers in Lesotho, so
much that they termed it as immoral, unlawful and
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
They called on King Letsie to dismiss Mokhehle and even
demanded for free elections.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle, however, defended his action, saying that he was not
wrong as he enjoyed the support of the majority of members of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
So far, King Letsie has not commented on Mokhehle's move.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Iran's New President Mohammad Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Mohammad Khatami, 54, was sworn in
here today as Iran's fifth president to replace 64-year-old
Hashemi Rafsanjani who ran the 62-million populated country for
two consecutive four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
The black turbaned new president was born in Ardakan, in the
central province of Yazd in 1943 to a religious family.
</P>
<P>
Son of an Ayatollah, senior level clergyman in Islam, Khatami
finished his early school years in his homeland. Then he attended
religious science center in Qom, about 140 kilometers south of
capital Tehran, from 1961 before getting his diploma.
</P>
<P>
Several years later, he got his B.A. in philosophy from
Isfahan University, accomplishing religious studies in senior
level at Qom Seminary.
</P>
<P>
Having started his post graduate studies in educational
sciences at Tehran University from 1970, he returned to Qom later
to pursue advanced Islamic courses at Qom seminary.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was involved in political activities and anti-Shah
campaign by preparing, duplicating and distributing political
statements, especially those issued by the late spiritual leader
Ruhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
He began his political activities at the Association of the
Moslem Students of Isfahan University, worked closely with
Khomeini's late son Ahmad Khomeini and Mohammad Montazeri and
organized religious and political debates.
</P>
<P>
Khatami chaired Islamic center of Hamburg in Germany before
the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The center turned into
an Islamic campaign center when Khomeini went to France.
</P>
<P>
He represented Ardakan and Meybod constituencies in the first
term of Parliament in 1980 and was appointed as the head of Kayhan
Institute by Khomeini in 1981.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, he was appointed as the minister of culture and
Islamic guidance during the premiership of Hussein Mousavi.
</P>
<P>
During the 1980-88 war between Iran Iraq, he served different
responsibilities including deputy and head of the joint command of
the armed forces and chairman of the war propaganda headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He was again appointed as minister of culture and Islamic
guidance by President Rafsanjani in 1989. But he had to resign
from the post due to pressure from the country's hardline bloc
after being labeled as liberal-minded.
</P>
<P>
Following his resignation in 1992, Khatami was appointed as
cultural advisor to president Rafsanjani and head of the National
Library.
</P>
<P>
He is familiar with three languages of English, German and
Arabic and has written a number of books and articles in
different fields.
</P>
<P>
He got married in 1974 and has two daughters and a son.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was elected as the fifth president by gaining
20,078,178 votes, nearly 70 percent of the votes cast on May
27 this year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Clothing Industry Facing Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Clothing Manufacturers'
Association Chairman Steve Bowen said on Sunday that more
companies in the clothing industry would be forced to close this
year because the industry was not doing well.
</P>
<P>
Seven textile companies have been liquidated since January
this year, causing hundreds of job losses, he said, adding 60
other firms are being sued for failing to contribute towards
workers' pensions.
</P>
<P>
The chairman blamed poor business on the high duty imposed on
imported raw materials as well as cheap garments flooding the
market from the Common Market of the Eastern anf Southern Africa
(COMESA) states.
</P>
<P>
Moreover,the 30 percent duty imposed on goods from Zimbabwe by
South Africa was too high and had resulted in only 7,195 garments
out of a quota of three million being exported to South Africa
this year, Bowen added.
</P>
<P>
"Our market has been flooded by imported goods because it is
cheaper to import finished products than raw materials. There is
no incentive for manufacturers and the industry is likely to be
affected by this for a long time," he said.
</P>
<P>
A 30 percent duty was charged on imported raw materials while
those who brought in finished products were charged only 10
percent.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sends Back Suspected Imported Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has returned 10 shipments of
food-stuff that fail to measure up to the health standard to their
exporting countries, Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The shipments, imported from Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Australia, Cyprus, Greece, Germany, Thailand and Spain, were found
unfit for human consumption and not in compliance with health
specifications, said the English daily.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Trade and Supply Minister Ahmed Goweily told Al Akhbar
recently that Egypt has sent back 142 tonnes of British beef
imported from the Netherlands that authorities suspected was
tainted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
Egypt banned imports of British beef immediately after the
European Union imposed an embargo on the meat in March 1996
because of mad cow disease, which was rampant in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Cairo banned imports of Belgian beef on July 3 after an EU
announcement of a Belgian company's possible involvement in
exporting British beef.
</P>
<P>
It returned 25,000 tonnes of Belgian beef considered unfit for
consumption and burned 519 tonnes of French beef for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crackdowns on food production factories last month
in Alexandria, the country's second largest city, resulted in
destroying about 7,657 tonnes of foodstuffs which were found to be
unfit for human consumption.

</P>
<P>
-- The intense heat and drought which are reigning southeast
France have transformed the Provence region into a tinder box,
where fires kept breaking out last weekend, destroying some 250
hectares of forests in the department of Bouches-du-Rhone near
Marseille.
</P>
<P>
-- The General Public Prosecutor of France has ordered that
Maurice Papon, the former Gaullist minister and governor of Gironde
accused of deporting thousands of Jews during World War II, be put
under judicial control in preparation for his trial to be held
on October 8 in Bordeaux.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Tourists in Egypt on Spending Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab tourists have come to
Egypt in droves this years, each spending, in just on month, more
than three times the average Egyptian earns in a year, Middle East
Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The number of Arab tourists to Egypt has risen 14.5 percent to
361,324 during January-July this year, the English weekly said in
its latest edition, quoting tourism officials.
</P>
<P>
Citizens from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Qatar and Iraq are making Egypt their summer vacation
spot, according to Nazmy Amin, undersecretary of state for the
Egyptian Tourist Authority (ETA).
</P>
<P>
According to an ETA report, the average amount a Gulf Arab
spends per day while in Egypt is 136 U.S. dollars, or 4,080 per
month, while World Bank figures show the average annual Egyptian
salary is 1,200 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Much of the reason for the rise in Arab tourism comes from a
one million U.S. dollar marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Tourism, along with the Egyptian Hotel
Association and other government agencies, have targeted the Gulf
region and boosted the amount of advertising on Egypt, especially
the Red Sea coast.
</P>
<P>
The increase in entertainment such as bowling centers, golf
courses and restaurants had also added new life and fun, according
to Tourism Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Arabs visiting Egypt would frequent Cairo and
Alexandria and spend their time for leisure and entertainment in
shopping malls, night clubs and theaters.
</P>
<P>
But this year, the trend has shifted to an interest in
Hurghada, Luxor and Sharm Al Sheikh, spots famous for their
archeological and scenic attractions.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf tourists come to Egypt instead of going to European
summer destinations, say most, because they feel strong ties with
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Another major pull has been investment opportunities. Joint
ventures and commercial tourism possibilities are tempting for Gulf
Arabs who have already began to build houses, tourism villages and
commercial centers in Cairo and the Sinai.
</P>
<P>
The best year for tourism was 1992 as a result of a big
publicity campaign and the worst was just one year later due to
terrorism and an earthquake, according to ETA.
</P>
<P>
The largest group of Arab tourists come from Saudi Arabia,
numbering 68,659, up 7.8 percent, followed by Kuwait, United Arab
Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Invites ILO Expert to Help Revise Labor Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has invited an expert
from the Interantional Labor Organization to help revise the
country's new draft labor law which provides for many changes to
benefit laborers - Kuwaitis and expatriates.
</P>
<P>
According to Khalil Al-Onaizi, assistant undersecretary for
legal affairs of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, said
here today the ILO expert will arrive within the coming few days.
</P>
<P>
Al-Onaizi said the expert would prepare a report on the bill
and the report would be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
The draft labor law, finalized by the Ministry of Social
Affairs and Labor last month, grants laborers more end-of-service
indemnity, increases annual public holidays and sick leave and
introduces more safety measures and certain other new benefits for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
The law, after approval, would cover all employees, Kuwaiti
and expatriates, working in the private and oil sectors, in which
about 80 percent of the employees are foreigners, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Onaizi said the new draft law has not dealt with the issue
of Kuwaiti sponsorship required for expatriate laborers, but it
allows the setting up of special recruitment agencies to provide
the needed employees to businessmen from inside and outside the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to eradicate the rampant visa smuggling, the draft
law bans employers from hiring expatriates without the necessary
permission from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
</P>
<P>
It also forbids businessmen from recruiting laborers from
outside Kuwait and fail to provide them with jobs, stipulating a
jail term up to three years and a fine of 16,500 U.S. dollars for
violators.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait currently has more than 600,000 foreign laborers and
the government has been striving to increase the percentage of
local employees in the private sector as well as in the
state-owned economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
The draft law will be submitted to the Cabinet and then to
Kuwaiti National Assembly for approval. Officials expect the it be
approved and come into effect before the end of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's new President Mohammad
Khatami, few hours after being sworn in, appointed Hassan Habibi,
the second man in the administration of former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, as his first vice-president.
</P>
<P>
In his decree, Khatami said that Habibi was appointed on the
basis of his "scientific and educational background, religious and
moral qualifications and experience in the administrative affairs
of the country."
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the official news agency IRNA, the
appointment is made according to the article 124 of Iran's
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
This was the first appointment made by the new president, who
said early today that he will introduce his cabinet to the
Parliament soon.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Habibi is seen here as the new president's
determination to keep Rafsanjani's economic policy and the
post-war reconstruction program, especially the Second Five-Year
Development Plan from 1996 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Habibi served as first vice-president under the administration
of Rafsanjani, who ran the country in the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
Habibi, 61, the son of Mirza Baqer Habibi, a shop-owner at
Tehran's bazaar, is well respected in the academic circle. He is
known as an academician, with no blemish on his integrity.
</P>
<P>
Raised in a strictly religious environment, Habibi got involved
in the religious circles that were rallying to overthrow the late
Shah in 1960s.
</P>
<P>
He fled to France in early 1960s after he was sought for his
political activities by the Shah's secret police. There he pursued
his academic career in sociology and received his doctorate. He
was also one of the leaders of the anti-Shah student movement in
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
weaker in Sydney today after a quiet local session which was
dulled by the absence of many market participants because of a
bank holiday in the state of New South Wales and Canberra.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Australian dollar had traded in a narrow
range, after being pushed below 74 US cents by a round of selling
during offshore overnight dealings in New York and London on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It closed lower at 73.94 US cents, from 74.45 US cents
previously.
</P>
<P>
Bankers Trust Australia senior dealer Geoff Bowmer said the
market had further tested the downsize today to see the unit tap
an intraday low of 73.65 US cents.
</P>
<P>
But buying interest from exporters soon saw the Australian
dollar recover back towards 73.80 to 73.90 US cents.
</P>
<P>
In the near term, the local unit was seen capped on the top at
74.10 US cents, while the downsize looked limited to 73.60 to
73.70 US cents.
</P>
<P>
Over the week, the Australian dollar was seen trading between
73.10 and 74.50 US cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 87.55 yen, from 88.56, and at
1.3783 marks, from 1.3756 previously.

SHANGHAI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's gas stations, which
serve China's largest economic center, will offer only lead-free
gas as of October 1.
</P>
<P>
The move is one of the local government's efforts to protect
the urban environment. Motor vehicle's exhaust fumes have become a
major source of pollutants in Shanghai.

Shanghai had 744,000 motor vehicles at the end of last

<HEADLINE> Greenhouse Gas Emissions on Rise in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Greenhouse gas emissions are
rising in Britain, making the country's combat against global
warming more difficult, Cambridge Econometrics said in a report
released today.
</P>
<P>
"Carbon emissions are projected to rise over the next
five to 10 years largely due to growing road transport and
power generation demand," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that by the year 2010 Britain's emissions are expected
to be less than four percent below 1990 levels. Under current
government policy emissions would only start to fall by 2008.
</P>
<P>
The British government has promised to cut its emissions of
carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, by 20 percent from 1990
levels by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The report said indications from the government that it might
encourage coal power stations could further hamper reductions.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market lost
ground today, taking the lead from New York's negative finish on
Friday, while the bank holiday in Sydney and other part of the New
South Wales state contributed to a drab day of trading.
</P>
<P>
"The bank holiday didn't help much, leaving the market to drift
with the negative influence from Wall Street," Henderson Charlton
Jones broker Philip Toop said.
</P>
<P>
"The resource stocks fared better than the industrials and the
banks due to some reasonable commodity prices on Friday night."
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index shed 21.5 points to close at 2706.0,
after the Dow Jones industrial average fell 28.57 points on Friday
to finish at 8194.04.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index dropped 36.6 points to 4349.5, while
the resources index slipped 9.6 to 1425.1.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a general feeling in the market now that the
resources will experience stronger earnings growth over the next
18 months than the industrials sector," Toop said.
</P>
<P>
"So there's a more positive underlying tone for the resources."
</P>
<P>
Among today's leaders, mining giant BHP lost 16 cents to finish
at 17.85 Australian dollars and mining company Rio Tinto fell 12.3
to 20.67 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, ANZ was hardest hit, losing 19 cents to
10.51 Australian dollars, followed by Westpac, which finished 16
weaker at 8.46 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The National Australia Bank shed 14 to 19.37 Australian
dollars, CBA was 12 softer at 16.53 Australian dollars and St
George Bank also dipped 14 cents to 8.81 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover reached just 223.94 million shares, worth
448.04 million Australian dollars (331.54 million US dollars).
Falls outpaced rises, 601 to 332, with 414 steady.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Levy Meet on Containing Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will meet with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Wednesday in a
bid to contain the volatile situation in the Mideast and salvage
the teetering peace march.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today that he had
invited Levy to Egypt for talks on ending the deteriorating peace
crisis following last week's suicide bombings in a Jerusalem
market which killed 15 people and injured 170 others.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that Levy is expected to arrive in Egypt
later today.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether the current Egyptian-Palestinian-U.S.
contacts could serve as a new starting point for the peace
process, Moussa said that "all depends on what the parties
(Palestinians and Israelis) can offer within the framework of the
implementation of the Oslo agreement."
</P>
<P>
"The two parties are requested to implement the agreement while
observing calmness, composure and self-restraint," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross is expected in the region
late this week for talks with Arab and Israeli officials on a new
U.S. initiative. Ross' scheduled trip here last week was put off
after the double suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassyouni told Voice of
Arab radio today that current Egyptian efforts are exerted to have
the transitional stage implemented and obstacles to the peace
march removed.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Israeli contact will coincide with an Arab League
council meeting to be held here tomorrow at the request of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to study the crucial
situation facing the Palestinians as a result of Israel's tough
measures and closure in the wake of the bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership called those measures and
culminating Israeli threat to re-enter areas of Palestinian
self-rule as "a declaration of war" against the PNA and the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Since last Wednesday, Israel has imposed a closure on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, barring tens of thousands of Palestinians
from jobs in Israel and restricting even Palestinians' movements
between their autonomous West Bank towns.
</P>
<P>
It also closed the Palestinian international crossing-points
with Egypt and Jordan and suspended the transfer of tax and
customs revenues to the PNA coffer.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been trying to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
which stalled after Israel broke ground on a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem in March.

<HEADLINE> More Terracotta Warriors Unearthed In Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The mausoleum of China's first
emperor in Shaanxi province has yielded even more terracotta
warriors in various positions: kneeling down to shoot, leading a
horse, or standing in a chariot drawn by four horses.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that these figures from Pit No. Two
are different from their companions that were brought to light
earlier, which are mainly foot soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The terracotta warriors, serving as a netherworld guard for Qin
Shi Huang, the first unifier of China and founder for the Qin
Dynasty (221-206 BC), were buried in three pits in the
mausoleum. They were discovered in 1974 when a local farmer was
digging a well.
</P>
<P>
Pits No. One and Three were excavated and opened to public by
1979 and 1989, respectively, and soon became known world-wide as
the "Eighth Wonder of the World."
</P>
<P>
Pit No. Two was regarded as the cream of the crop, but was not
excavated until March 1994 and was opened to the public later that
year, while the excavation was still under way. Archaeologists
have now removed all the earth over them, exposing a layer of
beams above the terracotta figures.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,350 beams covering a 3,000-sq. m. area, about half
of the pit, which are in good shape except for a few decayed or
burned that have collapsed, and 86 terracotta warriors and 44
horses and carriages have been excavated. The scientists say they
are unique.
</P>
<P>
In the process of clearing 11 doorways to the pit, the
archaeologists found traces of digging by iron tools, ditches
where water ran while the pit was being dug, wheeltracks,
footprints of the pit diggers, and traces of earthworms.
</P>
<P>
To the scientists' surprise, two tombs from the Eastern Han
Dynasty (25-220) were found above the terracotta figures,
suggesting that people may have discovered the pits some 1,800
years ago.
</P>
<P>
What is even more amazing is a hole perhaps dug by tomb robbers
from the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) leading to the rare
terracotta carriage drawn by four horses. Fortunately the carriage
was not the target of the treasure seekers.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists are now planning to excavate the
beam layer, while leaving a few beams for display. They will
repair some of the terracotta figures and leaving others in
fragments.
</P>
<P>
"That will impress visitors by showing them how the relics
looked before being repaired," the scientists explain.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) has reduced its budget from four million U.S.
Dollars to 820,000 Dollars for funding of development projects in
African countries, an U.S. official said here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
William Lusasavich, Director of U.S. Information Service, said
countries whose projects were being funded under the USAID
program have been asked to seek new sponsors although this has
put development programs in the region into disarray.
</P>
<P>
The agency had cut its budget funding of all African Credit
Union development programm by 80 percent, said Lusasavich, adding
it had also reduced by 50 percent the number of participating
African countries in development programs.
</P>
<P>
"The cut of funded projects by USAID does not mean the
organisation no longer had any other programs to fund in these
countries. It has undertaken to fund some since it has reduced
its budget by almost three quarters," the U.S. official noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a traditional
industrial base in northeast China, is working to remove three
major roadblocks to economic development.
</P>
<P>
The problems include poorly-operating state enterprises, lack
of efficiency in use of capital, and the state's grain buying,
selling, and storage system.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning plans to take three years to make medium-sized and
large state firms responsible for their own profits and losses and
to let them compete in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The province is going to try to improve its grain market. The
local state system of buying and selling has run in the red for
too long, and steps are to be taken to remove present barriers and
provide a long-term grain market goal.
</P>
<P>
Governor Wen Shizhen told Xinhua that the three schemes are
important for the province's overall economic development.

The visit, which the embassy initiated and scheduled to
coincide with Pollard's 43rd birthday Thursday, would have been
the first-ever by an embassy official. Pollard was granted
Israeli citizenship by the previous Labor government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Pollard wrote that Hanegbi's remarks, suggesting he serve the
remainder of his sentence in an Israeli jail, were "fraudulent
 ... calculated and without honor."
</P>
<P>
Hanegbi, who was referring to a new law which makes possible
prisoner transfers, said here Sunday night that "Israel will
respect Pollard's wishes and in any event will only act on the
subject (the prisoner transfer) if he puts in a request. "Pollard
first has to complete a formal request before Israel would take
any action," he Hanegbi added.
</P>
<P>
Pollard asked in his letter that how could Hanegbi
"returning a prisoner of Zion to Zion in chains? It was this
same cold-blooded cynicism that was evidenced when the government
of Israel threw me, an Israeli agent, out of the embassy" 13
years ago. He added that the current government has "escalated
... the degree of cold-blooded calculation and cynicism."
</P>
<P>
Pollard's wife, Esther Zeitz-Pollard, said in a statement that
it would take years before a prisoner-exchange accord between the
U.S. and Israel was formalized, and Israel would not be able to
legally parole Pollard without American consent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year Pollard's relatives accused Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of lacking enthusiasm in personally appealing
to President Bill Clinton to free Pollard when he visited
Washington, as his predecessors, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres,
did.

<HEADLINE> Search for Missing Israeli Submarine Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy's nuclear
submarine NR-1 will continue the search for a missing Israeli
submarine off the coast of Egypt, reported the pro-government
newspaper, The Jerusalem Post, today.
</P>
<P>
The search will be conducted outside Egyptian territorial
waters with the cooperation of Egyptian authorities, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ship has been searching for the Dakar, the Israeli
Navy's submarine that sank in January 1968, in the Aegean Sea for
the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Israeli Navy chief of personnel, a former
submarine force commander whose name was not disclosed in
accordance with Israeli laws, at a press conference aboard the
NR-1's tender in Haifa Bay Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Dakar, originally the HMS Totem, was built in 1944 and
purchased from Britain in June 1965 as part of a two-sub deal. It
sailed from Portmouth on January 9, 1968, en route to Haifa, where
it was to formally join the Israeli Navy, with a crew of 69.
</P>
<P>
On January 24, the Dakar, which was then south of Mediterranean
island of Crete, radioed navy headquarters for the last time,
saying it had made better time than planned and seeking permission
to arrive early. The request was denied, because the Navy did not
want the submarine arriving before the scheduled ceremony, which
the prime minister was to attend.
</P>
<P>
On February 4, the submarine was declared sunk and its crew
missing. On February 9, 1969, the Dakar's emergency buoy was found
by an Arab fisherman off the coast of Khan Yunis, Gaza Strip.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong province's rural
energy development has helped local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Use of methane has been greatly increased, with 160,000
household methane tanks set up by the end of last year, a 13
percent increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The province has developed 19 large and medium-sized methane

which produces over 110,000 kwh of electricity.
</P>
<P>
There are also improvements in the use of firewood and coal. By

stoves. The province has renovated 120,000 ovens, tobacco-curing
ovens, and brickkilns, saving 233,200 tons of standard coal.
</P>
<P>
The rural energy-saving projects have reduced the straw and
firewood use, improving farmland fertilization and preserving
forest resources, contributing a lot to the improvement of rural
environment.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 368 rural energy service companies,
employing 3,700 people, and there is a province-wide rural energy
industrial system for technical advice, help with contracts, and

<HEADLINE> Private Economic Growing In Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The private economy in China's
Qinghai Province developed rapidly in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, there were 67,000 household businesses in
the province, employing 100,000 people, with 492 million yuan in
capital.
</P>
<P>
The number of larger-scale private businesses in the province
rose to 2,100, with 26,000 employees, and 1.2 billion in
registered capital.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai is a remote inland province in the northwestern part of
China. Because of a lack of information, the province has lagged
behind other provinces in developing the private economy. By the
end of 1990, there were only 4,500 household businesses and 362
larger-scale private firms in the province.
</P>
<P>
But, the sector has seen faster growth since 1995, when
industrial and commercial departments at various levels began to
help by offering information and solving entrepreneurs' problems.
</P>
<P>
Taxes paid by these two types of business amounted to 126
million yuan in 1996, accounting for seven percent of the
province's total revenues.
</P>
<P>
And they provided jobs for 10,000 laid-off workers in the first
half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Seeks Unified Arab Front against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen
Dalloul Sunday lashed at the U.S. for failing to be an unbiased
sponsor of the peace process, calling for unified Arab front to
defend their interests against Israeli threats.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to retaliate Israel's stubbornness and
U.S. partiality is to set up a joint Arab front in which all
member countries are aware that their interests are threatened,"
Dalloul said, quoted by the Daily Star newspaper here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing popular delegations at Manara in the western Beqaa,
Dalloul called on the U.S. "to play the role of a neutral and
honest mediator in the Arab-Israeli conflict," adding that
"visits by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and peace
coordinator Dennis Ross to the region will be futile as long as
the biased policy of the U.S. has not changed."
</P>
<P>
He criticized Qatar for planning to host an economic
cooperation conference in November with Israel's attendance,
saying Doha's argument that the meeting would boost the peace
process "is ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
He described last week's double suicide bombings in Jerusalem
as "a natural consequence of the stalemated peace talks and the
crimes perpetrated by Zionists in many places."
</P>
<P>
Anti-Israeli attacks "are poised to continue as long as the
talks have not been restarted on the basis of just and
comprehensive peace and the principles agreed at the Madrid
conference," in which the peace process was launched in 1991,
Dalloul said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two million people in
Russia are using drugs, of whom 300,000 have become addicted, the
Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is due to rampant drug smuggling in the country. Court
cases involving drugs in 1996 numbered five times that of 1990,
sources from the Anti-Drug Bureau of the Interior Ministry was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Russian authorities confiscated more than 50 tons of
drugs and discovered 718 secret drug-processing labs.
</P>
<P>
Drug addiction has led to an increase of HIV carriers at the
speed of 100 people per day, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Lebanese Army in Violent Clash with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli airborne commandos
carried out at midnight today an infiltrating attempt in Nabatiyeh
area in south Lebanon and clashed with Lebanese army troops and
Muslim guerrillas, security sources reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
But no confirmation on the involvement of Lebanese army has
been made by government sources.
</P>
<P>
If proved true, this would be the first reported Lebanese
army's involvement in military clashes on the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict since Israel's "Grapes of
Wrath" operation in south Lebanon in April, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The sources said on condition of anonymity that at 1:00
a.m. (22:00 GMT), several Israeli helicopters landed the commandos
200 meters away from a position of the Lebanese army in the area,
some 75 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
During the violent clash, which lasted more than an hour and a
half, the Israeli commandos obtained support from "Apachi"
helicopters taking off from warships cruising in the
Mediterranean water near south Lebanon's coast.
</P>
<P>
The "Apachi" helicopters opened fire at Lebanese army troops
and the guerrillas, and Israeli forces in the hilltop outposts
overlooking the area also fired 155mm and 120mm artilleries toward
the battlefield, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters also flied reconnaissance missions at low
altitude over the area when the fighting was going on.
</P>
<P>
At 5:30 a.m. (0230 GMT), Israeli troops detonated the bombs
which they planted during the midnight attack, killing four
guerrillas who were trying to remove them.
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old girl coincidentally passing by was also wounded,
the sources said.

GUANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Weiping, vice-president

believes that Hong Kong and the inland area will increase economic
co-operation based on mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
There is competition between Hong Kong and the inland area, he

increased co-operation will not only promote the long-term

economic development of interior provinces.
</P>
<P>
Peng Xiaoyun, a Jinan University professor, noted that Hong
Kong's future is closely tied to China's reforms and
opening-up. She said that much needs to be done in perfecting the
country's economic operations and market economy laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Professor Peng also noted that the gap between Hong Kong and
the interior areas in the economic operations will be narrowed as

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Economy Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's economy has begun to
recover from its lowest point, despite the haunting effects of the
case of the financially troubled Kia Group.
</P>
<P>
Consumption in the private sector has been going up since June,
and facility and construction investment has also started to
increase, said the Ministry of Finance and Economy.
</P>
<P>
Citing as signs of the recovery, the ministry said the
country's exports in July grew at the highest rate so far this
year, while production activities continued to boom.
</P>
<P>
Sales of air-conditioners and beverages soared sharply amid
sizzling weather, and high sales of automobiles also contributed
to the revitalization of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The ministry previously predicted that the economy would hit
rock bottom around September or October.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Office also came up with data on the
national trend of industrial activities, featuring a 12.4 percent
rise in industrial output in June, compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Given the effect in the wake of strikes at major automobile
plants, the growth rate reached 9.7 percent, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Delivery of consumer products in domestic markets, which
dwindled 0.3 percent in May, rose 5.2 percent.

COLOMBO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 4,000 Tamil civilians are
stranded in Trincomalee town in the East of Sri Lanka, awaiting to
be ferried to Jaffna Peninsula in the North, according to reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
While four ships are available for the purpose, the owners of
the vessels are unwilling to expose the safety of their vessels
and crew to possible attacks by rebels of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who have been fighting for a separate state in
the north and east of the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE attacked several vessels carrying commodities to the
North from Colombo last month.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross has failed to
negotiate with the LTTE to escort the civilian ferries, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, those who had left their home due to
the fighting and were awaiting transport to the North, were mainly
teachers, students, workers, elderly persons and children.

<HEADLINE> US Warship Arrives in Hong Kong for Port Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- USS Blue Ridge, the flagship of
the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet, arrived here today for a short port
call, thus becoming the first foreign warship to come to Hong Kong
since the July 1 handover.
</P>
<P>
The amphibious control vessel is expected to stay here for five
days to obtain some supply and minor repairs. Its 1,000 officers
and sailors will go ashore for rest during the stay.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, two other U.S. navy vessels, USS Patriot and USS
Guardian, will arrive in Hong Kong for the same purpose. The two
warships with altogether over 160 officers and men on board are
scheduled to leave on August 11.
</P>
<P>
Before the handover, U.S. navy ships came to Hong Kong at an
average of over 50 times a year, unloading 50,000 officers and men
into bars, restaurants and shops.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Chinese government permits U.S. warships to
berth in Hong Kong, as before, for rest and repair reflects the
principle of "one country, two systems" and is beneficial to the
development of the Sino-U.S. bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), any access of foreign warships to
the HKSAR ports should obtain permission from the central
government of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's handover, any application for access of
foreign warships to HKSAR is handled by the Chinese Foreign
Ministry Commissioner's Office in HKSAR. While examining the
application, the Commissioner's Office informs the HKSAR
government and the People's Liberation Army Garrison in HK of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Once the application is approved, the related country's
consulate general in Hong Kong can approach the concerned
departments of the HKSAR government to make concrete arrangements
such as sea-lanes, piloting and radio frequency.

<HEADLINE> Budget Deficit Down Remarkably in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Czech government's budget
deficit went down remarkably in July, making it the best month for
the state finance so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Latest National Statistics Bureau figures carried by the press
here today showed an accumulative deficit of 8.8 billion koruny
(270 million U.S. dollars) by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the total deficit of 14.8 billion koruny (450
million dollars) at the end of June, the July figure represented a
drop of 6.0 billion koruny (180 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The improved finance was the result of government revenues of
287.6 billion koruny (8.71 billion dollars) and expenditures of
296.4 billion koruny (8.98 billion dollars) in July.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit of the Czech Republic emerged at the
beginning of this year as the country began to see a slowdown in
economic growth and recording a deficit in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
As over one third of the country's enterprises reported losses
and its currency was depreciated, the economy dipped into real
hardship and the deficit climbed to the all-time high in June.
</P>
<P>
To stop the downward slide, the Czech government rushed in
April and May to introduce the two series of austerity measures
that so far have cut its budgetary spendings by 7.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
The measures now in practice include downsizing government
institutions, postponing the construction of office buildings and
other facilities, and canceling regular state banquets.

WEIHAI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zhehai Oceanic Survey ship
departed Weihai Wharf late last month, marking the end of a
month-long comprehensive coastal waters environmental survey in
the Bohai and Huanghai Districts.
</P>
<P>
This survey, sponsored by China's National Environmental
Protection Agency, yielded valuable data concerning offshore
water quality and sources of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Besides the survey, the Chinese government has enacted a number
of related laws and regulations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Rapid local economic development focusing on the offshore oil
industry, ocean shipping and saltwater aquiculture has greatly
increased the volume of effluent industrial wastewater and
domestic flowing into the sea. Effluent discharges have led to
increasingly serious levels of offshore pollution.
</P>
<P>
Departments under the Offshore Environment Supervision Network
and Zhejiang Provincial Oceanic Ecological Environment Supervision
Station provided full support for the survey in order to
accelerate regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
The 257 supervision stations established in the districts are
responsible for monitoring 148 areas related to hydrology,
meteorology, sources of both land and sea pollution, aquiculture,
seabed deposits, offshore water quality, and effluent
discharges.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Govt Appeals Against Acquittal on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government Sunday
filed an appeal before the High Court against the acquittal of the
accused in the sensational Shima rape and murder case, according
to court sources.
</P>
<P>
Four policemen, accused of raping a garment worker, Shima
Chowdhury, who later died in jail, were acquitted on July 13 by a
Chittagong court, sparking widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
Court sources said Attorney General Barrister Nabi would be
appearing in the case today for admission of the appeal in the
High Court Division of the Supreme Court against the acquittal
order.
</P>
<P>
Shima Chowdhury was allegedly raped by policemen on October 9
last year while under temporary custody and she subsequently died
on February 7 this year in Chittagong Jail where she was kept in
judicial custody.
</P>
<P>
Shima's death in the jail provoked nationwide condemnation and
protest by various organizations, demanding investigation into the
case and punishment to the culprits.
</P>
<P>
It is stated in the petition for appeal that the rape of Shima
was corroborated by medical evidence. However, "since police
investigated the case against police personnel, the investigation
is not maintainable," said the petition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Parliamentary Committee met Sunday to probe the
death of Shima Chowdhury with committee chairman Foreign Minister
Abdus Samad Azad in the chair.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reviewed a report of the sub-committee which was
submitted earlier to this Parliamentary Committee, according to a
Parliament Secretariat press release.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Classifies Sri Lankan Rebels as Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States Senate has
unanimously recommended that the Clinton administration should
list Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam as a terrorist
organization, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has also urged that the Clinton administration
should expand its support for the anti-terrorist program in Sri
Lanka, the newspaper quoted Foreign Ministry sources here as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was passed last week as an amendment during
the Senate debate on the Appropriation Act of 1998 for the conduct
of foreign operations and related programs.
</P>
<P>
This is in the context of the Anti-Terrorist and Effective
Death Penalty Act of 1996 which authorizes the U.S. Secretary of
State to designate an organization as a foreign terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
So far the U.S. State Department has not listed any foreign
terrorist organization as authorized by this legislation.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. Senate stated reportedly that it was
concerned about the alarming toll that Tamil terrorists have taken
on innocent civilians in Sri Lanka, and urged the administration
to seriously consider making 750,000 U.S. dollars available in
anti-terrorism funds to combat this problem.

<HEADLINE> China More Experienced in Balancing Good Harvest and Crop Failures (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China has seen two major
ups-and-downs in grain production that have forced it to confront
the market fluctuations in the past 13 years, and now has enough
experience to balance successful harvests and crop failures,
Chinese economists say.
</P>
<P>
In the lean years of 1985-86 and 1991-92, there was famine in
some areas and grain prices shot up, bringing a handsome profit to
speculators and causing farmers and urban dwellers to suffer.
</P>
<P>
The state put large quantities of grain on the market through
state-owned grain stores and imported grain to satisfy domestic
needs.
</P>
<P>
Good harvests are both happy and worrisome events. They often
lead to overstocking, an insufficient number of warehouses, a
reluctance by grain importers to purchase grain, and a drop in
price, putting a damper on farmers' enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
To protect grain growers' interests and to stabilize the
market, in 1990 the Chinese Government started to set up a minimum
grain price system and the special grain reserve system. In 1994,
a grain market risk fund system was set up at provincial levels
and above.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Central Government began asking grain
producers in the Northeast and in Inner Mongolia to ship a certain
amount of grain to the South for storage.
</P>
<P>
These have had a positive effect, giving China a greater
ability to hold grain market risks down, according to Xie Yang, a
research fellow at the State Council's Development and Research
Center.

<HEADLINE> China More Experienced in Balancing Good Harvest and Crop Failures (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year's summer grain output has been estimated at 123
billion kg, 10 billion more than in the peak year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
This has affected summer grain purchases. Farmers in some areas
still have a great amount of grain on their hands after filling
state quotas and see the price take a nosedive when they try to
sell it on the market.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, decided
earlier this month to buy surplus grain without limit at a
protected price of 1.38 yuan per kg, and assured grain growers
they would make a profit.
</P>
<P>
This decision was praised by farmers all over the country, and
grain growers queued up outside state-run grain collection centers
each day.
</P>
<P>
One farmer, Liu Qiying, not long ago planned to reduce the
grain growing acreage in his hometown in Henan Province, a leading
grain producer, but told Xinhua that he would grow more grain next
year.
</P>
<P>
Summer grain output in Henan accounted for a third of the
nation's total. The Central Government policy had the enthusiastic
support of 80 million farmers in Henan, and the state has urged
townships to build more temporary warehouses and make full use of
unused ones. State banks have allocated 1.5 billion yuan for grain
storage expansion loans.
</P>
<P>
The government has also encouraged farmers to hold on to grain
and has promised to buy it later.
</P>
<P>
Li Yingzhong, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences says that a major task after a good harvest
is to keep farmers' enthusiasm for growing grain high to avoid a
possible drop in production.
</P>
<P>
Han Xiling, a professor at the Ministry of Internal Trade's
Zhengzhou Grain Institute, called the protected price a new way
for the socialist market economy to regulate the grain market. And
a State Planning Commission official says the move is an effective
method of increasing reforms in the grain system and improving the
grain market system.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China's Rich Ore Deposits Give Promise of High Yields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A number of newly discovered
mineral deposits in southwestern China indicate a bright future
for another non-ferrous metal production base for the country,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a large copper deposit explored in Simao in
Yunnan Province, gold deposits with promising reserves were
discovered in Lijiang, Zhongdian and Heqing counties of the
province during the first half of this year, according to the
Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
During the last few years, over 10 large mines have been
discovered in the counties crossed by "three rivers," namely the
Nujiang, the Lancang and the Jinsha Rivers. With a total area of
160,000 square kilometers, the "three rivers" region is believed
to be unusually rich in precious and non-ferrous metals.
</P>
<P>
The proven reserves of copper alone in the region will possibly
top 10 million tons, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is confident in the finding of 5,000 tons of
silver reserves and 50 tons of gold reserves in the region by the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission and the ministry has jointly
drafted a plan to intensify the prospecting of mineral resources
in the region. The two organizations will spend five to eight
years to work out a comprehensive report about mineral resources
distribution in the region.
</P>
<P>
General survey of mineral resources in the area will be intensified
and investment in the similar surveys and paid use of the rights
for prospecting will be encouraged, according to the
ministry.

<HEADLINE> Lower Unemployment Rate Major Task In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Bringing China's high rate of
unemployment down is a primary goal of the macro-economic
controls, according to monthly magazine "Outlook".
</P>
<P>
It says that the real rate of unemployment in urban areas was
7.5 percent by the end of the first quarter of this year, at 15.5
million people. This was 4.5 percent higher than 1996's three
percent, or 5.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
Rural areas have 175 million surplus labourers, representing an
unemployment rate of 34.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The higher unemployment rate is attributed to a contradiction
between a large amount of labor but few funds, large scale
industrial readjustment, an increasing number of lay-offs at
state-owned enterprises, and the high rate of economic growth and
investment.
</P>
<P>
Labor is China's richest resource, but how to make use of it is
a key link to sustained economic growth. China needs to develop
labor-intensive industries and a policy of saving capital while
using more workers.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of ways to reduce unemployment, according to
the magazine:
</P>
<P>
-- Enlarge the service industry in food service, commerce, and
tourism;
</P>
<P>
-- Develop the non-state economy and help it to absorb laid-off
workers;
</P>
<P>
-- Develop small labor-intensive enterprises by providing them
with loans;
</P>
<P>
-- Encourage unemployed urban dwellers to open small businesses;
</P>
<P>
-- Support foreign trade based on labor-intensive industries,
and
</P>
<P>
-- Develop more labor markets and job agencies, especially for
those who have no special skills, and set up unemployment and
old-age insurance.

<P>
JINAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Latest figures show that Zibo, a
city in east China's Shandong Province, has been home to some
1,400 foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The State Council granted Zibo, an inland city with no airport,
approval to open to the outside world in 1988. The city has since
attempted to improve its investment by installing over 300,000
program-controlled telephones, and 17,000 long distance
lines. Zibo has also improved its water and power systems, as well
as various other infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
The UN China Investment Promotions Office under the United
Nation Industrial Development Organization opened its Zibo Work
Station in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Zibo has regulated its industrial structure by channeling over
1.7 billion US dollars in foreign capital into hi-tech industry,
infrastructure facilities and agriculture.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Severe Drought Hits Jinan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Jinan, east China's Shandong Province,
is in the grips of a severe drought resulting from an extended
period of abnormally high temperature.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports indicate water shortages are affecting some 30
percent of the city's total population.
</P>
<P>
The extended heat wave has caused the city's water table to
fall to only 24 meters, a drop of more than three meters on levels
during last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River Water Plant, which normally supplies 200,000
cu.m. of water daily, has been forced to suspend operations due to
low water levels in the lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The city's current 700,000 cu.m daily water supply is some 150,000
cu.m short of the demand.
</P>
<P>
The city, long famous for hundreds of springs, has faced a
critical water shortage since the 1970s, with all local springs
drying up in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The city's water table continues to fall by 5-7 centimeters
daily and there is little hope for rainfall in the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
The local government has introduced measures restricting or
suspending industrial water consumption, and has adopted
contingency plans to limit residential consumption if necessary.

<P>
ATHENS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of the Greek troops
participating in the Italian-led multinational security force in
Albania returned home today.
</P>
<P>
The Greek contigent, 278 officers and non-commissioned
officers, arrived in the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos said at a welcoming
ceremony that the presence and initiatives of the Greek force made
it possible for the Albanians to hold free and democratic
elections and thus opened the way for Greek armed forces to assume
a role of "ambassador of peace" in countries faced with long
crises, instability and abnormity.
</P>
<P>
In April, a total of more than 700 Greek troops arrived in the
neighboring country to protect the speedy distribution of
humanitarian aid and the June 29 general elections.

and women's 100-meter titles for the United States with the season's
best times at the current 6th World Athletics Championships here
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Greene upset world record holder and Olympic champion Donovan
Bailey of Canada in the final with a clocking of 9.86 seconds, the
fourth best time in history and only 0.02 seconds shy of the world
record.
</P>
<P>
"The Lord was helping me to have the grace today. I said that I
would bring the American sprint back and this was the start of this
aim," said a beamed Greene after his triumph.
</P>
<P>
"My acceleration was very good. In a 100m race you can only win and
the world record will come," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who beat Michael Johnson in the million-dollar 150 meters
race on June 1, equalled his year's best mark in 9.91 to nail the
silver. The bronze medal was won by another American Tim Montgomery,
who taped 9.94.
</P>
<P>
"Until 60 meters I was racing well. Then another Bailey was
running. Greene won and that's about it. I'm looking for excuses, I
have just had too many problems this season," said Bailey, who has
been plagued by leg injuries this year.
</P>
<P>
The pre-race favourite Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago
disappointed the crowd with a fifth finish in 10.02, much slower than
his second round clocking of 9.87 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Olympic silver winner Frank Fredericks of Namibia cruised home
fourth in 9.95.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 100m showdown, Jones lived up to the prediction when
she hit the tape with a 10.83 seconds, the year's fastest time and
0.06 seconds inside her personal best.
</P>
<P>
Two less-known sprinters raked up the silver and bronze. Zhanna
Pintussevich of Ukraine wound up second in 10.85 and Sevatheda Fynes
of Bahams third in 11.03.
</P>
<P>
The day saw bad luck hit Jamaica's Merlene Ottey again and rob the
37-year-old the last chance to win the 100m world title.
</P>
<P>
Sevatheda jumped at the gun and made a false start, but Ottey
didn't hear the gun. With a determination to compete for the gold, the
Jamaican ran as fast as she could till 70 meters. That coused her too
much power and strength and made her fate doomed.
</P>
<P>
Jones said about the false start:"I have learned that anything that
happens in a race you just have to shake it off. The first gun went
off and Merlene didn't hear it. I was just determined to make my seond
start a little better."
</P>
<P>
The basketballer-turned sprinter added:"This championship is the
tops of my list far and a lot higher than my past basketball career.
The basketball NCAA final was a great experience a couple of years ago
but this is tops. I am definately here to stay for many years."
</P>
<P>
Ottey was out of reaching after the race. No one knows why mishaps
always hit her. The sprinting star was twice nipped at the line by
Gail Devers of the United States at the previous meet and last year's
Olympics. After struggling on the track over 20 years, her dream of
winning the 100m world title has ended like a nightmare tonight.
</P>
<P>
Heinz Weis of Germany claimed the men's hammer gold with a 81.78
toss, beating Andrey Skvaruk of Ukraine and Vasilly Sidorenko of
Russia into second and third places.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's qualifying competitions, defending champion and Olympic
winner Derrick Adkins of the United States was surprisingly eliminated
in the men's 400m hurdles semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Michael Johnson almost toppled out of the men's 400m semifinals
when the world and Olympic champion eased up in the late stage, but
was pipped by Ibrahima Wade of Senegal. Johnson clocked 45.39 seconds
to finish fourth in the group, placing overall 15th among the 16
qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
The other big names all sailed into next rounds without trouble.

YAOUNDE, August 3 (xinhua) -- Congolese President Pascal
Lissouba and his rival former President Sassou Nguesso have made
concessions in separate negotiations aimed at reviving peace
talks, according to sources monitored here today.
</P>

The announcement was made by Bernard Kolelas, Chairman of the
National Mediation Committee after a meeting with U.N. Special
Envoy Mohammed Sahnoun.

Reports said Lissouba has accepted in principle the proposal
to form a transitional government of national unity, and that
Nguesso might moderate his demands.
</P>

A peace accord will pave the way for international peace
keeping force to be deployed in Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>

the warring factions could not agree on a transition to
elections.
