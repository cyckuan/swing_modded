<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Governor Wants Death Sentence for Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Governor Frank Keating of
Oklahoma of the United States said today he wanted Terry Nicols
sentenced to death for his role in the 1995 Oklahoma bombing,
regardless of a jury's mixed verdict earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The federal jury in Denver, Colorado, found Nicols guilty of
conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter, but not murder. The
penalty phase of the trial is scheduled to begin Monday.
</P>
<P>
The blast of a federal building on April 19, 1995, killed 168
people and injured hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
Keating told "Fox News Sunday" that he believed Nicols should
now be tried on state murder charges, saying Oklahoma could
provide an impartial jury despite being the scene of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
He supported the state legislature's provision of 1 million
dollars for the state prosecution of Nicols and co-conspirator
Timothy McVeigh, who had already been convicted of murder and
sentenced to death in a federal court earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Describing the bombing of the Alfred Murrah building as an
extreme case warranting capital punishment, Keating said, "What
worse case can you get? Killing 168 people with premeditation. I
think if capital punishment is not given in this case, it could
not be given in any case."

<P>
PARIS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A 50-year-old Moroccan man was
killed in a fire which devastated a running down apartment
building in central Paris today, said police.
</P>
<P>
The fire could be caused by an accident in the big building
which was illegally occupied by some 365 North African and black
African people, as the government banned people from inhabiting
the house in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The mayoral office of Paris said that it had put into place
immediately all the necessary measures to rehouse the people
living in the building, which is situated on Rue Louvel-Tessier in
the 10th district of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that among the 365 people forced to leave the
building were 15 children, and the government was using a
gymnasium nearby as a temporary shelter for them, before sending
them to emergency houses of the city.

<HEADLINE> 2 Iranians Get Life Term for Shooting Kuwaiti MP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Iranians and a Kuwaiti
man were sentenced to life imprisonment today by a local criminal
court after being convicted of attempted murder of an outspoken
Kuwaiti parliament member in June.
</P>
<P>
The two Iranian brothers named Sayed Mohammed Ardabili, 25, and
Sayed Abdulhadi Arbadili, 19, were punished for their role in the
June 6 shooting of liberal MP Abdullah Al-Neibari and his wife
Ferial Al-Freih.
</P>
<P>
Five suspects, including the two Iranians, were arrested within
24 hours after the assassination took place shortly before night
fall. Al-Neibari was injured by machine-gun fire along with his
wife while driving toward Kuwait City from beach villa near the
Saudi border.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti also sentenced to life imprisonment is identified
as Salman Al-Shamlan, who masterminded the attack.
</P>
<P>
A leading liberal member and head of the Public Fund Protection
Committee in the 50-seat Kuwaiti parliament, al-Neibari is renown
for his fighting against corruption and embezzlement of public
funds.
</P>
<P>
So far no motive was given for the attack, but informed sources
said al-Neibari was about to uncover a defrauding case in which
al-Shamlan was probably involved. A number of cabinet ministers
were then asked by al-Shamlan's committee to face inquiries.
</P>
<P>
During interrogations the suspects mentioned several
high-ranking officials and confessed they "wanted to defend those
ministers and avoid them such an embarrassment."
</P>
<P>
A second Kuwaiti suspect, Adel Mohammad Al-Megemi was sentenced
to a 10 year jail term for his help in the attempt while a third
was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Life sentence is the most severe punishment by law
in Kuwait except rare execution cases which needs sanction from
state paramount leader the emir.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Suspend Bi-communal Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Cypriots have
decided to suspend contacts with the government of Cyprus
controlled by the Greek Cypriots as from Saturday, Turkish Cypriot
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
What will be affected by the decision are bicommual activities
sponsored by foreign countries, especially the United States,
contacts between two communities' trade unionists, business
people, women's organizations, students and professors, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Taner Etkin, "foreign minister" of the
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", a break-away part of
Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots are to review the decision of this month by
European Union which is to start accession negotiations with
Cyprus next March, but exclude Turkey, Etkin said.
</P>
<P>
European Union's decision has angered the Turkish Cypriots,
whose leader Rauf Denktash has claimed the negotiations between
the two communities are "dead," and that he will no longer discuss
the subject with the U.N. and the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister of Cyprus Ioannis Kasoulides criticized the
decision of the Turkish Cypriots on Saturday, calling it an
"extortionist move."
</P>
<P>
He said that the negative policy of the Turkish Cypriots toward
the EU will prove damaging for them.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north in 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after an
abortive pro-Athens coup by the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and some countries, including the U.S., have been
making efforts to help reunify Cyprus based on a bi-zonal and
bi-communal formula. But so far little tangible results have been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Pro-British Guerrillas Claim N.Irish Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Pro-British guerrillas said
today they killed a former Irish republican prisoner in a gun
attack in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The man killed was Seamus Dillon, who had served 14 years in
jail for a 1980 murder linked to the province's political and
religious conflict.
</P>
<P>
The attack by the Loyalist Volunteer Force Saturday night was
in reprisal for the killing hours earlier of their leader, Billy
Wright, by Irish republican prisoners inside a top-security jail,
according to reports from Belfast, capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
Wright, a guerrilla leader known as "King Rat," was shot by
members of the Irish National Liberation Army, a breakaway group
from the mainstream Irish Republican Army (IRA). Both groups are
fiercely opposed to British rule in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The violence, at a time when major guerrilla groups on both
sides of the province's sectarian and political divide are
observing a cease-fire, threatened to plunge Northern Ireland's
peace process into crisis.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the
province was living through a "dangerous" phase in its history.
The government would have to respond to events "clearly,
concisely, without over-reacting," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that she would hold a meeting Monday with her prisons'
minister Adam Ingram, police chiefs and prison officials to
discuss the way forward.

<HEADLINE> French Extreme-Right Urges Resignation of Prefect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- France's extreme-right National
Front (FN) today urged the resignation of the prefect of the
French overseas island territory of Martinique, after its leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen was rounded up by protesters at the airport of
the Caribbean island Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"No matter it is simply because of his incompetence or because
of his negligence which openly covered an operation of the
hooligans, the responsibility of the prefect is heavily involved.
He should go," said the party's national secretary in charge of
overseas territories and departments, Huguette Fatna, in a
published statement.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen was rounded up by some 50 militants of the independence
movement of Martinique Thursday at the airport of
Fort-de-France/Lamentin before he flew to Porto Rico.
</P>
<P>
The protesters attacked Le Pen for his remarks on "racial
inequality" and on the gas chambers of Nazi death camps, which he
said were "a point of detail in the history of World War II."

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls for Developing Domestic Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today called on well-off nationals to help tide over the tourism
depression caused by the November terrorist attack, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The well-offs should spend their vacations at home and cut
their travels and spending abroad, Mubarak made the call after
inaugurating an oil field at Wadi al Sahl about 430 kilometers
south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"I am certain that the well-to-do Egyptian vacationers can
enjoy the winter and summer attractions of their country better
than any place abroad," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best thing to do to reverse the bad effects of the
Luxor terrorist attack" on tourism of Egypt, he added.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants relentlessly killed 58 foreign tourists on
November 17 in southern resort Luxor about 500 kilometers south of
Cairo, dealing a crippling blow to Egypt's lucrative tourism
industry during the peak season of the winter.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists have reportedly canceled trips to Egypt, and
many countries have warned their nationals against travelling to
Egypt at present.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Tourism Ministry has said that hotel occupancy rate has
dropped to 18 percent from 70 percent in one month after the
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government is trying to make up for the losses by
targeting three areas, the Arab world, eastern Europe and Latin
America, in addition to encouraging nationals to spend vacations
at home.
</P>
<P>
According to a "100-day program" proposed by the Tourism
Ministry to activate domestic tourism, banks, political parties,
professional unions, sporting clubs, schools and universities have
been suggested to organize trips for their members to places of
interest in Egypt.

BAGHDAD, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today said the recent
U.S. talks with Turkey on protecting Kurds in northern Iraq
revealed the two are conspiring to carry out a U.S.-British scheme
of interfering in Iraq's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency quoted an unidentified spokesman
as saying the U.S. has been, and is still working to spread
disorder and instability in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He spokesman accused Washington of making northern Iraq an
arena for bloody internal conflicts and a target of Turkish
military attacks and invasion as well as foreign intelligence
violations.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a Voice of America report Saturday that
U.S. President Bill Clinton discussed with Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz efforts to continue pressuring Iraq with the view of
protecting Iraqi Kurds.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that by agitating Ankara in the wrong way,
the U.S. has inflicted heavy security and economic damage upon
Turkey, damage that can not be made up by U.S. promises to support
Turkey's request to join the European Union and cooperation in the
field of energy.

HARARE, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister
Stan Mudenge left Harare Sunday for a three-day visit to Zambia
amid mounting international condemnation of Lusaka's detention of
founding President Kenneth Kaunda on suspicions of involvement in
failed coup.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge however said he was going to attend a joint
Zimbabwe-Zambia ministerial commission discussing the two
countries bilateral agreements and the current political climate
in the region, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge, accompanied by Mines, Environment and Tourism
Minister Simon Moyo said in an interview at the Harare

message to President Fredrick Chiluba from his counterpart Robert
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the joint commission will look into the arrest
and detention of Kaunda, Mudenge said, "the meeting will look at
all issues affecting the two countries and all our bilateral
agreements."
</P>
<P>
He refused to comment further on the Kaunda case saying he
will issue a statement upon his return from Zambia Wednesday but
sources interviewed later revealed the Kaunda issue was top
priority on Mudenge's agenda.
</P>

<P>
HARARE, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition National
Progressive Alliance (NPA) called on Zambian President Fredrick
Chiluba to release former president Kenneth Kaunda detained on
Christmas day on suspicions of involvement in October's coup
attempt.
</P>
<P>
The NPA said on Sunday the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
should send a delegation to Zambia to investigate whether
allegations being levelled against Kaunda, now opposition leader,
were true.
</P>
<P>
NPA President Canciwell Nziramasanga said the OAU should play
an important role in freeing Kaunda who played an important role
in the liberation of most African countries from the reigns of
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
He said people such as Kaunda, Tanzania's Julius Nyerere and
Ghana's late Kwame Nkrumah were a rare species which should be
treated with Honor rather than humiliation that Kaunda is now
being subjected to.
</P>
<P>
"We are very cross about the arrest of Kaunda and if the OAU
has to maintain law and order in the region it has to move in,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested three days after his return from a
marathon trip abroad ending speculations that he was likely to be
arrested over the October coup bid, staged by junior army
officers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Air Controllers'' Strike Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation
of Air Traffic Controllers Associations (IFATCA) today said it is
seriously concerned with developments within Zimbabwe's civil
aviation industry following the dismissal by the government on
Wednesday of 67 striking controllers and cadets.
</P>
<P>
IFATCA executive vice-president for Africa and the Middle East
Oliver Farirayi said in a statement the dismissal of the air
traffic controllers and cadets was unjustified especially in the
absence of any serious negotiations to try and meet the demands
of the workers.
</P>
<P>
The controllers were fired after having gone on a work
stoppage following their failure to agree with the government on
the need to revamp their working conditions, machinery, grades
and salaries.
</P>
<P>
IFATCA recommended the dispute be settled through
negotiations, mediation, consultation or arbitration.
</P>
<P>
"For guaranteeing safety, air traffic controllers shall not be
replaced by personnel who do not hold atc licenses, validations
and competency appropriate to the duties that they are expected
to undertake," said Farirayi.
</P>
<P>
He added authorities should not resort to the use of civil
mobilization or "requisition measures for the purpose of ending
or preventing national disputes in air traffic control.
</P>
<P>
He added IFATCA had identified some problems with the air
traffic control system in Zimbabwe which he said could lead to
safety and national security problems.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to ask the authorities to engage in serious
dialogue with the air traffic controllers in order to reach a
mutual agreement. We as an organization aim to promote safety,
efficiency and regularity in international navigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the situation at Harare International Airport
remained the same Sunday with most flights leaving long after
their scheduled time.

<HEADLINE> Britain Set to Slide Down Growth League in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain is set to lose its
place at the head of the European growth league for the first time
in five years, according to leading economic forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Britain's growth rate has powered ahead of its European
competitors since it left the exchange rate mechanism in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson forecasts a slowdown in growth in the
UK gross domestic product to 1.8 percent, while Germany should
improve to 2.6 percent, France to 2.7 percent, Italy to 2.6
percent, Portugal to 3.7 percent and Spain to 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed the reasons why Britain will be
overtaken by these countries are its interest rate rises, tax
increases and falling export performance.
</P>
<P>
Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Smith Barney, said
that after "a golden mix" of strong economic growth, falling
unemployment and a successful reduction in the budget deficit in
Britain, "the coming year promises to be very different."
</P>
<P>
Britain's growth rate will fall from 3.5 percent this year to a
consensus estimate of 2.4 percent in 1988, tumbling its place in
the European growth league as low as tenth.
</P>
<P>
Observers here also believe that Britain's performance reversal
may weaken the force of the UK's six-month European Union
presidency and will also fuel the debate on whether Britain should
join the single currency earlier than 2002, as it has indicated.

<P>
LONDON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister David
Andrews today condemned as "obscenities" the tit-for-tat killings
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"The obscenities of recent days may well be designed to
undermine the peace process. They must not be allowed to do so,"
Andrews said in a statement.
</P>

The shooting of a guerrilla leader and the reprisal killing of
a former prisoner Saturday by splinter groups of major guerrillas
in the British-ruled province demonstrated the opposition to the
peace talks in Northern Ireland, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The full-scale peace talks, beginning last September between
major guerrilla groups on both sides of the province's sectarian
and political divide, aimed at ending nearly 30 years of religious
and political conflict which has also hit the Irish republic.
</P>
<P>
The Irish foreign minister said, "I actively join with other
political leaders in urging calm and restraint, and in emphasizing
that the only way forward is through the dialogue of the talks
process."

The opposition, which is expected to submit its objections
and propose amendments for the arrangements bill to the
Knesset, has charged that Netanyahu has capitulated to coalition
demands that would damage the national interests.
</P>
<P>
And the Labor party said that the concession will cost
billions of shekels and demands that every agreement between
the prime minister and his coalition partners be brought
before the Knesset plenum.

<HEADLINE> French Union Urges Emergency Measures After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The French trade unin Force
Ouvriere (FO) today called for emergency measures against violent
acts against public transport after a public streetcar was stoned
Saturday night by troublemakers in Mulhouse, eastern France.
</P>
<P>
The FO secretary in charge of transport, Roger Poletti,
expressed his "entire support" to the streetcar workers of
Mulhouse after this attack.
</P>
<P>
But he regretted that the workers once stopped providing
service to the district considered to be "hot," after the accident
took place.
</P>
<P>
"The refusal to serve the most disadvantaged districts divides
the nation into different speed tracks. This cannot but be
provisionary because it jeopardizes the essential nature of public
service itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several attacks against public transport drivers or vehicles
took place during this Christmas season, causing traffic confusion
in some cities.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ministers on Second Tour in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet ministers
today took the second inspection tour of the West Bank in a week
to review Israel's security needs ahead of the proposed troop
pullback and permanent talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
surveyed the area by helicopter. They stopped at key hilltop sites
to hear briefings by Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, who
guided today's tour to lobby for support to his redeployment map.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai guided last tour on Tuesday,
proposing the width of the security zones be reduced to be
accepted by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
However, Sharon said that he demanded the creation of security
zone 20 kilometers wide along the Jordan Valley and another seven
to 10 kilometers wide along the 1949 armistice line, or Green Line.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that his demands were the "minimal" for protecting
Israel's safety.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu agreed with Sharon's view. He also reiterated his
position that no Jewish settlement in the West Bank will not be
dismantled in the overdue second-phase redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio reported today that Netanyahu's
attorney Yitzhak Molcho has told PNA President Yasser Arafat that
Israel was serious in carrying out the pullback in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Molcho explained that Netanyahu was having difficulties in
getting the budget for next year passed in the Knesset
(parliament) by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Today's tour by the Israeli cabinet is part of the ongoing
preparation for the second-phase troop redeployment in the West
Bank. The United States was urging Israel to produce an agreement
on the percentage of pullback by January 15.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet had held several sessions to formulate the
pullback in the West Bank and the guidelines for the permanent
talks, but failed to reach an agreement due to division on
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Arafat will meet separately with U.S. President
Bill clinton in Washington next month to discuss ways to pushing
forward the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In early January, U.S. special peace envoy Dennis Ross would
return to the region to continue mediation.

<HEADLINE> UNIP Says It Wants Genuine Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The United National
Independence Party (UNIP) led by former Zambian president Kenneth
Kaunda said here today that it wants genuine and serious dialog
to resolve the issues which are at the center of the political
impasse in the country.
</P>
<P>
UNIP National Chairman Malimba Masheke told a news briefing at
UNIP headquarters that "Zambia is a big country. We can't all be
friends but we can all be patriots prepared to talk to all
leaders in their various political parties whether we like them
or not."
</P>
<P>
The dialog to be held at the end of this month is "nothing but
a futile exercise in trickery, which will achieve nothing," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that there will be no agreement on amending the
contentious clauses in the constitution and there will be no
agreement on a new and commonly accepted register of voters.
</P>
<P>
There will be no agreement on setting up a truly independent
electoral commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
No one should be cheated that the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) want real dialog and all they want is
a window dressing exercise so that they can get donor funding for
their budget, Masheke said.
</P>
<P>
He demanded Kaunda's immediate release without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Micheal Sata, co-chairman of the inter-party talks and
government minister without portfolio said here today that the
proposed inter-party dialog will go ahead as scheduled on
December 30 and 31.
</P>
<P>
After Kaunda was arrested by police on Thursday a number of
parties announced their withdrawal from the inter-party dialogs
including UNIP.
</P>
<P>
At the preliminary meeting held early this month 31 parties
drew an agenda for the inter-party dialog. The agenda includes
most contentious issues like constitution, electoral process and
voters' register and fresh registration.
</P>
<P>
Before Kaunda's arrest 28 parties confirmed their
participation of the dialog, which was originally scheduled early
next month.

<HEADLINE> NPA Reaffirms Withdrawal of Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The National Patriotic
Alliance (NPA) reaffirmed here today its withdrwal of the
proposed inter-party dialog.
</P>
<P>
NPA, an umbrella group comprising 12 Zambian opposition
parties, met here this morning to review the recent development
vis-a-vis the inter-party dialog, Acting NPA Chairman M. Lisulo
told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in the country is not at all conducive
for the holding of the dialog.
</P>
<P>
The continued state of emergency imposed after the October 28
abortive coup does not augur well for the resolution of the
current political impasse, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lisulo condemned the arrests of former president Kenneth
Kaunda and Dean Mung'omba, leader of Zambia Democratic Congress
(ZDC) in connection with the coup.
</P>
<P>
The political parties under the alliance have resolved that no
genuine and meaningful dialog can take place and all the parties
will not take part in the talks unless the state emergency is
lifted forthwith and Kaunda, Mung'omba and all political
detainees be released and all leaders of political parties who
are forced to stay out of the country are free to return and
participate in the dialog without fear of arrest and harassment,
Lisulo said.
</P>
<P>
Micheal Sata, co-chairman of the inter-party talks and
government minister without portfolio said here today that the
proposed inter-party dialog will go ahead as schedule on December
30 and 31.

So far only six parties have confirmed their participation in
the dialog.

<HEADLINE> One Quit Kenya's Presidential Race at Last Minute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan presidential candidate
Setphen Omondi Oludhe, the leader of the tiny Economic
Independence Party, announced today the final campaign day that
he quit the race to support President Daniel arap Moi's bid.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 73 and in power for 19 years, is "a wise and able" leader
to be voted for on Monday, the polling day, he was quoted by
local sources as saying in Kisumu, the third-largest city of
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Oludhe's party, set up late last month, was the youngest party
in the campaign with Moi's 37-year-old ruling Kenya African
National Union the oldest.
</P>
<P>
Oludhe's withdrawal came at the last minute of the campaign
which ended today in a basically peaceful atmosphere nationwide
despite reports on several clashes between youths loyal to
different candidates and leaving three dead, reports reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
Most rival parties today got their publicity machines to the
top gear to woo voters at last bid.
</P>
<P>
Moi held a final rally in his powerbase Rift Valley Province
today, saying he would list unemployment and corruption his major
priorities if re-elected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of supporters of Democratic Party's
presidential candidate Mwai Kibaki attended a rally in central
Nairobi to heed Kibaki's plea for social changes.
</P>
<P>
Most local opinion poll results have indicated that Moi would
head the poll with votes ranging from 40.2 percent to 49.2
percent, almost doubling his closest challenger Kibaki.
</P>
<P>
Electoral Commission Chairman Samuel Kivuitu said earlier that
his commission has completed all arrangements for the elections
and called on all voters to vote on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya will embrace the second multi-party general elections on
the day with a total of 9,031,141 registered voters expected to
cast their ballots to elect one president, 210 parliamentary
members and 2,955 local councillors.
</P>
<P>
Under Kenya's law, the winning presidential candidate must
garner the highest total and collect at least 25 percent of the
votes in at least five of Kenya's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
As many as 12,754 polling stations around the country are due
to open at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow and close at 6:00 p.m. (0300-1500
GMT).
</P>
<P>
There are 883 candidates from 23 parties running for the
parliamentary seats while 8,446 standing for civic elections.

<HEADLINE> Ankara's Reaction to EU Decision Confirms Athens' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said today that Turkey's tense reaction to the
European Union (EU) decision not to include her as a candidate
confirmed Greece's long-standing positions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before departure for a three-day visit to Bosnia and
Albania, Tsohatzopoulos said that the tension and thoughtless
comments with which Turkey reacts to the decision by the EU
regarding her accession confirmed Greece's long-standing position
that the Turkish military leadership had imposed clear conditions
for an aggressive policy towards particular countries.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an alleged decree signed by Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz which formally defined Greece and Syria as
posing the greatest external threats to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The issue had caused Greece's concern, he said, but stressed
that the Greek army was ready to deal with any challenge.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided earlier this month not to include Turkey on the
list of nations waiting to join the group, on the grounds of
Ankara's "poor human rights and bad relations with Greece."
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel reportedly warned Saturday
that Athens would pay for "blocking Ankara's bid to join the EU."
</P>
<P>
Tension between the two neighboring countries intensified
recently with the mutual expulsion of diplomats and violations of
Greek airspace by Turkish jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos warned Thursday that Greece's patience with
Turkish belligerence was running out.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cape Town, December 28 (Xinhua) -- South African National
Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala met visiting Chinese Vice-Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen here today, expressing welcome
to Qian's visit.
</P>
<P>
Ginwala and Qian agreed that the forthcoming establishment of
diplomatic relations between South Africa and China is a big
event that has been expected by the peoples of the two countries
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
It is also an achievement resulting from joint efforts by the
governments of the two countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed gratitude to Ginwala for her positive
contributions to the promotion of Sino-South African relations
and the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian relayed greetings from Qiao Shi, chairman of China's
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, who invited
Ginwala to visit China as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Qian arrived in Johannesburg early in the morning. South
African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo met him at the Cape Town
airport.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day official visit, Qian will also meet South
African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to have talks with Nzo and sign an official
joint communique over the normalization of bilateral relations on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela announced in November last year that his country would
sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and establish comprehensive
diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Qian is scheduled to attend on January 1 the opening ceremony
of the Chinese Embassy in Pretoria, the administrative capital of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Qian on the visit are his wife Zhou Hanqiong,
Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi
Guangsheng, and Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Ji Peiding.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM Back From Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's foreign minister Fayez
Tarawneh said upon his return home from a two-day visit to Saudi
Arabia this evening that Jordanian-Saudi ties were strong.
</P>
<P>
His trip, the second high level visit by a Jordanian official
to Saudi Arabia in six years, was a part of the continued
coordination between the two countries, said Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh met with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ben Abdul Aziz in
Riyadh during his stay and the two discussed the Middle East peace
process and the outcome of the summit meeting of the Organization
of Islamic Conference held in Tehran, Iran earlier this month,
official Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Tarawneh met with Saudi King Fahd and delivered
a verbal message from Hussein to him expressing the desire to
develop bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh`s visit to Saudi Arabia has been considered "very
important" here in further improving relations with the Gulf
economic giant. Jordan' Crown Prince Hassan paid an official
visit to Saudi Arabia in September this year, during which he met
the Saudi King.
</P>
<P>
Hassan's trip was the first high-level visit by a Jordanian
official to Saudi Arabia after the Gulf war in 1990. Relations
between the two countries were strained after the war as Jordan
refused to support the U.S.-led allied forces against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries cut off aid to Jordan and
expelled more than 300,000 Jordanian workers during and after
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Jordan and the Gulf nations improved in 1995
after Jordan distanced itself from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has become Jordan's second largest trade partner
after Iraq. In 1996, Jordan exported 130 million Jordanian dinars
(about 184 million U.S. dollars) worth of goods to Saudi Arabia
compared with 70 million dinars (about 99 million dollars) in
1995, according to official statistics.

ULAN BATOR, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party reviewed its achievements today in a new year
message to its members and the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
In the message from the party's Leadership Council, it said,
in the past year, the party successfully held its 22nd Congress,
conducted major reforms on fundamental policies and activities,
and established theoretical principles based on democratic
socialism for the nation.
</P>
<P>
It added that with reform in 1997 the party won great
victories in both the presidential election and the supplementary
election of The Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
These victories, it noted, demonstrated that the party enjoyed
support from its members and the people, and was the most
influential political force in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Party Chairman Nambaryn Enhbayar revealed in a press
conference that in 1997, about 7,000 people joined the party, of
them, 85 percent were under 35 years of age.
</P>
<P>
The party now has a membership of 86,000, the biggest
among all Mongolian political parties.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Defends Military Actions in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said today that its
military operations in northern Iraq were aimed at eliminating the
militants of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
"If there is a PKK existence in the region, the Turkish
government troops will not completely stop such operations there,"
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said at a weekly
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels took advantage of the authority vacuum in
northern Iraq to attack Turkey, posing a serious threat to
Turkey's security, Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
But he assured Turkey's respect for the territorial integrity
of Iraq in the operations.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has sought shelter in northern Iraq and use it to carry
out hit-and-run attacks on targets across the border after the
Iraqi government was rendered ineffective in exerting power in the
region by its defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has frequently launched cross-border military incursions
into northern Iraq since 1995.
</P>
<P>
This has prompted strong protests from Iran and Arab countries,
which urged Turkey to respect Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and withdraw troops immediately.
</P>
<P>
Ankara repeatedly said it did not envisage a permanent military
presence in northern Iraq, adding its troops will pull out as soon
as their objectives are achieved.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent 50,000 troops into Iraq last May in its largest
cross-border military operation this year to wipe out PKK camps
there. Some units remained in the region after the Turkish
government declared a troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting the Turkish government troops since
1984 in an attempt to set up an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Again Downplays Turkish-Israeli-U.S. Maneuvers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today again downplayed
the forthcoming Turkish-Israeli-U.S. joint naval exercises, saying
the exercises are "not directed at any third country" and are open
to military observers in the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan told a regular
news briefing that the drill code-named "Reliant Mermaid" is a
routine one aimed at improving search and rescue capabilities of
the three naval forces.
</P>
<P>
"As we said many times, the maneuvers are not directed at any
third country," Utkan said, adding that the countries in the
region should make themselves easy about the matter.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that any countries in the region are welcome to
observe the tripartite naval war games.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Israeli-U.S. joint exercises, which had been
postponed for several times, are to be held in the international
waters near the Israeli coast on January 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers, in the framework of the quickly-expanded
Turkish-Israeli military cooperation since last year, have
triggered sharp criticism from Iran and Arab countries, which
accused Turkey of forming military alliance with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has agreed to monitor the military exercises as an
observer, Utkan said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Order Effort to Sign Up Medicaid Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will soon order a major effort to sign up millions of children who
are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled in the program, The New
York Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted unidentified White House officials as
saying that Clinton was dismayed to find that most states had made
little progress in enrolling children from low-income families
last year.
</P>
<P>
Medicaid, the federal health insurance program paid by
federal-state matching funds, covers more than 30 million poor,
elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Clinton will order Federal and state agencies
late next month to step up their efforts by dispatching Medicaid
eligibility workers to hospital, clinics, day care center, schools
and factories.
</P>
<P>
Federal health officials said that at least three million
children were eligible for Medicaid bu not enrolled, nearly
one-third of the nation's 10 million uninsured children, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
More than 18 million children are now served by Medicaid in the
United States.

<HEADLINE> 1997: Epoch-making Events to Decide China's Future (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- For both the enormous grief
and joy it brought to the country, the year 1997 may well define
the history of China, especially the history of development since
its reforms and opening-up to the outside in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
If any doubt had been cast over China's prospects during the
post-Deng period, that doubt disappeared with a series of special
events that occurred in 1997. The year could foretell where China
will go.
</P>
<P>
With such major events on the schedule as the Hong Kong
handover, the convocation of the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), and the damming of both the
Yangtze and Yellow rivers, the year was expected to be different.
</P>
<P>
However, the death of Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China's
reforms and opening-up, added another special touch to the year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Deng had been retired several years
before his death, that the third generation of CPC collective
leadership had matured, and that the 18-year-long reforms and
opening-up had laid a solid foundation for further development of
the country, the outside world had voiced concerns about what
image would emerge in the post-Deng era. The country started
reform and opening-up under the guidance of Deng, and had entered
a critical stage. Skeptics were still pessimistic about China's
future after Deng.
</P>
<P>
It was this special background that would undoubtedly determine
the decisive importance of the subsequent series of events
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Although some predicted political upheavals based on some
superficial analyses, China's political situation has remained
stable. On the contrary, the ruling CPC successfully maintained a
stable political situation and accomplished the trans-century
leadership changes in an orderly fashion as the end of the century
approached.

<P>
Misgivings that the fate of the country solely rested upon
Deng are fading along with 1997. People are beginning to
understand why Deng had devoted so much attention to political
restructuring, especially in maintaining a smooth transition of power
and lasting political stability during his remaining years.
</P>
<P>
What is more important is that the Deng Xiaoping Theory, which
guides the reforms and opening-up of China, has been endowed with
more authority.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central
Committee, twice called on the party to hold high the great banner
of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
put forward by Deng Xiaoping, both in his memorial speech at
Deng's funeral in February and his speech in the Party School of
the CPC Central Committee in May. In September, Deng Xiaoping
Theory was formally written into the Party Constitution in the
15th CPC National Congress. Many believe this will have a
far-reaching impact on the country's future.
</P>
<P>
Through the year 1997, it has never been more likely that the
promise -- "never waver for a hundred years in adhering to the
Party's basic line" -- will endure. The country's basic policy of
making economic construction the central task, and taking the path
of reforms and opening-up, will not waver from any interference --
either from the left or the right -- nor from any change in the
composition of Chinese leadership.

It is reasonable to assume that Hong Kong will achieve
long-term prosperity and stability and China will finally achieve
the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's frequent and fruitful foreign relations
during the year have captured the attention of the world as well.
Headed by President Jiang Zemin's official visit to the United
States and a couple of Sino-Russian Summit Talks within the year,
China's diplomatic relations have entered a new era by forming
harmonious relationships with both neighboring countries and more
distant ones such as South Africa. There is no doubt that China
will play a more important role in regional and international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Marked by the successful accomplishment of its "soft-landing,"
China has bid farewell to a shortage of goods. By now, the
country has entered a new era which focuses on better economic
structure and the improvement of general economic strength.
</P>
<P>
With endeavors in the past four years, China has successfully
landed on the track of "high economic growth rate and low
inflation," thus achieving a stable economy in the initial stages
of economic take-off.

Despite these unprecedented achievements, Chinese leaders have
remained calm. The country has been lauded for its effective
macro-economic control efforts, which have allowed China to rise
above the ominous Southeast Asian financial crisis. It also has
improved its financial system and made strides to reduce redundant
constructions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country is bravely carrying out the reforms of
state-owned enterprises and the re-employment programs for a dozen
million laid-off workers. Such strenuousness is unrivaled
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
With its focus on economic development, China has expressed its
cordial wish for peace. In the 15th National Party Congress, Jiang
Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, declared
that 500,000 servicemen will be demobilized within three
years. The country also articulated its willingness to be a "good
neighbor, good partner, good friend" with member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Among all political slogans in China in 1997, Jiang's remark of
"the banner is the direction, the banner is the image" will
undoubtedly be the most popular.
</P>
<P>
While the press is crowning the year 1997 with such adjectives
as "extraordinary" and "epoch-making", the average Chinese has a
deeper understanding: Doesn't the image China presents with its
adherence to the Deng Xiaoping Theory rightly reveal the direction
the country will follow in the future?

<P>
BAGHDAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-general of the
Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) of Iraq Ahmed Mohammed Saeed
al-Atrooshy today condemned Turkey's new military incursion into
northern Iraq, demanding immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Iraqi News Agency (INA), al-Atrooshy said
Turkey's continued violation of Iraq's sovereignty under false
pretexts proves the hostility of Turkey, which run counter to
international law and norms as well as principles of good
neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said the objective of its cross-border operations
is to wipe out the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
militants who seek shelter in northern Iraq and launch attacks on
Turkish targets from there.
</P>
<P>
PKK has been fighting against the Turkish government since 1984
to establish an independent state in eastern and southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops launched the latest cross-border attack on PKK
militants two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Al-Atrooshy said that Turkey has taken advantage of the
abnormal situation in northern Iraq and has caused great harm to
inhabitants in the region.

<HEADLINE> China's First Blood Donation Law to be Implemented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China's first law on blood
donations, passed here today at the 29th session of the Standing
Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), China's
top legislative body, will be effective Oct. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The law, designed to guarantee the safe use of blood,
emphasizes that voluntarily donated blood can only be used in
clinical practice and must not be sold.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates: "The state advocates healthy citizens aged
between 18 and 55 to donate blood voluntarily, and encourages
personnel of organs of the state, soldiers on active service, and
students in colleges and universities to take the lead in doing
so."
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the safety of the blood donors and users, the law
sets rigid rules on the establishment, duties, and operation of
the blood donation centers which collect and provide plasma for
clinical use.
</P>
<P>
The law prohibits blood donation centers from excessive and
frequent drawing of blood from donors. And the voluntarily donated
blood cannot be sold to blood-products enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, anyone or any medical institution who
illegally collects blood, sells voluntarily donated blood, or
unlawfully organizes others to sell blood will be imposed a fine
of under 100,000 yuan (12,000 U.S. dollars), in addition to
confiscation of the illicit income. Those violating the law also
will face criminal responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Shan Ouqi, an official from the Department of Medical
Administration under the Ministry of Health, said that to meet the
demand of the clinical use of blood, the state encourages the
patients not in critical condition to store their own blood before
operations. The patients' relatives, friends, colleagues and the
whole society are encouraged to help patients.
</P>
<P>
Shan said the state will develop and popularize new
technologies for the clinical use of blood, and medical
institutions are prohibited from wasting blood.
</P>
<P>
Some of the details of the law have yet to be formulated, Shan
said.

BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A special administrative
regulation on the protection and management of computer
information networks connected to the Internet will be
promulgated and become operational starting this Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Entao, assistant minister of Public Security, made his

Since China began its opening-up drive in 1978, computer
information networks established by various regions, walks of life
and government departments have become an indispensable means and
tools in the management of state affairs, economic construction,
national defence construction and frontiers of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
The assistant minister pointed out that the connection of
China's computer networks to the Internet in 1994 has tremendously
promoted the country's cultural and scientific exchanges with the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"But the connection has also brought about some security
problems, including manufacturing and publicizing harmful
information, as well as leaking state secrets through the
Internet," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that as China accelerates the growth of the
information industry, wide applications of computer networks in
various spheres have made it a pillar of social development.
</P>
<P>
"Hence, the safe and effective management of computer
information networks is a prerequisite for the smooth

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Le Kha Phieu, 66, was
elected general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV)
at its 4th plenary session which was concluded here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Do Muoi, 81, former general secretary of the CPV, now acts as a
consultant of the CPV central committee.
</P>
<P>
Le Kha Phieu, born in Thanh Hoa Province in northern Vietnam on
December 27, 1931, joined in Vietnam's revolution when he was only
15 and withstood all trials and tribulations in the anti-French
and anti-American struggles.
</P>
<P>
He joined the CPV in 1949 and Vietnam People's Armed Forces
(VPAF) in May 1950. After 1978, he acted as the political
commissar of the 9th Military Zone until 1988 when he was promoted
to deputy director of the general political department of the VPAF.
</P>
<P>
At the 7th Congress of the CPV held in 1991, Le Kha Phieu was
elected a member of the central committee of the CPV and then
became director of the general political department of the the VPAF.
</P>
<P>
He was elected secretary of the secretariat of the CPV central
committee in 1992 and a member of the political bureau of the CPV
central committee in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
At the 8th Congress of the CPV held in 1996, Le Kha Phieu
became a standing member of the political bureau of the CPV
central committee and took charge of routine duties of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Le Kha Phieu noted in his articles, carried by Vietnamese
newspapers recently, that the CPV will adhere to the policies of
comprehensive reform.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the policies of reform are in keeping with not only
objective principles but also the aspirations of the Vietnamese
people."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is facing both opportunities and challenges now, he
said. The CPV is determined to build a peaceful, independent,
unified, democratic and prosperous Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"In a bid to continue pushing forward the cause of the reform
and speeding up the industrialization and modernization of the
country, we must further implement the policies and guidelines
made by the CPV and properly handle the problems emerging from new
circumstances," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to flexibly apply Marxism-Leninism
according to the objective reality in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Legislator Calls For Reducing Beijing's Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua)-- A member of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top
legislature, called for effective measures to reduce air pollution
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the legislature's plenary meeting today, Huang
Yicheng said that Beijing's air contains too many harmful
elements.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the amount of suspended particles, sulphur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide in Beijing's air far exceeded state limits and the
standards set by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing has become one of the 10 most-polluted cities in the
world monitored by the United Nations Environment Program," Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide air-monitoring project conducting the week of
Nov. 21-27 by the National Environmental Protection Agency shows
that Beijing has the nation's worst air pollution followed by
Guangzhou in south China and Chongqing in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the deteriorating air quality in Beijing is caused
mainly by auto emissions and coal use. Each year the city burns
nearly 30 million tons of coal without proper facilities for
desulphurization and dehydrogenation during combustion.
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing has promoted the use of lead-free gasoline, it
has not acted to reduce pollutants in auto exhaust.
</P>
<P>
To improve air quality, Beijing should use less coal and
develop other energy sources such as natural gas, electricity and
nuclear energy, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
"It should readjust its industrial structure and relocate some
heavy energy-consuming industries to other places," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, Beijing should give priority to developing public
transportation modes that use electricity and natural gas as
fuels. Automobiles without devices for purifying emissions should
be banned in the city, Huang added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Attacks Turkey for Military Ties with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran has strongly attacked
Turkey for its insistence on conducting military exercises with
Israel and the United States in the eastern Mediterranean next
month, Iranian newspaper Jomhuri Eslami reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi as saying Sunday that "Iran has repeatedly voiced its
deep concern and regret over the expansion of Israeli influence on
the soils of its neighbors."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that during the eighth Islamic summit held
in Tehran on December 9-11, Islamic leaders have warned of the
threats posed by the Israeli government in the region and asked
Turkey to reconsider its military ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We ask Turkey to pay serious attention to the interests of the
Islamic world," the spokesman said, adding that the main goal of
the Israeli government in such ties with Turkey was to divide it
from other Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi warned that boosting military cooperation and holding
join maneuvers with Israel would lead to instability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran can not remain indifferent toward such developments in
the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite military exercises among Israel, Turkey and the
United States are scheduled to be held in the eastern
Mediterranean on January 5-9 in accordance with a military
cooperation accord signed between Israel and Turkey in February,
1996.
</P>
<P>
Iran and most Arab countries have expressed great concern over
the military cooperation between Israel and Turkey and the eighth
Islamic summit adopted a resolution calling for reconsideration
of military cooperation between Islamic countries and Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey and Israel argued that their military
cooperation was not targeted at any other country.

<HEADLINE> HK Fares Well in Regional Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's financial
markets, operating with good management, have "fared well" in the
regional financial crisis, Anthony Neoh, chairman of the
Securities and Futures Commission, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Local markets set five records in the year, "the highest
turnover ever in the Stock Exchange and Futures Exchange, the
highest volatility since 1987, the highest diversity of products
ever to rank Asia's most diverse market, the highest number of
authorized funds and fund managers and the highest number of
registrants ever", said Neoh in a review of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the days of the market crashdown in October 1987,
the Stock Exchange traded 9 times the turnover and the Futures
Exchange traded 4 times the number of contracts.
</P>
<P>
There were 250,000 trades pending settlement in October 1987 in
the Stock Exchange which was one of the reasons for its closure
for four days while default in a massive scale in the Futures
Exchange prompting the introduction of the lifeboat loan.
</P>
<P>
But things improved a lot in October 1997. "The markets
continued to open and worked perfectly.... All settlements went
through and there was no backlog," Neoh noted.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the regulating body has been focusing on
directions such as maintenance of fair and orderly markets,
improvement of financial soundness and internal controls of firms,
maintenance and improvement of standards, and investor education,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Tanzania Promote Mutual Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Tanzania are
trying to promote mutual trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Harbors Authority (THA) is setting up a special cargo
handling center at Dar-es-Salaam Port for Kampala-bound goods
from earlier next year, The New Vision quoted a market report
released by the Uganda Export Promotion Board (UEPB) as reporting
today.
</P>
<P>
"All Uganda-bound transit cargo will be cleared within 24
hours from the time of arrival at Dar-es-Salaam Port ready for
loading and an onward journey to Kampala," said the UEPB report.
</P>
<P>
Ports Dar-es-Salaam of Tanzania and Mombasa of Kenya are the
main competitors for the transport market in Uganda and central
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Local trade communities here complained their goods via
Mombasa enjoyed no preferences comparing to the goods destined
for Rwanda, Burundi and Democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
The report is a part of a market study aimed at increasing
bilateral trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's exports to Tanzania are averaged 2.2 million U.S.
Dollars in 1993-1994 and 1995-1996 financial years while its
imports from Tanzania are averaged at 8 million U.S. Dollars
during the two years, official figures indicated.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to balance the trades by increasing the export
from Uganda to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production in Uganda is on rise in nearly all
sectors of manufacturing and not fully absorbed by local market,
and it is needed to find a market for the products, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, northern Tanzania with a population
of seven million people, some 25 percent of the whole population
of the country, is a great potential market for Ugandan products
like soap, plastics, mattresses, hoes, iron, steel items and
bicycles.
</P>
<P>
The main barriers for Ugandan products to enter Tanzanian
market are uncompetitive prices, the report said.

KUALA LUMPUR, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Singaporeans shopping in
Johor, Malaysia, are prohibited from buying more than 2 kilograms
of any controlled item like flour, cooking oil, sugar and milk,
effective Monday, according to the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Johor's proximity to Singapore and the depreciating ringgit
have made the items cheaper and conducive for Singaporean
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
The restriction is to ensure that local people would have
sufficient supply of the commodities in preparation of the double
festive season -- Muslims' new year and the Chinese New Year,
Johor State Environment and Consumer Affairs Committee Chairman
Chua Soi Lek was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation of the customs authorities, supermarket and shop
owners as well as Singaporeans themselves were being sought to
ensure compliance with the ruling, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The customs with the assistance of the state enforcement
officers will keep checks on Singaporeans leaving the state at the
Johor Causeway and the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that anyone flouting the ruling could be
charged under the Control of Supplies (Export Prohibitions)
Regulations 1996, which provides for a fine of maximum 15,000
ringgit (3,856 U.S. dollars) or two years jail, or both and the
goods confiscated.

<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
here today urged senior Chinese Communist Party officials to exert
more efforts in studying Deng Xiaoping Theory and the guidelines
of the Party's 15th National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, made the appeal at the closing ceremony

<P>
Nearly half the members of the CPC Central Committee elected
this year at the 15th CPC National Congress are new, and a large
group of new CPC Central Committee members will take up leading
posts next year, Jiang said, adding that new responsibilities
require that they must have broader minds and higher theoretical
levels.
</P>
<P>
In the course of in-depth reforms in China and new changes in
the world arena, Jiang noted, they must enhance their study of
Deng Xiaoping Theory to a new level.
</P>
<P>
To abide by Deng Xiaoping Theory and continue to enrich and
develop the theory should be a solemn historical responsibility of
all Party members as well as the leading group of the CPC Central
Committee, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
About 70 new members or alternate members of the CPC Central
Committee attended the seminar, which opened on December 4.

BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China expects to pump 143.2
million tons of onshore crude oil this year, or 1.8 million tons
more than last year's figure, showing the sharpest annual rise
since 1990.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Also adding to the country's need for foreign capital will be
the rise in foreign debt that is due next year.
</P>
<P>
Although most of it will be rolled over, some of it will
require new capital commitments from foreign creditors and
investors.
</P>
<P>
Economists are forecasting a current account deficit next year
of nine billion to 12 billion Rand (1.9 to 2.5 billion U.S.
dollars), from about 7 billion Rand (1.45 billion dollars) this
year.
</P>
<P>
The current account, which measures the non-capital flow of
transactions between countries, serves to monitor a country's
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Without compensating capital inflows, the deficit will eat
into the country's already threadbare foreign exchange reserves,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Despite ambitious plans of the South African government to
attract foreign investment, investors are wary about pumping
money into the country.
</P>
<P>
As for November this year, South Africa netted only 2.3
billion dollars of foreign capital, with a large portion confined
to buying existing assets.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank's latest Quarterly Bulletin,
foreign debt with maturity of less than one year amounted to nine
billion Rand in December, while other foreign debts falling due
next year totaled 2.9 billion Rand (600 million dollars). These
debts would have to be rolled over or new commitments would have
to be made to avoid dipping into the foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the balance of payments is set to
deteriorate even though economic growth will cool down.
</P>
<P>
Slow economic growth usually boosts the balance of payments
because, as domestic demand cools, companies usually turn to
export markets and the demand for imports abates.
</P>
<P>
However, the sharp drop in the gold price and the Asian
financial crisis are expected to put a damper on South African
exports, while trade liberalization should keep imports high.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Selects New Communist Party Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December ((28)) (Xinhua) -- Le Kha Phieu, 66, was
elected general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV)
at its 4th plenary session last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Do Muoi, 81, former general secretary of the CPV, now acts as a
consultant of the CPV central committee.
</P>
<P>
Le Kha Phieu, born in Thanh Hoa Province in northern Vietnam on
December 27, 1931, joined in Vietnam's revolution when he was only
15 and withstood all trials and tribulations in the anti-French
and anti-American struggles.
</P>
<P>
He joined the CPV in 1949 and Vietnam People's Armed Forces
(VPAF) in May 1950. After 1978, he acted as the political
commissar of the 9th Military Zone until 1988 when he was promoted
to deputy director of the general political department of the VPAF.
</P>
<P>
At the 7th Congress of the CPV held in 1991, Le Kha Phieu was
elected a member of the central committee of the CPV and then
became director of the general political department of the the VPAF.
</P>
<P>
He was elected secretary of the secretariat of the CPV central
committee in 1992 and a member of the political bureau of the CPV
central committee in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
At the 8th Congress of the CPV held in 1996, Le Kha Phieu
became a standing member of the political bureau of the CPV
central committee and took charge of routine duties of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Le Kha Phieu noted in his articles, carried by Vietnamese
newspapers recently, that the CPV will adhere to the policies of
comprehensive reform.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the policies of reform are in keeping with not only
objective principles but also the aspirations of the Vietnamese
people."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is facing both opportunities and challenges now, he
said. The CPV is determined to build a peaceful, independent,
unified, democratic and prosperous Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"In a bid to continue pushing forward the cause of the reform
and speeding up the industrialization and modernization of the
country, we must further implement the policies and guidelines
made by the CPV and properly handle the problems emerging from new
circumstances," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to flexibly apply Marxism-Leninism
according to the objective reality in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Low Inflation Raises Hopes for S. African Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The surprise fall in
South Africa's consumer inflation rate to 6.8 percent in November
has raised hopes for a more rapid improvement in the economy next
year, local economists said.
</P>
<P>
The average inflation rate for 1998 could fall to 5.5 percent,
driven by lower interest rates and slower demand in the economy,
"The Citizen" newspaper reported today after surveying seven
South African economists.
</P>
<P>
The average inflation rate this year was estimated at slightly
above 8 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The experts polled provided a range of forecasts for 1998's
inflation between 5.5 percent and 7.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economists said interest rates, which have a weighting of
14 percent in the consumer price index, are widely expected to be
reduced by two or even three percentage points in the first half
of next year.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank lowered its lending rate to commercial banks
by one percentage point, from 17 to 16 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
They expect two cuts in interest rates with prime at 17.25
percent by the end of the year, down from the current 19.25
percent, while long term rates could be reduced to 12.5 to 14.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The economists predicted a gross domestic product growth
between 1.5 and 2.7 percent for 1998, compared with the 1.7
percent growth expected for this year.
</P>
<P>
Exports growth was predicted to be between two percent and 4.5
percent with imports rising at a slow rate of between 1.5 percent
and 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economist disagree on the country's future current account
deficit with forecasts varying widely from five billion Rand
(1.03 billion U.S. Dollars) to 11.6 billion Rand (2.39 billion
Dollars), but it is believed that the deficit is set to widen
next year.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit this year stood at about seven
billion Rand (1.45 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to predictions, the South African currency would
further depreciate. Predictions on the exchange rate against the
U.S. Dollar range from 4.97 to 5.3 Rand, up from the current 4.85
Rand.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption expenditure could grow by 1.4 to 2.5
percent in real terms next year, while government consumption
expenditure vary from zero to 3.3 percent real growth, the
economists said.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic fixed investment could grow by 2 to 4.5
percent, with a likely poor start and pick-up later next year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Cast Ballots in Peace, No Violence Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Xu Jianmei, Wang Jinyu)
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 10 million registered
Kenyan voters this morning queued up orderly and peacefully for
casting their ballots to choose the fittest person who will lead
the eastern African country into the next century.
</P>
<P>
"No reports on violence have arrived so far. The voting is
being carried out very peacefully," Electoral Commission Public
Relations Officer Mahamed Koor told Xinhua at noon.
</P>
<P>
He said some people who attempted to take the opportunities
for stealing here and there have been detained in various parts
of the country, claiming no arrests today can be related to the
polling.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed local reports said radical Islamic preacher Sheikh
Khalid Balala and a senior member of the National Development
Party were arrested by the police.
</P>
<P>
Queues of up to 400 voters can be seen in many polling
stations in capital Nairobi where all main downtown streets are
almost left empty and silent.
</P>
<P>
All polling stations in the country were scheduled to open at 6:00
a.m. and continue for 12 hours. However, complaints came
following many of them were delayed to open, leaving voters
waiting for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The polling station located in Highridge Primary School,
Westlands, Nairobi, saw the first vote cast there at 10:45 a.m.
although many voters came there four to five hours before.
</P>
<P>
Social Democratic Party's presidential hopeful Charity Ngilu,
cast her ballots around 8:00 o'clock after waiting in the dark
for over 90 minutes, also complainted the postpone,
the Kenya Television Network (KTN) reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Electoral Commission is ill-prepared," she said. Ngilu is
one of the first two women in Kenya to vie for the top seat and
takes the third place in most opinion polls before the elections.
</P>
<P>
But Koor said that the delay is normal, citing the
preparation of ballot papers and transport of 27,000 monitors to
a total of 12,754 polling stations as main reasons.
</P>
<P>
"All the polling stations will close in the evening at the
exact time when they opened in the morning," said Koor, adding
that many Kenyans have predicted the delay and would turn out and
vote in the evening.
</P>
<P>
It is Kenya's second multi-party general elections since
its independence in 1963, with a total of 9,031,141 registered
voters expected to cast their ballots to elect one president, 210
parliamentary members and 2,955 local councillors.
</P>
<P>
Under Kenya's law, the winning presidential candidate must
garner the highest total and collect at least 25 percent of the
votes in at least five of Kenya's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls before today's election showed that President
Daniel arap Moi, 73 and in power for 19 years, would head the
poll with votes ranging from 40.2 percent to 49.2 percent, almost
doubling his closest challenger Mwai Kibaki, the Democratic Party
Chairman.
</P>
<P>
But most people interviewed by Xinhua in Nairobi today,
including dozens of rich Asian-origin people, said they want a
change in the leadership, citing corruption, economic slump, weak
state of infrastructure, administration with low efficiency as key
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Presidential candidate Setphen Omondi Oludhe, the leader of
the tiny Economic Independence Party, announced his withdrawal on
Sunday at the last minute, reducing runners in the country's most
crowded presidential race to 14. He said he will support Moi.
</P>
<P>
There are 883 candidates from 23 parties running for the
parliamentary seats while 8,446 standing for civic elections.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Truth Body Denies Report of Intl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has denied a newspaper report
that some South Africans would be brought to an international
court for their part in apartheid, The Citizen newspaper said
today.
</P>
<P>
The TRC had no part in any plan to establish an international
criminal court where people could be tried for crimes against
humanity, war crimes and genocide, TRC spokesperson Christelle
Terreblanche said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She said the TRC's mandate is only to compile a report with
recommendations to the South African parliament and the truth
body is not part of any proposed international legal process.
</P>
<P>
A Sunday Afrikaans newspaper, Rapport, said that there is a
growing suspicion that some South Africans will be charged in an
international court because they had protected or promoted the
apartheid policy.
</P>
<P>
The paper said a committee of the United Nations in New York
had already formulated laws for the criminal court's jurisdiction
and that the court could be established as early as the middle of
1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Rapport, General Constand Viljoen, former Head of
the Defense Force, and other defense officials who planned or
executed cross-border operations had for some time been aware of
the possibility that they could be called to account by
"international tribunals."
</P>
<P>
"They will probably start with cross-border operations, for
which you cannot ask the TRC for amnesty, because it did not
happen on South African territory," Rapport quoted Viljoen as
saying in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He said the TRC exercise is aimed at obtaining as much
information as possible for hearing before an international
criminal court, or perhaps an African tribunal, when the TRC's
term expires.
</P>
<P>
Rapport said judge of South African Constitutional Court,
Richard Goldstone, and Graca Machel, President Nelson Mandela's
companion, are among those who are promoting the idea of an
international criminal court.
</P>
<P>
Other well-known sponsors of the court include former UN
secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali and former U.S. president
Jimmy Carter and others.

XI'AN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A new water-supply project has
been able to supply drinking water to 200,000 urban dwellers in
Yan'an, known as the cradle of the Chinese revolution in the 1930s
and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The project diverted water from Wangyao Reservoir 52 kilometers
north to Yan'an, a city in northwest China's Shaanxi Province. It
can supply 50,000 tons of drinking water daily to meet the demand
not only of urban residents but also 16,600 rural residents and
their livestock.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an has been well-known in China because it served as the
headquarters of the CPC-led (Communist Party of China) struggles
against the Kuomintang regime and invading Japanese troops in the
1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
However, it had to battle serious shortages of water in recent
years due to arid weather and growing demands for water in the
wake of rapid economic development.

<HEADLINE> China's First Law on Prices (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China's first law on prices
was passed after examinations and revisions at the 29th meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress
(NPC) which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The law's purpose is to standardize pricing, to give full play
to the role of prices in rationally distributing resources,
stablize market prices and protect the legitimate interests and
rights of consumers and dealers. The law also is meant to promote
the healthy development of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The law, to become effective on May 1, is suitable for all
pricing in the country including commodities and services.
</P>
<P>
Legislators and legal experts who have attended the
examinations and revisions of the price law all agreed that
pricing has an important bearing on economic development, the
people's standard of living and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The law has great significance in terms of creating a sound
market environment for rational pricing and equal competition, and
protection of consumers' and businessmen's interests and rights,
legislators said.
</P>
<P>
The Price Law embodies China's successful experiences in
reforms and the opening-up drive in the last two decades, and
reflects the demands of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that the state will put into effect and
gradually perfect a mechanism which will allow the market to
regulate prices under macro-economic control. Pricing must conform
to the law of value, and the prices of most commodities and
services will be regulated by the market. However, the prices for
a few kinds of commodities and services will be guided or set by
the government, the law states.

According to the law, dealers have the right to set prices
within the scope regulated by the market or guided by the
state. They also have the right to report and charge activities
infringing their rights to set prices according to law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the law also requires traders to sell and
purchase commodities or provide services with marked prices, and
forbids them to charge fees without marked prices.
</P>

The law states that activities which involve dumping goods with
prices lower than costs, driving up prices, cheating,
discrimination and raising or pushing down prices deliberately all

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Black Opposition to Make Peace with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's largest
black opposition, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), has vowed to
accelerate its efforts to make peace with ruling African National
Congress (ANC), according to a local press report today.
</P>
<P>
The "Business Day" newspaper quoted IFP National Chairman and
Kwazulu-Natal Premier Ben Ngubane as saying at a rally in
northern Kwazulu-Natal on Sunday that the peace process would be
expedited in the new year with the aim of bringing security to
all the citizens of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu-Natal, where the IFP is based, is the only province in
the hands of the party.
</P>
<P>
Ngubane said a true democracy is characterized by "harmonious
cooperation" between people of different political persuasions.
</P>
<P>
"We are steadily marching towards that goal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hinting that the quest for peace would not end the contest for
power between the ANC and IFP, he said the IFP's membership had
the "awesome responsibility" of ensuring the party's victory in
the 1999 elections in Kwazulu-Natal with an increased majority.
</P>
<P>
The IFP won 50.3 percent of the vote in the 1994 provincial
elections. A drop in support would force it to enter into a
coalition provincial government with one of the opposition
parties, most likely the ANC, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Ngubane said the IFP also needed to improve its performance in
other provinces. This, observers said, was the key to the ANC's
offering IFP leader and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu
Buthelezi a position befitting his stature in a post-1999
government at national level.
</P>
<P>
Ngubane said the IFP needed to increase its membership,
revitalize its branches and identify issues around which the
party could mobilize support in a peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi also said at a rally earlier in the month that his
party wanted to be at peace with the ANC.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer afford divisions and we must realize that in
the end, if our country is to succeed, we must stand together,
failing which we are doomed to fall together," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two parties were involved in a bitter struggle for
political power in the 1980s and early 1990s and violent clashes
between them left more than 20,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
Before and during ANC's 50th national conference held in
Mafikeng, North-West Province, between December 16 and 20, ANC
President Nelson Mandela reached out an olive branch to the IFP.
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview on the eve of the conference, Mandela said
the two black-based parties should merge.
</P>
<P>
However, the IFP said it has not been officially approached by
the ANC on this matter and hinted that a merger is not likely in
the near future.

<HEADLINE> China Achieving Progress in Market Economy Drive (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) --China has made marked progress
in its drive of building socialist market economy, with the new
system taking a dominant position in China's economic life.
</P>
<P>
So far, 90 percent of the country's gross domestic product
(GDP) have been achieved through market circulation, Lu Yonghua,
director of the Research Office of the State Commission for
Economic Restructuring, made the remarks in an interview with
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
According to official, over 85 percent of capital goods, more
than 90 percent of industrial finished products and over 95
percent of means of subsistence now depend on market for price
adjustments, and capital goods and means of subsistence under
state mandatory plan have dropped from 1,000 kinds or so five
years ago to the present 30 kinds.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the progress is also felt in an all-round development
of market mechanism, establishment of a macro control system,
formation of an economic pattern featuring simultaneous growth of
diversified economic factors with public ownership as the
dominant force, and formation of a all-round opening-up pattern,
in addition to greater role of the market in adjusting
distribution of resources and economic life.
</P>
<P>
The drive of establishing a socialist market economy was
decided in 1992 at the 14th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Under the goal, China hopes to build up the framework of
socialist market economy by the turn of this century and develop
such system early next century.

Through adjusting ownership structure and developing
economy of non-public ownership and of mixed ownerships, China's
state-owned economic force now contributes 28.8 percent of the
country's industrial output value, and collective economic force
contributes 44.4 percent, while economic force of non-public
ownership contributes 30.8 percent instead of 13.4 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, circulation of three quarters or so of the commodities
are now undertaken by economic force of non-public ownership.
</P>
<P>
Markets of capital, technologies, property rights, futures and
labor have been developing rapidly in China. In 1997 alone, more
than 800 listed companies pooled 150 billion yuan of funds through
stock markets.
</P>
<P>
China has also planned to set up specialized markets of
entrepreneurs and managers beginning from next year, with the
purpose of offering more professional management personnel of
higher level for state-owned enterprises to carry out reforms.
</P>
<P>
Out of the present 2,000 billion yuan of total social
investment annually in the country, state investment only accounts
for five percent or so, various production and business
institutions have become leading forces of investment.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Internal Trade said retail
prices of state-controlled social commodities have fallen from 20
percent to 7.2 percent thanks to the formation of the
market pricing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the country's 300,000 state-owned
enterprises have learned to arrange production according the
market demands, and only 10,000 of the state-owned enterprises are
designated to fulfill state-set plans.
</P>
<P>
One-third plus of China's 14,000 state-owned large and
medium-sized enterprises have established standardized corporate
systems. And 50 to 70 percent of the state-owned small
enterprises have completed system transformation or organizational
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Well-known Chinese economist Ma Hong say that China has formed
a buyers' market and its relationship with the international
market has becoming closer and closer, and the degree of China's
economic development depending on overseas market will be up from
10 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"With the accelerated establishment of China's market economy
and globalization of the world economy, China can keep improving
its economic structure and efficiency only by developing an
economy on market demands," said the economist.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province Builds Resource Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Resource-rich Qinghai Province
in northwest China has built seven major industrial centers over
the past five years in a bid to expand the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The centers involve such industries as animal by-products,
potash fertilizer, petroleum, electricity, ferro-silicon,
salt-based chemicals and traditional Chinese medicinal herbs,
according to today's "People's Daily."
</P>
<P>
Qinghai is one of China's major areas of animal husbandry.
Residents there used to depend on its vast grasslands
which cover 96 percent of the province's land mass of more than
720,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
However, harsh natural conditions and unprofitable livestock
farming had failed to provide enough money to meet local
residents' basic needs.
</P>
<P>
The province started building industrial centers in the
1990s. This year Qinghai registered an all-time high industrial
output of 10 billion yuan (1.25 billion U.S. dollars), which
nearly doubled that of agriculture and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that Qinghai, whose topography is typical of
plateau and high mountains, has succeeded in optimizing its
economic structure and relying on resources-oriented industries.
</P>
<P>
During the past several years Qinghai has established a dozen
animal by-product processing firms and annual turnover from yak
wool alone now stands at 380 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
To beef up the "lifeline" industries, Qinghai has been active
in introducing shareholding and asset-restructuring mechanisms
into related enterprises. So far, the province's seven listed
companies have raised 1.5 billion yuan (18.8 million
U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Qinghai has 139 foreign-funded companies,
2,349 private enterprises and 15 enterprise groups.

<HEADLINE> World's Leading Wireless Telecom Technology Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A new wireless
telecommunications technology two or three years ahead of
international standard passed state appraisal here today.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from China's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, the SCDMA (synchronous code division multiplex
access) wireless local loop system is the first leading wireless
access technology developed by Chinese scientists and
engineers. China owns the sole intellectual property rights for
the technology.
</P>
<P>
New technologies adopted by the system such as SCDMA, smart
antenna and software radio have received patents at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The system proved to have excellent and stable transmission
quality during operation in the seven trial networks in large
Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the SCDMA system is best for rural areas,
small- and medium-size cities, and suburbs that have difficulty in
plugging in telecommunications lines.
</P>
<P>
Overseas forecasts say that 100,000 subscribers will be
connected to wireless local loop systems by the end of the
century, and more than 60 percent of them will be in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
China is projected to account for 20 percent of the world's
wireless local loop subscription.
</P>
<P>
The new system will be put into mass production next June.

<HEADLINE> Bank Projects Slower Growth for Hong Kong Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy will
grow more slowly in 1998, with the city experiencing cost
adjustment to restore its competitiveness, the Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation (HongkongBank) predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
External trade is expected to expand only moderately, being
adversely affected by the recent Asian financial turmoil, while
domestic demand will be dampened by falling assets prices and
higher interests rates, the bank's economic advisor George Leung
said.
</P>
<P>
Overall, real Gross Domestic Demand will rise by 4.0 percent in
1998, compared with the bank's 5.4 percent projection for 1997,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank's December issue of Economic Report described Hong
Kong's economic prospects for 1998 as "a year of adjustment" under
the linked exchange rate system.
</P>
<P>
The bank observed that the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
has for the most part "fared well" in the midst of the Asian
financial upheaval. "Despite criticism over the linked exchange
rate system, Hong Kong would have suffered an even more drastic
slowdown as a result of destabilizing speculation if the system
was not in play," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Due to the anticipated slowdown in domestic demand, inflation
will edge lower to 5.3 percent in 1998, from the forecast 5.9
percent for 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the continued fall in inflation, partly the result of
an adjustment in asset prices, will be "instrumental" in reviving
Hong Kong's competitive edge, the bank said, as the previous
increase in domestic factor costs has already cut into Hong Kong's
overall competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown brought forth by the Asian currency disturbances
is "actually expediting the process of restoring the SAR's
competitive position", the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao Airport Reports Sustained Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Macao International Airport
has seen a sustained business growth both in passenger flow and
the amount of cargo shipment over the past two years following its
commercial operation.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the airport management company show that
between January and November this year, the airport transported
1.80 million passengers, up 76 percent from the same period in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Cargo shipment in the period reached 40,000 tons, up 142
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
So far, the airport has opened 16 air routes to destinations
mostly in China's inland and Southeast Asia. It has transported a
total of over three million passengers and 60,000 tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that growth rate was not surprising for a new
airport. The increase of passengers was mainly the result of the
quasi-direct flight across the Taiwan Straits. More and more
Taiwanese travelers to the mainland opt for the route as it is
more convenient and efficient than other choices.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Taiwanese passengers who account for 56 percent of
all, other passengers are from China's inland and the southeast
Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Joao Moreira, chairman of the board of directors of the Macao
Airport Company, said he was satisfied with what the airport had
achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
He is optimistic about the future business growth of the
airport, predicting a passenger growth of about 10 percent in 1998
and a cargo shipment growth of more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said if proper efforts are made, the passenger flow of the
airport will not be affected much by the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia, the possible direct air traffic across the Taiwan
Straits in the near future and the upcoming opening of Hong Kong's
new airport.
</P>
<P>
While the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia will cut the
number of travelers to Macao, Moreira said that his airport plans
to make more efforts of promotion in North America, Japan and
Australia, hoping to attract more passengers from those regions.
</P>
<P>
"If direct air traffic across the Taiwan Straits is not
realized until the year 2000, it will have little influence to
Macao airport," he said. "By the time of the direct air traffic,
we would have cultivated other markets and reduced the proportion
of Taiwanese passengers."
</P>
<P>
The most important thing is, he said, "we have to open more
market sources in the period."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said Macao Airport is capable of meeting the
challenge of Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok Airport after it begins
operation next April.
</P>
<P>
The cost of using Hong Kong new airport will be higher than
that of using Macao airport, he said, adding that the new airport
is way too far from the downtown area while it is just one hour
from Macao airport to central Hong Kong.

SINGAPORE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined
sharply in thin trading on the Singapore market as the benchmark
Straits Times Industrials Index fell by 34.58 points to close at
1517.94 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that blue chips suffered selling pressure on fears
of higher interest rates, as local major banks, the Overseas
Chinese Banking Corporation and the United Overseas Bank,
announced that they were raising their prime lending rates by half
a percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Concerns over an economic slowdown in 1998 as brokerage houses
downgraded their forecasts for Singapore's Gross Domestic Product
also fueled selling, they said.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume was thin at merely 76.52 million units,
valued at 112.79 million Singapore dollars (67.54 million US
dollars). Declines outnumbered advances by 193 to 97, while 317
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
MBf Capital was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 3.78 million units. It was followed by
Inno-Pacific which had 3.32 million shares traded. GPE was next
with 2.67 million units changed hands.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Three foreign oil companies
operating in Nigeria are expected to begin work on their gas gathering
plants next year to ensure supply of feedgas for Nigeria's 3.8 billion
U.S. Dollars liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.
</P>
<P>
The companies, namely Shell, Elf and Agip, will provide the LNG
plant now under construction in Bonny, south Nigeria's Rivers State,
with about 850 million standard cubic feet per day of gas as
feedstock, the Daily Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three firms, which are present in Nigeria as partners of oil
joint ventures with the Nigerian government are also equity holders in
the LNG project, with Shell having 25.6 percent, Elf 15 percent and
Agip 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government controls 49 percent equity interest in the
project through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
As the government is expected to release its 1998 budget before the
end of this year, the companies have alerted for adverse effect of
budget cut, saying that low funding may stall the feedgas project.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria boasts abundant natural gas resources, estimated at 15-30
billion cubic meters. However most of the gas flow has long been
flaring.
</P>
<P>
To make use of the gas resources, Nigeria has decided to build
several gas projects. One of it went into operation in May this year
and its LNG has been exported to the United States.

<P>
SEOUL, December 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's National Assembly
this afternoon passed 19 bills on financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
This was achieved after a long dispute over a planned financial
supervisory agency governing banks, securities houses and
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers finally reached an agreement to place the giant
financial supervisory agency under the control of the Prime
Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to allow the tax authorities to gain access to
individual financial transaction data only when they need to
investigate a suspected tax evader.
</P>
<P>
They allowed the government to circulate unregistered
long-term bonds worth five trillion won (about 3.5 billion
U. S. dollars) for a limited period to help cash-starved
businesses procure funds more easily.
</P>
<P>
In response to the IMF-dictated bail-out terms on financial
sector restructuring, the reform package will allow less strict
restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of insolvent financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been in serious financial crisis caused by the
failure of a group of conglomerates and bad loans of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The nation has signed an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund for a bail-out loan valued at 57 billion

<HEADLINE> Floods Cut Off Roads to Tanzanian Wildlife Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Rain damages to the
roads leading to Tanzania's northern wildlife parks, Makuyuni and
Manyara, have brought traffic to a halt and could cost the
tourism industry 34 million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The "East African" newspaper today quoted Executive Secretary
of the Tanzania Association of Tour Operators, Mustapha Akunaay,
as saying that most tourist vehicles are two-wheel driving and
immobilized by the rough roads.
</P>
<P>
"We are really worried that if the rains continue and the
government fails to repair the road, no tourists will go to the
parks again for a long time," Akunaay said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian Meteorological Department has said the
above-average seasonal rains affected by the El Nino weather
phenomenon could continue until next April. The peak sightseeing
season is during December and March.
</P>
<P>
Most of visitors came to Tanzania to view animals in the
wilderness. The famed parks of Lake Manyara, Ngorongoro Crater
and Serengeti attract most of the tourists. Any stoppage will
cause unemployment for hundreds of drivers and travel guides as
well as a loss of business to curio sellers at Mto wa Mbu and at
Lake Manyara junction to Ngorongoro, most of them Massai
tribesmen.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania expects to receive more 359,000 tourists by the end
of 1997, of whom 90 percent will pass through the Makuyuni gravel
link road.
</P>
<P>
The country is expected to earn from tourism a record high of
388.8 million US Dollars in foreign currency this year. But the
tourism industry operators say Tanzania may start to suffer big
losses before the end of next January.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Takims Holidays and Safaris Ltd, Mohammed
Nathani, said tour companies are facing serious problems to get
tourists to the wildlife parks. He said rains have worsened the
road conditions but the government seemed to neglect the damaged
roads.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Finance Minister Denies Squeeze on Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim Monday dispelled notions that the
government is maintaining a credit squeeze, saying it was only
slowing irrational credit growth which had soared surpassing even
the national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Loans grew at 30 percent last year, an unrealistic rate as
against the national economic growth rate of eight percent, Anwar,
who is also Finance Minister, said in the northern state of Pulau
Pinang, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
As such, the government would scale down credit growth to 25
percent by year end, 20 percent during the first quarter of the
new year and subsequently to 15 percent by the end of 1998, he
said while addressing members of the Pulau Pinang joint chambers
of commerce.
</P>
<P>
As of last November, he said, domestic loans grew by 84.9
billion ringgit (21.88 billion U.S. dollars), or nearly 26
percent, to 417.7 billion ringgit (107.65 billion U.S. dollars)
from 332.8 billion ringgit (85.77 billion U.S. dollars) in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said a 15 percent credit growth was more realistic as
against the projected four percent national economic growth for
next year.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was confident that Malaysia could get out of the present
economic predicament in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government is encouraging loans to productive
sectors and has allowed banks to give priority credit according to
recent official guidelines.
</P>
<P>
"The government is encouraging loans for export and high-tech
sectors and selected services to back economic activities," Anwar
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added "Loans are only discouraged for two sectors, the
property sector and the unproductive one such as for consumer
spending...but loans for low and medium-cost homes up to 150,000
ringgit are not affected."
</P>
<P>
The report said that on margin calls, the finance minister
said, banks should be allowed flexibility in managing loans
issued.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Unemployment Rate to Move Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian Employment
Minister David Kemp said Monday that anecdotal evidence suggested
the Australian economy was on track for budgeted jobs growth, but
the unemployment rate would not move as quickly because of the
many hidden unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Kemp was commenting on a study which found a bright outlook for
an acceleration in jobs, particularly in the retail, tourism and
building sectors.
</P>
<P>
"All this confirms the fact that Australia is entering a period
of sustained jobs growth that was indicated by the Australian
Bureau of Statistics figures," Kemp told reporters.
</P>
<P>
While the latest anecdotal evidence supported the budget
forecast of 8.0 percent unemployment by the middle of next year,
it was not enough to warrant a downward revision of the
unemployment rate, Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very confident that by the middle of next year we will
reach the budget forecast of eight percent unemployment. Jobs
growth also ought to make the budget forecast of 2.5 percent," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kemp warned that an acceleration in jobs growth was
unlikely to be mirrored by a fall in the unemployment rate, as the
rate did not represent the hidden unemployed who could move into
the labor force as fortunes improved.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment as a rate will fall more slowly than the jobs
growth, because there is a large pool of hidden unemployed out
there," he said.

<HEADLINE> Few S.African Policeman Disciplined for Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The South African Police
Service (SAPS) has disciplined only 27 policemen implicated in escapes
from police or court cells although the majority of escapes took place
in its jurisdiction, The Star newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than 900 prisoners have escaped from police custody this year,
most of them from charge offices and during normal working hours, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Correctional Services Department, which suspends an
employee suspected of involvement in an escape, the SAPS waits until a
formal charge has been laid against a staffer.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 118 police stations in Gauteng Province conducted
by The Star revealed that few policemen are disciplined as a
result of escapes.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, out of a total of 906 escapes from Gauteng
police stations this year, departmental action was taken against only
28 police members, of whom 27 were suspended.
</P>
<P>
More awaiting-trial prisoners escaped from police station charge
offices than from court and holding cells. And a large proportion of
escapes, as high as 50 percent in certain stations, occurred during
normal office hours between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
As part of the concerted clampdown on prison escapes, the Justice
Department is considering the possibility of hearing separate cases
against already convicted felons in prison. It is also considering
hearing bail applications inside prison for prisoners already in
custody.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said there was a contrast between the Correctional
Services Department and the SAPS in the approach to the question.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of measures in August by the Correctional Services
allowing for the suspension of an official immediately after an
escape, and pending the outcome of an investigation, resulted in a
drastic decline in escapes from prisons in the last quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 officials have been suspended since the directive was
issued and escapes from prisons have declined from about 110 a month
prior to August to 86 a month in the three months after August.
</P>
<P>
However, police spokesmen are cagey about the introduction of
similar measures in the SAPS. The sheer number of police stations and
the impact the suspensions would have on the already depleted manpower
of the SAPS would be "too severe to contemplate."
</P>
<P>
The nation was shocked when six of the country's most dangerous men
escaped from a Pretoria prison at the beginning of the month.

the local currency traded in a tight range of 65.62 US cents to

illiquid market," Whitley said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to wait until January 5 for the market to return
back to normal."
</P>

The Australian dollar finished unchanged at 85.56 yen, and at

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian economic crisis
meant Australia would have to work at 100 miles an hour on the
trade front just to avoid going backwards in 1998, Deputy Prime
Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Australia secured significant liberalization's in world trade
in 1997, as evidenced by our 104.46 billion Australian dollars (70
billion U.S. dollars) merchandise trade surplus in 1996-97,"
Fischer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"But we cannot afford to relax, it would be a mistake to become
complacent in light of some major challenges facing world trading
economies in 1998," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the Asian financial crisis, and in particular the
collapse of the Korean economy, meant Australia would be
struggling just to prevent exports from falling.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said: "In the case of Korea it is our second largest
export market and our major exports are beef, wool, ores, coal and
gold."
</P>
<P>
"The federal coalition government is responding to the
situation with a multi-faceted approach, including onward
diversification of our trade efforts, not only to Asia but beyond
Asia to the rest of the world including South Africa and South
America," the deputy prime minister said.

448.7 last year," the office said in a report released here.
</P>
<P>
It said that on a month-on-month comparison, the VPI increased
by 0.4 from 483.0 in September.
</P>
<P>
These figures were based on the results of the Survey of Key
Enterprises in Manufacturing, a regular monthly survey by the
office aimed to provide flash indictors on the performance of key
manufacturing enterprises in the country.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the year-on-year increases were observed
in 11 out of the 16 major sectors.
</P>
<P>
Electrical machinery, with an 82.2 percent growth, contributed
the biggest share of 69.6 percent to the year-on-year growth of
VPI due to the gains in production of micro-circuits, the office
said.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by chemicals, a 14.2 percent increase, and
petroleum products, a 6.6 percent increase, with a 10.3 percent
contribution each to the year-on-year growth, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The volume of production index (VOPI) for key manufacturing
enterprises was estimated at 158.8 in October 1997, registering a
year-on-year growth of 4.3 percent," the office said.
</P>
<P>
The office said that electrical machinery, with the biggest
increase of 86.9 percent, contributed a share of 91 percent to the
year-on-year growth, while beverage and non-metallic mineral
products followed with increases of 25.7 percent and 4.4 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, petroleum refineries decreased by 11.2 percent,
wearing apparel by 34.5 percent, paper and paper products by 40.6
percent and transport equipment by 26.7 percent in the month, it
said.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, the VOPI increased by 0.2 percent from
158.6 in September, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The October performance of the sector indicates that the
negative effects of the financial crisis in the country had not
been felt heavily by the manufacturing enterprises yet in the
month.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Marks Anniversary of Victory Over U.S. Blitz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam marked the 25th
anniversary of the country's victory over the U.S. B-52 blitz on
Vietnamese capital of Hanoi in December 1972, an editorial of
national daily Nhan Dan reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to force Vietnam to sign a U.S.-dictated treaty
on the on-going war in the country, the U.S. forces started the
12-day-long attack on December 18, 1972.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that the U.S. scheme failed with 30 raiders
including 23 B-52s and F-111s brought down over Hanoi by the
Vietnamese armed forces during the 12-day attack.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Vietnam forced the United States to
eventually sign an agreement in Paris, which recognized Vietnam's
independence and sovereignty and ended the U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam war, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that the people's ardent patriotism, the
spirit of national independence, sovereignty, wisdom and
creativeness, which had led to Vietnam's victory, should be fully
utilized in the fight against poverty and backwardness, and in the
cause for national industrialization and modernization.

<HEADLINE> Small Thermal Power Plants in China to Be Closed Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The State Power Corporation
will close down small thermal power plants with a total installed
capacity of 10.86 million kilowatts in the next three years,
according to an ongoing national power conference here.
</P>
<P>
The "People's Daily" quoted a leading official of the Power
Ministry as saying that the move is aimed at optimizing the power
structure.
</P>
<P>
"The progress of closing down small thermal power plants will
be connected with the approval of construction of large power
plants in the locality," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the provinces of Guangdong, Henan, Jiangsu and
Zhejiang, which are blamed for slack management of the small
thermal power plants, to take a lead in the drive next year.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the building of power grids should be a
priority for the development of the power industry.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Province in east China recently took the first move to
shut down a smoothly-operating small thermal power plant for the
sake of environmental protection. The province has 193 such small
thermal power plants which consume large amounts of energy and
pollute the environment seriously.
</P>
<P>
China's per-capita power consumption amounts to only one third
of the world's average. Currently, the country has 11 counties
without power supply and 60 million people have no access to
power.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Trim Civil Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- No fewer than 10,000 civil servants
at the federal level may lose their jobs next year due to a massive
retrenchment exercise planned by the nigerian government for early
next month.
</P>
<P>
A government white paper on the exercise, billed to commence
anytime from the second week of January, will soon be out, the
Nigerian Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchment exercise is in compliance with the Head of
State's recent directive that the federal civil service be trimmed or
else he would not approve the new recommended salary structure.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, committees have been set up in federal
government ministries to compile names of those who may fall into the
categories of people whose service are no longer required.
</P>
<P>
Some of the criteria for determining such categories of people
include those who are in the habit of coming late to work, those who
have been confirmed medically unfit, and people whose productivity are
considered to be on the decline.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that those to be trimmed mainly include
cleaners, drivers and messengers, as the government also wants to
reduce its huge wage bill.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the federal civil service has been carrying
out mass lay-off of workers.

<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a Cobalt-60 container check-up system which can find as
small as a cake of soap in a container full of goods in three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said it is the first container check-up system of
the kind in the world and its price only accounts for 20 percent
of the foreign accelerator-rayed check-up systems.
</P>
<P>
The fast-speed check-up system has been developed by
scientists at the Nuclear technology Design Institute of Qinghua
University after 15 months efforts.
</P>
<P>
The system has recently passed the appraisal by a group of
academicians of Chinese Academy of Engineering and experts from
other research institutions.
</P>
<P>
The safety of biological products and foods can be guaranteed
as the goods only receive 1 percent as much radiation dosage as
that of making an X-ray check up of a man.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the newly developed system will be effective
device for the nation's anti-smuggle work.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 150 customs houses in China need to install such a
system.

<HEADLINE> China's 1st DSS in Shipping Management Passes Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China's first Decision-Support
System (DSS) for management in shipping industry passed assessment
in north China's port city of Tianjin City on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The software system has been jointly developed by the Tianjin
Branch of the China Ocean Shipping Group (COSCO Tianjin) and the
Dalian Maritime University.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Tianjin University and COSCO agreed that the
system will have a profound impact on China's shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
The system is advanced, practical and reliable, and creative as
well, they concluded.
</P>
<P>
They proposed commercializing the system so as to spread its use
in the whole shipping industry. The system will be put to use in
COSCO Tianjin on January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei Jiafu, general manager of COSCO Tianjin and
chief of the joint DSS-developing group, the system has three main
systems, namely the general manager DSS, the vessel-operation DSS,
and the investment DSS, and nine sub-systems.
</P>
<P>
The 47 year-old general manager told Xinhua that as China is
shifting from a planned economy to a market economy, shipping
companies have to practice a modern and scientific management
system, in a bid to compete on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Wei, a former captain and leader of many other major shipping
companies in the country, started to develop the system soon after
he came to COSCO Tianjin two years ago.
</P>
<P>
COSCO Tianjin was set up in October 1, 1970. Since then, the
number of its ocean-going fleet has grown from 10 vessels of
137,000 DWT to more than 100 vessels of two million DWT.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Fundamental Changes Expected in Blood Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China's first law on voluntary
blood donation, passed by the top legislative body here today,
marks a fundamental change in the blood donation work which has
been practiced for more than a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
The 29th session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People's Congress(NPC), closed here today, announced that
the blood donation law will become effective starting from October
1, 1998. The law stipulates that the state implements the system
of voluntary blood donation.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Health Chen Minzhang said that the "Blood
Donation Law" will be a milestone in the country's blood donation
work, and marks an important progress in the promotion of the
country's socialist cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
China first introduced compulsory blood donation among its
citizens in 1978. However, the work in this regard remains at a
low level due to weak publicity and lack of legal administration.
</P>
<P>
Shan Ouqi, an official in charge of blood management from the
Ministry of Public Health(MPH), disclosed that at present the
blood volume for clinical use stands at some 800 tons annually in
the country, with 4 million blood donators, with about 50 percent
professional blood sellers.
</P>
<P>
She said, driven by economic gains, some of the sellers provide
blood too frequently, leading to the decrease in the blood quality.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the MPH shows that the incidence of positive
reaction in the test on the HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen)
stands at 30-90 percent in the blood provided by professional
blood sellers.
</P>
<P>
Shan continued, the paid blood donation has twisted the spirit
of humanitarianism, and runs contrary to the traditional virtues
of the Chinese nation featuring unity, fraternal love and mutual
aid.
</P>
<P>
Shan said, introduction of voluntary blood donation system and
banning on blood selling will basically stop the occurrences of
the above-mentioned phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
According to Shan, 11 people's congresses and governments at
provincial and municipal levels in the country have passed local
blood donation regulations, with some of their successful
experiences included in the just-passed blood donation law.
</P>
<P>
At present, the MPH has established a well-equipped management
organ and contingent for blood collection and supply, and has set
up 347 stations for blood collection, storage, separation and
transportation across the country.
</P>
<P>
By November this year, there had been 72 cities in the country
which have more than 10,000 voluntary blood donators each.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Province Reports Rapid Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) of Hunan, an inland province in central China is projected
to top 300 billion yuan (37.5 billion U.S. dollars) this year,
according to a provincial government report.
</P>
<P>
Hunan's GDP -- the value of goods and services produced -- has
grown at an average annual rate of 11 percent since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of agricultural output is projected at 8
percent this year, according to the report. The traditionally
agricultural province has expanded its acreage planted to quality
rice to 133,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has set up 64 centers for producing and
processing grain, cotton, cooking oil and sugar, with the output
of these products accounting for more than 70 percent of the
province's total, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that Hunan's industrial output grew by 11
percent this year, reaching 191.9 billion yuan (23,98 billion
U.S. dollars). Its steel output will reach 2.4 million tons this
year, an all-time provincial record.
</P>
<P>
Some company groups producing electric wire and cables, iron,
steel and paper have broken into the international market, because
of the adjusted economic structure.
</P>
<P>
In a move to open wider to the outside world, the province
has increased funding for infrastructure construction and five
key industries -- machinery, food, metallurgy, building
materials and textiles, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province has achieved a balance between revenue
and expenditure for five consecutive years. This year's revenue is
estimated at 25.2 billion yuan (3.15 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The retail price index has dropped to one percent this year, and
consumer price index to three percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The province has invested 268.3 billion yuan in fixed assets in
the last five years, at an annual growth rate of 26
percent. Thirty-eight key projects -- such as the Changsha and
Xiangtan power plants, Shimen-Changsha Railway and Chenglingji
Port -- have been completed or are being undertaken.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province has handled imports and exports
totaling 14.3 billion U.S. dollars over the past five years. It
has actually used 4.6 billion U.S. dollars in overseas investment
in that period.
</P>
<P>
With rapid economic development, the province has helped
900,000 farmers rise above the poverty line this year. The per
capita income of urban and rural residents is expected to reach
5,358 and 2,000 yuan, respectively, both up five percent from last
year.

<HEADLINE> More Farmers in Shandong Join Old-Age Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in east China's
Shangdong Province will no longer depend exclusively on their
children for their later years, thanks to an old-age pension
insurance system that has been set up in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 17 million farmers in Shangdong, an
economic powerhouse in China, have joined the rural pension plan
which started in 1991, accounting for 50 percent of the total
eligible for social insurance. About 2.3 billion yuan has been
accumulated in the pension fund.
</P>
<P>
The province has 59 million farmers, 68 percent of the
province's total population. And most of people who are 60 or
older live in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The rural pension system is part of the social security network
China is building to minimize the side effects of its booming
market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
A certain amount of pension insurance money should be paid by
individuals when they are still working. They will improve their
chances of having a better life by getting pension.
</P>
<P>
Payment by individual farmers usually accounts for half of the
total insurance premiums and the rest is paid by villages where
they live and township-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to set up a unified, comprehensive
rural pension insurance system in the next three years, said Zhang
Ruifeng, vice-governor in charge of rural insurance.
</P>
<P>
So far, 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions
have introduced an old-age pension insurance system in rural
areas. Altogether, 82 million farmers have joined the insurance
plan and the amount in the fund has topped 12 billion yuan. About
400,000 farmers have drawn the pension.

<HEADLINE> New Policy to Boost Tanzania's Mineral Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is expected to
implement a new mineral policy, aiming at increasing mineral
production from two percent of the annual Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, Tanzania will introduce reforms which
will guarantee foreign exchange repatriation of profits,
favorable tax and regulatory treatment for mining investors,
leaving the door open for private investments, the East African
newspaper quoted officials from the Ministry of Energy and
Minerals as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
The policy will also strengthen institutional, environmental
and legal aspects, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The officials from the Ministry said the policy has already
been endorsed by the cabinet and will be launched by Minister
Abdallah Kigoda.
</P>
<P>
The policy's more important responsibilities include the
opening up of the sector to allow complete private ownership of
mineral prospecting. This will shift the role of the government
from that of owning and operating mines to that of stimulating
private mining investment and providing support of investors.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector will play the role of being the principal
vehicle for carrying out direct investment in mining, " said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The policy calls for " a well developed gemstone cutting and
jewellery industry making Tanzania the gemstone center for Africa
and providing dependable employment to Tanzanians," it added.
</P>
<P>
The policy will also ensure that contractual rights and
obligations are protected, and provide for settlement of disputes
through the courts or by international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the policy, the Ministry of Energy and
Minerals will set up a Mining Board to supervise the mining
activities and stamp out illegal mining by issuing special
identification cards to all licensed small-scale miners, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has provided 13 million US dollars since 1995
for human resources and capacity building in the sector through
provision of technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Currently Tanzania earns about 500 million US dollars annually
from exports which include minerals. Official sources said the
country's mineral sector is expected to attract up to 400 million
US dollars by the year 2,000.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Market in Tianjin Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The real estate market has
been developing vigorously in Tianjin, the largest port city in
north China, since 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the municipal government has taken
a wide range of reform steps to enliven the real estate market
over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The reform measures include selling government-built apartments
to employees, leasing the right to use land for housing
construction, encouraging different enterprises and institutions
to raise funds for housing construction, and establishing public
housing funds.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, some 23 billion yuan have been pooled
for construction of housing in the city. And the municipality has
leased the land-use right for 1,296 plots, with a total area of
31.39 sq km, for housing construction.
</P>
<P>
New apartments with a combined floor space of 20.6 million sq m
have been constructed with the raised funds and put onto the
market, said the local sources.
</P>
<P>
A total of 500,000 residents have improved their housing
conditions by purchasing new apartments from the market. The per
capita floor space of urban dwellers has now increased to 7.7 sq m
from 6.9 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin now has 1,142 real estate developers, up from only
eight in 1994. In the first nine months this year, 4.49 billion
yuan was spent constructing new apartments, a rise of 20 percent
from the same period last year. During the same period,
open-market apartments with a total floor space of 1.12 million sq
m were sold.

<HEADLINE> Rare Animal Bred in Beijing Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- One lester slow loris, a rare
primate under first-class state protection, has given birth to two
babies in the Beijing Zoo recently.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the animal has been bred in the zoo.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say, it is difficult for the animal to reproduce
in northern China, for it is afraid of cold.
</P>
<P>
The lester slow loris, inhabiting in China's subtropical province
of Yunnan, was first found in 1986. The small, slow-moving
primate lives on trees and is active at night.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, scientists in the Beijing Zoo have carried out
researches on the lester slow loris. They adjusted the
temperature, air humidity, and illumination in the animal's room
to imitate its living environment.
</P>
<P>
The two cubs will make a debut soon, said an official of the
zoo.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 1,500 animals in over 100 species have been
bred in the zoo this year, including giant pandas, golden monkeys,
red-crowned cranes, swans and chimpanzees.

Bangladesh's per capita gross national product (GNP) was only
276 U.S. dollars in 1996-97 and more than half of its 124.3
million people live in poverty. The problem is compounded by the
weak economic base, natural calamities, mismanagement and
dwindling foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Successive governments have pledged efforts to lift the country
out of poverty and undertaken many related projects, which have
gained limited success.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1987, the proportion of people living in poverty
fell by 5.8 percent to 51.7 percent in 1994. At such a pace, it
would take more than 50 years to eliminate poverty in the country,
according to Dr. Hossain Rahman of Bangladesh Institute of
Development Studies.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, the Samurdhi Movement is credited with having
helped prevent popular discontent by ensuring that the wealth of
the rich is trickling down to the poor.
</P>
<P>
Formerly known as the Janasaviya Plan launched in October 1989,
it was part of the government's economic development strategy to
aid the rising number of poor people, brought about partly by the
economic reforms started in the country in 1978, by creating more
jobs for them and increase their incomes.
</P>
<P>
The reforms have greatly boosted the economy, but consequently
the gap between the rich and the poor is also widening. To nip any
potential social unrest in the bud, 34 million and 12 million U.S.
dollars had been released by 1996 as relief funds and employment
funds respectively to help 27,000 poor families.
</P>
<P>
In February, the parliament passed a package of provisions
concerning the plan, renamed the Samurdhi Movement in August 1995,
in an effort to boost the campaign.
</P>
<P>
There are between 325,000 and 390,000 people living below the
poverty line in the Indian Ocean island nation with a population
of 18.5 million.
</P>
<P>
For the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal, fighting poverty is an
arduous struggle with its per capita GNP stagnating for a long
time at 190 U.S. dollars, one of the lowest in the world, and 45
percent of its 21 million people living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Poverty alleviation has been one of the major objectives of
successive governments and a number of programs have been launched
in the past years.
</P>
<P>
These programs have been focusing on rural areas and on
agriculture which contributes 43 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) and 82 percent of the employment.
</P>
<P>
For all these programs' success, the road ahead is tortuous.
The biggest problems are limited arable land, lack of off-farm
activity and the overgrowth of population, Nepali officials said.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: South Asia Faces Daunting Challenges in Fighting Poverty (1)  By Nan Ya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, December 29 (Xinhua) -- For South Asia, one of the
poorest regions in the world, poverty eradication remains a
daunting task with just five years to go to meet the target.
</P>
<P>
At their summit meeting in May this year in the Maldives, South
Asian leaders reaffirmed their commitment to eradicating poverty
in the region as soon as possible, preferably by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Years of relentless efforts in these countries culminated in
1991 when their leaders sat down in Colombo, Sri Lanka, for a
regional summit at which the highest priority was given to
identifying measures to fight poverty which had long been a
scourge to the region.
</P>
<P>
And at their New Delhi summit in 1995, the leaders of
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka -- the seven members of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), pledged to eradicate poverty in the
region preferably by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Ever since SAARC was formed in 1985, poverty eradication, as
well as economic cooperation, has been the top priority of the
regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
Keenly aware that South Asia is still haunted by a host of
serious social problems with poverty as the chief culprit, SAARC
governments spare no efforts in this endeavor.
</P>
<P>
According to SAARC figures, the number of people living below
the poverty line in the seven countries has dropped to about
one-third of the total 1.2 billion population from 45.4 percent in
1987.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimates that the incidence of poverty in South
Asia is expected to decline to 26 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yet the task is arduous. Poverty is widespread, but resources
are limited. In recent years, SAARC countries have taken various
measures to fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
In India, the largest country in the region, one-third of its
more than 900 million people live below the poverty line. Since
India gained independence in 1947, its successive governments have
taken various measures to help the poor and backward areas in
alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
These include the establishment of the National Backward
Classes Finance and Development Corporation -- a non-profit firm
which promotes economic and development activities for the poor,
and the formulation of preferential policies encouraging private
and foreign investments in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Both the central and local governments have special assistance
plans. Special allowance is provided for poor people who can
attend training centers to learn skills to make a living.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Pakistan, one of the most conspicuous
aid-the-poor plans is perhaps the Social Action Program (SAP),
launched in 1992 with the aim to remove the lingering structural
imbalance in development.
</P>
<P>
The two-phase SAP involves primary education, basic health,
population welfare and rural water supply and sanitation. In the
first phase (1992-1996), the primary school attendance rate and
the contraceptive prevalence rate rose, the infant mortality rate
dropped and life expectancy for women improved.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to invest 270 billion rupees (6.7 billion
U.S. dollars) for the second phase (1996-2000). It has also set up
a Federal Task Force on Poverty Eradication to help improve its
policy framework.
</P>
<P>
For Pakistan, the biggest challenge in eradicating poverty may
be the high growth rate of population, which has dropped to 2.7
percent. Pakistan, the eighth most populous nation in the world,
ranks 134th among the 174 developing countries in terms of human
development indicators, and 28 percent of its 140 million people
still live below the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> Graf Still Uncertain for Australia Open: Tournament Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf is still
uncertain to play in the Australian Open due to her knee surgery,
according to tournament director Paul McNamee in Melbourne on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The German tennis star has not played a tournament since having
an arthroscopic surgery in May and has not entered any of the
Australian Open warmup events.
</P>
<P>
"We can't be 100 per cent certain that she will play in the
Open until she actually sets foot in Australia," McNamee said.
"There still has to be a question mark over Steffi Graf."
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that Graf will enter the Hope Island,
Queensland, event _ beginning Jan. 4 _ under the Women's Tennis
Association's "golden wild card" rule, but her entry has not been
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Graf is only three grand slam singles victories away from
breaking the record of 24 set by Australia's Margaret Court.

<HEADLINE> Brief Notes on Major Kenyan Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Following are the brief
introduction of eight out of 15 presidential candidates in
Kenya's second multi-party elections held today.
</P>
<P>
Daniel arap Moi -- 73 years old. Vice-President from 1969 to
1978 and President since 1978. Leader of the ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU). Prominent peace-broker in the Great Lakes
region and eastern Africa. He is widely expected to win his final
five year term today mainly due to the division of the opposition
and his relatively most diluted tribal color. But issues like
allegedly rampant corruption, high unemployment and weak state of
infrastructure might lead him to a possible Waterloo. Coming from
Kalenjin, a minority community, he headed the 1992 poll with 36.8
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Mwai Kibaki -- 66 years old. KANU's National Executive Officer
in early 1960s, cabinet minister from 1964 to 1978, Vice-
President from 1978 to 1988 and Chairman of the opposition
Democratic Party (DP) since 1992. He is seen as the most serious
challenger to Moi in today's poll and believed to get a majority
in Central Province. A member of Kikuyu, the largest tribe making
up about 25 percent of Kenya's population, he took the third
place in the 1992 race with 19.45 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Charity Ngilu -- 45 years old. One of the first two women ever
to vie for the top seat in Kenya and, if successful, she would be
sub-Saharan Africa's first elected female president. As many
people believe, she stands a real chance in today's voting mainly
due to her clarion call for social changes and fresh image
untainted by scandals. She was one of the rare rags-to-riches
women in Africa and first walked into politics in 1992 when
elected to parliament for the DP which she quit this year so as
to run on the Social Democratic Party (SDP) ticket. She comes
from Kamba tribe.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kijana Wamalwa -- 53 years old. Official leader of the
opposition in the just-dissolved seventh parliament and Chairman
of FORD-Kenya which is the only party in the country with a
parliamentary representative in each province. Once lecturer in
law at Nairobi University, he first won the parliamentary seat in
1979 and became the second vice chairman of FORD in September
1992 soon before FORD split into FORD-Kenya and FORD-Asili. He
gets support mainly from his own Luhya tribe, the third largest
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Raila Odinga -- 52 years old. Leader of the opposition
National Democratic Party (NDP). Second son of Kenya's first Vice-
President Jaramogi Oginga Odinga who was widely respected by
Kenyans as a nationalist hero. He got a degree in mechanical
engineering in Democratic Germany in 1970, has been detained three
times by the Moi government and was elected Vice-Chairman of
FORD in 1992. He quit FORD-Kenya to join SDP in January. A
prominent role in opposition campaigns mid this year for pressing
the government to conduct minimum constitutional reforms before
elections, he commands broad support in western Kenya, especially
among young people from his Luo tribe, the second largest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Koigi wa Wamwere -- 49 years old. Leader of Kenya National
Democratic Alliance (KENDA). He served in parliament as a KANU
dissident in the one-party era, detained without trial or charge
for three years under late President Jomo Kenyatta's rule. After
several years in exile in Norway, he was re-arrested in 1990 and
spent another two years in jail charged with treason. The charge
was finally dropped without explanation. In 1995 he was sentenced
for four years for allegedly raiding a police station and
stealing guns. The judgement was nullified by the Supreme Court
on the first day of this month, making him eligible to run at the
last minute. He is said enormously popular among peasant farmers,
both among his own Kikuyu and other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Martin Shikuku -- A Kikuyu, 62 years old. Leader of the opposition
FORD-Asili and the party's parliamentary member. He is one of the
few pre-independence politicians still in politics. Elected in
parliament in 1963. Detained in 1975 for saying KANU was "dead"
and released in 1978. Served as an assistant minister between
1980 and 1986 when he was dismissed after being accused by Moi of
making disparaging remarks about Kenyatta and his government. In
1992, he became the Secretary-General of FORD, but soon fell out
with Oginga Odinga. When the party split, he joined FORD-Asili
and Odinga formed FORD-Kenya.
</P>
<P>
George Anyona -- 52 years old. Leader and the sole
parliamentary member of the Kenya Social Congress party. A former
university lecturer and political prisoner, he was first elected
to parliament in 1974. He was the secretary of the Inter-Parties
Parliamentary Group which drew up constitutional revisions
enacted before parliament was dissolved last month. A Kisii from
western Nyanza province, he garnered less than one percent of the
vote in the 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
Other seven candidates, representing minor parties,
are Madam Wangari Maathai of Liberal Party, Kimani wa Nyoike of
FORD-People, Munyua Waiyaki of Patriotic Party of Kenya (UPPK),
Katama Mkangi of Kenya National Congress, Waweru Ng'ethe of Umma
Party, Godfrey Mwireria of Green African Party and Stephen
Wilfred Omondi Oludhe of Economic Independence Party, who
announced his quit yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Completes 50 Major Pollution Control Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has completed 50 major
dust, noise and water pollution control projects this year.
</P>
<P>
"The projects have solved a number of pollution problems
cared by the public and improved the environmental quality in
some regions," said an official with the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
An asphalt concrete plant in the city's Chaoyang District has

</P>
<P>
At a cost of 140 million yuan (about 17.5 million US dollars),
the plant has set up a new factory equipped with pollution control
facilities in Changping County of Beijing, greatly reducing its
dust emission.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has enabled all its suburban gas stations
to supply lead-free gas.

<HEADLINE> China Generates 1.13 Trillion KWH Electricity This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- China expects to generate
1.135 trillion kwh of electricity and its installed generating
capacity will reach 250 million kw this year, both ranking second
in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi Dazhen, minister of electric power and general
manager of the China State Power Corporation, China has made
historic breakthrough in electricity generation, investment mode,
operation mechanism and management system. And a complete and
initially modernized system of power industry has taken shape.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at a national power conference
held here today. He said that it is remarkable for the country to
have maintained an annual average growth rate of 6.2 percent in
power generation for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
And for ten years running, the large and medium-sized
generating units with total capacity ranging from 10 million kw to
15 million kw have been put into operation annually.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 14 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities directly under the Central government have met the
target of making electricity available to every village under
their jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that 95 percent of the country's total rural
population will have gained access to the use of electricity by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that with Daya Bay and Qinshan nuclear power
plants having been put into operation, the country's sources of
electricity have been diversified. And for several years
hydropower generating units with capacity exceeding 4 million kw
have been put into operation annually.
</P>
<P>
Presently, large-sized generating units each with a capacity
above 200,000 kw or 300,000 kw have become the backbone of the
country's power grids, which account for more than 40 percent of
the country's total installed power generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country has succeeded in setting up a
multi-channel fund raising system for power construction, with
funds from various localities and overseas topping 170 billion
yuan for construction of large and medium-sized generating units,
or 43.1 percent of the total investment in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that an all-round reform has started in the
country's power industry to transform the traditional operation
mechanism and management system, which has been signaled by the
establishment of the China State Power Corporation.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bharatiya Janata Party's
(BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Atal Behari Vajpayee is in favor
of setting up a Constitution Commission to review the efficacy of
the Indian Constitution in grappling with the problems of the
nation over the past 45 years.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission comprising experts in constitutional law,
education, social service, economics, history, science and
technology and other facets of national life may suggest changes,
additions and alterations to suit the changing needs of the
present and the challenges of the future," Vajpayee said in an
exclusive interview with The Hindustan Times Sunday, which was
made public here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A review of the Constitution was imperative in the light of the
prevailing political instability both at the Center and in some
states, frequent elections and the misuse of the constitutional
provisions for narrow political and personal gains, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The younger generation that is to man the nation in the
immediate future is losing faith in the system," he further said.
</P>
<P>
The BJP, one of the two major national parties in India, has
already expressed its desire to form next government after the
United Front government tendered its resignation on December 4.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Review Nuclear Reactor Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai has ordered to review the country's plan to build a
nuclear research reactor amid worries over safety problems, The
Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan gave the order as the planned project to build a 10
megawatt reactor in Ongkharak district of Nakhon Nayok province
received no safety license, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Nuclear Safety Subcommittee did not grant a safety license
to the project, the site work of which had already started with
U.S. nuclear reactor builder General Atomics commissioned to build
and operate the facility, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The deal for the 3.8-billion-baht (84.4 million U.S. dollar
under the exchange rate when the contract was signed) project was
approved on June 1 this year by the then Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
government, which reportedly bypassed the subcommittee chaired by
the permanent secretary of Thailand's Science, Technology and
Environment Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission refused to conduct a
safety review of the Thai reactor according to the terms of
references on the project on grounds that the planned reactor was
a mix of U.S. and Australian technology, the newspaper quoted a
government source as saying.
</P>
<P>
General Atomics has already started preparing the land for the
reactor, the source said, adding that if the government now
decides to scrape the project, it will face a loss of a down
payment of 300 million baht (6.67 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Probe Central Bank's Mismanagement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai has promised that his government will clean up the central
bank and punish those found guilty of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Bangkok Post published on
Monday, the prime minister said the government would make it a
priority to examine the Bank of Thailand's role in implementing
economic measures over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said the probe will review the granting of a 100-billion
baht (4 billion U.S. dollar then) loan to the Bangkok Bank of
Commerce (BBC), which ran into severe financial problems two years
ago after allegedly over-extending loans to businesses and people
closely connected to the bank's executives on over-valued
collaterals.
</P>
<P>
Investigations will also be carried out into the fast depletion
of Thailand's foreign reserves, which were used to defend
belatedly the Thai currency against currency speculators, and the
use of huge sums, estimated at more than 430 billion baht (16.86
billion dollars then), of the country's development fund to prop
up ailing private finance firms.
</P>
<P>
Of 58 such firms suspended by the government in June and August
this year, 56 have been closed down.
</P>
<P>
In the last few months, some academics and financial analysts
have held the central bank partly responsible for the country's
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
An investigation led by Suthee Singhasaneh, former finance
minister, found abuse of authority and blunders made at the
highest levels of the central bank, the report said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 passengers
aboard a United Airlines jumbo jet were injured and one was killed
when the U.S. plane hit massive air turbulence over the Pacific
late Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 10 in Brazilian Prison Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A prisoner and a hostage were
killed in an ongoing Brazilian prison unrest on Sunday, which
raised the death toll in recent prison riots in the country to 10.
</P>
<P>
Police said that about 300 visitors and 17 prison guards were held
hostage when the riot occurred at the Sorocaba prison near Sao
Paulo in southeast Brazil.
</P>
<P>
One inmate and a visitor who had been taken hostage were killed
during the rebellion and the situation remained unchanged Sunday
evening, said a prison spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the two pistols and five revolvers used by
the rebel prisoners had been smuggled into the prison by outsiders
during visiting hours.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, police crushed another uprising in the prison
near the Sorocaba facility.
</P>
<P>
Although 192 prisoners rebelled in that case, nobody was killed or
injured as the rebels agreed to return to their cells peacefully in
the end.
</P>
<P>
However, the prison riot that took place in the northeastern
town of Fortaleza on Thursday left eight inmates dead.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has been hit by a spate of prison rebellions in recent
months as prisoners complained about overcrowded cells and demanded
an improvement on living conditions.

BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has
seen continuous growth in the number of mobile phone subscribers,
with more than 300,000 added this year alone, which exceeds the
total in the previous 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing has had 600,000 mobile phone

a handling capacity of 760,000 lines.
</P>
<P>
Now, the network has more than 360 standard stations for the
phones, which have been linked up with 30 of the country's 32
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, as well as with
13 countries and regions including Singapore, Finland, Germany,
Hong Kong and Macao.

TOKYO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- One passenger was killed and 63
people were injured as a U.S. passenger plane en route from Tokyo to
Hawaii was buffeted by heavy turbulence on Sunday, reports here
said.
</P>

The accident occurred when the Boeing 747 jumbo jet, which
departed Narita, Japan, at 9:05 p.m. local time (1205 GMT), was
ascending at an altitude of 9,400 meters over the Pacific Ocean.
</P>

The reports said the turbulence was so violent that passengers
and flight attendants were thrown against the overhead luggage
compartments and the ceiling.

The seat belt sign was not turned on because the turbulence was
totally unexpected.
</P>
<P>
The injured were rushed to hospitals after the United Airline
flight returned to Tokyo's Narita airport, said Donna Sitkiewicz,
director of communications for the airline.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Economy to Grow 4 percent in 1998: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) expects the Philippine economy to slow down next year to
4-4.5 percent in terms of gross national product (GNP) growth rate
due to the current financial problem, local press reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said this projection is in line with the
government's outlook for 1998, which was revised down almost three
percentage points from the original target to 4.5 percent for GNP
and 4 percent for gross domestic product (GDP), in anticipation of
the twin effects of the financial turmoil in the region and the El
Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
However, the ADB said keeping growth prospects at this level
will require extra care from the government to ease interest rates
to more normal levels and moderate public investments to
accommodate increased external debt-servicing obligations and thus
remove pressure on the fiscal balance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank said the Philippines' inflation will be a
main problem next year, being sensitive to both movements of the
peso and weather changes.
</P>
<P>
The ADB expected the inflation rate to shoot up to 10 percent
next year, much higher than the government-planned 6.5-7.5
percent. The rate remained at an averaged low level of 5 percent
in the first 11 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank added that the upward adjustments of interest rates
after the peso was floated in July "could aggravate the financial
position of the corporate sector, worsen the investment climate in
the economy, choke economic growth and prolong the economic
slowdown."
</P>
<P>
"It would be more appropriate for the government to reduce
interest rates to more normal levels and leave the nominal
exchange rate to the foreign exchange market. Lowering the
interest rates should take precedence over stabilizing the
exchange rate," the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The bank, however, noted that if the currency adjustment is
managed efficiently and if political stability follows the
presidential polls in May next year, growth could resume after
1998 to signal the end of the stormy aftershocks of the regional
currency malaise.
</P>
<P>
"Over the long term, the Philippine economy should come out
stronger from the current currency adjustment," it said.

reclamation in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has climbed to a
new high.
</P>
<P>
The State-owned company has a total registered capital of
540 million yuan (65 million U.S. dollars). It manages 153,400
hectares of land and employs more than 70,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The company is expected to be a major center for fine crop
strains breeding, agricultural research and commodity export in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi's reclamation projects, which largely adopt machinery
in agricultural production, have been playing an important role in
the overall development of local agriculture, industry and trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the sector had a gross domestic product (GDP) of 624
million yuan (75 million U.S. dollars) and contributed 174 million
yuan (20 million U.S. dollars) to the region in tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi's reclamation projects focus on crop growing, animal
husbandry and aquatic production. The sector has 15,000 hectares
planted with sugar cane, 8,628 hectares with fruit, 2,525 hectares
with tea, 3,269 hectares with sisal hemp, 4,777 hectares of rubber
trees and 21,500 hectares of cash forests.
</P>
<P>
Their major products are pigs, cows, prawns and freshwater
fish. In 1996, 213,800 hogs were slaughtered at reclamation farms
here.
</P>
<P>
The reclamation company will further strengthen the sector's
competitiveness. Its business will also involve inter-provincial
trade, border trade, wholesales of farm products, tourism, catering,
real estate development and transportation services.

<HEADLINE> More Wild Animals Inhabit Changbai Mountains in NE China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Large numbers of black
bears, wild boars and roe deers are being frequently spotted in the
Changbai Mountains in northeast China's Jilin Province, due to
the hunting ban implemented two years.
</P>
<P>
Ren Junjie, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Jilin provincial people's congress, said the sightings were
reported by an inspection group that has just completed its tour of
Jilin, Tonghua and Baishan cities and the Yanbian Korean
Autonomous Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Ren said illegal hunting has been greatly reduced since the
province's five-year ban became effective in January of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition, expanding forests in the mountainous areas and
increased knowledge of wild-animal protection have contributed to
the improvement of natural habitats and increases in the animal
population.
</P>
<P>
Jilin is the country's only region that has enforceed a hunting
ban throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
In Tonghua's rural areas, residents once discovered 26 roe deers
in a group and several hundreds of wild ducks flying to a river
on the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the swan geese, which had disappeared in the
city for many years, has returned to Jilin this year.
</P>
<P>
Jilin has established a first-aid station for injured wild
animals and had rescued 21 wild animals three years after its
establishment.
</P>
<P>
Ren called for drafting a provincial regulation to compensate
those who are injured or whose property is damaged in protecting
the animals.

<HEADLINE> Suez Canal Tolls Not to Be Changed in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Egypt's Suez Canal
Authority (SCA) Ahmed Ali Fadel announced today that the tolls of
ships sailing through the international waterway will not be
changed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The decision came despite continuing drops in SCA's revenues,
Fadel said at a press conference held in Ismailia midway of the
canal and about 120 kilometers east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economic unit of the SCA has recommended the
tolls which have been in place since 1994 be kept intact.
</P>
<P>
Discounts will continue to be given to tankers from the Gulf,
ships and tankers from Australia to the Mediterranean ports, from
Japan to Europe and from the United States to the Gulf, he said.
</P>
<P>
The discounts range from 5 to 35 percent according to various
factors including the types and loads of the ships, and whether
they are on a one way or round trip basis.
</P>
<P>
Studies are underway on a Qatari request for further toll
reduction for liquefied natural gas carriers from the Gulf country
and an agreement will be reached and applied, Fadel said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the revenues of the Suez Canal, the third
largest foreign-currency earner in Egypt, in 1997 stand at 1.822
billion U.S. dollars, down by 3 percent compared to 1996.
</P>
<P>
A 5.7 percent devaluation of the Special Drawing Rights of the
International Monetary Fund also ate into the the earnings, but he
said that is "acceptable."
</P>
<P>
The 193-kilometer canal, which stretches from Port Said in the
north to the town of Suez in the south, is the longest lock-free
canal in the world.
</P>
<P>
The canal linking the Mediterranean and the Red Sea was opened
on November 17, 1879 and was nationalized by Egypt on July 26,
1956.
