<HEADLINE> WEU Chief Urges Flexibility in Crisis Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union (WEU)
chief Jose Cutileiro Tuesday urged flexibility in decision making
within the politico-military institution to better handle crises.
</P>
<P>
The consensus principle, which the WEU had to apply in the
decision-making procedure regarding sending troops to a theater of
operations, should be flexible enough to give priority to WEU
operations over coalitions of the willing, Cutileiro told a
gathering in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was held to mark the 50th anniversary of the
signing of the Brussels Treaty which serves as the founding
document for the WEU as well as the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Crisis management is a main mission of the institution which
was founded in 1955 and now has 10 full members.

<HEADLINE> EC, CFO Fail to Reach Deal on World Cup Ticket Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC) and
the French organizing committee(CFO) for the 1998 Soccer World Cup
failed to reach a deal on selling the remaining tickets for the
finals outside France.
</P>
<P>
European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert Tuesday met
with CFO managing director Jacques Lambert, but failed to make a
deal, a spokesman for the EC said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the meeting had been "constructive" and that
the EU executive expected a final proposal within this week.
</P>
<P>
Van Miert said last week that he wanted the CFO to make more
than 160,000 unsold tickets available for soccer fans outside
France.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Commission, the European Union(EU)'s
executive body, may take legal measures which could result in a
fine for breach of EU fair competition rules.
</P>
<P>
Soccer fans in other EU countries complain about the
concentration of ticket sales in France, which they believe
discriminate against other citizens in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup finals are scheduled for June 10 to July 12.

Bank report.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana Tuesday quoted the report which

CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Tuesday blessed the envisaged
restoration of Egyptian property seized by Sudan as a positive
step towards mending fences between the two Nile neighbors, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Higher Education Mofeed Shehab said the
move is the beginning of redressing warped conditions set in place
by the Sudanese government six years ago which have soured
Egyptian-Sudanese relations.

In a step towards improving the long-hit ties with Egypt,
Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir has given instructions to return
Egyptian property in Khartoum that was confiscated by the Sudanese
government in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Shehab, also minister of state for scientific research, said
the Ministry of Higher Education will closely follow up the
reinstatement of the Egyptian government property, including the
Cairo University Branch in Khartoum.

<HEADLINE> Arrested S. African Official Suspended from Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Senior South African
Foreign Affairs official Robert Mcbride, arrested in Mozambique
last Monday for alleged gun smuggling, had been suspended on full
pay pending the outcome of a criminal probe against him.
</P>
<P>
Due to the "gravity of the allegations" against Mcbride, the
Foreign Affairs Department had informed him of the intention to
suspend him from duty as director of the Southeast Asia desk, the
department said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mcbride has replied that he understood the need of the
procedure, given the serious nature of the allegations against
him, and he regretted the embarrassment caused to the South
Africa government, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said the suspension would technically
come into effect at the weekend, as Mcbride had about five days
to respond in writing, South Africa Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Mozambican criminal investigation, the
department was also conducting an internal inquiry into the
matter, it said.
</P>
<P>
The department reiterated that Mcbride was not on official
government business at the time of his arrest, but was on a
three-day leave.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government recognized that the due process
of law in Mozambique must take its course," it said.
</P>
<P>
The South African government would provide assistance in the
probe if required by the Mozambican authorities, within the
framework of the bilateral agreements between the two countries
to combat cross-border crime.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, President Nelson Mandela's spokesman said the
president was satisfied that cooperation between South Africa and
Mozambique on fighting cross-border crime would continue despite
the Mcbride incident.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was also confident that the cooperation would be
strengthened, the spokesman said after the president was briefed
on the matter by Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi,
who led a top-level delegation to Maputo Monday to discuss the
arrest with the Mozambican authorities.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Rises Slightly to 2.6 Pct in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's annual rate of
underlying inflation, which excludes home loan payments, rose
slightly to 2.6 percent in February, against forecasts of 2.5
percent, according to figures released Tuesday by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
This meant that the government missed its target inflation rate
of 2.5 percent last month after hitting it in January for just one
month since the general election.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that the headline rate of inflation rose to 3.4
percent from 3.3 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The figures re-opened the debate about whether another interest
rate rise will be necessary to check inflation.
</P>
<P>
The rise was mainly due to the fact that prices in the
clothing, footwear and household goods sectors rebounded last
month after the January sales.

<HEADLINE> Policy Vacuum for European Central Bank Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The planned European Central
Bank (ECB) could operate in a policy vacuum if the European Union
(EU) countries fail to coordinate their economic policies,
former European Commission President Jacques Delors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Delors made the remark Tuesday at a meeting of the
institutional affairs committee of the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said the European economic and monetary union (EMU) would
mark a "qualitative leap" for the EU's institutions, but the ECB
could find itself operating in a policy vacuum.
</P>
<P>
"If the ECB is working in a political vacuum, then I very much
fear it will become a scapegoat and the whole project could be
called into question," he told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ECB, destined to be a very powerful EU body after the EMU
launch next year, will be responsible for exercising monetary
policy with the aim of achieving price stability throughout the 15
EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
Delors also said that under the Maastricht Treaty, the ECB
would have to explain its policies to the public. "It has to be
accountable to the public and explain what it is doing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament's economic affairs committee is
scheduled to meet this week to approve a report which will ask the
ECB to make regular appearances before the committees of the
parliament, which under the treaty is the only place where ECB is
obliged to publicly explain its actions.
</P>
<P>
The report would be voted on by the whole assembly in early
April, according to EU sources.

<HEADLINE> EU, France Hold Talks Over Credit Lyonnais Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- France may soon present a plan
on the rescue of its Credit Lyonnais Bank, a European Union (EU)
spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert and French
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahnhas held "constructive"
talks Monday in Brussels on the future of the troubled
state-controlled bank, said the spokesman for Van Miert.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which fell to the verge of bankruptcy at the
beginning of the 1990s, is being rescued for the third time.
</P>
<P>
The long-term profitability of Credit Lyonnais, which is
expected to report a profit when it announces its annual results
Thursday, depends partly on the softening of the terms of a
restructuring plan imposed by the European Commission in 1995 in
return for clearing a huge government bailout.
</P>
<P>
The European competition commissioner, who has met with the
French finance minister regularly since the beginning of 1998,
wants France to privatize the bank and to sell all its retail
banking network outside France.
</P>
<P>
Van Miert has reopened an investigation into all subsidies
received by Credit Lyonnais since it nearly collapsed in the early
1990s.

LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's former cabinet minister
Jonathan Aitken was released Tuesday on bail after being
questioned over allegations of perjury and conspiracy to pervert
the course of justice.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested earlier in the day after he offered himself for
police questioning. His 17-year-old daughter, Victoria, was
arrested Monday over allegations of conspiracy to pervert the
course of justice.
</P>
<P>
Aitken, 55, said he had "voluntarily attended" a police
interview in London over allegations made against him and his
daughter by the Guardian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The former chief secretary to the Treasury took the Guardian
newspaper and Granada Television to Britain's High Court last year
over allegations they made in 1995 about his links with Saudi
Arabian business associates over an arms deal.
</P>
<P>
They had accused Aitken of procuring prostitutes for Arab
businessmen, of trying to arrange arms sales to Iraq before the
Gulf War and of allowing a Saudi associate to pay for a stay at
the luxurious Ritz Hotel in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Aitken, a rich businessman, had links with many powerful people
in the Arab world which he used to help win lucrative defense
contracts for Britain.

<HEADLINE> Competition Among Pakistani Banks to Become Tense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The decision of Pakistan's
central bank to lift control over the exchange rates for the U.S.
dollar against the rupee will have no significant impact on the
dollar-rupee parity in the open market, but will intensify
competition among banks, a senior banker said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), in a move to further relaxing
foreign exchange control, allowed local and foreign banks
operating in the country to determine their own exchange rates for
the dollar against the rupee.
</P>
<P>
The SBP decision will come into effect from March 24. "It
gives exporters and importers an option to choose among banks to
buy dollars at a cheaper price," said Haseeb Saulat, Assistant
Vice President of Askari Commercial Bank LTD in a telephone
interview Tuesday evening. "Thus the competition among banks will
be even tense," he added.
</P>
<P>
 In a circular, the SBP Tuesday announced that it will allow
authorized dealers to quote different exchange rates for U.S.
dollar like other currencies.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also decided to widen its buy and sell spread
for the green back from 0.5 percent to one percent and allowed
banks to quote their own dollar-rupee exchange rates for
transactions.
</P>
<P>
On January 20, SBP allowed authorized dealers to fix their own
rates of exchange for about 24 foreign currencies other than U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani rupee is pegged to the dollar and the Foreign
Exchange Committee has been determining dollar-rupee exchange
rates on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, importers will be free to purchase U.S.
dollar for imports, in ready or forward, from any authorized
dealer like other foreign currencies subject to the procedure and
stipulations of the SBP's announcement.

<HEADLINE> Bandits Threatening Somalia's Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The security situation in the
capital here as elsewhere in Somalia is deteriorating since
bandits are rampant in a vicious circle of clan related
animosities.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and three others were wounded when a
group of unidentified gunmen ambushed a Toyota pick-up near the
former milk factory of Hodom district Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness account, the gunmen, nearly 10
armed with assault rifles, have indiscriminately opened fire on
the Toyota pick-up, killing two of its occupants on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The deceased included a well known businessman, Ali Ahmed
Hassan, the head of the Cargo section of Daallo Airlines, one of
three major local airline companies operating in Somalia and his
driver.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the family members of the
deceased, the killing was a retaliatory action carried out by
armed men from the Suleman sub-clan against the Eyr sub-clan,
both belonging to the Habar Gidir clan of Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the country, another killing has also occurred in
the remote village of Gudinlabe, about 500 km north of Mogadishu
where three men were killed and their car was looted by armed men
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The report did not confirm whether the two killing incidents
were correlated or were just a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
The retaliatory sub-clan-based animosity between the two
groups roots back to the killing of a well-known businessman,
late Qasim Sheikh Mohamud, who was killed by Eyr sub-clansmen
near Ballidogle airport, 90 km Southwest of the capital on
December 25 last year. The businessman was himself killed for a
retaliation purpose.
</P>
<P>
The animosity between the two sub-clans has reach its climax
after an armed confrontation took place between Eyr and Suleman
sub-clansmen in Afgoe district, 30 km South of Mogadishu in mid
February, where at least 12 men were killed and many others
wounded including non combatant civilians.
</P>
<P>
In another incident Tuesday, three people were wounded and a
passenger bus was looted by unidentified gunmen who opened fire
on the bus on the road to Afgoe town.
</P>
<P>
The insecurity in Mogadishu and its surrounding areas is
getting worse with the delay on common understanding between
Mogadishu's faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
These horrible incidents are taking place at a time when
Hussein Aidid is outside Somalia for an unexpected visit to
neighboring Kenya where he was allegedly invited by president
Daniel Arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
Two committees from Hussein Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed have
been holding successive meetings here to end the stalemate over
the formation of a workable mechanism in beginning Mogadishu's
administration.
</P>
<P>
Both sides spoke of optimism in the talks and are expecting
Hussein Aidid to arrive in Mogadishu later today to finalize the
deadlock.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Needs Reinforcement from Other Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian-led west African
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG said Tuesday it needs troops
contributed by other neighbors to reinforce its final push on
remnants of the dislodged military junta in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Five weeks after ECOMOG removed the junta from power in
Freetown and subsequently captured six other major towns across
Sierra Leone, other west African countries, including Guinea, are
yet to contribute their troops to ECOMOG as promised.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corporation quoted a senior Nigerian
ECOMOG officer as saying that the junta remnants in diamond-rich
eastern Sierra Leone are continuing to attack defenseless
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The question of technical protection of the ECOMOG-controlled
areas in the district needs to be addressed, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, Freetown is now safe and well
secured but other countries of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) must contribute their parts to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"Troops from other ECOWAS countries and logistics from certain
Western countries would give the right signal as they advance to
capture the remaining towns not necessarily under the control of
the junta," he said.
</P>
<P>
Four weeks ago, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said that
Niger was going to contribute 1,000 troops to ECOMOG to assist
their operations.
</P>
<P>
However, the troops are yet to arrive in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigeria's commitment to the operation is signaled
by constant injection of personnel and weaponry, which continues
to build up the country's dominance in the sub-regional force.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Recommends More U.N. Observers in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday reported delays in Angola's peace process and
recommended adding 83 civilian police observers to the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola.
</P>
<P>
In a new report to the Security Council, the secretary-general
said that delays and last-minutes conditions "have become a
constant feature" of the tactics of the National Union for the
Total Independence fo Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Urging both parties to comply with their obligations under the
Lusaka protocol, the U.N. chief said, "I do not believe that the
international community is ready to accept continuing
procrastination in this regard."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the completion of the peace process is contingent
upon the full and unconditional demilitarization of the UNITA,
Annan said the presence of unregistered armed elements does not
enhance mutual trust in the process of national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general also reported that there are allegations
of human rights abuses being committed by the Angolan National
Police in newly normalized areas. "This is particularly
regrettable considering the need to bring officials to justice in
cases of confirmed human rights abuses, including the death of 10
UNITA supporters detained in Malange," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the progress made in the normalization of State
Administration, which has been extended to 264 out of the 335
localities, and the deployment of Angolan National Police into the
newly normalized areas, a substantial revision of the deployment
of civilian police is needed, said Annan. He added the number of
the United Nations civilian police locations will be increased
from 46 to 51. He recommended that the Security Council consider
authorizing the deployment of an additional 83 civilian police
observers.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the situation on the ground and the progress made
in the implementation of residual military tasks, the
secretary-general said he will gradually reduce the military
components of the mission by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
He also said it will be advisable to maintain a significant
United Nations involvement in the peace process in order to
promote confidence-building measures, national reconciliation and
development.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Construction Continues Surge in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Stimulated by low mortgage
rates and good weather, the U.S. construction of new homes and
apartments shot up 6 percent in February to the highest level in
more than a decade, the Commerce Department reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that construction of new single-family homes
and apartments rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.64
million units as the mortgage rates dropped to the lowest in four
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. industrial production failed to show an
increase for the first time since late 1996. The output at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities was steady in February,
the first time since October 1996 that there has been no monthly
gain.
</P>
<P>
The unchanged monthly performance for industrial production,
which followed a tiny 0.1 percent increase in January, was
attributed partly to the third straight monthly decline in the
assembly of cars and light trucks.
</P>
<P>
The housing market has also been helped by the unseasonably
mild winter in many parts of the country, caused by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The 6 percent increase in housing construction in February
followed a smaller 0.2 percent rise in January. The 1.64 million
annual rate for construction was the highest since housing starts
climbed to 1.66 million units in November 1987.
</P>
<P>
The upsurging in the U.S. housing industry is considered the
result of the falling mortgage rates and an economy that has
pushed the unemployment rate to the lowest level in 24 years,
helping to boost consumer confidence to record levels.
</P>
<P>
The housing report showed that construction on single-family
homes rose 4.3 percent in February to an annual rate of 1.27
million units, the highest level for this category since March
1994.
</P>
<P>
Construction of multifamily units was up 12.6 percent to an
annual rate of 366,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Building permits for future construction increased 6.5 percent
in February, the biggest gain since a 7.7 percent rise in December
1993.
</P>
<P>
All regions except the West shared in the February boom. The
biggest increase came in the Northeast, a jump of 14.3 percent to
an annual rate of 192,000 units, the highest level for this region
since February 1990.
</P>
<P>
Construction rose 10.9 percent in the South to an annual rate
of 724,000 units, the highest level since June 1986. Housing
starts rose 8.1 percent in the Midwest to an annual rate of
372,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The only region to suffer a setback was the West, where El Nino
has spawned torrential rains and flooding. Reflecting the adverse
weather, housing construction fell 7.9 percent in the West to an
annual rate of 348,000 units. It was the biggest one-month setback
since a 19.1 percent decline in December 1996.

LAGOS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria boasts as the world's
number one producer of yam and cassava, the Federal Office of
Statistics (FOS) said Tuesday.
</P>

highest figure of maize production with 93 percent, followed by
Edo and Anambra states, which grow 90 and 89 percent
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ousts Two Norwegian Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
announced a decision Tuesday to expel two Norwegian diplomats from
Russia, the Interfax news service reported.
</P>
<P>
The two Norwegians -- Rune Castberg, a councillor of the
Norwegian embassy in Moscow, and Ole Bjornoy, consul of the
Norwegian general consulate in Murmansk -- were ordered to leave
Russia by March 20.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the expulsion is that "Russian competent
authorities have incontrovertible evidence of involvement in
activities incompatible with their official status," the Foreign
Ministry's release said.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Norway expelled two Russian diplomats and declared
three former employees of Russian foreign missions persona non
grate on suspicion of espionage.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the scandal, the Norwegian prime minister
postponed his visit to Russia, scheduled for this week, that
caused a negative reaction in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry Valery Nesterushkin
said that the expulsion of Russian diplomats from Oslo was "an
episode in our bilateral relations which does not encourage their
constructive development."
</P>
<P>
"Activity of the Norwegian special services toward Russia and
its citizens does not contribute to normal development of
cooperation between our countries," the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Remains Unchanged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. output at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities was unchanged in February,
the Federal Reserve reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The steady level of the output in February followed a revised
0.1 percent growth in January and much bigger increases of 0.3
percent in December and 0.8 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Unseasonably warm weather nation-wide caused by El Nino
continued to weaken the demand for electricity and natural gas
used in heating. Utilities showed a 0.9 percent rise in February,
as compared with the 3.1 percent drop in January.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing was flat last month following a 0.3 percent
increase in January. Production of autos and light trucks fell by
2.1 percent in February following even bigger declines in January
and December.
</P>
<P>
The monthly record was the first time it has failed to show an
increase since October 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy grew at a strong 3.8 percent annual rate in
1997, the best showing in nearly a decade. However, some
economists believe that the growth this year could be a full
percentage point lower as the Asian crisis contributes to slower
manufacturing activity.
</P>
<P>
For February, the unchanged performance in manufacturing
reflected a small 0.1 percent rise in production of durable goods,
items expected to last three or more years. This slight gain was
attributed to strong increases in computers, semiconductors and
office equipment offsetting the weakness in auto production.
</P>
<P>
There was a 0.1 percent decline in production of non-durable
goods. Declines in output of food and paper products outweighed
gains in production of consumer chemicals and residential use of
utilities.
</P>
<P>
The production of business equipment, which had expanded nearly
11 percent last year, fell by 0.2 percent in February after having
an even larger 0.6 percent plunge in January.
</P>
<P>
Similar declines were also seen in the production of
industrial, telephone and photographic equipment.
</P>
<P>
Output at the nation's mines was down 0.3 percent in February
in the wake of a big 1.6 percent increase in January.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Opposition Party Asks to Join Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Afonso Dhlakama, Chairman of the
majo opposition party, the Mozambican National Resistance Party
(Renamo), reiterated here Tuesday that his party demanded to join
the Technical Secretariat of the Election Administration ( STAE).
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Dhlakama said that Renamo is demanding
its involvement in the STAE so as to check the irregularities in
last year's voter registration.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we hope to have complete right in the STAE,"
adding that the irregularities like the missing of the
registration book was "planned".
</P>
<P>
Another reason for Renamo's demand to join the STAE, he said,
is that the STAE will function also for the general elections for
1999.
</P>
<P>
The current STAE serves as a tool for the ruling Mozambican
Liberation Front (Frelimo) in its malpractice, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama said that his party has no ill intention to ruin the
local elections designed to be held on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The reason for Renamo to join the STAE is to correct all the
irregularities and win back people's trust to it, the opposition
party leader said.

<HEADLINE> Perry Sees More R&AMP;D Investment as Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry said the U.S. needs to do more to preserve its
technology lead.
</P>
<P>
The global dominance of the United States is not assured as it
faces "very tough competition," he said during an interview,
according to the Investor's Business Daily Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Regarding competition between Japan and the U.S., he said
whenever the basis of competition is innovation, the U.S. does
"very well," but when it's manufacturing sills, "usually Japan
wins."
</P>
<P>
"That may be true in the future as it has been in the past,
maybe not," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan had a detailed plan to dominate technology,
inventing in memory chips, high-definition television and
artificial intelligence, which it sees as unbeatable areas.
</P>
<P>
"Simply, Japan bet on the wrong horses," he charged.
</P>
<P>
Perry was concerned about the reduction of government funding
for technology as the defense budget, part of it allocated for
technology, has decreased in recent years.
</P>
<P>
An increase of the talent pool, enough capital, access to
international markets, a vital economy and a rise of the research
and development base are the issues that the U.S. must address to
preserve its technology lead, Perry said.

<P>
GENEVA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The four parties having talks on
the Korean Peninsula have agreed that the talks have now turned
from procedural matters into a phase of discussions on substantial
issues.
</P>
<P>
China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), South
Korea and the United States of America have also agreed to make
concerted efforts for further progress of the talks, Chen Jian,
assistant foreign minister of China, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the plenary meeting on the second day, Chen,
chairing the current round of the talks, said that it is necessary
to seek some organizational makeups to have deep discussions on
certain matters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese side will make positive efforts for
the talks to go on in a smooth way as long as they are in favor of
the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the ultimate
goal of the four-party talks: reaching consensus on a peace treaty
to replace an armistice signed in 1953 when the fighting on the
Korean Peninsula ended.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Chinese delegation said that China will play a
constructive role in helping establish a new peaceful mechanism at
an earliest date.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting Tuesday afternoon, China had bilateral
consultations with each of the other three delegations.
</P>
<P>
The other three delegations at the second plenary session of
the talks, launched in Geneva last December, are led by DPRK
Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan, South Korean Deputy Foreign
Minister Song Young-Shik, and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Stanley Roth.

<HEADLINE> World Oil Demand Growth Forecast to Fall </HEADLINE>

NEW YORK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- World oil demand is forecast to
reach 75.1 million barrels a day in 1998, representing an increase
of 1.6 million b/d from 1997, when the growth was 1.8 million
barrels b/d.
</P>
<P>
Citing the figures of the International Energy Agency, the U.S.
Journal of Commerce said Tuesday that the slowdown trend is due to
the Asian financial crisis.

Aside from China and India where growth in oil demand is
expected to remain strong, the rest of Asia is expected to see
little growth, the IEA was quoted as saying in its latest monthly
oil market report.

On the supply front the IEA said world crude production was
estimated at 76.7 million b/d in February, up 670,000 b/d from
January.
</P>
<P>
Non-OPEC oil supply last month was estimated at 45 million b/d,

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Cuts Short His Meeting With Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Banjamin
Netanyahu has cut short his meeting here Tuesday evening with
visiting British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook as planned,
Netanyahu's office said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu also decided not to host a dinner in
honor of Cook as formerly planned, the office added.
</P>
<P>
The office did not give the reason why Netanyahu has decided to
do so, but it is believed here that Netanyahu is apparently not
happy with Cook's outcome of talks with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat in Gaza and his
controversial visit to Har Homa earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Arafat, Cook told a press conference
that the European Union opposes Israel's policy of settlement
expansion in the occupied Palestinian territories, which is one
of the main reasons hindering the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to speed up its troop redeployment in the
West Bank and halt all settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Cook, as a representative of the European Union (EU), is on a
tour of the Middle East aimed at helping revive the peace
process. He has visited Egypt and Jordan before he came to the
Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel. He will also travel to
Syria and Lebanon. Britain is holding the rotating presidency of
the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cook's insistence on seeing for himself Har Homa angered
Israel, which warned that the visit might undermine EU's role in
mediating the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Cook's visit to Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem also caused
sharp reactions from the Israeli side, saying the visit could only
result in more conflicts between Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel broke ground for the construction of a Jewish settlement
on Har Homa a year ago, leading to a standstill in the peace talks
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel stated that Har Homa is part of Jerusalem and Jerusalem
is the capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Cook's visit to Har Homa, Nabil Shaath, PNA
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, said that
Cook's visit is a challenge to the Israeli government because it
had tried to convince him not to do so.
</P>
<P>
This is a clear refusal on the part of the Europeans and the
British refusing settlements on Har Homa in particular and
against the policy of settlements in general, Shaath said.

<HEADLINE> Annan's Visit to Enhance Mideast Peace: Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Tuesday expressed
confidence in the upcoming visit of United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan to the Middle East, saying it will give a
better chance to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has great confidence in the secretary general and his
mission as well as the role of the United Nations," Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters on the eve of Annan's
tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
"His visit to Egypt acquires a special importance with regard
to chances for reaching a peaceful settlement in the Middle East,"
Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to arrive in Cairo on Wednesday, starting his
nine-day trip, which will also take him to Syria, Lebanon, Israel,
the Palestinian self-rule areas and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to hold talks with Moussa and the Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Wednesday and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They will focus on the peace talks between the Palestinians,
Syrians and Lebanese, on the one hand, and the Israelis, on the
other, regional and international issues and the U.N. reform,
according to Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Moussa warned that if the Mideast peace process fails, it will
affect peace, security and stability in the area.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors have been in a
standstill for more than a year due to Israel's hardline policy
and Jewish settlement activities in the occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
"What concerns us is to support the role of the United Nations
to establish and preserve peace, particularly following the big
push which the U.N. received after Annan's successful mission in
Iraq," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
A deal Annan struck with Baghdad in February averted a possible
military strike against Iraq by the United States and paved the
way for unrestricted U.N. arms inspections of suspected Iraqi
sites.

</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said he is satisfied with the current relations
between Russia and Moldavia, which are stable enough for the two
countries to plan their cooperation for a 10-year span and "to
move ahead in the economic and political spheres."
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the complicated problem concerning
the settlement in the Dniester region. They agreed to hold a
meeting in the Black Sea port of Odessa on March 20 to discuss
specific details of the settlement process, the Russian premier
said.
</P>
<P>
The half-hour talks resulted in signing an agreement to
encourage and mutually protect capital investments, as well as a
joint statement on the economic cooperation program to be launched
in the near future, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Another report quoted the Moldavian prime minister as saying
that Moldavia is going to pay off its gas debt to Russia in cash
and exports of goods.
</P>
<P>
Ciubuc had talks on the gas debt with leaders of the Russian
gas giant Gazprom Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moldavia owes a total of 594 million dollars for natural gas
imports in 1996-1998, of which 159 million is a penalty for
delayed payment.
</P>
<P>
Of the debt the breakaway Dniester enclave accounts for 388
million dollars. The Dniester region paid some 14 percent of its
gas debt in 1994 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Stresses Importance of Girls' Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Education Genet Zewdie said on Tuesday that promoting education
of women will enhance the country's human resources capacity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting here on the importance of girls'
education in the country, Genet underlined that without the
empowerment of women, who constitute 50 percent of the nation's
labour force, development of the country's manpower resources is
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
She said that special attention should be paid to higher
enrollment of women in education so as to achieve the desired
goal in building up the nation's human resources.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that many Ethiopian women, particularly those
living in rural areas, have been denied their right to get access
to education due to social and cultural reasons. But she said
that the government has a plan to raise the enrollment rate of
women students at all levels of education to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, an extensive program has been launched
nationwide with an eye to raise the awareness of parents of the
importance of girls' education.
</P>
<P>
With regards to female teachers, the education minister said
that mechanisms have been drawn to make female teachers account
for at least 30 percent in every teachers' training institution.
</P>
<P>
Although Ethiopia implements a ten-year compulsory education
system across the country, the number of girls receiving
schooling is far less than that of boys, especially in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
A recent study shows that illiteracy rate of the female is
higher than that of the male in the surveyed regions in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in sampled areas of the northern rural Amhara,
61.1 percent of the male population are illiterate while 79.0
percent of the female are illiterate. In Gambella region, the
female illiterates are nearly 20 percent more than the male
illiterates. And the illiterate rates of the male and the female
in Afar region are 73.7 percent and 81.0 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> World Semiconductor Market Forecast to Grow 8.4 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide semiconductor revenue
is forecast to grow 8.4 percent to 148.7 billion U.S. dollars this
year, according to International Data Corporation of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
With memory revenue expected to rebound in 1999, the market
will return to double-digit growth rates, eventually reaching
272.4 billion dollars by 2002, IDC said in its newly published
Semiconductor Market Forecast and Review 1997-2002.
</P>
<P>
IDC revised its 1998 semiconductor market growth projection
from a mid-1997 estimate of 15.1 percent to the new level as it
sees a 9.7 percent decline this year in the memory market to 26.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the situation to "a lingering overcapacity" and
"uncertainty across every region" caused by waves sent by the
Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Japan is most of concern where a 4.8 percent market growth is
forecast, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
However, IDC believes that stable prices as a result of major
capacity cutbacks in combination with strong bit growth will drive
memory revenue up in 1999 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
IDC sees microprocessor segment as a bright spot for the
semiconductor market, expecting its revenue to expand 24.9 percent
to 29.3 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the regional semiconductor trends, IDC said the U.S. market
will reach revenues of 94.5 billion dollars in 2002, while
European consumption share will remain flat throughout the
forecast period.
</P>
<P>
Asia Pacific region will surpass Japan in revenue size by 1999,
it added.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Refuses to Budge on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Reacting angrily to British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's Har Homa visit, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday said Israel would never
accepts a redivision of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking alone to reporters following a tense meeting with
Cook, Netanyahu said Israel would never relinquish its sovereign
claim over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In protest of Cook's visit to Arab East Jerusalem's Har Homa,
where Israel is building a settlement, Netanyahu canceled a
scheduled dinner with the British minister.
</P>
<P>
"Israel will never ever accept the redivision of Jerusalem. We
will never build a Berlin Wall inside our city. This is our
eternal city for 3,000 years, we reunited it in a miraculous event
in 1967 ... we will never divide that city," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Israel took over East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East
war and then annexed it; the Palestinians want East Jerusalem as
the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that during their one-hour meeting at the Prime
Minister's Office he stressed the Israeli position to Cook, who is
touring the Middle East representing the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu claimed that Israel retains sovereignty over
Jerusalem before the final-status under the signed peace
agreements, and it would not give up its sovereignty even after
the permanent talks.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel welcomed all governments, including European
ones, to participate in advancing the peace process, provided that
they would not take "predetermined and prejudiced positions."
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to Cook's position of supporting
the Palestinian demand for a halt to Israeli settlement activities
in occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu added that he was waiting to welcome British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, who is expected to visit Israel next
month. He called Blair as "a friend of Israel, a statesman who
wants to move peace forward."
</P>
<P>
Cook's visit to Har Homa and meeting with Palestinian
officials in the Orient House, the de facto Palestinian National
Authority's office in East Jerusalem, were aimed at sending a
strong message to Israel that it must halt settlement expansion in
order to advance peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a separate news conference in a Jerusalem hotel,
Cook said that the international community has the "legitimate
concern" about Israel's settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Israel's start of constructing the Har Homa settlement one
year ago led to a stalemate in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and
remains a major obstacle to any progress in the renewed
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Demands Insurance Violations Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday ordered Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
to investigate reported violations of a 1996 law aimed at
guaranteeing health insurance to those who change jobs or lose
coverage.
</P>
<P>
At the Capitol to push his plan to extend Medicare coverage,
Clinton pointed to a new report showing that insurance companies
were finding ways to thwart the law authored by Senator Edward
Kennedy and former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We see that some insurers are finding ways
around that law, giving insurance agents incentives to delay or
deny coverage to vulnerable Americans. These practices have to be
stopped.... We intend to enforce it vigorously."
</P>
<P>
The report by the General Accounting Office (GAO), an
investigative arm of Congress, found that people who exercised
their rights under the law were often charged premiums far higher
than the standard rates. And the GAO said some companies
discouraged insurance agents from selling policies to people with
medical problems, the very people who were supposed to benefit
from the law.
</P>
<P>
The law was supposed to guarantee that people losing group
health insurance would have access to coverage in the individual
insurance market, regardless of pre-existing medical problems.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the government would also notify every insurer in
every state in the country that it is illegal for them to penalize
agents who sell policies to high-risk individuals.

<HEADLINE> Former Zairean Generals Allowed to Stay in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Three former Zairean
generals were granted leave in the Johannesburg High Court on
Tuesday to stay in South Africa until April 21.
</P>
<P>
Justice M. Joffe said that the generals, who have been living
in South Africa since May last year, had 10 days to apply for
political refugee status which would enable them to stay in the
country legally. And their application will be heard on April 21.
</P>
<P>
Former Zairean defense minister Admiral Mavua Mnoima, General
Kpama Baramoto and General Ngbate Nzinloi fled in May last year
to South Africa after former Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko
was ousted by the then rebel leader Laurent Kabila who is now
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The three generals were allegedly carrying diamonds and
millions of US dollars when they arrived in South Africa. They
are living in Johannesburg, but their exact whereabouts are not
known.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least 120 high-ranking officials of
the former Zairean regime headed by Mobutu are living in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Most of these Zaireans were senior officers or civil servants,
and 102 of them are on a "wanted" list issued by the Kabila
government in connection with the looting of state coffers.

<HEADLINE> Iran Vows to Control Its Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran is determined to control its
population growth through family planning and to keep the growth
rate at around 1.5 percent by the end the century.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Health Minister Ali Akbar Sayadi made the remarks
in an exclusive interview with Xinhua correspondent here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the importance of family planning programs, Sayadi
said, "we will see a sharp growth of our population in the coming
years, because 51 percent of our people are under 20 and only four
percent of the population are above 65."
</P>
<P>
The government's family planning programs enjoyed a "bright
success" during the recent years by bringing down the population
growth rate from 3 percent in 1950s to 1.4 in 1996, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that each Iranian couple had an average of five
children in 1992, but the number dropped to 2.5 in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran targeted its population in the year of 2022 at 90 million,
30 million more than the present number and it will try to bring
down the population growth rate to 0.5 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country started its family planning programs in the 1970s
before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, but the programs were
abandoned because of the revolution and the following Iran-Iraq
war (1980-88), he said.
</P>
<P>
After the war, the Iranian government found it difficult to
meet the demand of the growing population, he said, so the
government started its family planning programs in 1989 together
with the first five-year development plan (1989-1995).
</P>
<P>
Sayadi attributed the success in control the population growth
to the government planning, investments, free-charge services and
international cooperation. Economic difficulties also made people
to abandon the traditional views of having more children, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, more and more people voiced their readiness to
cooperate with the government in family planning, he said, adding
that at present 55 percent of Iranian women accept safe
contraceptives, compared with only 24 percent who agreed to use
them when the government began to carry out the programs.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the country still faces some difficulties in
implementing the programs, saying that one of the serious problems
is that Iranian men showed less interest than women in family
planning.
</P>
<P>
Sayadi termed low-level education of the people, low efficiency
of some government institutions and religious views as other
hurdles for family planning in the country.
</P>
<P>
Although late supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini agreed
with family planning, however, he said, so far no religious
authorities have officially announced family planning as legal.
</P>
<P>
The deputy health minister stressed that the government will
encourage the people to support family planning through education
and propagation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reiterated that abortion will not permitted in
Iran in the name of family planning, saying that abortion is not
acceptable from the Islamic view and it is not the right means for
population control.

<HEADLINE> UK Chancellor Unveils "New Ambitions for Britain" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) - British Chancellor Gordon Brown
Unveiled what he called 1998 "New Ambitions For Britain" budget
Tuesday aiming at boosting employment, rewarding families and
helping business.
</P>
<P>
Brown told House of Commons that the Budget is designed to link
four key elements of the Government's economic strategy:
</P>
<P>
-- Securing economic stability based on low inflation and
sound government finances for the long-term;
</P>
<P>
-- Encouraging work by extending the New Deal, making work pay,
providing child care support, tackling skill shortages and
promoting life-long learning;
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting enterprise through a range of tax reforms to boost
investment and small firms; and
</P>
<P>
-- Creating a fairer society, now and in the future.
</P>
<P>
In order to secure economic stability, the budget confirms
inflation target at 2.5 percent. But the Chancellor admitted that
the Government still needs to guard against risks to avoid return
to "boom and bust".
</P>
<P>
For the purpose of promoting long-term investment in British
economy, Brown said investors who hold assets for at least 10
years before selling them would pay capital gains tax of just 24
percent instead of 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor also said, alongside the move to quarterly
payments and the abolition of Advance Corporation tax main rate
cut for larger companies to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Business investment will also be boosted by confirmation of a
cut in corporation tax to 30 percent from 31 percent and a pledge
it will not rise for the rest of the five-year life of the current
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Brown promised that all families with a full-time worker would
be guaranteed income of 180 pounds a week, with no income tax
payable on incomes to 220 pounds a week.
</P>
<P>
"The budget... begins the task of modernizing not just taxation
but the entire tax and benefits system of our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
In creating a "fairer society", Brown said that the Government
will allocate an extra 500 million pounds (800 million US dollars)
for health next year and 250 million Pounds (400 million US
dollars) for education.
</P>
<P>
The Government will also spend 500 million pounds (800 million
US dollars) at public transport and cutting the annual road
license fee for the cleanest and smallest cars.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Budget, William Hague, leader of the
Conservative party, said: "There is a betrayal and a great deal of
disappointment for many people."
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) gave a broad
welcome overall to the Budget. It's Director-General, Adair
Turner, said: "We are encouraged by the overall fiscal balance and
the prudent approach to public spending... "

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Compromises for Peace on N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday urged key players in the Northern Ireland talks to make
tough compromises for peace.
</P>
<P>
"Concessions that today might seem hard to accept will seem so
much less important in the light of an accord that brings hope and
peace and an end to violence," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"No one will be the loser if agreement is reached," noted
Clinton at a ceremony to mark the St. Patrick's Day in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged all the parties involved in the Northern Ireland
peace process to demonstrate "by words and deeds" that they reject
violence.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was meeting with different parties which represent
pro-British Protestants and Catholics on the Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"I will say it as clearly and as emphatically as I possibly
can. This is the chance of a lifetime for peace in Ireland. You
must get it done," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Later, the president went to Capitol Hill to attend a St.
Patrick's Day luncheon. He was to end the day playing host to a
White House reception honoring the holiday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night Clinton met Gerry Adams, leader of the Sinn
Fein party, and Adam's chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he was impressed with Clinton's grasp of the
details. He said he believes prospects for a peace agreement are
good but he could not say that no more violence would mar the
process.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks began in June 1996 and are supposed to end in
May, hopefully with a plan of governance for Northern Ireland
acceptable to both its Protestant majority and the large Catholic
minority.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he is uncertain whether agreement can be reached by
May and he expects no breakthrough in Washington.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials recognize that any real progress will only come
at the Belfast talks and hope that the contacts in Washington will
help create more flexibility.

<HEADLINE> Cook Defends His Visit to Disputed Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook defended his visit to the controversial Har
Homa on Tuesday, saying Israel has no reason to overreact.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after a meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Cook said he intended to underline
that Israel's settlement activities in the occupied territories
undermine the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
European Union's attitude towards Israel's expansion of
settlements is in line with that of the United states, as
Washington as well asks Israel to halt such activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook, representing the European Union (EU), on Tuesday
afternoon visited Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem the Palestinians
want as their future capital. Britain is holding the rotating
presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Israel broke ground for the construction of a settlement on the
site a year ago. This led to a standstill in the peace talks
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accuse Israel of violating the signed
agreements, which they contend prohibit unilateral actions prior
to final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Displeased with Cook's insistence to visit Har Homa, Netanyahu
cut short their meeting and canceled a dinner in his honor in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
But Cook said he felt no sorry to lose a dinner, and that the
international community has a legitimate concern of Israel's
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Terming his meeting with Netanyahu as useful, Cook said the
Israeli prime minister told him that the EU has a role to play in
reviving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the day, the British top diplomat also held talks with
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, which he said focused
on Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said he would convey Israel's stance on the issue to
Lebanese and Syrian leaders when he travels to the two countries
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cook arrived here Tuesday for a one-day visit as part of his
regional tour aimed at helping reactivate the peace process. He
has visited Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian self-rule areas, and
will continue his trip from here to Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> EU Under Pressure to Carry Study on Duty-Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Ireland Tuesday won support for
its call for a study on the jobs impact of a decision by the
European Commission to end duty-free sales of goods in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ireland called for a report on the consequences of the
abolition planned by the European Union (EU)'s executive body at a
meeting of EU transport ministers in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Transport ministers from some eight other EU member states
voiced their support for such a report, which is also supposed to
probe into the effects on transport costs of the planned scrapping
of duty-free.
</P>
<P>
An Irish statement cited industry figures estimating between
30,000 to 50,000 job losses if the EU goes ahead and ends
duty-free sales.
</P>
<P>
Irish Minister for Public Enterprise, Mary O'Rourke, stressed
at Tuesday's meeting that the duty-free sector was important for
employment.
</P>
<P>
"The position is quite clear. The transport ministers would
like it to be studied and will communicate that to the finance
ministers," said British Transport Minister Gavin Strang.
</P>
<P>
The International Duty Free Confederation, a lobby group
representing the duty-free industry, said the transport ministers
had sent a "very strong message" to the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
However, the unanimous backing of the finance ministers of the
15 EU member countries is needed to reverse the decision by the
Commission to end duty-free sales of goods such as tobacco and
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
In addition, EU Tax Commissioner Mario Monti has said he sees
no need for such an impact study, adding that he would not bow to
pressure of the duty-free industry.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Fails to Meet Macroeconomic Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Few of the macroeconomic
targets set out by the South African government have been met,
South Africa Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
According to figures presented to parliament's Finance
Committee Tuesday by Finance Ministry director-general Maria
Ramos, the economic growth in 1997 was only 1.7 percent. The
target set out in the Growth, Employment and Redistribution
(GEAR) macroeconomic strategy was 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Real private investment rose just three percent instead of the
targeted 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficit was targeted at four percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP), but it came in at 4.3 percent. Real
government consumption went up to 21 percent of the GDP from the
targeted 19.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Formal non-agricultural sector employment was supposed to
increase by three percent, but declined by one percent instead.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that on the positive side, the real effective
exchange rate appreciated by one percent, instead of depreciating
by 0.3 percent, while real non-gold export growth was 9.3 percent
instead of the expected eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Other positive factors were that the annualized inflation was
8.6 percent instead of 9.7 percent, and the current account
deficit was 1.5 percent instead of two percent of the GDP.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Have High Expectations on New Cabinet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's paramount
power body said here today that they had opted for a compact but
more competent, pragmatic and energetic new cabinet, which they
believe will have a superb performance in advancing the country's
reform, opening-up and modernization drive at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC), the top legislature, in session here since early March,
today approved by ballotage a list of members of the State
Council, the Chinese cabinet, nominated by the newly-appointed
Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers share the view that the central government of a
new term shoulders great responsibilities and faces great
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Premier Zhu Rongji, the new cabinet consists of four
vice-premiers, five state councillors and 29 ministers. Records
show that among the ministers, 24 received university education,
eight are granted with senior technical titles, and five have had
experiences of studying or working overseas.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the new cabinet are educated better still than
their predecessors, and experienced with sound records of
administration," said Legislator Zhang Zhongli, 77, who has served
as an NPC deputy for four consecutive terms.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who is president of the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences, also praised these new cabinet members as "having clear
and wide vision and pioneering spirit" and "underlining practical
work".
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Lu Xueyi, a sociologist with the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, China's reforms have now entered a
critical stage in which some in-depth contradictions are required
to be resolved, while the country's economic and social growth
also needs to be further promoted.
</P>
<P>
"When the new central government makes a good start with a
competent and pragmatic image, it will surely win the people's
support and trust," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet, which has reduced its principal officials by
two vice-premiers, three state councillors and 11 ministers as
compared with the previous one, is the central government with the
fewest officials, since China launched its reform and opening-up
drive two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Apart from seven ministers in the previous cabinet who have
retained their posts, 17 of the 22 new ministers have been
promoted from among the former vice-ministers, and five others
were transferred from other units.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Have High Expectations on New Cabinet (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I'm very glad to see that the new cabinet has been formed in
strict compliance with the institutional restructuring plan, which
was submitted by the State Council to the current NPC session.
This represents the first step so far taken in downsizing
government institutions and changing their functions," said Deputy
Li Yukun, a prestigious artist from east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Qin Chijiang, secretary-general of the Chinese Monetary
Society, said the most urgent task for the Chinese government at
present is to go all out for institutional restructuring, and
reforming the banking sector and state-owned enterprises while
maintaining a steady and rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Qin and a number of other lawmakers said that they have faith
in the competence of the central government of a new term.
</P>
<P>
As the executive vice-premier in charge of economic work in the
previous cabinet, they noted, Zhu Rongji has managed the
macro-control over the national economy in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
It was also Zhu who advocated last year that China should
manage to bring its loss-making large and medium-sized state
enterprises out of troubles and initially set up a modern
financial system to gear to the growth of a market economy in
about three years, they underlined.
</P>
<P>
Among the vice-premiers, they said, Li Lanqing, Qian Qichen and
Wu Bangguo have all scored remarkable success in the fields they
have been assigned to during their tenure of office in the
previous government, while Wen Jiabao, who entered the central
government a dozen years ago, has long proven himself a pragmatic
and knowledgeable person.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers expressed the hope that the new central
government will strive for new progress in resolving problems with
the growing public concerns, such as improving the life of the
people in great need and public security and curbing the spread of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely arduous task for the new cabinet," said
Deputy Feng Qifu, commissioner of Luliang Prefecture in north
China's Shanxi Province, an outlying, backward mountainous region.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The French Formula One Grand Prix
is back on this season's calendar, announced the sports ruling
body FIA on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
FIA had removed the race out of this year's programme because
of a long simmering dispute over television rights.
</P>
<P>
Under French law it had been illegal for sporting events to be
sold exclusively to one channel. But last month the French
parliament adopted a new sports bill allowing sporting
organisations to sell exclusive rights.
</P>
<P>
This year's French Formula One Grand Prix will be held on June
28.

BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Hunters and Chinese Army
Rockets beat their respective semi-final rivals on Wednesday to
set up a showdown for the title of the Chinese Basketball Division
A League.
</P>
<P>
The Hunters, who upset Shandong Flaming Bulls 70-63 in the
first leg, prevailed 70-62 on the road in the second of the
best-of-three semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The Flaming Bulls, who finished second in the regular season,
appeared too nervous to breach the well-knit defence of the
visitors, trailing 29-41 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The hosts, cheered by a sell-out crowd of 5,000, stepped up the
attacks after the break and managed to close the gap to one point.
</P>
<P>
But the Hunters, runners-up of last season, snapped the fierce
rally in time on two three pointers by point guard Li Xiaoyong,
who finally ended up with a game-high 28 points.
</P>
<P>
In Chongqing, defending champions Rockets fought back from a
first half 34-44 behind to rout the visiting Beijing Ducks
82-57.

Military science research consists of basic research and
application research, which are closely related and support each
other, said Jiang, adding that the research should focus on
problems of realistic significance while strengthening basic
studies.
</P>
<P>
The quality of the military science research depends on the
quality of the researchers, Jiang said, stressing that the
training of skilled professionals in the field should be given
strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said military science is a comprehensive subject, which
involves social sciences, natural sciences and many other
fields. The building of the research force should be based on
skilled professionals who have a solid theoretical basis of
Marxism and a wide-ranging knowledge of politics, economy,
military, history and, especially, high-technology. They should
have rich practical army experience, he said, as well as devotion
and rigorous scientific approaches.
</P>
<P>
Jiang sent warm greetings and congratulations to all
researchers of the academy on behalf of the CPC Central Committee
and the Central Military Commission, extending high tribute to
elder officers and researchers who had made great contributions to
the nation's military science research cause.

<HEADLINE> Industrialization, Second Leap in China's Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China's rural economy is
beginning to experience its second leap forward -- the
industrialization of agriculture, according to deputies from some
grain growing areas to the Ninth National People's Congress, in
session here since early March.
</P>
<P>
The first leap forward is known as the household contract
responsibility system, or household-based farming, introduced two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The aim of promoting the industrialization of agriculture is to
raise the efficiency of agriculture and enable farmers to get more
added value from the processing and marketing of their farm
produce, according to Qi Jingfa, a vice-minister of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The central government has since 1996 spent 177 million yuan
building the first group of 22 projects for agricultural
industrialization in 12 provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, 10 ministries jointly designated 59 pilot
areas for experimenting with agricultural industrialization, which
are expected to be completed in three years.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have realized that they should not only immerse
themselves in production but also keep an eye on a changing market
for what they produce, said He Chengguo, mayor of Chuzhou, Anhui
province, where household-based farming was first introduced.
</P>
<P>
Industrialization of agriculture makes it possible to break
down barriers between rural and urban areas, promote the interflow
of labor and optimize rural production structures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ye Liansong, governor of north China's Hebei Province, said the
key to upgrading the rural production structure is to develop key
processing enterprises and intermediate organizations.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Hebei have made much progress in this direction,
according to the governor. They have, for example, set up more
than 10,000 associations specializing in the cultivation,
transportation and selling of farm products such as cotton, water
melons and vegetables.

KUWAIT CITY, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Brazil on

worldwide, he added.

SHANGHAI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft, the leading
U.S. software producer, signed a cooperation agreement with the
Shanghai municipal government today to set up hundreds of

</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the training centers will step up the

<P>
An official with the Ministry of Railways said that this is the
start of a new freight-carrying system instead of linking package
cabins with passenger trains.
</P>
<P>
It takes only 36 hours for the freight train from Guangzhou to
Beijing, 20 to 30 hours faster than automobiles, and the price is
cheaper, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Some 283 such trains are expected to be in operation before
2000.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Manned Spacecraft By Chen Jie and Li Xiguang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China will launch a manned
spacecraft including a lunar explorer in the near future, a
leading Chinese space scientist said here today.
</P>
<P>
"China is striving to make breakthroughs in manned space flight
technology at the end of this century or the beginning of the next
century, and will launch small lunar explorer when possible," Ma
Xingrui, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Space Technology
(CAST) told an international meeting of space scientists here today.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the CAST, the country's satellite and
spacecraft developing and manufacturing center, Ma disclosed
China's new space program which includes:
</P>
<P>
-- Developing communication satellites of large-capacity,
high-power and long-life to provide direct broadcast, mobile
communication and multi-media communication;
</P>
<P>
-- To develop environmental resources satellites and ocean
satellites. China plans to develop new remote sensor and expand
remote sensing spectrums based on Zi Yuan-1 satellite and develop
ocean satellites;
</P>
<P>
-- To further utilize and improve recoverable satellite to
explore space microgravity rescues. China will use recoverable
satellites continuously to conduct life science experiments and
material processing research under microgravity environment;
</P>
<P>
-- To provide piggyback services for customers throughout the world;
</P>
<P>
-- To develop other spacecrafts on the basis of recoverable
satellite technology;
</P>
<P>
-- To develop small and low-cost satellites to meet the
requirements of space exploration and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal for space exploration is to set up several application
satellite systems which are badly needed by national economy and
can operate stably for a long term," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to achieve this purpose, China must keep certain
satellites in orbit by prolonging the operating life of orbital
satellites as much as possible and launching replacement satellite
in time before the orbital satellites come to its end, so as to
ensure the continuity of satellite application.
</P>
<P>
"China will also develop new satellites and some new types of
other spacecrafts to meet the demands of domestic users and try to
make contribution to the development of world's economy, science
and technology," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will put priority on satellite payload
technology, and sophisticate satellite platform technology.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the China Aerospace Corporation (CASC),
has established complete systems for research, design,
development, production and testing in various space products such
as launch vehicles and space craft.
</P>
<P>
The corporation, with nearly 10,000 research scientists has
ranked itself among the world's leading space industries in some
of the main areas in space technology, including satellite
recovery, launching multiple payloads with one rocket, launching
geostationary orbit satellite. It has also developed the strategic
missile systems.
</P>
<P>
The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, with a staff of
27,000 researchers and engineers, has developed the Long March
Vehicle Family which has successfully placed more than 40 Chinese
and international satellites into orbit, bringing China's launch
vehicle technology to the world's advanced level.
</P>
<P>
China's space scientists have entered collaboration with their
counterparts in the United States, Japan, Canada and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Space scientists from the US, Japan and Europe are expected to
discuss the latest space technology and international cooperation
in the 21st century with the Chinese researchers during the
three-day conference.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Spindles Destroyed in Zhejiang Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DINGHAI (ZHEJIANG), March 18 (Xinhua) -- After eight hammers
wrapped in red silk swooped down, 10,000 old spindles were
destroyed at Zhoushan Island in East China's Zhejiang Province
today in the continuing national campaign to shrink the textile
industry.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry has been plagued by overproduction and
chronic inefficiency in recent years. The industry is taking
severe steps to cut down its bloated scale.
</P>
<P>
Ye Rongbao, deputy governor of Zhejiang, said that both the
provincial government and the province's textile firms support the
central government's decision and will proceed with spindle
reduction.
</P>
<P>
Ye, who witnessed today's destruction of the spindles, said the
province has destroyed 250,000 old spindles in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
Su Weiping, an official of the Zhoushan Cotton Mill, claimed
that the pain of losing these spindles will only be temporary
because the company's future development depends on a structural
readjustment in the textile industry.
</P>
<P>
The shattered pieces of the spindles were promptly loaded on
five trucks to be carried away and melted.
</P>
<P>
The whole process was closely scrutinized by an official with
the China National Textile Council.
</P>
<P>
Ma Haijian, factory director of Zhoushan Cotton Mill, received
a 1.5 million yuan check from a representative of the provincial
government as compensation for destroying the spindles.
</P>
<P>
The CNTC official said that another 1.5 million yuan will be
allocated to the mill by the central government.
</P>
<P>
The mill will also obtain two million yuan in low-interest
loans.
</P>
<P>
China plans to reduce 4.8 million outmoded spindles this
year. Since February, more than 220,000 spindles have been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
CNTC had ruled that every mill must have its spindle reduction
completely scrutinized, starting from application to the actual
hammering and melting.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-March, the CNTC has sent more than 30 inspection
teams to localities to supervise specific implementation of the
spindle reduction and compensation policy.

<HEADLINE> HK Legislators Approve Budget for 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Provisional legislators
approved the first full budget of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) for 1998-99 here Wednesday, which is
described as a balanced plan in the time of economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
The budget, presented to the 60-seat Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) by Financial Secretary of the SAR government Donald
Tsang a month ago, was adopted by the legislature at its full
session Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also approved two other bills -- the Merchant
Shipping (Registration) (Amendment) Bill 1998 and the Building
Management (Amendment) Bill 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the legislators, Tsang said: "I am grateful to
the members of the PLC for welcoming the budget proposals and
responding generously to them in the debate."
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, the total expenditure for the new financial
year will amount to 248 billion HK dollars (32 billion
U.S. dollars) and the figure is equal to the government spending
of 233 billion HK dollars (30 billion U.S. dollars) plus 15.2
billion HK dollars (2 billion U.S. dollars) outlays from the
Capital Investment Fund.
</P>
<P>
The total revenue for 1998-99 is estimated at 247 billion HK
dollars (31.6 billion U.S. dollars). With 11.7 billion HK dollars
(1.5 billion U.S. dollars) worth of land fund added, the fiscal
reserves in the new financial year will stand at 10.7 billion HK
dollars (1.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budget also plans a six-percent increase in duties on
tobacco, fuels and methyl alcohol.
</P>
<P>
"The surplus forecast for 1998-99 is prudent" and "the budget
is essentially a balanced one," the financial secretary said,
predicting a 3.5-percent growth in the SAR's Gross Domestic
Product in the new financial year, which starts from April 1, 1998
 and ends on March 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Delivers Speech on Military Science (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China's military science research
should develop more rapidly to meet the demands of an
ever-changing situation, Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who is
also general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's remarks came while attending the celebration of the 40th
anniversary of the founding of the Military Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
China's national defense and army modernization drive have
entered into a crucial cross-century stage, he said, emphasizing
that military research should adhere to the guidance of Mao Zedong
and Deng Xiaoping's military thoughts, adapting to the development
of world military trends, and making a greater contribution to the
country's military modernization drive, said Jiang, who also is
chairman of the Central Military Commission of China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that over the last four decades researchers of the
academy have compiled a large number of military works, translated
and published foreign military works, and provided the Central
Military Commission with many valuable research reports and
consultations which have played an important role in pushing the
cause of China's national defense and helping build the army.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the principles of people's army and people's war in
Mao Zedong's and Deng Xiaoping's military thoughts will have
long-term guiding significance for the army. Military science
research will deviate from the correct course without the guidance
of the principles, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Launches Pilot Scheme for Fixed Rate Mortgages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Mortgage
Corporation (HKMC) signed an agreement with two commercial banks
Wednesday to launch a pilot scheme for promoting fixed rate
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
Under the six-month scheme, the two participating banks, Chase
Manhattan Bank and Dao Heng Bank, will offer home buyers mortgage
loans at a fixed rate of 10.5 percent for the first three years.
The HKMC agreed to purchase from each of the two banks eligible
fixed rate mortgages up to 250 million HK dollars (32 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's signing ceremony, Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang, who chaired the board of the HKMC, said: "Today is a very
big day for us in mortgage financing in Hong Kong. Fixed rate
mortgage products will bring significant benefits to Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong home buyers now have an additional choice of mortgage
arrangement which can protect them from adverse movements in
interest rates, said the official. The participating banks will
also add a source of steady fee income from providing fixed rate
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
If the pilot scheme is successful, the HKMC may appoint more
participating banks and increase the amount available for fixed
rate loans, sources from the HKMC said.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Official Calls for Free Trade Area by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The 2nd SAARC (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) Economic Cooperation
Conference opened here Wednesday with a call for achieving a
regional free trade area by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session of the conference, Kantikumar
R. Pondar, president of the Chamber of Commerce of SAARC, called
for taking immediate steps for the transition from the South Asian
Preferential Trade Arrangement (SAPTA) to the proposed South Asian
Free Trade Area (SAFTA).
</P>
<P>
He called for achieving this goal by 2001 as proposed not only
to reaffirm "our faith and confidence in SAARC, but also to keep
up our image and reputation vis-a-vis the various international
organizations and regional economic groupings who are watching us
with considerable interest."
</P>
<P>
Pondar said that first of all it is imperative to sign an
inter-governmental agreement on SAFTA between SAARC countries.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said that to realize SAARC free trade, it is
necessary to ensure that a non-discriminatory approach is followed
by all the countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
Pondar said it may be worthwhile to consider across the board
the tariff reduction of commodities which may be retained by SAARC
members due to security or other considerations.
</P>
<P>
This would be an appropriate step since the countries are
already committed to zero or minimum tariffs by 2001, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pondar also emphasized facilitation of communication linkages
to meet the requirement of expanding trade and commerce between
SAARC countries.
</P>
<P>
"The flow of goods and services in SAARC is currently
constrained by a tremendous lack of infrastructure and
communication linkages between our countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Pondar said the SAARC members have extremely limited border
posts for rail and road movement. Shipping and air links are also
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
He called for signing regional agreements to facilitate traffic
by road, railway, port and air.
</P>
<P>
Pondar hoped that a regional agreement for investment promotion
and protection be in place soon to facilitate the setting up of
joint ventures in potential areas like textile, tourism, energy,
telecommunications, jute, tea, rubber, engineering goods and
automobiles.

SEOUL, March 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Wednesday urged Japan
to apologize for atrocities committed in World War II against
comfort women, or sex slaves, and to shoulder responsibility for
them.
</P>
<P>
"The Korean people will respect the Japanese if Japan
acknowledges the atrocities committed against comfort women,"
Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Park Chung-soo said here in an

</P>
<P>
The comfort women were those who were forced to sexually serve
Japanese soldiers during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Japan should compensate these women, said Park Chug-soo.
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, South Koreans have frequently
demonstrated in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, appealing
for an apology and compensation.
</P>
<P>
The total number of survivors from sex slavery registered in
eight countries stands at 22,280, according to the Korean Council
for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery, which got the

ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee for
the Red Cross (ICRC) has withdrawn its 19 relief workers from the
major northern Afghan town of Mazar-e-Sharif, a report reaching
here Wednesday from Kabul said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to pull out the relief workers was taken after the
latest fierce fighting in Mazar-e-Sharif between the two factions
of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Although a cease-fire came into force on Monday, reports of
sporadic firing are still coming in from the town, which is also
the headquarters of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report quoted a representative of the Northern
Alliance as saying the alliance is holding a meeting in
Mazar-e-Sharif to discuss ways for ending infighting within the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting broke out last weekend between the security
units of Jumbish-e-Milli led by Uzbek leader General Abdul Rashid
Dostum and forces of the Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat representative,
Ustad Muhaqiq. Dozens of people are reported to have been killed
in the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Karachi Stock Exchange Index Further Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE) 100-Index dropped slightly Wednesday by 6.06 points to close
at 1520.26 against Tuesday's 1526.32.
</P>
<P>
A total of 70 million shares were traded on Wednesday against
65.05 million shares traded previous day.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the further dropping of KSE 100-Index was
in response to political uncertainty in Sindh Province with
brokers fearing that the main political party, Mutahhida qaumi
Movement (MQM), may break its alliance with the ruling Pakistan
Muslim League (N) in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The MQM party has given a 48-hour ultimatum to the government
on Tuesday evening to solve the outstanding differences, otherwise
they would break away from their coalition alliance with the
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warn that a break-up between the MQM and the ruling
party may affect Karachi's fragile law and order situation.
</P>
<P>
There are expectations that the stock market will continue its
slide on Thursday since there is little buying. Some brokers
predict, however, that the KSE 100-Index will go up a few points
in the week before leveling off at the 1600 level.

sent on to the EU's energy ministers for review.
</P>
<P>
The report, regarded as the first step towards a proposal for
an EU directive on this topic, emphasizes the Commission's view
that there is a need for common EU-wide rules on renewable sources
of energy such as solar, wave and wind power within a
competition-based system.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body says that such a system will have clear
advantages in terms of cost effectiveness, trade and the quick
development of renewables. It will, in turn, result in the
strengthening of the technological leadership enjoyed by EU
industry in this field.
</P>
<P>
The report argues that renewables will need support because it
will continue to be generally more expensive to produce than
energy from conventional fuels.
</P>
<P>
The EU member states are now reportedly designing their own
schemes for the support of renewables, to include tax breaks,
levies, "green" licences and guaranteed prices as well as
assessments of the compatibility of these schemes with EU law.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to make rapid progress in this area. Renewable
energies represent a cornerstone in the Union's strategy for
reaching the Kyoto targets," said Mr. Papoutsis.
</P>
<P>
He also said that renewable sources of energy would promote job
creation in a "promising sector" and maintain the EU's leadership
in this field.

<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Rangers midfielder Paul Gascoigne
escaped punishment on Wednesday when he was given a "severe
warning" for his flute-playing geture to Celtic fans.
</P>
<P>
But the Scottish Football Association (SFA) decided not to fine
or ban him as he was heavily fined by his club.
</P>
<P>
Celtic had written to the SFA complaining about Gascoigne's
actions and asked them to investigate.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne's gesture at Celtic's Parkhead stadium on January 2
sparked an official complaint from Celtic and was widely
criticised.
</P>
<P>
The gesture is seen as highly provocative in a city where
football fans are divided largely on sectarian grounds.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia to Supply More Electricity to Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The supply of electric power from
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Beijing is expected to rise
considerably, so that power shortage in the Chinese capital will
be eased and the quality of its environment improved.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of power transmission to Beijing will reach two
million kw by the year 2000 on the current basis of 900,000 kw,
according to Liu Mingzu, chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Regional Government, who is currently attending the annual session
of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
While working out its program for trans-century development,
Liu noted, Inner Mongolia has decided to turn its advantage in
coal resources into an economic edge.
</P>
<P>
The West Power Grid of Inner Mongolia, within the easy reach of
Beijing, is designed to have a generating capacity of 3.28 million
kw, and the capacity will reach 6.54 million kw by 2000.
</P>
<P>
After coping with local demands, more than three million kw
will be transferred to power grids in north China, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
When Beijing residents suffered rare, sustained hot summer
weathers last year, the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Power Grid of the
North China Power Administration cut its power supply to some
other places in an effort to help guarantee the adequate supply of
electricity in the capital.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Quality of Cadres, A  Decisive Factor (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing First Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, has
completed the process of examining and deliberating on a number of
work reports submitted by the State Council and departments under
it and shifted its emphasis onto the choice of new government
leaders.
</P>
<P>
By now, people are fully aware of the importance of having
competent cadres -- an issue underlined time and again by top
leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
This is not because new problems have occurred among the ranks
of cadres but because a new situation in the country requires more
competent cadres.
</P>
<P>
Mao Zedong, the late CPC chairman and founder of New China, had
a well-known saying: once policies and strategies have been
determined, cadres are the decisive factor. Many deputies to the
NPC share the view that Mao's idea in this regard is still of
great significance for the China of today.
</P>
<P>
China's cross-century development program has taken clear shape
during the period from the convening of the 15th CPC National
Congress to the current NPC session. Specific measure have also
been worked out to resolve problems that have cropped up in the
course of reform and development.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, leaders of central government departments for a new
term of office have been chosen following the formation of a
collective leadership of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
At a time when policies have been formulated and the lineup of
leaders determined, to raise the quality of cadres becomes a
pressing task.
</P>
<P>
Whether the principles and policies of the Party and government
can be implemented smoothly and how fast development in all fields
can be hinge on the role of cadres at all levels.
</P>
<P>
At the present stage, it can be said with certainty that the
overall quality of cadres at all levels falls short of what their
country requires in its march toward the next century with
ambitious economic development goals to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
This is an issue raised by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of
the CPC Central Committee, years ago and listed on the agenda of
the 14th CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that an increasing number of people will pay
close attention to this issue in a changing situation.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Quality of Cadres, A Decisive Factor (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many NPC deputies hold the view that qualified cadres should
first of all grasp Marxism-Leninism, especially Deng Xiaoping
Theory. This is because Deng Xiaoping Theory has served as the
guiding principle for China's two-decade-long reforms and opening
up to the outside world. It is also because the country's
prevailing policies are all based on this theory.
</P>
<P>
In the last couple of years, leaders at the top level have
stressed the importance of having a correct political orientation
and urged cadres to keep the country's overall interests in mind.
It is a basic requirement for cadres at all levels to follow
unswervingly the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core.
</P>
<P>
This is understandable since, if cadres at all levels fail to
take the overall interests of the nation into consideration or
lack a firm political faith, or do not match their deeds with what
they say, it would be difficult to push ahead with reforms and
continued implementation of the open policy in China, a vast
country with a huge population, at a critical period for its
development.
</P>
<P>
Without doubt, cadres should also have knowledge, especially
that in the fields of science and technology, and market
economics. Otherwise, they would find it difficult to deal with
complex situations and new problems.
</P>
<P>
Another issue of top concern among NPC deputies is cadres' work
style and state of mind. Cadres at all levels should maintain the
Party's fine tradition of "serving the people wholeheartedly" and
never depart themselves from the masses. Moreover, they are not
allowed to abuse their power to seek personal gains.
</P>
<P>
Deputies also urge cadres at all levels to work in a pioneering
spirit because China is now taking a road that has not been
traveled before within and outside China.
</P>
<P>
It can be predicted that the training of competent cadres is
abound to be placed once again on the agenda of the Party and
government after the conclusion of the Ninth NPC First Session.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Financial Institutions Expected to Enter S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Foreign financial institutions are
expected to enter South Korea in the second half of this year to
buy local banks, a South Korean organization said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local banks will be primary targets of foreign financial
institutions when conditions for business operation are ripe, the
Samsung Economic Research Institute said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report listed Seoul Bank and Korea First Bank as the top
targets, which are under preparation for sale, as are other small
ailing banks.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that all listed banks can easily recover normal
operations by improving management and rationalizing financial
operations, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
12 commercial banks have been closed while another 23 will be
examined subject to stringent rehabilitation criteria set by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Under the criteria, the 23 banks will have to raise their
capital adequacy ratio to more than four percent by the end of
this month, six percent by July and eight percent by June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks, which fail to meet the criteria, will either
be closed or forced to merge.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once an exuberant economic powerhouse in the
world, has been plagued by the economic crisis since late last
year and needs foreign capital to revitalize its economy.

<HEADLINE> Gates: Microsoft Investment Unaffected by Asian Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Bill Gates said here Wednesday that his
company's investments in the region will not be affected by the
economic turmoil as they are long-term in nature.
</P>
<P>
"We do everything on a long-term basis and the investments we
are making in the region are not changed by the turmoil and
economic crisis," he told a press conference after meeting
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Gates, who is on a one-day visit here as part of a regional
trip which also covers Australia, Singapore and the Philippines,
also had "very productive" meetings with other Malaysian cabinet
members and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
He said issues discussed in the meetings included opportunities
for Microsoft in Malaysia, development of Malaysia's Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC), education and the world market.
</P>
<P>
Gates expressed Microsoft's commitment to expanding the staff
strength of its operation in Malaysia, where the company has its
regional headquarters.
</P>
<P>
On Microsoft's participation in the MSC project, Gates, who is
the MSC's international advisory panel member, said: "I am a big
supporter of the basic concept driving the infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
The MSC, a 750 square kilometer zone located south of Kuala
Lumpur, is designated as the hub for development of multimedia
products and services in the country.
</P>
<P>
Gates said his visit here is meant to identify the roles
Microsoft can play in the MSC and his company is committed to
increasing the amount of things it does in the project.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Microsoft said in a statement that the company would
invest close to 1 million ringgit (about 272,479 U.S. dollars) in
developing and nurturing young Malaysian software programming
talent.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Refugees in Netherlands to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government set up a
special office Wednesday to help the country's over 300 refugees
in the Netherlands return home.
</P>
<P>
The refugees fled to Holland at the end of 1992 when the civil
war broke out again. However, their request for refuge was denied
by the Dutch government.
</P>
<P>
After bilateral consultations, the two governments signed a
cooperation deal in September 1997, which prescribes the
establishment of the refugee assistance office.
</P>
<P>
The office, under the agreement, is aimed at enhancing the
voluntary return of Angolan refugees, which will start from May
this year, with the Angolan government providing legal documents
necessary for their return, and the Dutch side offering financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The office will also help build facilities for the settlement
of the refugees and their employment, to ensure a secured living.
The returnees will have access to applying for bank loans to be
self-employed or join other collective ventures.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations statistics show that a total of three
million Angolans were reduced to refugees during the
two-decade-long civil war, 700,000 of which are staying in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Although a cease fire was announced in 1994, the national
economy has been seriously damaged, which still poses difficulty
for the return of refugees from abroad.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Archaeological Team Excavating Imperial Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Japanese team of
archaeologists will uncover the secrets of the rear palace, where
imperial concubines lived during the Western Han Dynasty (206
BC-24 AD), in the Guigong Palace Complex on the southern part of
the Western Han capital, in Chang'an.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of
Archaeology and the Nara National Cultural Properties Research
Institute announced today that they have begun the excavation work.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that the palace complex, which was
built by the Han emperor, Wudi, was famous for its architecture
and treasures. One of the buildings, the Mingguang Hall, was
decorated with gold, jade, and pearls that gave it a brightness at
night.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists have so far unearthed the foundation of a
2,700-sq.m. hall.
</P>
<P>
The Chang'an site is located to the northwest of the city of
Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, on 36 sq.km. of ground, an
area that is 50 times the size of Beijing's Forbidden City, where
the emperors of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911)
dynasties lived.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have been working on the city site since
the 1950s and have covered part of the city gates, the imperial
ancestral temple, central government buildings, and workshops.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, in government building remains they found more than
50,000 inscribed bone slips that are considered central government
archives.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists say that Chang'an was very nearly square and
had 12 gates, each of which had three portals allowing four carts
to pass at the same time.
</P>
<P>
An advanced water supply and drainage system was found in the
city which had well-planned streets, the longest of which
stretched for 5,500 m.
</P>
<P>
The imperial palaces were located in the southern part of the
city and include the Weiyang, Changle, Guigong, Beigong, and
Mingguang complexes.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say that the emperors lived in the Weiyang, their
mothers lived in the Changle, and their concubines in the other
three.

</P>
<P>
He called on candidates intending to join the race to hand in
nomination forms without delay.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cyclists Eyes More Gold Medals in Bangkok Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese sports official said
here on Wednesday that the chief aim of the Chinese cyclists this
year is to win more gold medals at the 13th Asian Games scheduled
on December in Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"This year's goal is to collect more gold medals in Bangkok
than those we won in Hiroshima Asiad in 1994," said Cai Jiadong,
president of the Chinese Cycling Association. "But in a long run,
we should seek a breakthrough in the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
Chinese cyclists claimed three gold medals, four silvers and
four bronzes but they have never won an Olympic medal in history.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 gold medals will be awarded in the Bangkok Asian
Games and 18 golds on stake in Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, our female cyclists enjoy an upper hand in
Asia. And several riders have had the calibre to win medals in
Olympics. But the male are still lagging far behind even in
Asia," Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Some 65 riders have gathered in the national training camp
since last December. They will take part in the trial competition
held later this year for qualifying for the Bangkok Asain Games.

</P>
<P>
Air France will have two flights a week until September, when
it will add a third. Its Paris-Beijing flight will also be
increased from the current four flights to five a week in

</P>
<P>
Air France, whose aircraft flew between Shanghai and Paris

<HEADLINE> Pak PM: Peace, Stability Key to Growth in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Wednesday stressed the need for creating an environment of
peace and stability in South Asia for economic development and
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that peace and security are key to the
economic development of the region," Sharif said while
inaugurating the Second Economic Cooperation Conference of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) here
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference is attended by government officials and
delegates of chambers of commerce and industry of SAARC member
countries, which include Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said Pakistan is firmly committed to the ideal of a
friendly and cooperative South Asia engaged in mutually beneficial
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
"We are equally committed to the liberalization of trade in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization process has to be accompanied by parallel
efforts to remove non-tariff barriers and hidden subsidies that
impede and distort trade, deny a level playing field, undermine
mutuality of interest and prevent transparency, he said.
</P>
<P>
As long as these barriers plague the commercial environment,
the aims of the South Asian Preferential Trading Agreement (SAPTA)
and South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) cannot be realized,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other regions of the world, Sharif noted, "our
region is lagging behind in economic development."
</P>
<P>
Trading activity, a good indicator of economic dynamism, is
sadly not keeping pace with global trends, he said.
</P>
<P>
Representing one-fifth of the world population, he said, SAARC
member states have a dismal 1 percent share of the global trade.
Even the intra-regional trade is as low as 3 percent of the total
trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an estimated half billion people in South Asia are
still living in poverty with income and consumption levels below
nationally defined poverty lines and hunger, malnutrition and
illiteracy are rampant, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government and private enterprises have to
work together to face these challenges.
</P>
<P>
"We need to universalize prosperity and eradicate poverty. What
is needed is a strong and mutual trust between the government and
business in order to put society on the path of sustainable
economic development," Sharif said.

<HEADLINE> HK Legislators Approve Budget for 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Provisional legislators today
approved the first full budget of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) for 1998-1999, which is described as
a balanced plan in the time of economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
The budget, presented to the 60-seat Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) by Financial Secretary of the SAR government Donald
Tsang a month ago, was adopted by the legislature at its full
session Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, the total expenditure for the new financial
year will amount to 248 billion HK dollars (32 billion U.S.
dollars) and the figure is equal to the government spending of 233
billion HK dollars (30 billion U.S. dollars) plus 15.2 billion HK
dollars (2 billion U.S. dollars) outlays from the Capital
Investment Fund.
</P>
<P>
The total revenue for 1998-1999 is estimated at 247 billion HK
dollars (31.6 billion U.S. dollars). With 11.7 billion HK dollars
(1.5 billion U.S. dollars) worth of land fund added, the fiscal
reserves in the new financial year will stand at 10.7 billion HK
dollars (1.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Noting that the lawmakers had not made any change to the budget
in the past month, Tsang reiterated: "The surplus forecast for
1998-1999 is prudent" and "the budget is essentially a balanced
one."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the SAR government has adhered to its prudent
fiscal policy and has observed the relevant provision of the Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that the SAR shall follow the
principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in
drawing up its budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal balance,
avoid deficit and keep the budget commensurate with the growth
rate of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The new financial year starts from April 1, 1998 and ends on
March 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Macao Paper Applauds China's New Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The third generation of China's
leadership is time-tested as politically mature, capable, and
trustworthy, a leading Macao newspaper said in a commentary on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News said the new leadership elected at the
on-going session of the 9th National People's Congress (NPC)
enjoys a high prestige among the Chinese people as they have scored
outstanding achievements in their official careers, and won the
heart of the people.
</P>
<P>
The NPC session in Beijing has elected Jiang Zemin China's
president, Li Peng chairman of the Standing Committee of the 9th
NPC, and Zhu Rongji premier of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"Time has proven that the third generation leadership with
Jiang Zemin at the core is politically mature, capable, and
trustworthy to the Chinese people," the newspaper said. "Its
members' renewal or transfer to their new positions will guarantee
the continuity of national policy and the effective operation of
the government."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Macao members of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and
chiefs of local communities also spoke highly of the new
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, who was re-elected vice-chairman of the CPPCC
National Committee, said on Tuesday night after returning from
Beijing that the new leadership "commands popular support", and
"accords with the aspirations of the people."
</P>
<P>
"The minute-long applause at the session (when the new
leadership was elected) indicates they enjoy a high prestige and
are trusted by the Chinese people," Ma said. "I am very delighted
and have composed a poem for the new leadership."
</P>
<P>
Some other CPPCC members and chiefs of local communities said
the new leadership will "lead China into the 21st century
successfully."
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, all Macao newspapers have given
prominence to the NPC and CPPCC sessions in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Hanoi Calls For More Assistance From Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam called on developed
countries on Wednesday to provide more assistance to countries in
the Southeast Asian region so as to enable these countries to get
rid of the current financial crisis soon.
</P>
<P>
"We call on developed countries, international financial and
monetary institutions to provide more their responsible assistance
so that the countries in the region can soon get out of the
crisis," visiting Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong said at the
state banquet given in his honor by Singapore President Ong Teng
Cheong.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese leader said that the finance and currency crisis
had "very negative effects on many countries in the region,"
which, he stressed, required efforts for surmounting this
difficult challenge.
</P>
<P>
"We share with the affected countries the difficulties and
challenges and at the same time try to follow closely the
situation in order to draw necessary experiences," Tran Duc Luong
said.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese President, who arrived here Wednesday afternoon
on a three-day state visit, also said that Vietnam will continue
to "consistently pursue the foreign policy of independence,
sovereignty, openness, multilateralization and diversification,
actively integrating itself into the region and the world."
</P>
<P>
"The priority is given to the development of relationship with
regional and neighboring countries," he stressed.

and an active member of the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian
Nations).

PARIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the threat by the Rally for the Republic and Union for
Democracy to exclude the far-right National Front (FN), some elected
regional deputies of the rightwing opposition are negotiating with
the FN in secret.
</P>
<P>
In the northern region of Picardie, the leftwing coalition
will present a candidate from the Communist Party to the
presidency of the regional council. Elsewhere where the left has
won a majority, the allies of the Socialists will be elected vice
presidents of the councils.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French rightwing oppositions estimated Tuesday that they
can win the presidency of 11 regional councils or parliaments -- out
of a total of 22 -- ``with uncontestable manner,'' including four
regional councils where the right and the left are running shoulder
to shoulder. Defeated in Provence, the president of the Union for
French Democracy Francois Leotard submitted a resignation which was
rejected.
</P>
<P>
-- Facing Israel, Europe has only two choices -- bow or crack.
The British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's visit to Jerusalem on
Tuesday, which stirred a diplomatic incident and receiving an
unprecedented slap on the face from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, fully showed that.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Arrives for Talks on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. chief's top envoy for
Cyprus arrived here early Wednesday for a six-day visit in a bid
to bring the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival, U.N. Secretary-General's Special
Advisor for Cyprus, Diego Cordovez said the U.N. is seriously
concerned about the situation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He warned that international interest could wane if rival
sides on the island do not show political will for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez's visit follows a Security Council decision last week
calling upon "both parties to take the practical steps necessary
to move the negotiating process forward in an effective manner."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council expressed concern over the "high
level of tension" in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez told reporters that outsiders are more interested in
solving the long-standing Cyprus problem than the Cypriots
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"It seems we are more interested, we the outsiders. The two
community leaders are the ones that have the responsibility to
work out a settlement, We can help them," Cordovez said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the international community is extremely
concerned, but you know, there may be a moment when they may
simply give up and that would be tragic. I am trying to avoid
that."
</P>
<P>
Cordovez, the former Ecuadorean Foreign Minister, is expected
to have separate meetings with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash and Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides during his
visit. He will also have a meeting with the ambassadors of the
U.N. Security Council's five permanent members in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez's visit came at a time when the bicommunal peace
talks were in deadlock after the two rounds of U.N.-led direct
talks between the two Cypriot communities' leaders in the U.S. and
Switzerland last summer.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has stated that the Turkish Cypriots will not
participate in peace talks unless his breakaway state unilaterally
declared in northern Cyprus is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Denktash's position was taken after the European Union decided
to start accession talks with the Cypriot government scheduled on
March 31.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took over the northern third of the island following a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez will leave on Sunday for Athens and end his trip
in the region with a visit to Ankara.

<HEADLINE> SAR Official: HK Remains Attractive to Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's appealing to
international businesses remains despite the recent financial
problems in the region, Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are still the world's freest and fairest market, with
minimum intervention by a clean government and clear rule of law,"
Leung said while officiating the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong
International Jewelry Show '98 here.
</P>
<P>
A 25 percent increase in the number of international traders
"shows that, nine months after the reunification, Hong Kong's
becoming a special administrative region of the People's Republic
of China has not affected its position as an international trade
and financial center and its participation in international
affairs continues freely and actively," she said.
</P>
<P>
The jewelry trade and industry has long been an important part
of Hong Kong's economy. As one of the largest exporters of
precious jewelry in the world, Hong Kong exported 10.5 billion HK
dollars (1.35 billion U.S. dollars) worth of jewelry products last
year.
</P>
<P>
The annual event moved this year into the new wing of the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, site of the handover
ceremonies at the midnight of June 30 last year. This year's show
is expected to attract thousands of visitors worldwide, said Leung
Sik-wah, chairman of the Trade Development Council Jewelry
Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
More than 770 companies from 27 countries and regions are
participating in the four-day fair.
</P>
<P>
To provide convenience for both exhibitors and buyers, products
have been classified into 16 categories and a computerized
exhibitor system has been installed to save time in locating any
company of interest.
</P>
<P>
The event is organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council in cooperation with the Hong Kong Jewelers' and
Goldsmiths' Association, the Hong Kong Jewelry and Jade
Manufacturers Association, the Hong Kong Jewelry Manufacturers'
Association and the Diamond Importers Association.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers Wednesday
warmly welcomed Zhu Rongji becoming China's new premier.
</P>
<P>
Commentaries, photos or profiles about Premier Zhu were
published in almost all local newspapers which agreed that the
election of Zhu as China's new premier is an embodiment of
people's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu was elected China's new premier by deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao Daily said in an editorial that the newly elected
Premier Zhu is well versed in economy, enjoying high prestige both
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
China is now concentrating its energies on developing its
economy and opening up, so it needs a premier like Zhu, it said.
</P>
<P>
The new Chinese leadership including President Jiang Zemin has
impressed the Hong Kong people very well and will win support
from them too, the paper said, adding that this will be a best
guarantee for Hong Kong's prosperity and stability after its
return to China.
</P>
<P>
A commentary by Ming Pao Daily News said the new Chinese
leadership with Jiang Zemin as president, Li Peng as chairman of
the NPC Standing Committee and Zhu Rongji as premier of the State
Council, has been formally formed and will lead the Chinese people
 in advancing toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Their successful coordination will surely guarantee the correct
 decision making and high administrative efficiency, greatly
pushing forward the governing of China according to law, it said.

SINGAPORE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to rise
on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) gained 24.04 points to close at 1645.3 points on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that stock prices ended higher amid moderate fund
buying, with property stocks extending their recent rise.
</P>
<P>
They said that expectations that the property market may be
near its bottom and stabilizing interest rates have propelled
property stocks higher.
</P>
<P>
However, they noted that buying was cautious as players
continued to watch the socio-political and economic developments
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 287.44 million units, valued
at 419.37 million Singapore dollars (about 260.48 million U.S.
dollars). Advances overwhelmed declined by 280 to 75, while 256
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Hersing was the most actively traded stock as it registered a
turnover of 2.426 million units. It was followed by IPC
Corporation which had 15.42 million shares traded. DBS

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Arrives for Talks on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. chief's top envoy for
Cyprus arrived here early Wednesday for a six-day visit in a bid
to bring the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival, U.N. Secretary-General's Special
Advisor for Cyprus, Diego Cordovez said the U.N. is seriously
concerned about the situation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He warned that international interest could wane if rival
sides on the island do not show political will for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez's visit follows a Security Council decision last week
calling upon "both parties to take the practical steps necessary
to move the negotiating process forward in an effective manner."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council expressed concern over the "high
level of tension" in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez told reporters that outsiders are more interested in
solving the long-standing Cyprus problem than the Cypriots
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"It seems we are more interested, we the outsiders. The two
community leaders are the ones that have the responsibility to
work out a settlement, We can help them," Cordovez said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the international community is extremely
concerned, but you know, there may be a moment when they may
simply give up and that would be tragic. I am trying to avoid
that."
</P>
<P>
Cordovez, the former Ecuadorean Foreign Minister, is expected
to have separate meetings with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash and Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides during his
visit. He will also have a meeting with the ambassadors of the
U.N. Security Council's five permanent members in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez's visit came at a time when the bicommunal peace
talks were in deadlock after the two rounds of U.N.-led direct
talks between the two Cypriot communities' leaders in the U.S. and
Switzerland last summer.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has stated that the Turkish Cypriots will not
participate in peace talks unless his breakaway state unilaterally
declared in northern Cyprus is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Denktash's position was taken after the European Union decided
to start accession talks with the Cypriot government scheduled on
March 31.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took over the northern third of the island following a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez will leave on Sunday for Athens and end his trip
in the region with a visit to Ankara.

<HEADLINE> China Records Growth in January Textile Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China exported textiles and
clothing valued at over three billion US dollars during January,
up 9.18 percent on last year's same month, according to today's
International Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
The nation recently introduced a series of measures to boost
textile exports and cut production costs. The steps were
taken to increase exports which declined somewhat in the last
quarter of 1997 due to the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
January textile exports to the United States surged by 49
percent, those to Germany up by 25 percent and those to Russia by
85 percent on the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
However, the effects of the prevailing financial turmoil
lingered with exports to Hong Kong dropping by 12 percent, Japan
by 11 percent, and the Republic of Korea by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The daily stressed that China should make full use of its
products with a high added value and brand names in order to gain
a greater share of the international textile and clothing markets.
</P>
<P>
The daily predicted that China's textile exports will witness
consistent growth this year in spite of increasingly fierce
competition and the ongoing financial crisis in Southeast
Asia.

But the bourse lost its earlier momentum in afternoon trade,
retreating from its highs after falls on Asian stock markets.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries closed just 2.5 points higher at 2769.6,
despite an overnight record high on Wall Street and a strong start
to the day that included an intra-day high of 2789.4.
</P>
<P>
The intra-day record for the index was 2797.3 set on September

Henderson Charlton Jones Broker Philip Toop said some re-rating
in the insurance sector had most probably helped buoy its stocks,
which pushed the index up a massive 194.6 points, or 2.62 percent
to 7618.9.
</P>
<P>
Insurance stocks were popular with investors seeking higher
yield, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the rise in insurance stocks to rallies in both
the bond and equities markets.
</P>
<P>
Insurance heavyweight National Mutual Holdings was behind the
index surge, edging up 9 cents to 3.45 Australian dollars, a move
of 2.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
Banks were also among the market leaders with the relevant
index up 37 points to 5722.8.

</P>
<P>
The All Industrials Index finished 11.9 points stronger at
4775.2, after peaking at 4806.2.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said leading stocks News Corp., BHP, Amcor and Telstra
all contributed to dragging the All Industrials down from its
earlier highs.
</P>
<P>
News Corp. was 7 cents weaker at 10.38 Australian dollars with
the preferred shares down 5.5 cents to 8.82 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 376.22 million shares worth 662.57
million U.S. dollars with falls of 613 outnumbering rises of 536.
</P>
<P>
The All Resources Index slipped 6.3 points to 1165.7, with
leading miner BHP down 15 cents at 15.68 Australian dollars,
holding the market back as investors took profits following strong
rises in the resources giant after Managing Director John Prescott
resigned recently, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
Rio Tinto shares climbed 10 cents to 19.5 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index was down 10 points to 1099.6 after the price of
gold fell from Tuesday's close of 294.15 U.S. dollars an ounce.
Gold bullion closed Wednesday at 292.1 U.S. dollars an ounce.

PARIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the threat by the Rally for the Republic and Union for
Democracy to exclude the far-right National Front (FN), some elected
regional deputies of the rightwing opposition are negotiating with
the FN in secret.
</P>
<P>
In the northern region of Picardie, the leftwing coalition
will present a candidate from the Communist Party to the
presidency of the regional council. Elsewhere where the left has
won a majority, the allies of the Socialists will be elected vice
presidents of the councils.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French rightwing oppositions estimated Tuesday that they
can win the presidency of 11 regional councils or parliaments -- out
of a total of 22 -- ``with uncontestable manner,'' including four
regional councils where the right and the left are running shoulder
to shoulder. Defeated in Provence, the president of the Union for
French Democracy Francois Leotard submitted a resignation which was
rejected.
</P>
<P>
-- Facing Israel, Europe has only two choices -- bow or crack.
The British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's visit to Jerusalem on
Tuesday, which stirred a diplomatic incident and receiving an
unprecedented slap on the face from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, fully showed that.

<HEADLINE> Senior German Officials to Visit Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Two senior German Foreign
Ministry officials will visit Iran to mend Bonn-Tehran relations,
local daily newspaper Iran News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The trip will take place in April following the Iranian new
year (to start March 21) holidays," the daily quoted an
unidentified source, adding that the two German officials are
directors general of political and consular affairs of the German
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first trip of senior German officials to Iran
after the warm-up of relations between Iran and the European Union
(EU), whose recalled ambassadors returned to Tehran last November.
</P>
<P>
The EU states withdrew their envoys to Tehran after a German
court accused Iranian leaders last April of sponsoring state
terrorism against Iranian Kurdish rebel leaders in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that the two German officials decided to
travel to Iran with an aim to discuss an Iranian death sentence on
the German citizen Helmut Hofer who was imprisoned on charges of
having illegal sexual relations with an Iranian Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel warned last month that
the improvement of Bonn-Tehran relations would depend on Hofer's
fate, but Iranian officials dismissed the warning by saying
that the case was a judicial one and had nothing to do
with diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in Iran last September and was sentenced
to death for having sexual relations with an Iranian Muslim
woman. The Iranian laws ban sexual relations between a Muslim
woman and a non-Muslim man.
</P>
<P>
Hofer has appealed to Iran's higher court by claiming that
he had converted to Islam before having a case with the
Iranian woman. Iranian judicial authorities stated earlier that
the verdict on Hofer might be changed if his claim was
proved by necessary document.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Sends Message to Clinton to Deflect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- To deflect further pressure,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sent a message to
United States President Bill Clinton on advancing the peace
process, Israel Radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The radio said Netanyahu was trying to prevent the publication
of a new U.S. peace plan on breaking the stalemate in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process. No details of the message were
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's move came apparently following the diplomatic
uproar created by visiting British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook,
who exerted pressure on Israel to halt its settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who visited Israel Tuesday in the capacity of the
rotating presidency of the European Union (EU), was currently on a
Mideast tour trying to help revive the peace process by supporting
the Palestinian demand for ending Israeli settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The trip has taken him to Egypt, Jordan and Palestinian
self-rule areas, and will also take him to Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Despite Israel's angry protests, Cook visited the controversial
Har Homa site in Arab East Jerusalem, where Israel is building a
settlement. He also met with Palestinian Council members at the
site to hear their complaints.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who met with Cook for one hour Tuesday evening,
canceled a scheduled dinner with Cook in a rare diplomatic
snub. He reiterated that Israel would never relinquish its
sovereign claim over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Cook denounced Israeli settlement expansion for undermining the
peace process, saying that his Har Homa visit was aimed at telling
Israel that the international community has the legitimate right
to express its deep concern over the issue. The Har Homa
construction has been one of the major obstacles blocking
progress in the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations Assembly has issued a
condemnation of Israeli construction of the Har Homa
settlement. It also called for a conference of the parties to the
Geneva Conventions to discuss Israeli settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
But Israel believes that as long as it is supported by the
United States, its closest ally, it can resist any other outside
pressures, including those from the EU.
</P>
<P>
Since the Iraq-U.N. crisis over weapons inspection last month,
Washington has not yet refocused its attention on the deadlock in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been stalled since
March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The disputes between the Palestinians and Israelis mainly focused
on two issues: Israel's continued efforts to expand settlements in
the territories, and Israel's refusal to carry out the delayed
further troop redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar dropped
more than half a U.S. cent Wednesday in sympathy with its New
Zealand counterpart after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand eased
interest rates by twice the amount anticipated by financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed the local session at 66.53 U.S.
cents, from 66.93 cents in Sydney late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It had begun on a much stronger note at 67.15 U.S. cents but
was quickly knocked back when the New Zealand central bank eased
official rates by 150 basis points, instead of the expected 75.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash forecast
substantially weaker export growth in the coming year, saying the
central bank was easing monetary conditions to prevent a sharp
decline in the economy because of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank Chief Economist Craig James said the
Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar "tend to be lumped
together by global fund managers."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 86.72 Japanese yen from 86.65
and at 1.2132 Deutsche marks from 1.2168.

<HEADLINE> Snowy Weather to Continue in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The bad weather accompanied by
snow and heavy winds that began on Monday will last until the
weekend in Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the country have dropped to eight to 12 degrees
centigrade from 16 degrees days ago, the agency quoted information
from the Meteorology General Directorate as saying.
</P>
<P>
Due to slippery road, a passenger bus from Turkey's capital
Ankara to Samsun along the Black Sea turned over in Merzifon town
of Amasya province, about 250 kilometers northeast of the capital,
at small hours on Wednesday, killing at least four people and
injuring 22 others, and three of them in serious conditions, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the heavy snow, which is continuing, has been
disrupting daily life in many cities and causing traffic delays
and accidents.
</P>
<P>
Snow also blocked many village roads in the provinces of
Kayseri, Samsun, Amasya, Malatya, Bolu and Hakkari and caused
power outages and breakdowns in communication systems in these
regions.
</P>
<P>
Primary and high schools in many provinces were given two-day
holidays due to the bad weather, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Arrives for Talks on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. chief's top envoy for
Cyprus arrived here early Wednesday for a six-day visit in a bid
to bring the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival, U.N. Secretary-General's Special
Advisor for Cyprus, Diego Cordovez said the U.N. is seriously
concerned about the situation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He warned that international interest could wane if rival
sides on the island do not show political will for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez's visit follows a Security Council decision last week
calling upon "both parties to take the practical steps necessary
to move the negotiating process forward in an effective manner."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council expressed concern over the "high
level of tension" in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez told reporters that outsiders are more interested in
solving the long-standing Cyprus problem than the Cypriots
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"It seems we are more interested, we the outsiders. The two
community leaders are the ones that have the responsibility to
work out a settlement, We can help them," Cordovez said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the international community is extremely
concerned, but you know, there may be a moment when they may
simply give up and that would be tragic. I am trying to avoid
that."
</P>
<P>
Cordovez, the former Ecuadorean Foreign Minister, is expected
to have separate meetings with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash and Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides during his
visit. He will also have a meeting with the ambassadors of the
U.N. Security Council's five permanent members in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez's visit came at a time when the bicommunal peace
talks were in deadlock after the two rounds of U.N.-led direct
talks between the two Cypriot communities' leaders in the U.S. and
Switzerland last summer.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has stated that the Turkish Cypriots will not
participate in peace talks unless his breakaway state unilaterally
declared in northern Cyprus is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Denktash's position was taken after the European Union decided
to start accession talks with the Cypriot government scheduled on
March 31.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took over the northern third of the island following a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez will leave on Sunday for Athens and end his trip
in the region with a visit to Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Plunge on Fading Hope for Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo on
Wednesday in the wake of a statement by a senior official of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that new economy-boosting
measures will not include income tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First Section
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange sank 377.52 points or 2.22 percent
from Tuesday's close to 16,619.68.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all issues on the
First Section, dropped 16.68 points or 1.31 percent to 1,253.09.
</P>
<P>
First Section volume went up to an estimated 430 million shares
from Tuesday's 388.83 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was Wednesday's most heavily traded
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock market opened slightly higher on a media report
that the government will draw up additional economic stimulus
measures by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-morning, stock market players, mainly foreign
investors, accelerated selling following the U.S. dollar's surge
to the 130 yen level for the first time in two months.
</P>
<P>
The yen selling was prompted by a comment by the LDP's top
policy-planner Taku Yamasaki, who hinted in a newspaper interview
that income tax cuts were not appropriate to shore up the economy.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,330 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outpaced winners 818 to 294 with 139 issues unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese President Ends State Visit to Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese President Tran
Duc Luong left here Wednesday afternoon for Singapore after a
three-day state visit, the first by a Vietnamese head of state
since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1973.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese president's state visit, aimed at enhancing
bilateral ties between the two Southeast Asian nations, was also
to reciprocate the visit by Tuanku Ja'afar to Vietnam in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia paid tribute to the Vietnamese leader's visit as
Malaysia was chosen as the first country to visit by the president
since he took office last September.
</P>
<P>
During the "historic" visit, Tran Duc Luong held bilateral
discussions with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on
bilateral, regional and international issues such as the economic
crisis faced by Malaysia and other ASEAN countries, the
forthcoming ASEAN summit, the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has agreed to the promotion of intra-ASEAN trade using
their own currencies.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Vietnam reaffirmed its policy to develop
friendship, good neighborliness and multi-faceted cooperation with
Malaysia on the basis of respect for independence, sovereignty and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tran Duc Luong said at a state banquet hosted by Malaysian King
Tuanku Ja'afar in his honor that over the years Vietnam and
Malaysia had observed fine development in friendship and
multi-faceted cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that since economic cooperation was becoming a
primarily important area in intra-ASEAN cooperation, especially in
view of the regional financial and currency crisis, Vietnam and
Malaysia needed to step up the areas of cooperation tantamount to
the existing fine political cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said within the framework of the ASEAN market and
international market, the two countries still have great
potentials which can be explored further so as to make full use of
each country's advantages.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Malaysia pledged to assist Vietnam in
drawing up the individual action plan required by the APEC and
also to help Vietnam with the preparation of the Common Effective
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) list that is required by the ASEAN Free
Trade Area (AFTA) scheme.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam became a member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) in 1995 and is expected to be admitted into APEC
along with Peru and Russia during the informal meeting of the APEC
leaders to be held here in November.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will host the ASEAN Summit in December.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia expressed its satisfaction with Vietnam's active role
in international affairs since its entry into ASEAN in 1995 and
welcomed measures introduced by the Vietnamese government to
promote intra-ASEAN trade.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Vietnam have concluded many agreements in the
fields of economic, trade, investment, scientific and
technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is the seventh largest investor in Vietnam. As of
December 31, 1997, Vietnam approved 64 Malaysian projects with a
total capital outlay of 1.35 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total trade between Malaysia and Vietnam in 1997 stood at 1.356
billion ringgit (358.73 million U.S. dollars) compared with 1.191
billion ringgit (315.08 million U.S. dollars) in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Americans Sue Boeing Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Forty-one ethnic American
workers sued the world largest aircraft maker Boeing company
Tuesday, seeking more than 82 million dollars for alleged racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit accuses the aerospace giant of failing to promote
ethnic workers, creating a hostile work environment,
discriminatory hiring practices and sexual harassment, according
to a report reaching here from Seattle, where the company is
located.
</P>
<P>
Among the plaintiffs, the report said, forty are Afro-Americans
and one is Filipino-American. All are current or former Being
employees.
</P>
<P>
They said that many of them were denied promotions granted to
others with equal or lesser qualifications, or offered promotions
that required them to transfer when others were not required to do
so.
</P>
<P>
Jim Dagnon, senior vice president of the company, promised that
his company would investigate the allegations and "appropriately
address" the problem, if any.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM-Designate Releases National Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- India's new government would
adopt a "consensual mode of governance", eradicate unemployment
and reevaluate the country's unclear policy, Prime
Minister-designate Atal Bihari Vajpayee declared here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to develop national consensus on all major
issues confronting the nation by involving opposition parties and
all sections of the society in dialogue," said Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference following his release of the
eight-page national agenda on the eve of assuming office that he
would try for a consensual mode of governance as far as
practicable.
</P>
<P>
The new government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
would establish a national security council which would undertake
India's first ever strategic defense review, said Vajpayee, who
will resume office as India's 12th prime minister Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will reevaluate the nuclear policy and exercise the option
to induct nuclear weapons," the agenda said. "We are committed to
ensuring safety and security of all citizens in all parts of the
country."
</P>
<P>
On international relations, the agenda said, the BJP government
would "reorient" the country's diplomacy to pursue economic and
commercial goals and strengthen regional and civilizational
groupings.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that it would pursue "genuine secularism", it said
"we will truly uphold and practice the concept of secularism
consistent with the Indian tradition" of equal respect for all
faiths and on the basis of equality of all.
</P>
<P>
Outlining its economic policy of the BJP government, the
national agenda said it would give a strong self-reliance thrust
to the reform process to move on to a seven percent growth bracket
with an ultimate goal to eradicate unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The document proposed to set up a committee to study
feasibility of treating all 19 languages included in the
Constitution as "official language".
</P>
<P>
A national judicial commission would be set up to recommend
judicial appointments in high courts and supreme courts and draw
up a code of ethics for the judiciary, said the agenda.
</P>
<P>
To deal with corruption, the agenda said, the BJP-led
government would enact a bill with adequate powers to deal with
corruption charges against anyone, including the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The agenda was signed by 17 persons, all leaders of the BJP and
its allies.

<HEADLINE> Romanian FM Confident over Treaty with Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations over a major
political treaty between Romania and the Republic of Moldova are
at an advanced stage, said the Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei
Plesu on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At his first press conference since being appointed to the post
two months ago, Plesu said, "I am confident that, given the very
good atmosphere in which contacts have been proceeding, things
will run in a good direction."
</P>
<P>
But the Foreign Minister cautioned that the treaty is a very
serious thing and has to be negotiated in a careful and
responsible manner.
</P>
<P>
Plesu had said before that the treaty with Moldova, the former
Romanian territory known as Basarabia, was not to be signed in a
rush. Basarabia was taken from Romania in 1940.
</P>
<P>
"We have no aggressive intention, no plan not to respect an
independent state's self-determination, but there are affinities
between us, a communion of language, culture which cannot be
neglected or treated in haste," Plesu stressed.
</P>
<P>
So far, two meetings have been held to negotiate the terms for
the treaty, the latest being in February. The next round is
scheduled for May.

BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tunisian ambassador to China
today hailed the "active development" of the Tunis-China relations
and expressed the hope that the economic and cultural links
between the two countries would be further advanced.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Mongi Lahbib, the ambassador, said that the Sino-Tunisian
relations are being strengthened on the basis of unity, mutual
trust, respect and support.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia and China share many similarities, and the ways of
bilateral cooperation in various fields could be diversified,
added the ambassador in an interview with Xinhua before the
Independence Day of Tunisia, which falls on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador cited the fertilizer factory initiated jointly
by China, Tunisia and Kuwait in north China's Qinhuangdao city as
an encouraging model of the "South-South Cooperation".

<HEADLINE> Nepal, Bangladesh to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and Bangladesh agreed to
expand the scope of their cooperation and increase bilateral trade
at a Joint Economic Commission meeting attended by their finance
ministers, press reports here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day meeting which ended Tuesday, the finance
ministers of the two countries also agreed to encourage
joint-venture investment.
</P>
<P>
The areas of bilateral cooperation agreed upon include industry
and investment, trade and commerce, water resources, education,
health, communication, tourism and civil aviation, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah Kibria and his
Nepalese counterpart Rabindra Nath Sharma also discussed the
possibility of Nepal importing natural gas from Bangladesh and
exporting hydropower to that country.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission was established in January 1978 with the
objective of promoting economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kibria said Bangladesh is working to upgrade the physical
infrastructure of the Phulbari transit route to make it
economically viable in the near future so as to boost trade
between Bangladesh and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The transit route runs from Kakarbhitta of Nepal to the
Bangladeshi border town of Banglabandh through Phulbari in
northeastern India and then to the Mongla port in southwestern
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Except on the inauguration day last September, the route
remains idle due to impractical operating modalities and lack of
infrastructure in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The commerce secretaries of Nepal and India will meet in New
Delhi later this month to review the operating modalities.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal appreciated the positive gesture shown by Bangladesh to
further facilitate the export of Nepalese primary products to
Bangladesh and to consider Nepalese request for customs tariff
reduction," Nepal's Sharma was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the last fiscal year which ended on July 14, 1997, Nepal's
exports to Bangladesh amounted to about 357 million Nepali rupees
(about 5.7 million U.S. dollars) and imports stood at some 680
million rupees (about 11 million dollars), reports said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Bangladesh are both members of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and members of the
so-called Growth Quadrangle, a sub-regional cooperation grouping
within the SAARC.
</P>
<P>
The Growth Quadrangle which also groups Bhutan and India was
initiated in December 1996 to develop jointly the eastern
Himalayan rivers for rapid economic development.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Rebuffs U.S. Stance on Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
rebuffed the statement of the United States that it would not
accept a military candidate in Nigeria's presidential elections
this year, saying it amounts to undue interference in Nigeria's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Information and Culture Minister Chief Ikeabasi Mokelu, in a
press statement issued in the capital Abuja Tuesday, said
Nigerians are free to elect whomever they want, without America
imposing its will.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan
Rice said last Thursday that any military candidate or top
government official who emerges as civilian president in Nigeria
would not be accepted by her government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position is a "negation of the basic principle of
democracy and civilized behavior", said Mokelu.
</P>
<P>
"And if our people choose to vote for a military candidate
later this year, no nation on earth, no matter how powerful or
wealthy, can usurp their sovereign right to elect whomsoever they
wish to become their president," he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the United States of trying to foist its own
culture and political practices on other nations in the guise of
safeguarding democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Under the Nigerian military government's transition to civil
rule program, presidential elections are billed to start in
August and the civilian president will take over power from the
military on October 1.
</P>
<P>
So far only two political figures have announced their
intention to contest, while many people are waiting for the
decision of the Head of State, General Sani Abacha, who is said
to make known his position on the issue in a few weeks.

<HEADLINE> India to Ban Controversial Contraceptive Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- India has decided to ban the
controversial contraceptive drug, Quinachrine, which is being
misused for female sterilization, Indian newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Drug Controller of India gave a written commitment to the
Supreme Court on Monday that the use of the drug as a method of
female sterilization would be banned in the country, said the
Times of India.
</P>
<P>
The commitment came following a joint writ petition filed by
the All-India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA).
</P>
<P>
The move is hailed as a significant victory for Indian women in
their struggle against harmful contraceptives and the use of women
as guinea pigs in the drug business.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that at least 40,000 Indian women have been
administered Quinachrine without their knowledge, though exact
figures are not available.
</P>
<P>
Although the drug, which has not been approved by any
regulatory authority in the world, is being tried in violation of
WHO's directive in 19 developing countries, India is the first
country to ban the drug.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory tests have indicated that the drug, already banned
by the World Health Organization (WHO), can cause mutation of
cells, ectopic pregnancy and could be carcinogenic.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Council for Medical Research started its trials in
1992, which were later abandoned because of a high rate of
failure.
</P>
<P>
However, that did not deter unscrupulous private practitioners
and non-government organizations in many cities from using women
as guinea pigs to test its efficacy, said AIDWA general secretary
Brinda Karat at a press conference Tuesday.

Li Shuqing, head of the Institute of Sociology of Hebei

workers return to their villages with capital, technology and
information, it will bring economic change to rural parts of China.
</P>
<P>
According to some reports, 300,000 transient workers from
Sichuan Province in southwest China have returned home to start
businesses, and tens of thousands of farmers from Hunan, Hubei,
Anhui, Guizhou and Henan provinces have returned home to make
their fortune. More than 60 percent of the owners of 2.4 million
private businesses in Hebei have worked for some time in urban
factories.
</P>
<P>
About 80 million Chinese farmers have been trained by work they
found on their own, involving not a penny of government funds,
according to Li Yining, a professor of economics at Beijing
University.
</P>
<P>
This is a major investment in human resources, he says, and if
only a third or a quarter of the rural workers return home, great
changes will take place in their home towns.
</P>
<P>
This prediction is becoming a reality in China's rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tries to Meet EU's Fish Imports Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Health Ministry will
send officials to tour the country's fishing processing plants to
see whether they have implemented the hygiene standards demanded
by the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking Tuesday after receiving Lutz Salzmann, Head of the
Nairobi Mission of the delegation of the European Commission,
Kenyan Health Minister Jackson Kalweo said Kenya was seriously
addressing the issue of the ban on Kenya's fish exports by EU,
the Kenya Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In January, an EU committee meeting in Brussels decided to ban
import of fresh fish from four African countries including Kenya
because of cholera outbreak in the east African region.
</P>
<P>
"Cholera is still in the region and the ban will continue
until the disease is brought under control," said Lutz Salzmann.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important that the country (Kenya) implements the
general hygiene standards on fish processing by the June 30
deadline or risk being totally shut out from the European
markets," the EU official warned.
</P>
<P>
Salzmann expressed the hope that a new inspection team from EU
will come to Kenya to review the situation of fish processing in
the country and give necessary recommendations before the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Fish exports to the European markets can earn the
country 10 million U.S. Dollars a year. But now, the fishing
industry is being seriously affected by the EU ban.

<HEADLINE> Water Commercialization Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Deputies from both water-abundant
southern provinces and arid northern areas to the National
People's Congress (NPC), in session here since early March, have
shown great concern for the grave situation of water shortages in
China and called for making water a commodity.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, the Chinese cabinet, has promulgated a
number of regulations on efficient use of water resources and is
working on regulations imposing charges for the use of water
resources, according to Niu Maosheng, minister of water resources,
who is attending the annual NPC session as a deputy.
</P>
<P>
China is one of 13 most water-deficient countries in the world.
With a rapid growth in population and in the amount of water used,
there has been an acute imbalance of water supply and demand in
recent years. Water shortages constitute a major factor
restricting China's economic growth and social development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, waste of water can be seen everywhere, especially
seriously in agriculture, whose water consumption accounts for 75
percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangping, a deputy from Anhui Province, a leading grain
producer in east China, said only 30 percent of water is
effectively used in Anhui because a traditional way of irrigation,
"flooding", is still widely used.
</P>
<P>
A farmer deputy from north China's Inner Mongolia, named Tian
Ying, said local farmers water a ha. of farmland with as much as
9,000 cubic meters of water. Actually two thirds can be saved with
such new methods as spraying and drop irrigation, she said.
</P>
<P>
A major cause for the drying-up of the Yellow River at its
lower section for much of the year was the excessive use of water
for irrigation in the upper and middle reaches of the river, said
Chen Xiaoguo, a deputy from the Yellow River Water Conservancy
Committee.
</P>
<P>
In addition, only half of water for industrial use has been
recycled. The consumption of water for every 10,000 yuan of
industrial output value in China averages 200 cubic meters, three
fourths more than that in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
In the past four decades, the government has invested 300
billion yuan in building 80,000 reservoirs across the country,
which have brought total irrigated area from 13.3 million ha to
46.6 million ha nationwide, accounting for 22 percent of the
world's total, Niu said.
</P>
<P>
However, the state has so far imposed no charge on the use of
water for agriculture and collects a limited fee for water in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Deputies attending the NPC session urged the state to enact
laws and regulations on water use and commercialize water supply
to ensure that the country have adequate water supply in the 21st
century.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Environment degradation of Lake
Victoria is to impose east Africa a loss of 150 million U.S.
Dollars a year, if water hyacinth is not controled.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made by Aquatics Unlimited, an American
company in its February report which was quoted by local newspaer
the New Vision Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report urged governments in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to
make quick measures to curb water hyacinth, the main cause of
degradation of the lake.
</P>
<P>
The wed appeared in the lake in the 1950s and developed
rapidly in recent years. It consumes a large amount of oxygen in
water and thus exchanged the ecological balance of the marine
organism system in the lake and caused a dangerous threat to the
ecological environment in the lake. Besides, the wed always
blocks up the transport on the lake.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's major economic
and financial center, has witnessed increased foreign exchange
trading on the part of individuals.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Communications handled
individual foreign exchange transactions valued at 367 million US
dollars during 1997, up a dramatic 214.7 percent on 1996.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
According to a survey by China Labor Journal, 13.3 percent of
China's unemployed rural workers have the idea of returning home
to start businesses.
</P>
<P>
The 300,000 people in Sichuan now employ 800,000 local
laborers. This "job seeking" economy is new in China, but has
caught the government's attention.
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, parts of Hebei have developd a strategy
for becoming a part of "Greater Beijing" and have asked local job
seekers to bring in capital, technology and projects from other
cities. Lixian County near Baoding city has gotten 80 million yuan
from outside in this way.
</P>
<P>
To get people to return home in an orderly way, Sichuan has
decided to establish a center for returning job seekers in Jintang
County to provide services.
</P>
<P>
More officials are interested in attracting overseas investment
and have started encouraging job seekers to return home.
</P>
<P>
"The change from job seeking to starting a business has helped
us understand that urban areas and economically-developed coastal
areas have not only offered jobs to several million surplus rural
laborers who send back billions of yuan in earnings, but have also
helped train a generation for future development in the vast rural
areas," says Li Shuqing.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Attempts to Ensure Uninterrupted Flow of Yellow River (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Xinhua Writer Hu Lujie and Ding Yaqing
</P>
<P>
 Alternative Measures
</P>
<P>
China has introduced a number of alternative measures to
increase water resources in the Yellow River Valley. For example,
the Ministry of Water Resources has strengthened its unified
control of water usage to more institutions in the middle and
lower reaches of the Yellow River Valley.
</P>
<P>
In addition to planting more trees, introducing more vegetation
and controlling soil erosion in the upper reaches of the river,
northeast China has introduced a special plan to develop
underground water resources and raising the use rate of related
resources to the worldwide average of between 60-70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Qinghai Province recently announced it will
launch expanded large-scale cloud-seeding operation in the upper
reaches of the Yellow River Valley during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Xiaolangdi Project, a major multi-purpose
project funded by the World Bank, is proceeding smoothly in the
middle reaches of the river valley in Henan Province. The massive
reservoir, scheduled for completion in 2001, will provide ample
water supplies during peak irrigation seasons.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Province will continue to allocate massive investments
to sink more wells and build additional reservoirs to ensure water
supplies in areas along the Yellow River, as well as for
introducing efficient irrigation facilities to an additional one
million hectares of cultivatable land.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the 629-km section of the Yellow River in Shandong
Province have already sunk 240,000 wells to tap underground water
resources for both production and daily life activities.
</P>
<P>
Central government top leaders have exhibited great concern
about the extended periods of interrupted water flow along the
Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
During recent discussions with Henan deputies to Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), both Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
former premier Li Peng, who is now Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), called for
harnessing of the Yellow River at strategic points and for giving
priority on ensuring the rational use of water resources in the
Yellow River Valley.

A survey conducted in 12 counties and cities revealed burdens
on local farmers ranged between 10-30 yuan and accounted for three
percent of their net income in 1997, a figure noticeably lower
than the five percent national average.
</P>
<P>
The province relieved burdens on farmers by expanding budgetary
and final accounting systems to 98 percent of local
townships. Participating townships provided 92 percent of farmers
with detailed lists of fees and labor service items.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 74 percent of the townships introduced auditing
systems, and 81 percent of villages adopted open account financial
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement departments conducted 28 related inspections
during the year. The inspectors rendered punishment to 14
officials charged with malpractices involving over one million
yuan, with eight officials subject to either punishment stipulated
by the Party or administrative disciplinary action. Four officials
were prosecuted accordint to law.

<HEADLINE> TAZARA to Launch Regional Marketing Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania-Zambia railway
authority (TAZARA) is to embark on a vigorous marketing campaign
to lure countries in the sub-region to engage the railway company
in the transportation of their import and export goods, the TAZARA
Managing Director said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zambia Daily Mail, TAZARA Managing
Director Kingston Mkandawire said marketing expeditions are
underway to Malawi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Botswana
and Zimbabwe to lure them to use the company's services.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to improve on our services, first make them
reliable, then go out to sell so that our customers would not be
disappointed," Mkandawire said.
</P>
<P>
Transit times for the train have been reduced from 15-16
days in some cases previously to three days now. The result of
this achievement has been improved security for traffic on
TAZARA.
</P>
<P>
By adjusting the way the trains run, the company has
drastically reduced its fuel costs as well, which saves it
120,000 litres of diesel cost per week, said thE director.
</P>
<P>
"I see TAZARA becoming a good company and a reliable railway
line. We want to see a situation where people quit using South
Africa's Spoornet and road transport and come to TAZARA because
it is the company of the future," Mkandawire noted.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA recorded a 30 billion Kwacha (about 22 million U.S.
Dollars) profit from passenger and freight services in the first
half of the 1997-98 financial year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, its workers both in Tanzania and Zambia will from
July 1 be receiving their salaries pegged to the dollar at the
ruling rate in both countries.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Lawmaker Performs His Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Duan Youlin, a farmer from
central China's Hunan Province, could hardly hold back his tears
as he made his way up a few long flights of steps to the Great
Hall of the People in Beijing for the first full session of
China's top legislature of a new term, the Ninth National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Though he has had rich life experiences and has been to many
places including the United States and Japan, it had never occurred
to him that he would be elected to the country's top legislature
and discuss state affairs with other deputies, many of them also
high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
But to some 4,000 folks back in his village, the 54-year-old
Duan is "somebody"-- during the 1960s and early 70s, he was
enthusiastically involved in "class struggles;" and then, years
later, with equal enthusiasm, he cashed in on economic reforms in
the 1980s by leading his villagers in setting up workshops,
launching industrial enterprises, doing wholesaling and retailing
and establishing trade firms.
</P>
<P>
"We used to rely heavily on the government for food and money
and did not really have our own ideas on political issues. But now
we are free to air our views on state affairs," said Duan, one of
the rags-to-riches Chinese whose personal properties are valued at
more than a million yuan (more than 100,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Duan said he does not feel embarrassed among the many
intellectuals and senior officials in his delegation of deputies
to the NPC, in session here since early March.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, I take pride in my being a farmer deputy.
Like the other deputies, my rights are protected by law," Duan
said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that he was ill at ease in the presence of
ministers and governors during the first few days in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We take the same bus (to the meeting venue), eat in the same
dinning hall and discuss matters of common concern on an equal
footing, and we have become quite familiar with each other," he
said. "Now I am no longer ill at ease and say what I like."
</P>
<P>
Duan is devoted to his duties and responsibilities as a
people's representative. Before he came to Beijing, he had
consulted a former local NPC deputy on NPC-related matters,
including procedures to file proposals. He also visited 14
government departments of his county as well as many villages to
acquaint himself with local conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The threshold of my house was almost flattened with so many
visitors who wanted me to pass their opinions and suggestions to
higher officials," recalled Duan. "One farmer even walked four
kilometers on foot to talk to me in my home."
</P>
<P>
Duan had the first experience of exercising his power as an NPC
deputy in Changsha, capital of Hunan Province, where deputies from
all parts of the province gathered before leaving for Beijing as
the provincial delegation.
</P>
<P>
A woman found Duan and complainted to him that she had
exhausted herself by trying to get her lawsuit accepted because
local judicial departments for several years had shifted the
responsibility onto one other.
</P>
<P>
Duan discussed the matter with the city's mayor, also an NPC
deputy, who immediately gave orders to relevant departments to
handle the case at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Having received an education equivalent to junior middle
school, Duan is very diligent and has been spending more time
expanding his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
He has bought a lot of books during the session time, many of
which are about laws. He is one of the initiators of two motions
and four written suggestions to the current NPC session.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I am a competent NPC deputy," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province is suffering through the worst drought on record since
the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning's precipitation level for the November-February period
fell by some 40 percent on the annual average, with water levels
in the province's seven major reservoirs falling by 43 percent,
according to the Provincial Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
Water has ceased flowing in 18 of 21 major rivers in Fuxin
County.
</P>
<P>
Higher than normal temperatures led to a substantial decline in
soil moisture levels, and complicated the drought conditions
affecting 1.83 million ha. even further, according to Li Wenke,
deputy director of the department.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that Liaoning is combatting severe drought
conditions by proliferating efficient irrigation technology and
strengthening water conservancy efforts.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have spent 285.6 million yuan
completing 28,000 water-conservancy projects, he said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Arrangement for Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) on Tuesday approved a three-year arrangement of 384
million U.S. dollars for Cote d'Ivoire under the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to support Cote d'Ivoire's economic
program for 1998-2000.
</P>
<P>
The first annual arrangement of 167 million dollars will be
available in two semi-annual installments. The first installment
of 112 million dollars will be available on March 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
The medium-term adjustment strategy for 1998-2000 focuses on
three key policy components: prudent fiscal policy to bring the
budget close to balance by the year 2000 and achieve a surplus
thereafter, structural reforms to promote private sector
development and investment, and an ambitious social development
agenda focused on poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The basic macroeconomic objectives for the program are to
achieve a real GDP growth of six percent a year, helping the per
capita income to rise by more than two percent annually; to
maintain an inflation rate of about three percent a year; and to
lower the current account deficit to two percent of GDP by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting member
countries that are undertaking economic reform program to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire joined the IMF in March, 1963. Its quota is
equivalent to 320 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF
financing currently totals about 448 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Unemployed Chinese Farmers Now Running Their Own Businesses (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A major economic change is
believed to have take place in rural China as large numbers of
surplus rural laborers who have flooded Chinese cities and coastal
areas in search of work since the mid-1980s return to their
villages and start their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qifa, who spent three years looking for work in north
China, is now the head of three woollen mills with some 200
employees. The 46-year-old man, who was in the army in the late
1970s, went to Beijing along with some other young villagers in
1983 and worked as a salesman for a Beijing woollen mill.
</P>
<P>
He travelled to almost every part of the country before
returning home and starting his own mill in 1985 with money he had
saved.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who now has a great deal of marketing experience and has
gradually come to understand the meaning of things like cost,
profit and market competition, says, "At first, I just wanted to
go out and earn some money, then come back to build a house and
spend the rest of my life, but later I changeed my mind."
</P>
<P>
Last spring, instead of going to town to look for a job as
usual, Wang went to local government departments and got some
information on land and employment policies, and then bought
bricks, tiles and other building materials to start a business of
his own.

CHANGSHA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Eight dredgers manufactured in
the Netherlands will soon join efforts to tackle silting problems
in Dongting Lake, China's largest freshwater lake in the Yangtze
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
China purchased the Dutch dredgers with low-interest loans
provided by the government of the Netherlands. Three dredgers are
currently operating in the heavily silted lake.
</P>
<P>
The lake is prone to flooding due to an annual accumulation of
over 100 million cu.m. of dirt and sand, according to the Hunan
Provincial Water Resources Council.
</P>
<P>
The eight dredgers can reach depths of between 15-18 meters and
will have the capacity to remove 23 million cu.m of silt annually.
</P>
<P>
The flood season is rapidly approaching and local officials are
counting heavily on the capacity of the modern equipment to
strengthen this year's flood prevention program.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Guangdong
Province, a vanguard of China's opening-up drive, not only are
benefiting from economic prosperity but also lower crime rates,
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to a recent provincial political and legal
conference revealed that in 1997 the crime rate in Guangdong
declined 11.3 percent compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that among the province's 21 prefecture-level
cities, the crime rate declined in 16. Of those 16, six dropped
more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of criminal cases of firearms, kidnaping and
robbery fell 52.4 percent, 52.5 percent and 13.9 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the Pearl River Delta, the most
prosperous region of Guangdong, registered an 11-percent decline
in criminal cases, compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attribute the improved social order primarily to
the national anti-crime campaign and the establishment of safe
communities across the province.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 safe communities now cover 60 percent of the
province's territory.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 63 counties have started police emergency
call service and all of the province's counties now have their own
police patrols.

Since it opened in 1998, the Guiyang Customs Office has helped
the province develop economic ties with other parts of the world,
said Director-General Lian Wensheng.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of export and import companies
registered in the Customs office has increased from a few to
86 over the recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Customs also make efforts to simplify their clearance
procedure to make import and export more efficient, said Lian.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off. According to latest statistics,
Guizhou in 1997 handled 630 million U.S. dollars in imports and
exports, increasing by seven percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the Customs, local products sell well abroad
including metals, electronic and mechanical products, chemicals
and textiles.
</P>
<P>
The province is now making preparations for the opening of
direct container transport by train to Hong Kong,
according to Lian.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Attempts to Ensure Uninterrupted Flow of Yellow River (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- "Rain from the Heavens fill the
Yellow River which then surges forward and empties into a sea of
no return", a well-known poetic line by ancient Tang Dynasty
(618-907) Li Bai seemingly reassures people of the rivers
inexhaustible water resources.
</P>
<P>
However, the poet would most likely never have penned the line
had he known that the water in the middle and lower reaches of the
Yellow River, the cradle of Chinese nation, would stop flowing for
272 days since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River meanders through China for 5,464 km and is
dubbed as the "mother river of the Chinese nation". The river
finds its sources in the Bayanhar Mountains in northwest China's
Qinghai Province, flows in an easterly direction through nine
provinces and autonomous regions, and empties into the sea in east
China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
 Contributing Problems
</P>
<P>
The river has gone dry more frequently and for longer periods
since the first incidence of interrupted water flow was reported
in the lower reaches in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The root of the problem is largely blamed on inadequate water
resources and sharp increases of water consumption, as well as the
serious waste of water in terms of both production and daily
life, the lack of a unified management system governing the use of
water resources in the Yellow River Valley, and water pollution.
</P>
<P>
Interruptions in the water flow of the Yellow River has caused
great economic damages to the country. Information from east China's
Shandong Province said that its areas in the lower reaches of the
river suffered over 13 billion yuan in economic losses and 3.6
million local population had difficulty of obtaining drinking
water in 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guangdou, a well-known Chinese hydrologist, said the
problem symbolizes the overall deterioration of the ecological
environment in the entire Yellow River Valley, an area with a
population of well over 140 million people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that continuing environmental deterioration has not
only caused desertification and a loss of biological diversity in
the lower reaches of the river, but has also directly threatened
economic development and the livelihoods of residents in affected
areas.

<P>
Diversion Program
</P>
<P>
Chinese hydrologists have proposed implementation of a
south-north water diversion program to divert water from Yangtze
River in the south to the Yellow River in order to completely
solve problems related to the uninterrupted water flow and
inadequate water resources of the latter river valley.
</P>
<P>
Three options have been formulated for the program -- eastern,
central, western routes. Hydrologists are currently leaning to the
eastern route as the most desirable alternative.
</P>
<P>
The eastern route will involve diverting water from the Yangtze
near Yangzhou City in Jiangsu Province to the Yellow River and
eventually on to Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province via the
existing Hangzhou-Beijing Grand Canal and various other rivers
running parallel with the canal.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Province. located in the lower reaches of the Yellow
River, is already diverting water from Yangtze River near Jiangdu
in Jiangsu Province to Dongping Lake, with the current annual
diversion volume estimated at between 800-940 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Realization of the three water diversion routes will require a
combined static investment of 219 billion yuan, with the completed
projects pumping additional 49.3 billion cu.m. of water into the
Yellow River annually.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zhiyao, a well-known Chinese specialist on harnessing of the
Yellow River, called for an immediate execution of the eastern
route as the option is more realistic according to the current
conditions.
</P>
<P>
There would be many practical problems in executing the
south-north water diversion program due to the huge investment
needed and a wide range of technical difficulties in designing and
construction, though the realization of such program will
undoubtedly increase water resources in the Yellow River, said the
specialist who also urged economizing on water.

<HEADLINE> Drexler Reported to Coach University of Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Houston Rockets all-star guard
Clyde Drexler will leave the National Basketball Association to
coach his University of Houston, local reports said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local radio said Drexler might be named to the post as early as
Wednesday and would hire two assistants who were former teammates
on the college club that finished second in the 1983 US college
finals.
</P>
<P>
Drexler would neither confirm nor deny the reports while
Rockets spokesman Tim Frank said, "He is a Rocket, he has a
contract through the rest of the season."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Drexler would be a free agent at the end of
the season and he can do anything he wants to do.
</P>
<P>
Drexler, 35, leads Rocket scorers with 18.6 points, 5.5 assists
and 4.8 rebounds per game with a 43 percent shooting percentage.
</P>
<P>
His departure was surely to be a big blow to the Rockets that
stand seventh in the Western Conference after winning the NBA
titles in 1994 and 1995 when Michael Jordan attempted his baseball
ventures.

CHANGSHA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan Province, has employed
10 retired officials to supervise the working styles of in-service
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Wu Mengnan, a leading official with the municipal disciplinary
inspection commission, remarked at a news conference that the move
is part of the municipal government's effort to build a clean and
honest government.
</P>
<P>
As retired officials, the 10 supervisors are quite familiar
with governmental work and have easy access to the opinions of
ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that by setting up "transfer stations,"
the government could get more candid opinions.
</P>
<P>
Chen Rongjie, 81, has voluntarily acted as a supervisor during
the past dozen years, and has been named by local residents as the
"Pacific Police," namely someone who is concerned about everything.
</P>
<P>
Chen was excited at the news that he is among the 10
supervisors selected, saying: "I'll be an excellent supervisor as
I am no longer a 'self-employed' one."

NEW DELHI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Ministry of India
has allocated 25 billion rupees (650 million U.S. dollars) for
indigenous production of warships to bolster its aging navy fleet,
a leading Indian daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project covers construction of three frigates which will be
smaller in tonnage than the Delhi class destroyers (6,500 tons),
said the Indian Express.
</P>
<P>
It would take nearly a year to start construction of these
frigates, named Project 17.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Navy has for the first time used information
technology intensively as a tool in the design of the Project 17
class frigates, which has quickened the entire process.
</P>
<P>
The time-frame for Project 17 from the conception to sanction
stage took the navy four years. The navy refined the design of the
Type 15, or Delhi class destroyer, to develop the Type 17 class
frigate.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India reported Monday that India's cabinet
Committee on Security had approved a plan to build an aircraft
carrier at the cost of 15 billion rupees (390 million U.S.

<P>
BUCHAREST, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Government on
Tuesday adopted a draft budget for fiscal 1998 that promises to
rein in the country's runaway hyper-inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian news agency said that under the budget, the
government will keep inflation rate under 45 percent, budget
deficit under 3.6 percent of the nation's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP), and try to achieve a zero economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, the government's financial income in 1998
will be 13.3 billion U.S. dollars while spending will reach 14.9
billion dollars, running a deficit of 1.54 billion dollars. The
country's GDP is expected to total 42.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Dainanu called fiscal 1998 a
harsh year. Experts said the targeted inflation rate, which is far
below the 1997 figure of more than 150 percent, is hard to achieve.
</P>
<P>
The budget was to be submitted to the parliament for review
later this week or early next week.

BUDAPEST, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A powerful blast caused
extensive damage but no injuries at the home of a Hungarian
opposition party leader, police chief Attila Berta said Tuesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Sentenced to 30 Years for Conspiracy </HEADLINE>

<P>
Phnom Penh, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Prince Norodom Ranariddh was
sentenced in his absence to 30 years in prison Wednesday for
conspiring to overthrow the coalition government with the help of
Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
It is the second trial of the deposed first prime minister in
his absence. On March 4, he was convicted of illegally buying and
transporting weapons and sentenced to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
As in the first trial, Ranariddh, who is self-exile in Bangkok,
chose not put up a defense and refused to recognize the charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Funcinpec Party generals Nhiek Bun Chhay,
Serey Kosal and Chao Sambath were all sentenced to 20 years in
prison. General Chao sambath is believed to have been executed in
the wake of the July fighting.
</P>
<P>
The prince and his three co-defendants were charged with
violating three separate laws, one of them the 1994 statute
outlawing the Khmer Rouge, which carries a maximum life sentence
and a minimum of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The other two laws relate to the criminal and military
violation of national security.
</P>
<P>
An agreement signed by the prince and nominal Khmer Rouge
leader Khieu Samphan was a key part of the prosecution, along with
other evidence alleging an aggressive military alliance between
the prince and the rebel faction.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two witnesses, including the prince's former military
adviser, Tum Sambol, now military adviser to First Prime Minister
Ung Huot, testified at the Military Court trial.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses were mainly former Funcinpec Party military and
police commanders.

<HEADLINE> Mostar Airport to be Opened for Civilian Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The international mediator in
Bosnia has imposed a decision that the airport in the divided city
of Mostar will reopen to civilian traffic within a month.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Westendorp, who is responsible for implementing the
Dayton peace accord, decided Tuesday to open the airfield which
has been closed to all but NATO flights since the beginning of the
war in 1992.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman, Simon Haselock, announced in Sarajevo that the
mayor and deputy mayor of Mostar would each nominate three people
for a seven-member committee, which is in charge of the airport.
</P>
<P>
The seventh, the chairman of the committee, would be nominated
by Westendorp, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This arrangement will be valid for six months while Bosnian
Croat and Muslim leaders seek a long-term solution to the
management of the airport.
</P>
<P>
Haselock said that Westendorp exercised his power to impose
legally binding decisions to meet the economic needs of Mostar, an
important strategic post 100 kilometers south of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Croatians and Moslims there had not reached an agreement
to run the airport after months of discussion.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- India rebuffed Tuesday
Pakistan's allegation of New Delhi's involvement in recent
violence including bomb blasts in the neighboring country, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry described
Pakistan's allegation as "malicious and false", and it is directed
at "covering its own involvement in these heinous acts".
</P>
<P>
Pakistan accused India last week of its involvement in recent
train blasts in Punjub province killing 16 people and injuring 26
others.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said in a statement that "the serious and endemic
ethnic and sectarian violence with which Pakistan itself is beset
is the consequence of the encouragement which the Pakistan state
has provided to fundamentalist and terrorist groups".
</P>
<P>
In recent explosions in Tamil Nadu of southern India, some
Indian politicians held Pakistan responsible for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi police have arrested five militants including two
Pakistanis for their alleged involvement in bomb blasts in New
Delhi, capital of India, and north India over the past year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Opposition Kicks Off Censure Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai opposition leaders Wednesday
kicked off a censure debate designed to topple the present
government led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
The debate will focus on a no-confidence motion submitted to
parliament by the opposition on March 2.
</P>
<P>
The opposition reaffirmed its vow to give the government "a
very tough fight" that it claimed would reverse the public's
sentiment towards the government. But opposition leaders remained
tightlipped on what issue could be its knock-out punch.
</P>
<P>
"Things we plan to expose are not going to fade away after the
censure, as was the case with the previous no-confidence debate
(against the former government led by Chavalit Yongchaiyudh),"
said opposition leader Chalerm Yoobamrung.
</P>
<P>
The opposition is expected to concentrate on Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmannahaeminda, blaming him for having created the
economic bubble by approving a flood of foreign loans and on PM's
Office Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, criticizing him for having
changed the state investment regulations and thus compromising
Thailand's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai Tuesday expressed confidence in
surviving the biggest political challenge in his four months in
office.
</P>
<P>
Chuan also said he saw no need at the moment to change the
government alliance but added that he never expected to serve a
full four-year term despite speculation that he would do so if he
managed to maintain his popularity.
</P>
<P>
"I never think about staying a full term, but as I said before
I can't fix a time frame (for the government)," he said in a clear
indication that he would step down early once all political reform
mechanisms were in place.
</P>
<P>
"As of now there is no need to bring in any party (into the
coalition). We have a clear majority control in the House, even
though we can't call that an overwhelming majority," Chuan said.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Province Benefits from Cooperation with Coastal Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Intensifying cooperation with
relatively developed coastal areas is helping Yunnan Province
promote local economic growth and restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, is the most
important partner. The two sides worked out economic cooperation
plans for the period of 1996-2000. They already have implemented
116 cooperative projects involving 1.63 billion yuan of
investment.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-Kunming Electrical Machinery Plant, which cost the
two sides more than 10 million yuan, is scheduled to go into
production in the first quarter of this year. Shanghai Huayi Group
plans to cooperate with Yunnan's chemical sector on 20 key
projects involving 800 million yuan of investment.
</P>
<P>
The Kunming-Shanghai Fat Chemical Co. Ltd, which was designed
to make use of Yunnan's rich resources of castor-oil plant, will
produce 12,000 tons of castor oil annually.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai also helped the province train 200 senior managers and
more than 3,000 professionals.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province in south China is another major partner. By
the end of last year, the two sides had carried out 30 cooperative
projects with a total investment of 1.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, Yunnan has opened more than 2,000
cooperative projects with other provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities, and used 4.4 billion yuan in the effort.

<HEADLINE> Auto Imports Decline, Exports up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Despite tariff cuts on vehicle
imports last October, automobile and motorcycle imports declined
sharply, and their exports increased dramatically last year,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The import volume of automobiles and motor vehicles was 1.81
billion U.S. dollars, down 12.08 percent from 1996, and the export
volume reached 825 million U.S.dollars, up 21.12 percent,
according to the General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
Motorcycle imports reached 1,495 units, down 48.6 percent, and
the volume hit 2.37 million U.S. dollars, up 56.72 percent.
</P>
<P>
Car imports stood at 33,300 units, down 40 percent, with the
total value reaching 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports of luxury sedans saw a dramatic increase last year, but
import of medium-sized cars fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the largest auto exporter to China last year, earning
370 million U.S. dollars on 21,700 units sold.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that increasingly sophisticated mind-sets of
would-be car-buyer, an overcapacity in the domestic market and
steep drops in auto prices would lead to a continuing slide of
auto imports this year.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, China exported 14,800 vehicles last year, earning
190 million U.S. dollars, up 28.83 percent from 1996.

BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Practices have shown that the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops stationed in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) have implemented very well the
policy of "one country, two systems" over the past eight months
since Hong Kong's return, a senior officer said.
</P>
<P>
The troops have conducted effective defense and other duties,
setting up essential contacts with the Hong Kong SAR government,
and adapted themselves to the natural and social circumstances of
Hong Kong, said Xiong Ziren, political commissar of the troops.
</P>

"The main reason behind is that we have resolutely implemented
the policy of governing the army according to law, so that our
troops have won good reputation from Hong Kong residents," Xiong
said at a panel discussion of deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) from the PLA.
</P>
<P>
Under the new situation, he noted, governing the army in
accordance with law is the guarantee for carrying out the duties
of the troops.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Xiong suggested, certain laws or regulations
should be enacted for the appraisal of the merits of officers and
make good arrangements to displace them when they are transferred
to civilian work from the army stationed in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved a
Finance Ministry proposal to cut housing allowances and travel and
mobile-telephone expenses for all government officials.
</P>
<P>
Deputy government spokesman Pan Phuengsujarit said Tuesday that
government officials will also be banned from receiving housing
allowances and travel expenses to an area in which they request to
be relocated.
</P>
<P>
Today's Nation newspaper quoted Pan as saying that the
government will not allow officials to get reimbursement for
housing allowance if their agencies are relocated.
</P>
<P>
Pan said the government was informed that when the Public
Health Ministry moved from the Want Thewet district to the
Nonthaburii district in Bangkok, the state's housing expenses rose
from 80 million baht (2 million U.S. dollars) to 200 million baht
(5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Expenses for moving house and for mobile phones will no longer
be paid in full but be subject to a limit. A mobile-phone owner
exceeding the limit must pay the balance, said Pan.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to this, government officials
stationed overseas will face a 20-percent cut in special
allowances.
</P>
<P>
Under the Finance Ministry proposal, the Royal Degree on
Housing Allowances 1984 and the Royal Degree on Travel Expenses
1983 will be amended so that all officials will be barred from
being reimbursed for housing allowances in areas where their own
house or that of a spouse, parent or child is located.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers on China's Peaceful Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China's peaceful reunification
has become one of the most popular topics among deputies to the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top lawmaking
body, in session here since early March.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers said that the successful practice of the
principle of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong has greatly
boosted their confidence in the ultimate reunification of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Zhang Yongjun, a native of Taipei in Taiwan, said that
the principle of "one country, two systems" has is based on the
fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and has taken both
historical factors and realities into account.
</P>
<P>
"The smooth return of Hong Kong to its motherland and its
continued prosperity and stability could serve as a successful
model for the return of Macao and the settlement of the Taiwan
issue," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Edmund Hau Wah Ho from Macao, which will return to China
at the end of next year, said Macao people are fully confident in
the region's future.
</P>
<P>
"It has become a common understanding among the Macao people
that Hong Kong today is Macao tomorrow," said Ho, who is
vice-chairman of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Wilfred Wong Ying-wai from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) said that Hong Kong's return to the
motherland on July 1 last year has provided new opportunities for
Hong Kong's further development, and enabled China's interior to
take full advantage of Hong Kong's status as a global financial,
trade and shipping center.
</P>
<P>
"Once Macao returns to the motherland and the Taiwan issue is
also resolved, the Chinese nation will acquire an unprecedented
opportunity to seek great prosperity," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Liang Guangda, who is Party secretary of Zhuhai, a
booming city next to Macao in south China's Guangdong Province,
said his city is now making active efforts to prepare for the
return of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"An exit-and-entry control mansion with 90 passages, the
largest in the country, has been built, while construction of a
bridge linking Zhuhai and Macao is underway," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Liu Yiming pointed to the fact that since the political
problems between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits remain
unresolved, the expansion of cross-Straits exchanges has been
affected negatively by some imposed obstacles from the Taiwan side.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, Taiwan itself has been prevented from seeking
greater development through exploiting the affluent resources and
huge market on the Chinese mainland," he said with regret.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Set to Merge Supermarket Chains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
commercial center, plans to improve efficiency by introducing
mergers to reduce its number of supermarket chains from 14 to
10.
</P>
<P>
The city's first supermarket chain was established in 1992,
with the sector thereafter witnessing booming growth and the total
number peaking at 40 chains.
</P>
<P>
However, low-level operational scales resulted in low
efficiency and triggered a round of mergers. The total of 28
supermarkets chains in place at the end of last year has since
dwindled to only 14 operational units.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the 14 operational supermarket chains in
place at the end of 1997 had 919 outlets stores covering 330,000
square meters. Related outlets recorded total sales of some 10
billion yuan (1.20 billion US dollars), making up 6.7 percent
of the city's total retail sales.
</P>
<P>
The municipal plan calls for future supermarkets to have floor
space of some 1000 square meters.

<HEADLINE> Military Firms Shine in Civilian Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China's vast number of military
firms are playing an increasingly prominent role in civilian
production as makers of passenger aircraft, motor vehicles,
electrical appliances, toothpaste and toothbrushes.
</P>
<P>
In Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, dozens
of civilian manufacturing bases led by former military firms have
emerged, according to Feng Xichu, mayor of Xi'an and a deputy to
the National People's Congress (NPC), in session here since early
March.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an is home to 68 military enterprises and research
institutes with a workforce of more than 200,000. In 1997, the
city's defence industry produced an output value of close to 10
billion yuan, of which 75 percent came from civilian products,
Feng said.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to military enterprises making more civilian
products than military equipment, Xi'an is not alone. In southwest
China, another major military production base, civilian production
makes up more than 95 percent of the total production of the
defence industry there.
</P>
<P>
A shining example is Sichuan's Mianyang City, the country's
second biggest electronics industry center. Changhong Electronics
Group in the city, which has its origin in a defence enterprise,
produced 17 billion yuan worth of civilian goods in 1996, 54
percent of the industrial and agricultural output value of the
city of the year with a population of five million.
</P>
<P>
By now, military firms in China have built up more than 600
civilian production lines, turning out 15,000 kinds of civilian
products, their lines of business ranging from telecoms, energy,
transport, light and textile industry to pharmaceutical and
medical products and engineering construction.
</P>
<P>
Civilian production in China's defence industry has grown by 20
percent annually in recent years, and the proportion of civilian
production today accounts for 80 percent of the industry's total
production.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Restricts Anti-Nerve Gas Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
said Tuesday it will withhold the anti-nerve gas drug implicated
in the Gulf War syndrome unless a specific gas attack is imminent.
</P>
<P>
The drug, pyridostygmine bromide, or PB, was a valuable and
necessary element of defense against chemical weapons attacks,
said Gary Christopherson, acting assistant secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
But in the future, he said in a letter to the Senate Veterans'
Affairs Committee, it will be used only if intelligence indicates
imminent use of nerve agents Soman or Tabun against U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 Gulf War, the U.S. military gave PB to about
600,000 troops without their consent although the Pentagon had no
reason to believe Soman and Tabun were being used.
</P>
<P>
Instead, said an Associate Press report, intelligence indicated
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of the nerve gas Sarin.
</P>
<P>
Later, thousands of veterans have complained of undiagnosed
illnesses such as chronic fatigue, headaches, nausea, diarrhea,
depression, joint and muscle pain, memory loss and insomnia.
</P>
<P>
One theory says such illnesses may have been the result of
troop exposure to chemical weapons. Another theory suggests the
combination of PB and an insecticide called Deet as the cause.
</P>
<P>
Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, ranking Democrat on
the Senate committee, said the limited use for the drug suggests
the Pentagon never should have given it to Gulf War troops.

<HEADLINE> Herdsmen in China to End Nomadic Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- All herdsmen are expected to end
the nomadic life by the end of the century, according to Qi
Jingfa, vice-minister of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The government began assisting roaming herdsmen to settle down
12 years ago. With adequate and persevering endeavors made over
the past years, 97 percent herdsmen in the northern Inner Mongolian
Autonomous Region and 75.6 percent of herdsmen in northwestern
Gansu Province settled down by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 67 percent and 54 percent of herdsmen in Qinghai
Province and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, also in
northwest China, had dwelled in the new houses they had built by
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Practices have shown that settlement of local herdsmen helps
develop animal husbandry in a large scale and promote cultural,
technological and educational undertakings in the pastoral areas,"
Qi Jingfa said.
</P>
<P>
The way of settling down is also the best option for herdsmen
in need to become better off or become affluent, he noted.

<P>
BELGRADE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo is an internal affair of
Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic claimed again Tuesday,
when he met with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that Milosevic said
the Kosovo issue could only be solved by political means within
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Exerting pressure or intervention on internal affairs did not
accord with international policy which initiates the establishment
of equality and mutual trust between countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Plimakov said Kosovo should be given a new position beyond
cultural autonomy, under safeguarded Yugoslav territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, who arrived in Belgrade on a two-day
visit to Yugoslavia, called on Kosovo Albanian extremists to stop
terror activities and Yugoslav authorities to give up using
large-scale military force against Kosovo Albanians.

BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A mountaineering team from the
Beijing University will scale the 8,201-meter Mt. Cho Oyu next
month to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the founding of
the university.
</P>
<P>
The 17-member team, including one professor, three
master-degree candidates and five graduates, will attempt to be
the first university team in China to conquer a peak over 8,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
The mountain, sixth highest in the world, is located on the
Sino-Nepalese border. It was conquered for the first time by an
Austrian and two Nepalese sherpas from an Austrian team in October
1954.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing University squad will leave here on Friday and is
expected to arrive at the base camp in China's Tibetan Autonomous
Region on March 28 before setting off their assault on the summit
on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The university team has successfully scaled six mountains in
nine years, including the 7,546-meter Mt. Muztagata.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing University was founded on May 4, 1898.

PANAMA CITY, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Panama will open an

<P>
There were 13,175 Panama registered ships in 1997, one of the
largest commercial fleets worldwide.

<P>
More than 40 percent of the fleet's clients are scattered in
Asia. As a result, half of the Panamanian commercial ships are

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Confident of Success in Fight against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), in session here since early March, said
corruption can be effectively held in check with in-depth reform
and the establishment of a legal system suited for a socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey among 157 NPC deputies shows that more than 70
percent of the deputies believe corruption will be held in check
in a short period of time, and 99 percent of deputies express
confidence in the success of the ongoing anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Qitong, an NPC deputy and chairman of the Standing
Committee of Fujian Provincial People's Congress, said that the
gradual improvement of a legal framework in line with a socialist
market economy has laid the foundation for fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, China's top legislature has enacted 328 laws and
law-related decisions and its government has formulated more than
700 regulations. In addition, provinces, autonomous regions and
centrally-administered municipalities have formulated more than
5,000 local laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations have
formed a legal framework guiding economic activities and people's
behaviors, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Also, a series of laws regulating the activities of
law-enforcement officials such as the police, judges and
prosecutors have been enacted. And people's congresses at all
levels have intensified supervision over the implementation of
laws and regulations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that Chinese leaders have on many occasions stressed
the importance of fighting corruption, noting that this conforms
with the wish of the Chinese people to eradicate corruption.
</P>
<P>
While foreseeing a bright prospect in the fight against
corruption, many NPC deputies acknowledge that anti-corruption
will be a long-term and arduous task.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province to Exploit Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
began to enact a 13-year (1998-2010) plan to exploit water
resources in the province.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Province is the origin of China's major rivers such as
the Yangtze, Yellow and Lanchang with 62.76 billion cubic meters
of water resources, ranking 16th in the country.
</P>
<P>
The theoretical reserve of water energy in Qinghai is 23.38
million kilowatts, ranking 5th in the country.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial water conservation bureau said
that in further exploiting water resources emphasis will be placed
on water conservation construction such as small hydro-stations
and anti-drought and flood campaign facilities.
</P>
<P>
In the next 13 years, Qinghai Province will fully exploit water
resources in the eastern part of the province, Qaidam Basin, the
Huangshui River Valley, upper reaches of the Yellow and Yangtze
rivers, inland lake areas, and areas around the Qinghai River.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be taken to fully untilize water resources in the
province like repairing old water conservation projects, expanding
water-saving technology, and building small water-conservation
projects.
</P>
<P>
To ensure smooth execution of the plan, Qinghai will issue
regulations on management of state-owned water conservation
property, funds input, and water conservancy reform.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Launch Global Crime Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and the United States
are planning to launch an international academy here late this
year in a bid to provide training in the suppression of narcotics
and other transnational crimes, the Bangkok Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Winer, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state,
said Tuesday that the academy will help prepare officials in the
Asian region to deal with major organized crime.
</P>
<P>
The academy will allow countries of the region to combat drugs,
money laundering, financial crime, illegal immigrants and
violation of international property rights, Winer said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. help to set up an international law enforcement
academy in Thailand was part of the package of assistance pledged
during Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's recent talks with U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
As Thailand expects to pass its Money Laundering Bill soon,
Winer said the United States wants to see the region adopt similar
standards because it will promote financial stability and increase
market confidence.
</P>
<P>
The question of Myanmar's participation was "still being
discussed", said Winer.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Washington is against Kosovo's bid
for independence from Yugoslavia, U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott said Tuesday in Skoplje.
</P>
<P>
As quoted by reports from the Macedonian capital, where Talbott
was on a one-day tour, he warned that, if escalated, the ethnic
conflict in Kosovo could be worse than that in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Describing the recent tension in Kosovo as "explosive" and the
"most dangerous" in Europe, the U.S. official said his government
has been following the developments in the breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
Once spilled out from Kosovo in southern Serbia, where 90
percent of residents are ethnic Albanians, the crisis could
trigger a war involving a number of other countries, Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and the international community do not
support Kosovo's independence or breakaway from Yugoslavia," he
said, adding there should be no reason to change the borders.
</P>
<P>
He called, together with Macedonian Foreign Minister Blagoj
Handziski, for earlier dialogues between Belgrade and Kosovo
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
To address the risk of the Kosovo crisis spreading into
Macedonia, Talbott suggested the United Nations peacekeeping
forces in Macedonia should stay or be replaced by other troops.
</P>
<P>
The current mandate of the U.N. troops will expire August 31.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no defense vacuum in Macedonia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who arrived at Skoplje on Monday evening after visits
to Croatia and Albania, was scheduled to continue his Balkan tour
into Bulgaria and Romania on Tuesday evening.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will set up 500
vocational training centers for youth by year 2000 to resolve the
unemployment problem here which is expected to be aggravated with
the culmination of the 15-year civil war, the official Daily News
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vocational Training and Rural Industries Minister Amarasiri
Dodangoda was quoted as saying that already 171 provincial
training centers and 11 district centers have been set up
countrywide to train youth in typewriting, shorthand, scientific
dress making, beauty culture and motor cycle repairing.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the government's efforts to resolve the
unemployment problem, the private sector and non-governmental
organizations have been mobilized.
</P>
<P>
The main problem was to find employment for those who pass out
from schools and universities to suit their academic
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
There were thousands of unemployed people who were certificate
holders and therefore it was necessary to provide some sort of
vocational training to enable them to be self employed or qualify
for jobs in the private sector or abroad, the minister said at a
rally recently, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
There was demand from abroad for technicians such as welders,
pipe fitters, jewelers and wood technologists. These offers should
be taken up for the benefit of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Vocational Training Authority, however, plans to train at
least 15,000 young people this year and increase its capacity to
25,000 by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Opens Financial Sector Wider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- This largest economic center of
China continued to open its financial sector last year, according
to a senior banker.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's number of operational overseas financial
institutions rose by four to 51 by the end of last year, said Mao
Yingliang, president of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank
of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
He added that the licensed overseas financial institutions
represent 15 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Also last year overseas financial institutions opened 18 new
representative offices in Shanghai, bringing to 163 the
municipality's total number of such offices.
</P>
<P>
The experimentation in yuan business by nine overseas banks in
the Pudong New Area has produced positive effects, Mao said,
adding that more oversas banks will be approved to deal in the
local currency this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 24 licensed overseas banks have moved their branch
offices to Pudong, a rising finance and trade zone separated from
downtown Shanghai by the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the 45 overseas financial
institutions in the banking business in Shanghai had 17.6 billion
U.S. dollars in assets by the end of last year, up 29 percent from
a year ago. Their outstanding loans were up 48 percent to 13.3
billion U.S. dollars while their unpaid deposits rose 39 percent
to 1.9 billion U.S. dollars. Their post-tax profit grew 28 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
The overseas banks saw their overdue loans down slightly to
1.15 percent of their lending portfolio last year, while the
majority of their loans were directed to such industries as
electronics, chemicals, manufacturing, finance, and transportation.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded insurance companies in Shanghai reported a
combined premium income of 616 million yuan last year, up 23.2
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The influence of overseas financial institutions in Shanghai
has spread to neighboring areas, with 56 percent of loans extended
to borrowers outside Shanghai, Mao said.

GENEVA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese diplomat
said Tuesday that common ground and cooperation should be sought
during the 54th session of the Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jianmin, the head of the Chinese delegation to the session,
made the remark at a meeting discussing the agenda of the present
session, which began on Monday and will end on April 24.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the 53 member states of the commission came
from five continents with different historical and cultural
background, it was natural for them to have different views on
this or that question.
</P>
<P>
But more importantly, he said, the member states had much
common ground.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, we all recognize the universality of human
rights; we are all committed to the promotion and protection of
human rights; we all agree that no country's human rights
situation is perfect, there is always room for improvement."
</P>
<P>
"It is for us to identify our common ground and create an
atmosphere of equality and mutual respect for cooperation," Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
Only under the spirit of cooperation, on the basis of equality
and mutual respect , can the Human Rights Commission find its way
out of the blind alley of useless confrontation, he said.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Home favorite Patrick Isaksson
won his golden double by taking both the 50-meter and 200-meter
breaststroke titles on the first day of a two-day World Cup
swimming meeting in Malmo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Isaksson, the 100m breaststroke winner at last April's
short course championships in Gothenburg, savored his big win in
the 200m, which was not his speciality, by beating some of the
world's best including world record holder Phil Rogers of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
He clocked two minutes 10.42 seconds in the 200, ahead of
European champion Alexander Goukov in second on 2:11.04 and
Australia's Ryan Mitchell in 2:11.35. Rogers finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
"What was good was to beat three people who can swim about 2:08
and especially Mitchell who I haven't swum against before,"
Isaksson said.
</P>
<P>
Isaksson, who won a double victory in the last World Cup in
Sheffield, England, at the weekend in the 50 and 100 meters,
considered the 100 his best event.
</P>
<P>
Early, Isaksson won the 50 meters in 27.80 seconds, ahead of
Dominico Fioravanti of Italy on 28.21.
</P>
<P>
Christian Keller of Germany became another double gold medalist
by winning both the 400m and 100m individual races.
</P>
<P>
He took the 400 meters in a time of 4:13.40, more than a second
clear of Canada's Curtis Myden and won the 100 meters in 55.43,
ahead of Denmark's Jakob Andersen on 55.51.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 200 freestyle, Louise Joehncke of Sweden edged
Costa Rica's Claudia Poll, the 1996 Olympic champion, for the top

<HEADLINE> Philippines Approves Deal With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
approved a two-year-long precautionary program with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) which is expected to be
implemented in April, the Business Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Memorandum for Economic and Financial Policies (MEEP) has
already been signed by Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson and
Finance Secretary Salvador Enriquez, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, which will replace the existing IMF program for
the country, will be forwarded for approval to the IMF executive
board which would meet on March 28 or 29, Enriquez was quoted as
saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, the country's gross national product is
expected to grow by 3 percent in 1998, and 4 to 5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Average inflation would be kept at between 7.5 and 8.5 percent
this year, and at 6 to 7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also provides for banking reforms, which include
an increase in minimum capital, higher provisioning and reducing
intermediation costs.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is expected to exit from the decades-long IMF
economic supervision after it graduates from the present IMF
program at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
But the government entered the so-called precautionary
arrangement program with the IMF in order to obtain billions of
dollars of loans to cope with the current currency crisis.

<HEADLINE> China-Canada Project Benefits Uygur Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Supihan, a woman farmer in
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, received a 600-yuan loan from a
China-Canada project six months ago. She has not only paid back
the loan but also has earned an additional 550 yuan.
</P>
<P>
She was one of 320 poor Uygur women in Yiliqi Township of Hotan
city in northwest China who received the aid from the five-year
income-creating project for women, coded the CC97 Program.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Canadian government provided 4.6 million Canadian
dollars of free aid to 320 Uygur women farmers in four villages of
the city to help them improve life.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the women spent the loan fattening cattle and
sheep, while the rest were involved in small businesses and
growing vegetables. All of them have improved their living
conditions by varying margins, and now they have received a second
loan of 1,000 yuan each.
</P>
<P>
The loan recipients also participated in training in health
care, environmental protection, animal husbandry, forestry, and
literacy organized by the program administration office.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians will have another 640 Uygur women join the
program and increase the annual loan in the next four years, local
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Hopes to Return for Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- New York Knicks center Patrick
Ewing, who received his wrist surgery in December, said on Tuesday
he hoped to return to the court for the season's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Ewing, 35, who was expected to be sidelined until next season,
said "my goal is to definitely come back for the playoffs. If it
were up to me, I would play tonight."
</P>
<P>
Ewing, a 2.13 meter star center at his 13th NBA year, suffered
a dislocated right wrist and torn ligaments on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old veteran had the cast and three pins removed on
February 15, triggering speculation he could return if the Knicks
make the playoffs. Playoff rosters must be set by April 20.
</P>
<P>
Ewing, 11-time NBA All-Star, increased his range of motion to
60 percent and his strength to 50 percent 12 weeks after the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
"All through the rehab and all through the time in the cast, I
kept my mind strong. I kept thinking about coming back," added
Ewing, whose team has gone 20-18 in his absence.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks stand sixth in the Eastern Conference in a tight
race for the eight East playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
Ewing, who signed a four-year 68 million dollars contract
during the offseason, was averaging team highs of 20.8 points and
10.2 rebounds before the injury.
</P>
<P>
He eclipsed 22,000 career points earlier this season and needs
222 rebounds to become just the sixth player in history with
20,000 points and 10,000 rebounds.

To improve local farmers' awareness of scientifically utilizing

STOCKHOLM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The head of Denmark's Liberal
Party has resigned after his center-right opposition coalition
lost the general election on March 11.
</P>
<P>
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, 56, was due to give a press conference

An opinion poll published before voting indicated the

defeat the center-left ruling coalition of the Social Democrats
and the Radicals led by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, and
Ellemann-Jensen would have become Denmark's next prime minister.

However, the ruling coalition won the election, taking 90 seats
in the 179-seat parliament. Ellemann-Jensen's opposition was one
seat behind. Rasumssen will remain in power to form the next

<HEADLINE> Brazil Names Players For Clash against Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Romario and Bebeto were
summoned on Tuesday to complete the Brazilian team for a World Cup
warmup against Germany next week.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian squad is to be composed of 10 players from local
clubs and 12 in foreign teams who were named last week. Most of
them are sure names at the World Cup this summer.
</P>
<P>
On March 25, the Brazilians will fly to Stuttgart to face
Germany for a true test of their capability to retain the World
Cup title under coach Mario Zagallo.
</P>
<P>
Romario and Bebeto were the pair who led Brazil to its fourth
World Cup title in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Besides them, the Brazilian roster includes goalie Taffarel and
midfielder Denilson, both considered starters on the Cup team.
</P>
<P>
Defenders Junior Baiano, Goncalves and Ze Roberto are also sure
to make the final cut.
</P>
<P>
However, there also were some surprises. Goalie Dida got the
nod over Carlos Germano, repeatedly called by Zagallo as the No. 2
goalie. Fullback Cleber of Palmeiras also got a chance.
</P>
<P>
The big surprise was lateral Ze Carlos of Sao Paulo, who will
make his debut on the national team. That may be a sign that
Zagallo wasn't happy with the much-criticized play of Ze Maria in
the Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
Following are the namelist for the friendly:
</P>
<P>
Goalies: Taffarel (Atletico Mineiro) and Dida (Cruzeiro)
</P>
<P>
Defenders: Roberto Carlos (Real Madrid), Cafu (Roma), Aldair
(Roma), Ze Carlos (Sao Paulo), Junior Baiano (Flamengo), Goncalves
(Botafogo) and Ze Roberto (Flamengo)
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The service sector has become a
major contributor to economic growth in Shanghai, accounting for
44 percent of the more than 336 billion yuan of gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The service sector registered 153 billion yuan in added value
last year, a 17.7 percent rise from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, banking and insurance businesses generated 47.25
billion yuan of added value, a 26 percent rise over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Stock Exchange conducted more than 2,980 billion
yuan in turnover last year and the local China Foreign Exchange
Trading Center dealt with 69.71 billion U.S. dollars in turnover.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, all banks in the city had had more than
556 billion yuan of savings and 372 billion yuan for loans. The
city had 2,634 Chinese banking institutions and 11 insurance
companies by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last year, added value generated by local posts and
telecommunications, transportation, commercial businesses, and
real estate rose 8.4 percent, 4.6 percent, 21.2 percent and 15.3
percent, respectively, over 1996.

<HEADLINE> Roger Milla Ready to Coach Cameroon for World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Cameroon's retired star Roger
Milla said he was ready to take the helm of coaching his national
soccer squad for the World Cup finals in France this summer.
</P>
<P>
Local reports on Tuesday quoted Milla as saying that "Cameroon
still has a coach at the moment. But I've already been contacted,
and I am ready because it would be a very exciting job."
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Milla scored four goals to pace the Indomitable Lions
to the quarterfinals in the World Cup in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon did not lose a game en route to qualifying for the
World Cup under Belgian coach Henri Depieux who was replaced for
the last game against Zimbabwe by Jean Manga Onguene.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Milla works as an assistant coach in Montpellier,
the southern French city where Cameroon will face Italy in Group B.
</P>
<P>
In a group which also features Chile and Austria, Milla said
that "our players have only started their national team careers.
It's a young team, perhaps some stars will emerge during the World
Cup."
</P>
<P>
Milla, the Africa's player of the year in 1976 and 1990, said
Italy was the favorite to advance and Austria could also make the
second round.
</P>
<P>
In the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Milla, 42, scored
his team's only goal in a 6-1 loss to Russia, becoming the oldest
player to ever score in World Cup finals.

PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Lazio of Italy entered the UEFA Cup
semifinals for the first time after drawing 2-2 with AJ Auxerre of
France in the second leg of the quarter-finals in Auxerre, France.

<P>
The tie meant that Lazio advanced with a 3-2 victory on

</P>

In the 13th minute, Guerino Gottardi made it 2-0 when he scored
on a pass from Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved.

Stephane Guivarc'h, who converted a free kick.
</P>
<P>
Guivarc'h scored again 10 minutes from time with a header but

<P>
ROME, March 17 (Xinhua) -- German Erik Zabel outpaced his
rivals to win his second stage of the Tirreno-Adriatico cycling
race on Tuesday while Rolf Jaermann held the overall lead with one
day left.
</P>
<P>
Along the relatively flat 164-kilometer route around Civitanova
Marche, some 30 riders still jamed in the leading field with three
kilometers left.
</P>
<P>
Zabel, who won three stages at the 1997 Tour de France, dashed
ahead to edge Italy's Mario Manzoni and Denmark's Rolf Sorensen at
the finish.
</P>
<P>
All were credited with an official time of 4 hours 16 minutes
and 2 seconds as was Switzerland's Jaermann, the 17th man across
the line.
</P>
<P>
However, Jaerman still led the overall standing by four seconds
against Franco Ballerini with only one stage remained, the eighth
162-km stage from Grottammare to San Benedetto del Tronto on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jens Heppner was third with 1:03 behind, and Sorensen ranked
fourth.
</P>
<P>
The Tirreno-Adriatico was considered a major tuneup for the
March 21 Milan-to-San Remo classic, the first event of the 1998
World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Float Europeso Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines is planning to issue 150 million to 200 million U.S.
dollars worth of Europeso bonds to boost its gross international
reserves, the Manila Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying
Tuesday the floatation of the Europeso bonds would be on top of
the 1 billion dollars worth of club-loans that it plans to borrow
from a syndicate of international investment banks.
</P>
<P>
The Europeso bond is a peso-denominated debt instrument floated
in international markets.
</P>
<P>
So far, 12 banks have committed to lending 600 million dollars
to the Philippines but the central bank plans to tap other banks
to bring up the amount to 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
At least two foreign banks have submitted formal offers to
underwrite the central bank's Europeso bond issue, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Department of Finance announced that it would sell
as much as 500 million dollars of 10-year global bonds this year.
</P>
<P>
The plan comes as the central bank aims to boost its foreign
currency reserves to 12 billion dollars in 1998 from the current
9.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Europeso bond may have a maturity of three to five
years, according to Cristina Orbeta, director of the central
bank's external debt management department.

<P>
HEFEI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
become a major tourist attraction in the country because of its
wider forest coverage.
</P>
<P>
Mountainous areas in the province provide more than 266,000
hectares, 73 percent of which are covered with trees.
</P>
<P>
The province leads the country in terms of the number of forest
parks. It now has 23 state-level and 12 province-level forest
parks totaling nearly 114,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The forest parks attract 4 million domestic and overseas
tourists per year.

<P>
During recent years, the province has raised millions of yuan
through different channels for the planning and construction of
local forest parks.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 local forest parks, including those at Huangshan
and Juihuashan mountains, have been opened to overseas visitors
and are expected to earn more than 100 million yuan a year.

<HEADLINE> EU Hopes Remaining Tickets Away from French Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Tuesday urged
the World Cup organizers in France to keep the remaining tickets
away from the French fans to calm the furor of the EU community.
</P>
<P>
The EU gave the organizers until the end of the week to present
a plan for the remaining tickets for the finals or face sanctions.
</P>
<P>
As a majority of the 2.5 million tickets had been sold in
France, the executive commission of the 15-nation EU insisted that
the remaining 160,000 seats go exclusively to non-French nationals.
</P>
<P>
"It's necessary to counterbalance major discrimination," said
EU spokesman Stefan Rating.
</P>
<P>
"If they are not forthcoming we will have to proceed," he said,
adding legal steps could result in heavy fines.
</P>
<P>
The CFO has been the target of criticism as tickets for foreign
fans were far away from the huge demand and two-thirds were put on
the French market.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they received 20 million requests for tickets
for the 64 games but the ten stadiums could only accommodate a
fraction of that demand.
</P>
<P>
Of the 160,000 remaining tickets, 50,000 already are allocated
for foreign soccer federations, with the 110,000 aimed at the
public at large.
</P>
<P>
"The whole issue is whether the `general public' includes
French nationals," said Rating.

<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Faced with worsening traffic
congestion, many taxi riders in the Chinese capital began
returning to buses with the advent of a special bus lane last June.
</P>
<P>
The lane is on one of Beijing's busiest streets, Chang'an
Avenue, which runs east-to-west across the heart of Beijing. It is
a major street for public transportation.
</P>
<P>
Traffic authorities say only buses and mini-buses approved by
the police can use the lane, which will help increase bus speed
and encourage more people to ride them.
</P>
<P>
"The buses are faster than before, and they are convenient and
punctual," said Miss Deng, who works for a foreign-funded company
in the east part of the city.
</P>
<P>
Taxis often get jammed on the road during the peak traffic
hours and are difficult to stop on the sides of the street because
of the bus lane limits, she said, "so I gave up taxis and started
taking buses."
</P>
<P>
To date, the city has opened 22 bus routes. Half of those are
double-deckers or air-conditioned. Fifteen more bus routes will be
operational this year. At the same time, urban residents are
returning to the subway and mini buses.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city's public transportation system
handles 10.2 million passengers per day. Of those, 15 percent are
taxi riders.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Backs India's Agricultural Support Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced here
Tuesday that it will provide 196.8 million U.S. dollars to back
India's National Agricultural Support Project (NATP) in a bid to
accelerate agricultural growth in the country.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to speed up the reform and
strengthening of the country's agricultural technology development
and dissemination system.
</P>
<P>
In the long-run, the project will bring benefits to farmers,
especially the poor, by improving the supply of relevant and
practical agriculture technologies to help increase productivity
and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The project will establish research priority-setting mechanisms
and shift orientation of research to give greater attention to
issues affecting sustainability of production systems, address
stagnation of yield growth in intensive irrigated agriculture and
improve productivity of rain-fed agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is some 239.7 million dollars. Of
the World Bank financing of 196.8 million dollars, a 100 million
dollar interest-free credit will be provided by the International
Development Association (IDA), the Bank's concessionary lending
arm and the remaining 96.8 million dollar loan will be provided by
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).
The Indian government will contribute some 42.9 million dollars
for the project.

CANBERRA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Treasurer Peter Costello vowed Tuesday to fight the states,
business and welfare groups on the goods and services tax (GST),
saying the government would reject the demand from business and
welfare lobby that a GST should not be used to increase indirect
taxes on the community.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government has launched an overhaul of company
laws and set up a task force to establish Australia as a leading
business and financial center in the Asia region.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Some of the world's leading information technology companies
were planning to expand in Australia, Chairman of Microsoft Bill

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defends Training Program for Indonesian Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
on Tuesday defended its military program to train Indonesian
troops despite complaints from some lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Congress set a ban in 1992 to ban any programs for training of
foreign troops, but the State Department said the training program
for Indonesian troops was not covered by the six-year-old law.
</P>
<P>
"This training is legal and, in our view, in conformance with
the expressed intent of Congress," State Department spokesman
James Rubin said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Those joint exercises involving Indonesian troops "enhance
American military readiness and increase U.S. engagement" with
this important Southeast country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the Indonesian
forces trained by the Pentagon include a special forces commando
unit called Kopassus.
</P>
<P>
It said the unit had received training from U.S. special
operations soldiers in skills like psychological warfare and
reconnaissance missions.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress were quoted by the newspaper as saying
that the administration had been acting in bad faith by continuing
training despite the ban.
</P>
<P>
Nancy Pelosi, a Democratic Representative, said the training
"is certainly not within the spirit" of the 1992 law. "It raises
serious questions about a violation of congressional intent. It
is clear that it is a circumvention of Congress."
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said the administration "has in no way attempted to
mislead Congress, and administration officials have discussed
military exercises and training in Indonesia with relevant
committees on a number of occasions in recent years."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Job Approval Rating Remains High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Following former White House
aide Kathleen Willey's charge of impropriety against U.S.
President Bill Clinton, new polls show Americans are divided over
whom to believe, but they continue to give Clinton high marks for
job performance.
</P>
<P>
The polls released Tuesday were the first since Willey aired
her allegations Sunday night on CBS' "60 Minutes" program. Clinton
denied doing anything improper, and the White House released a
barrage of friendly, private notes from Willey to Clinton after
the alleged incident in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
An ABC News poll put Clinton's job approval rating at a 63
percent but showed 50 percent of Americans saying they have a
favorable impression of Clinton, and 46 percent viewing him
unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
A CNN/USA Today/Gallup survey said Clinton's approval rating
had actually increased last week to 67 percent, but the 651 adult
Americans polled Monday were divided over whether to believe the
president or his accuser.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Panel Approves Budget Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A key U.S. Senate panel
Tuesday approved the administration's request for 1.8 billion U.S.
dollars to keep troops in Bosnia past a now-abandoned June
deadline and to maintain U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Appropriations Committee split the administration's
spending request into two bills, one containing the 18 billion
U.S. dollars for the IMF and the other containing everything else.
</P>
<P>
Both the bills were approved by a 26-2 vote and sent to the
full Senate, for action perhaps as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
But the committee attached to the spending bill a provision
urging President Clinton to make greater strides in getting allies
to shoulder more costs of confronting Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the panel also tacked on a series of conditions to
the IMF bill intended to pressure the IMF into reforming some of
its practices, calling on the IMF to comply with international
trade obligations in making loans.
</P>
<P>
The Senate version did not include one provision that has drawn
a threatened veto by President Clinton _ abortion restrictions on
international family planning groups. Such a restriction remains
under active consideration in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The measure also includes 610 million U.S. dollars for disaster
relief, the bulk of it as a result of violent weather caused by El
Nino; and 196 million U.S. dollars to help fix year 2000 computer
problems at the Federal Aviation Administration and the Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
The bill includes 1.3 billion U.S. dollars to help offset the
cost to the Pentagon in the current fiscal year of maintaining the
expanded U.S. military presence near Iraq; and 383 million U.S.
dollars for peacekeeping operations in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Hit Record Closing Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- All the three major stock markets
in Europe surged strongly and ended at fresh record closing highs,
boosted by the Dow's strong overnight advance, steady Asian
markets and large sums of institutional funds seeking higher
yielding investments.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading share closed at 5,834.9, up
49.8 points or 0.86 percent, hitting its fourth record close of
the month, lifted by a strong overnight performance by shares on
Wall Street and the market was largely unaffected by the UK budget
speech from Chancellor Gordon Brown.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE shrugged off the budget, rising just three points in
the period after Brown began his speech.
</P>
<P>
The Paris CAC-40 index closed at 3,661.63, rising 63.37 points
or 1.76 percent, although below an all-time high set earlier in
the session as Wall Street's weaker opening weighed on the market,
still a fresh record for the third consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
The market was boosted by continuing earnings optimism among
domestic investors and strong buying interest from foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index also ended firmer at 4,946.68,
up 62.83 points or 1.29 percent, a fresh record closing high.
Dealers said that the index was supported by the overnight gains
on Wall Street, a firm bond market and positive corporate news.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: Malnutrition Constitutes Global "Silent Emergency" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Malnutrition constitutes a
global "silent emergency," killing millions every year and sapping
the long-term economic vitality of nations, according to a latest
report of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The statistics on malnutrition are grim. Nearly 12 million
children under the age of five die annually, and malnutrition is a
culprit in 55 percent of these deaths, the UNICEF said in The
State of the World's Children 1998.
</P>
<P>
Iron deficiency Anaemia is a contributing factor in over 20
percent of post-birth maternal deaths in Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
About 43 million people worldwide are suffering from varying
degrees of brain damage due to iodine deficiency. Some 226 million
children are stunted (shorter than they should be for their age);
nearly 67 million are estimated to be wasted (weigh less than they
should for their height); and about 183 million weigh less than
they should for the age.
</P>
<P>
The situation in sub-Saharan Africa is more serious than in
other regions of the world, where every third child is underweight
while two out five are stunted, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Mulnutrition is a tangle of two mutually reinforcing factors:
insufficient nutrient intake and illness, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Its root cause, therefore, is poverty at the household,
community and national levels, the report points out.
</P>
<P>
The report urges governments concerned to build widespread
awareness of the roots and consequences of malnutrition, along
with ways of reducing it.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Tuesday that the American troops will remain in the
Gulf until Iraq could prove to have complied with U.N. resolutions
to destroy all chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi officials had repeatedly claimed to have
destroyed their stores of chemical and biological weapons, but he
still believed the arsenal had not been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said on Sunday that there were still 130 tons of chemical
precursors and 15,600 biological munitions kept by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"That's why the international community must remain vigilant.
and that's why we will maintain our forces in the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has about 35,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen
and marines on alert in the Gulf.
</P>

Cohen did not put any limit on the amount of time U.S. forces
in the Gulf region will remain at their current level.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs British Peacemaking Effort in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright supports the efforts by British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook in reviving the Middle East peace process,
said the State Department Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"She has great confidence in him personally and in the
intentions that he is pursuing at the request of the European
Union to visit Israel and to try to promote peace in the region,"
State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose country is holding the rotating presidency of the
European Union, touched off a ruckus by meeting with a Palestinian
official at a Jewish housing project on the outskirts of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Let me say that we have long welcomed Europe's interest in the
Middle East, particularly their strong economic support for the
Palestinians," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman added, "we were not consulted on the
specific itinerary of the trip that he took."
</P>
<P>
Cook met with Salah al-Ta'mari, a Palestinian legislator who
has led a fight against the housing project, after promising not
to.
</P>
<P>
Cook's visit to the project site was viewed by the Israeli
government as a gesture of support to Palestinians claims to east
Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials also were incensed by Cook's decision not to
visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial _ a regular stop for
foreign dignitaries. Instead, he chose to lay a wreath at a
memorial for Deir Yassin, scene of a massacre of Palestinians by a
Jewish militia in 1948.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department tried to focus attention on the
deadlock in negotiations."What we want to see from the leaders are
the tough decisions that we've long called for," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Launch Tourism Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa, Mozambique
and Swaziland will launch a joint tourism investment drive in
early May as part of a multi-million cross-border development
project.
</P>
<P>
At a ministerial meeting on the 600-million-Rand (some 121
million US dollars) Lubombo development project in Mbabane,
Swaziland, South African Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan announced
some of the investment projects.
</P>
<P>
These would include the recently declared world heritage site
at St. Lucia, the yet undeveloped Kosi Bay Lake system, both on
the South Africa's eastern coast, and the Mozambican resort town
of Ponto Do Ouro.
</P>
<P>
The anchor projects would be supported by the publicly-funded
infrastructure developments, including the construction of a new
road along the coastal reserves from Hluhluwe in South Africa's
KwaZulu-Natal province to the Maputo elephant reserve in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Construction had already begun on the South African portion of
the road and a passenger train service between South Africa's
busy seaport of Durban and Maputo, the capital city of
Mozambique, was introduced last week.
</P>
<P>
Upgrades on South Africa's national coastal highway, the N2
highway, to extend it through Swaziland to Maputo, had also begun
on the South African side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from the three countries will sign Lubombo protocols
to facilitate rapid cross-border development and traveling.
</P>
<P>
The Lubombo development project is designed to jointly build
up infrastructure, communications, tourism and trade
opportunities in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Trade and Tourism Minister Oldemiro Baloyi said
that extensive technical planning had gone into packaging the
investment opportunities, including legal, financial, and
marketing requirements.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Set up Special Guard Teams to Respond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Guard will
help local authorities to respond to potential terrorist attacks
from chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons, Defense
Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to establish 10 separate and special National
Guard teams that will be dedicated solely to assisting local
civilian authorities in the event of a chemical or biological
attack," announced Cohen in a speech at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
"These teams will arrive quickly, assess the scene and help
ensure these affected areas get the federal assistance" they need,
Cohen said in a speech at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
Noting the threat posed by such attacks as the sarin gas attack
on the Tokyo subway or the terrorist bombing of the World Trade
Center in New York, the Defense Secretary said that the nation
must be better prepared against the potential chemical or
biological attacks.
</P>
<P>
The units will help in "providing early assessment, initial
detection, and technical advice to local commanders during an
incident involving weapons of mass destruction, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The National Guard and reserve forces could be deployed to
handle reconnaissance and decontamination. A new office will
oversee coordination of the units with existing ones.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that the Department of Defense is leading a federal
effort to train the first responders in 120 American cities. "The
police, the firefighters, the medical technicians are going to be
first on the scene of an attack. We are now in the process of
helping to prepare these first responders," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department is requesting 49.2 million U.S. dollars
in next year's budget to pay for the project.
