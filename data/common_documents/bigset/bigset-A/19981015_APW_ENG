Team of '90s going home again

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The team of the '90s is running out of time.
There's only year left for the Atlanta Braves to win a second World
Series title.
	   Returning to Turner Field with grandiose plans of becoming the
first team in major league history to rebound from an 0-3 deficit,
the Braves instead gave their tomahawk-chopping fans another winter
to ponder what went wrong.
	   Those 106 regular-season wins are merely the most ever for a
team that didn't make the World Series. No one will remember that
the Braves became the first team to force Game 6 after losing the
first three games, actually coaxing their lackadaisical fans into a
sellout Wednesday.
	   San Diego is going to the World Series after a two-hit, 5-0
victory clinched the NL championship series four games to two.
	   ``I guess we could take the easy way out and never get to this
point,'' John Smoltz said. ``It stinks having to sit here and
answer these questions again. But that's reality. I'm sure there's
hundreds of players who would like to be sitting here in this
position.''
	   Danny Bautista was probably an exception.
	   He stood uncomfortably in front of his locker, trying to explain
what happened in the sixth inning when Sterling Hitchcock's soft
liner ricocheted off his glove for an error, allowing three
unearned runs that turned the game into a blowout.
	   ``As soon as he hit it, I thought I had it,'' Bautista said.
``But I lost it when it went into the lights. I did my best.''
	   Manager Bobby Cox doesn't think another World Series win is
required for the '90s Braves to earn proper recognition.
	   ``We love to win in April, May, June,'' he said. ``I don't know
if it validates anything. Some of other good teams got knocked out
even earlier than we and Cleveland.''
	   At least the Braves used to wait until the Series before losing.
The last two seasons, they haven't been able to get that far _ both
times eliminated at home in Game 6 of the NLCS, both times with Tom
Glavine on the mound, both times scuttled by one big inning.
	   A year ago, Florida scored four runs in the first, eliminated
the Braves with a 7-4 victory and went on to beat Cleveland in a
seven-game Series. Apparently content with having just as many
championships in the '90s as the Braves, the Marlins promptly
disbanded their team.
	   On Wednesday, a five-run sixth inning _ helped along greatly by
Bautista's fielding gaffe _ earned the Padres a meeting with the
New York Yankees.
	   ``We're disappointed that we didn't win this year,'' Glavine
said. ``We'll come back next year in spring training and try to win
again. I'm proud as hell to play in this organization. I've got a
chance to play in the World Series every year.''
	   Maybe the Braves, having made an unprecedented seven straight
trips to the postseason, will have to be content with that lone
World Series title, won in 1995. Maybe the Braves will have to
settle for the monotonous level of regular-season success that
allows them to reach the playoffs year after year.
	   After all, that's a truly remarkable feat considering this
25-man roster has only two holdovers, Glavine and Smoltz, from the
1991 team that got it all started.

Typhoon Zeb roars out of Philippines, heads for Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details about typhoon impact in Taiwan
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Zeb on Thursday roared out of
the Philippines, where at least four people died in mudslides, and
headed for Taiwan, disaster officials said.
	   The storm had already claimed two lives in Taiwan, where police
said a man was swept out to sea by two-story high waves as he was
fishing, and another died after being trapped overnight in heavy
rains on a mountain.
	   As of 9 a.m. (0100 GMT), Zeb, whose peak winds dropped to 165
kph (103 mph) with gusts of up to 200 kph (125 mph), was over the
South China Sea and headed for Taiwan, said weather forecaster Rene
Molina.
	   In the northern Philippines, at least 31,000 people were forced
to flee as rampaging floods swept thatch homes in Zeb's peak
sustained winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per hour.
	   Disaster officials said a 16-year-old boy taking shelter at a
church in Solano town in Nueva Vizcaya province was killed when a
wall collapsed on him. Another person was killed in a separate
landslide in the mountain resort city of Baguio in Benguet
province.
	   In Antipolo, just outside Manila, two boys, aged two and four,
died after a hill near a quarry site unleashed tons of mud and
debris into their hut.
	   Officials said they expected more casualties.
	   Government offices and schools in the area were turned into
emergency shelters.
	   Zeb's fury was beginning to be felt in Taiwan. Officials said
airport in southeastern Orchid Island closed in strong winds, and
ferry and rail services in southern Taiwan were also suspended.
	   More than 2,000 Chinese fishermen took shelter at two main
Taiwanese fishing ports as the Taiwanese boats where they were
employed docked there to avoid the high waves, port officials said.
	   Zeb, the strongest of eight storms to hit the Philippines this
year, was not expected to reach the same force it had when it
entered the country if its slams Taiwan either late Thursday or
early Friday, forecaster Molina said.
	   ``There is no warm air where the typhoon can feed to reach peak
power,'' Molina said. ``Taiwan is likely to be spared much
damage.''
	   But he said it was expected to intensify as it moves out of the
Philippines at 9 kph (6 mph).
	   Taiwan's official Central News Agency said several airlines have
canceled domestic flights to the southern port city of Kaohsiung
and nearby islets. International flights were not affected.
	   Last month, Tropical Storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers dead and 80
others missing.

After sightseeing, China, Taiwan try again to bridge differences
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated after start of talks scheduled to begin at
0815 GMT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ After marveling at Shanghai's fastpaced,
high-rise growth, Taiwan's top negotiator with rival China prepared
to meet his Chinese counterpart Thursday to try anew to bridge
differences that have chilled relations.
	   Taiwan's Koo Chen-fu and China's Wang Daohan met for the first
time in five years Wednesday, holding an hour long discussion that
mixed pleasantries with the divisive positions that have kept the
two sides from resuming the formal negotiations that Beijing
scrubbed three years ago.
	   How far apart the two negotiators remain is unclear. Wang's
aide, Tang Shubei, said after Wednesday's meeting that there were
``major differences.'' But just the fact that the two elder
statesmen met face-to-face may be enough to propel relations
between the estranged governments forward.
	   ``It's a significant visit, taking into account that it has been
five years since these two have shaken hands,'' said Su Ge, an
expert on China-Taiwan relations at Beijing's Foreign Affairs
College. ``The most important thing is for the two sides to keep in
contact. This will build momentum for relations.''
	   Political heirs to the antagonists in the Chinese civil war,
China and Taiwan split after Mao Tse-tung's communists forced
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists off the mainland in 1949.
	   Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and Nationalist Party elder,
and Wang, an 84-year-old Communist Party stalwart and mentor to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, held their first and until Wednesday
only meeting in Singapore in 1993.
	   After Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui traveled to the United
States in 1995, Beijing took it as a sign he was reneging on
eventual reunification. It canceled the lower-level dialogue Wang
and Koo started and launched test-missiles and war games near
Taiwan, straining relations to their tensest since the height of
the Cold War.
	   Ever since, Beijing has insisted that revived talks should deal
directly with thorny political issues, including reunification.
Taipei wants negotiations to pick up where they left off, settling
practical issues like fishing disputes, partly to build up
confidence between the two sides.
	   Koo pressed his practical agenda at Wednesday's meeting with
Wang and during sightseeing Thursday morning. After touring
Shanghai's Pudong district, a swath of farmland transformed over
the past decade into a collection of factories and office towers,
Koo toured the fledgling stock exchange.
	   ``Open and fair business dealings require stricter laws and more
transparent regulation,'' Koo told reporters as floor traders
looked on.
	   Taiwanese business executives _ who have committed dlrs 35
billion in investment in China over the past decade _ were to meet
Koo over lunch. He was then scheduled to meet, dine and watch a
traditional Beijing opera with Wang.
	   In an indication of the hopes China is placing on the visit, Koo
will meet Chinese President Jiang and Vice Premier Qian Qichen over
the weekend in Beijing.
	   Both sides are under pressure to achieve an accommodation.
Better ties would likely help the Nationalists win business support
in December's general elections.
	   China's Jiang is also under pressure from the military and the
communist old guard to get Taiwan to agree to reunification. With
Hong Kong's return last year and the Portuguese colony of Macau due
to follow suit next year, the island is the last piece of Imperial
China resisting Beijing's control.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After years of denial, Germany is taking a
big step toward accepting immigrants and their children by knocking
down barriers in the nation's 85-year-old citizenship law.
	   The decision by the future government is the first major policy
shift resulting from the left's election victory last month and an
important gesture to Germany's 7 million foreign residents, who
make up nearly 10 percent of the population.
	   ``This government will recognize that Germany is a country of
immigrants,'' said Kerstin Mueller, a domestic policy for the
Greens party, the junior partner in the incoming government
coalition.
	   The language took aim at outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government, which insisted that Germany is not a country of
immigrants.
	   Germany's 2 million Turks have fought especially hard for the
changes. Most Turkish children born here have grown up virtually as
Germans, but they still feel excluded from an increasingly
multicultural society by the 1913 citizenship law, which grants
automatic citizenship only on the basis of German blood.
	   Few have battled harder for change than Cem Ozdemir, born to
Turkish parents in Germany in 1965 and a lawmaker for the Greens
since 1994.
	   ``The goal clearly must be that people who live here permanently
are not foreigners, not guests, but belong to society,'' he said
Wednesday before the agreement between Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democrats and the Greens.
	   Under the plan, German-born children of foreigners will have an
automatic right to citizenship for the first time, if one of their
parents has been living in Germany since age 14.
	   Both parties also agreed on allowing dual citizenship and on
shortening foreigners' eligibility for naturalization to eight
years from 15. Current law requires Turks to give up their Turkish
passport, which many are still reluctant to do.
	   The future governing partners, who have a 21-seat majority in
the incoming parliament, plan to introduce the proposed amendments
after the new legislature convenes on Oct. 26.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right government, voted out in
Sept. 27 elections after 16 years, refused to liberalize the
citizenship law, mainly because of pressure from Bavarian
conservatives.
	   Germany began recruiting large numbers of Turkish workers in the
1960s to help fuel its postwar economic boom. In recent years, they
and their children have made headlines mainly as victims of
anti-foreigner violence, including a 1993 firebombing in which five
Turks died.
	   Nevertheless, Germany is becoming more and more multicultural.
	   Take Turkish-born Ekin Deligoz, 27, elected to parliament for
the Greens last month only a year after gaining German citizenship.
	   ``Until last year, I was only a second-class member of this
society,'' she said. ``Now I'm not only a part of it but can
actually shape the country.''

Prince Charles lithograph raises thousands for Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
hospital &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A lithograph by Prince Charles sold for
18-times its standard retail value at an auction to benefit the
hospital in the front line of Northern Ireland's worst-ever
terrorist attack .
	   The signed and dated lithograph of one of Charles' watercolors
of Windsor Castle fetched 53,000 pounds (dlrs 90,000) at an auction
Wednesday in support of County Tyrone Hospital, which treated most
of the 29 people killed and 370 wounded in an Aug. 15 car bomb
committed by IRA dissidents in the town of Omagh.
	   The picture, the first piece of art by Prince Charles to be
auctioned anywhere, had been valued by Christie's auctioneers in
London at between 2,000 and 3,000 pounds (dlrs 3,400 to dlrs
5,100).
	   But its rarity, combined with the special cause benefiting from
the auction, was likely to attract a higher price, art experts had
predicted.
	   Bidding opened at 2,000 pounds (dlrs 3,400 and soared to more
than 50,000 pounds (dlrs 85,000) in about three minutes.
	   Businesswoman and mother of three Agnes McCourt bought the
lithograph, which was the focal point of the auction.
	   Charles donated the picture after visiting the hospital and the
bomb-ravaged town three days after the attack.
	   It was sold alongside some 200 other donated works, mostly by
Irish artists including Jack Yeats, older brother of the Nobel
Prize-winning poet. More than 150,000 pounds (dlrs 255,000) was
raised in total.
	   Sarah Fisher, from the hospital's intensive care unit, said she
was ``overwhelmed'' by the response to the auction.
	   ``We really feel that the people of Dublin and all over Ireland
have embraced us in our time of need,'' she said. ``We had an idea
that the painting by Prince Charles would have a significant effect
on the auction, but we didn't expect the response that it
received.''
	   The money will buy specialist monitoring and physiotherapy
equipment to help rehabilitate the blast survivors, the hospital
said.

Soldiers begin patrolling streets in Honduras
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Soldiers have begun patrolling the
streets of Honduras' two main cities in an attempt to stop rising
crime.
	   The first soldiers on Wednesday began patrolling in Tegucigalpa,
the capital, and San Pedro Sula, 160 kilometers (100 miles) to the
north. The military plans to gradually place 10,000 soldiers
throughout the country.
	   Their mission will last ``until we've managed to scare away
crime in the country,'' said Col. Rodolfo Interiano, who is heading
the operation.
	   This is the fifth time since 1994 that the army has patrolled
Honduran streets. Previous efforts were considered failures because
the soldiers soon returned to their barracks.
	   The deployment was sought by legislators and business people
concerned that crime would scare away investors. Since 1994, 22,000
people have been the victims of violent crime in the country of 5
million.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ An 18-year-old Okinawan high school student struck
in a hit-and-run accident in which a U.S. Marine is charged has
died of her injuries, police said Thursday.
	   Yuki Uema, a high school junior hit by a car on Oct. 17, died of
a brain contusion at 10:10 p.m. Wednesday at an Okinawa city
hospital, said police spokesman Yukinori Shima.
	   U.S. Marine Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge, 23, is accused of driving
the car that hit the small motorcycle Uema was on.
	   Japanese prosecutors charged Eskridge on Tuesday with causing
injury through negligence, driving under the influence of alcohol
and leaving the scene of an accident.
	   The U.S. Marine Corps released a statement Thursday expressing
regret over the death and sorrow for her family.
	   ``This is a tragic, needless loss,'' said Lt. Gen. Frank
Libutti, Commander Marine Corps Bases, Japan. ``We know there is
little we can say to ease the Uema family's tremendous grief and
pain, but we are very sorry.''
	   U.S. Ambassador to Japan Thomas Foley also offered his
condolences in a letter sent to Uema's mother, U.S. Embassy said.
The embassy also said it will work to prevent such incidents from
happening again.
	   Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka, the government's
top spokesman, said Thursday that Tokyo plans to convey its
``strong regret'' to Washington and demand tighter discipline over
American troops in the country, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Reaction to the incident in Japan has been muted so far. But
tensions have long simmered between U.S. soldiers and residents of
Okinawa, 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan are
concentrated on Okinawa. Widespread protests broke out in 1995
after a 12-year-old girl was assaulted and raped by three U.S.
servicemen.
	   Eskridge was handed over to Japanese police on Tuesday. A second
Marine who was in the car with Eskridge was questioned by local
police and released.
	   Eskridge was stopped by gate guard as he tried to enter a
military facility. The guard noticed unusual damage to the front of
his car, including a cracked windshield.
	   The accident occurred on a highway near the young woman's home
in the Okinawan city of Ginowan. Police suspect a second car also
hit Uema after the first collision, Kyodo News said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Zeb roared out of the
Philippines on Thursday, leaving at least 21 people dead, including
a South Korean, and causing floods and mudslides that swept away
thatch homes, disaster officials said.
	   Its punishing winds also were wreaking havoc in Taiwan, where
two more storm-related deaths were reported.
	   At least 31,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines by the rampaging floods and peak sustained winds of 240
kilometers (150 miles) per hour that Zeb unleashed.
	   In Benguet province, at least 10 people were killed and an
undetermined number of others remained missing after boulders, mud
and debris crashed down a mountain and covered a workers' quarters
of the Luzon Hydroelectric Cooperative, the provincial disaster
office said.
	   In nearby Baguio City, also in Benguet, five people died in
separate landslides while a sixth fatality, Kim Yang-nin, a South
Korean student, died after his car plunged into a ravine when a
portion of a road he was driving through collapsed, said police
spokesman Chief Insp. Ricardo Villena. Kim's hometown was not
immediately available.
	   ``There are so many reports of landslides that will keep us busy
for a while,'' he said.
	   In Antipolo, just outside Manila, two brothers _ aged 2 and 4 _
died after tons of mud and debris cascaded down a hill onto their
hut. Their 6-year-old sister survived.
	   Disaster officials said a 16-year-old boy taking shelter at a
church in Solano town in Nueva Vizcaya province was killed when a
wall crumbled and crushed him. Another person was killed in a
landslide in Baguio.
	   More casualties were likely because of the numerous reports of
landslides and floods in remote areas where communications have
been cut, officials said. Government offices and schools in the
worst-affected areas were turned into emergency shelters.
	   Two people were injured in Quirino province after being hit by
flying debris. At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status
with sustained winds of 240 kph (150 mph) and gusts measuring (295
kph) 184 mph.
	   Zeb, the strongest of eight storms to hit the Philippines this
year, weakened as it cut through the mountain areas of Luzon. Its
winds dropped to 165 kph (103 mph) with gusts of up to 200 kph (125
mph) Thursday morning. The typhoon was over the South China Sea and
heading for Taiwan, said weather forecaster Rene Molina.
	   Molina said Zeb, traveling at 9 kph (6 mph), was expected to
reintensify as it leaves the Philippines. It was not, however,
expected to strike Taiwan with as much force as it had on arrival
in the Philippines.
	   ``There is no warm air where the typhoon can feed to reach peak
power,'' Molina said. ``Taiwan is likely to be spared much
damage.''
	   Taiwan and parts of Japan were bracing for the typhoon, which
was heading toward islands on the country's southern fringe early
Thursday.
	   Taiwanese Police in southeastern Taitung said a man was swept
out to sea by two-story high waves while he was fishing, and
another died after being trapped overnight in heavy rain.
	   Taiwan's official Central News Agency said several airlines have
canceled domestic flights to the southern port city of Kaohsiung
and nearby islets. International flights were not affected.
	   Last month, Tropical Storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers dead and 80
others missing.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to clarify that story stands for digest item slugged
 &UR; In landmark shift, Germany to liberalize citizenship &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs.  &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After years of denial, Germany is taking a
big step toward accepting immigrants and their children by knocking
down barriers in the nation's 85-year-old citizenship law.
	   The decision by the future government is the first major policy
shift resulting from the left's election victory last month and an
important gesture to Germany's 7 million foreign residents, who
make up nearly 10 percent of the population.
	   ``This government will recognize that Germany is a country of
immigrants,'' said Kerstin Mueller, a domestic policy for the
Greens party, the junior partner in the incoming government
coalition.
	   The language took aim at outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government, which insisted that Germany is not a country of
immigrants.
	   Germany's 2 million Turks have fought especially hard for the
changes. Most Turkish children born here have grown up virtually as
Germans, but they still feel excluded from an increasingly
multicultural society by the 1913 citizenship law, which grants
automatic citizenship only on the basis of German blood.
	   Few have battled harder for change than Cem Ozdemir, born to
Turkish parents in Germany in 1965 and a lawmaker for the Greens
since 1994.
	   ``The goal clearly must be that people who live here permanently
are not foreigners, not guests, but belong to society,'' he said
Wednesday before the agreement between Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democrats and the Greens.
	   Under the plan, German-born children of foreigners will have an
automatic right to citizenship for the first time, if one of their
parents has been living in Germany since age 14.
	   Both parties also agreed on allowing dual citizenship and on
shortening foreigners' eligibility for naturalization to eight
years from 15. Current law requires Turks to give up their Turkish
passport, which many are still reluctant to do.
	   The future governing partners, who have a 21-seat majority in
the incoming parliament, plan to introduce the proposed amendments
after the new legislature convenes on Oct. 26.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right government, voted out in
Sept. 27 elections after 16 years, refused to liberalize the
citizenship law, mainly because of pressure from Bavarian
conservatives.
	   Germany began recruiting large numbers of Turkish workers in the
1960s to help fuel its postwar economic boom. In recent years, they
and their children have made headlines mainly as victims of
anti-foreigner violence, including a 1993 firebombing in which five
Turks died.
	   Nevertheless, Germany is becoming more and more multicultural.
	   Take Turkish-born Ekin Deligoz, 27, elected to parliament for
the Greens last month only a year after gaining German citizenship.
	   ``Until last year, I was only a second-class member of this
society,'' she said. ``Now I'm not only a part of it but can
actually shape the country.''

Seoul investigates death of cattle sent to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea conceded Thursday that
cattle donated to North Korea may have eaten hemp rope, but said it
didn't kill any of them.
	   Chung Ju-yung, founder of Seoul's Hyundai conglomerate, donated
500 cattle to North Korea when he visited his native home in the
North in June.
	   North Korea later complained that 71 of the cattle died because
of an alleged Seoul government plot to kill the animals. It accused
South Korean government agents of force-feeding the cattle
indigestible vinyl strips and lumps of rope before shipping them to
the North.
	   Calling that claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry of National
Unification ordered Hyundai to check thousands of other cattle
being raised at its ranch on the west coast.
	   On Thursday, the ministry said lumps of rope have been found in
the stomachs of some Hyundai cattle on the ranch, which was built
on reclaimed land.
	   Hyundai officials said vinyl and other indigestible materials
might have been contained in earth used to make the land.
	   But the ministry, quoting veterinarians, said the rope and vinyl
did not kill the cattle. Instead, it attributed the deaths to
stress caused by the long trip by truck to the North.
	   South Korea reiterated its proposal Thursday that veterinarians
and officials of North and South Korea jointly investigate the
deaths of the donated cattle.
	   Animosity and distrust between the two Koreas run deep. The
Korean states were separated into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the early
1950s.

	   The Oilers, who snapped a four-game losing streak in Vancouver
going back to Dec. 23, 1996, went 3-for-7 on the power play after
starting the season 0-for-8 with the man advantage.
	   Todd McAmmond had two assists for the Oilers, who opened the
season with two losses.
	   Mark Messier scored the Canucks' lone goal on a power play,
ending goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov's shutout bid with 4:36 left in
regulation. The goal was Messier's first of the season and 598th of
his career, two short of becoming the 10th NHL player to reach the
600-goal plateau.

Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific agree on broad alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan Airlines Co. and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd. have agreed to form a broad commercial alliance aimed
at boosting air traffic in Asia, the Japanese airline said
Thursday.
	   Under the agreement, the two airlines will share codes on some
routes between Japan and Hong Kong and link their frequent flyer
programs some time early next year, JAL said in a release.
	   Members of the airlines' frequent flyer program will be able to
earn mileage points by taking each other's flights worldwide, it
said.
	   Code sharing allows airlines to pool resources and routes by
carrying one another's passengers and is becoming an increasingly
popular option in commercial aviation's fast consolidating
industry.
	   ``Japan Airlines and Cathay Pacific are both committed to
deliver high quality customer service'' through the agreement, said
Shinzo Suto, JAL's senior managing director in charge of passenger
marketing.
	   Philip Chen, Cathay Pacific's chief operating officer, said
Japan ``is one of our most important markets'' and added it was
believed the agreement would ``go a long way to strengthening our
business over the long-term.''

Yeltsin goes to work again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin disobeyed doctors' orders
again Thursday and went to work in the Kremlin for a second day,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   Yeltsin, 67, is suffering from a respiratory infection that
forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier in the week.
	   Doctors ordered him to stay home, in bed, to recuperate.
	   But Yeltsin showed up at his office for several hours on
Wednesday, holding talks with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on
the economy and developments in Kosovo.
	   In television pictures of the start of the meeting, Yeltsin
appeared pale and tired, and walked stiffly. But he gestured
animatedly and joked with his ministers, scoffed at his doctors'
advice, and complained that ``I can't even sneeze'' without someone
making a fuss about it.
	   Yeltsin has a history of health problems, and underwent heart
bypass surgery in 1996. Still, he insists he has no major illnesses
and plans to serve out the remaining two years of his term.
	   Interfax gave no information about Yeltsin's work schedule for
Thursday.

Beijing bans computer games to protect children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Computer game wizards, beware.
	   China's capital is trying to banish computer games from cultural
and recreation facilities to protect the health of students and
prevent piracy, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
	   The city's Cultural Department has ordered all establishments
that provide computers to the public for training and network
services, including internet cafes, to prohibit game playing,
threatening severe punishment for violators, Xinhua said.
	   It said investigations were already underway.
	   The ban apparently reflects concern that students who are hooked
on the games are squandering their time and neglecting physical
exercise.
	   It also is intended to crack down on facilities that use pirated
computer games and CD-ROMs, the report said. Chinese and foreign
software makers complain that pirated products account for most of
the computer software in circulation in the country today.

American professor angers Indonesian with corruption allegations

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An American college professor has
angered the Indonesian government by alleging that its top
economics minister had been involved in a shady business deal
involving a U.S. mining company.
	   Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita has angrily denied corruption allegations
made this week by Jeffrey Winters of Northwestern University of
Evanston, Ill.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said the police should investigate
Winters' comments, The Jakarta Post newspaper reported Thursday.
	   ``The police must investigate him ... a coordinating minister is
harassed by a foreign expert. That's not on,'' Muladi said.
	   The Post quoted one unidentified official as saying Ginandjar
had been ``humiliated'' by the accusations.
	   Newspapers say Winters has accused Ginandjar, a former mines
minister, of being involved in a share deal between a local company
and PT Freeport Indonesia, a subsidiary of New Orleans-based
Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc.
	   Freeport operates a massive copper and gold mine in
Indonesian-controlled western New Guinea. It has denied allegations
of collusion with Indonesian officials in the past.
	   Ginandjar said he did not violate any laws or abuse his
ministerial power. He also did not make any personal profit, he
said.
	   He said that if the accusations against him are proven, the
government would take legal action.
	   Winters, who visited Indonesia this month, left the country
several days ago.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted him as saying from the
United States that he stood by his comments about government
corruption, although he said he did not directly accuse Ginandjar
of being involved in corruption.
	   ``I'm scared about being arrested or interrogated by police.
That is up to the Indonesian government,'' he said.
	   Winters' allegation is the latest in a long list of accusations
of corruption and collusion made against senior officials who
served under former President Suharto.
	   Suharto ended 32 authoritarian years in power when he quit
office in May after a wave of riots and protests ended with the
deaths of 1,200 people.
	   Suharto himself is now under investigation for corruption but
has denied allegations that he has stashed billions of dollars away
in foreign banks.
	   Ginandjar was a senior minister under Suharto and remained in
Indonesia's Cabinet when Suharto's successor and friend, Habibie,
took over.
	   Ginandjar has been a major player in the setting up of a
multibillion dollar economic rescue package with the International
Monetary Fund to help overcome Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
three decades.

Japan's lawmakers approve bill to dispose of former railway debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese lawmakers voted a controversial bill into
law Thursday designed to deal with a massive debt burden left over
from the privatization of the nation's former railway monopoly.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic party
won passage of the legislation through the opposition-dominated
upper house of Parliament on Thursday with the support of two
minority parties.
	   Japan's lower house had approved the bill earlier this month.
	   The measure requires the government to assume 23.5 trillion yen
(dlrs 197.6 billion) in debt, interest payments on which will be
paid for by a special tax on tobacco. The principal is to be repaid
over a six-decade period starting from 2000.
	   It also commits the seven private rail companies born out of the
break up of the former Japan National Railways to contribute an
additional 180 billion yen (dlrs 1.51 billion) to help meet
under-funded railroad worker pension obligations.
	   The seven railroad firms had objected strongly to the plan,
saying they had settled their contributions in a separate 1996
agreement.
	   In that accord, the JR companies had to put 170 billion yen
(dlrs 1.43) toward the pension obligations, Japan's Kyodo News
service reported.

Russian Cabinet cancels meeting on economy without explanation

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Cabinet canceled without explanation
Thursday a meeting that was to have been devoted to the country's
economic crisis.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov and Economy Minister Andrei
Shapovalyants had been scheduled to report on a plan to settle
debts between the government and state-owned companies totaling
some 50 billion rubles (dlrs 3.8 billion).
	   Payments to and from the government and the private sector
ground to a halt in September following the sharp devaluation of
the ruble and the government's default on its domestic debts in
mid-August.
	   The government press service confirmed the meeting had been
canceled, but would not say why or when it would be rescheduled.

Chinese newspaper criticizes NATO over Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a harshly critical newspaper article, China on
Thursday accused NATO of setting a bad precedent for meddling by
major powers through its involvement in the Kosovo crisis.
	   The state-run China Daily said NATO intervention opened the door
for superpowers _ an apparent reference to the United States _ and
military alliances to infringe on other countries' sovereignty ``in
the name of `humanitarian intervention.'''
	   ``It will be a nightmare for countries incapable of defending
their security while superpowers and or some other military groups
abuse the method of military intervention,'' the newspaper quoted
Zhu Xiaozhong, a government think-tank researcher, as saying.
	   Commentaries in the newspaper, China's main English-language
daily, tend to reflect official policy.
	   NATO has given Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic until
Saturday to show that he is ending his crackdown against Kosovo
Albanian separatists or risk air strikes.
	   China has repeatedly voiced opposition to the NATO threat,
saying the crisis is Yugoslavia's internal affair and should be
resolved peacefully.
	   The China Daily said forcing Yugoslavia to withdraw its troops
from Kosovo would push the situation beyond the Serbs' control and
mean that ``the independence of Kosovo will be a matter of time.''
	   That ``may open the Pandora box of separatism again in the
Balkan region, which could result in endless chaos and bloodshed,''
the newspaper said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Several Katyusha rockets fell near Israeli

	   The small, unguided missiles, apparently fired by Lebanese

Residents of the villages went into bomb shelters. The Israeli army
said some rockets also landed in the Israeli-controlled section of
Lebanon just across the border.

meet under-funded railroad worker pension obligations.
	   The seven railroad firms had objected strongly to the plan,
saying they had settled their contributions in a separate 1996
agreement.
	   In that accord, the JR companies had to pay a sum of 170 billion
yen (dlrs 1.43) toward the pension obligations, Japan's Kyodo News
service reported.

Report: Sydney, Australia, ignored warnings about water problem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ More than a year before millions of
people were forced to boil their drinking water in Sydney to avoid
illness, authorities were told the water supply was vulnerable to
contamination, according to documents released Thursday.
	   In a series of warnings earlier this year, most of Sydney's four
million residents were cautioned to boil tap water for at least one
minute because of contamination by giardia and cryptosporidium
parasites.
	   The warnings ended in mid-September, but not before causing
major embarrassment to the city, which will play host to the 2000
Olympic Games, and damaging its reputation as one of the world's
top tourist destinations.
	   The cause of the water problems is still a mystery and is being
investigated by a government-appointed inquiry.
	   Documents released in parliament and made public for the first
time Thursday include a report by a senior Sydney Water employee,
Leigh Raymond, that warned of a cryptosporidium outbreak 16 months
before the first Sydney contamination.
	   ``It is probably only a matter of time before there is an
outbreak in Australia,'' Raymond said at a water quality conference
in California in March 1997. He said Sydney Water urgently needed
to develop a cryptosporidium action plan similar to those prepared
by U.S. and British authorities.
	   Other documents released show that despite Raymond's speech,
Sydney Water told the state health department it already had a plan
to deal with any contamination of Sydney's water supply.
	   A cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1993 was
blamed for the deaths of about 100 people and for making about
400,000 people ill.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people with
weak immune systems.
	   There was no big increase in illness during the Sydney
outbreaks, and some scientists have argued that the bugs it
contained were harmless algae.
	   The government released 20,000 pages of documents about the
crisis, including test results, reports and government memos. But
it asked a court to keep secret 4,000 pages of other documents.
	   Both the Labor government and the conservative opposition have
accused each other of hiding information related to the
contamination from the public.

Report: Tax collectors punished for beating farmer to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Nine people in southwestern Sichuan province are
facing trial for beating three peasants, one of whom died, because
they refused to hand over taxes for selling pigs, an official
report said Thursday.
	   A group of villagers hired by local officials in the Sichuan
village of Guanyin tried to collect the tax on June 15 after
hearing farmer Zheng Daping had sold two pigs.
	   When Zheng insisted he had not yet sold the pigs, the group
began to beat him, knocking him to the ground, the newspaper
Economic Information Daily reported.
	   Zheng's nephew rushed to defend his uncle with a pole, and was
severely beaten over the head. Zheng's wife joined the fracas and
also was beaten, the report said.
	   It said Zheng and his wife recovered from light injuries, but
the nephew died a day later.
	   After the beating, most of the officials fled, although two were
caught by other villagers. The nine officials held responsible for
the attack lost their positions and are facing trial, the report
said.
	   The case highlighted conflicts that exist in many rural
communities over taxes imposed by local officials. Some of the
taxes are legitimate, but profiteering officials sometimes impose
illegal levies and fines, or use coercive measures to collect
taxes.

Bahamas will hang two criminals despite opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBORAH NASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ The Bahamas is sending two murderers to
the gallows on Thursday despite international opposition.
	   At home, there have been none of the protests that accompanied
the last hanging in the Bahamas, in 1996. That follows a Caribbean
trend to fight rising crime with the harshest punishment.
	   ``We pray that others will take note that the Bahamian society
is fed up with these heinous types of crime,'' said the Rev. Simeon
Hall, president of the Bahamas Christian Council, which had
protested the 1996 execution.
	   ``The innocent people have been pushed to this day and feel this
is their only recourse,'' Hall told The Associated Press hours
before the scheduled hangings.
	   Bahamians have been particularly sickened by the killings of
three foreigners in August _ two women, one British and one
American, who were on vacation and a cruise ship worker. An
18-year-old Bahamian jetski operator has been arrested in the
killings of the women.
	   Attorney General Tennyson Wells said the Bahamas would hang
Trevor Fisher, 28, and Richard Woods, 51, even though they have
appeals pending at the Organization of American States'
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
	   The Washington D.C.-based commission made a last-minute appeal
for the men's lives Wednesday, Bahamian government radio reported.
But there was no response to the commission, which had received
Fisher's petition in June 1996 and that of Woods in November 1996.
	   The Bahamian Ministry of National Security said the government
had not received any recommendation from the commission and
``considers that it has complied with its obligations.'' The
ministerial statement came Friday, the same day the death warrants
were read to the condemned men.
	   Some Caribbean countries have accused the commission of
deliberately prolonging its decisions in a bid to prevent hangings.
Jamaica withdrew from the commission this year and Trinidad has
said it will withdraw next year.
	   Bahamian officials needed to carry out the executions ahead of a
five-year limit set by Britain's Privy Council, which ruled in 1993
that it was inhumane to keep prisoners on death row for more than
five years. As a result, hundreds of condemned convicts had their
sentences commuted to life imprisonment, since the Privy Council of
the House of Lords is the highest court for several current and
former British Caribbean colonies.
	   In the Bahamas, 17 death sentences had to be commuted this year
and 30 people remain on death row.
	   The Privy Council ruled three-two last week that the Bahamas,
independent since 1973, should act. It emphasized the ``requirement
on humanitarian grounds that in countries which retain the death
penalty, lawful death penalties should be carried out as swiftly as
practicable.''
	   The council said it also was necessary ``to maintain public
confidence in the criminal justice system in the Bahamas.''
	   Britain's government is opposed to the death penalty and has
tried to persuade Caribbean countries to stop it. In response,
Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad _ all independent nations
with varying links to Britain _ announced in July that they plan to
cut ties to the Privy Council and form their own Caribbean Court of
Justice.
	   The hangings in the Bahamas are scheduled separately for 8 a.m.
(13:00 GMT) and 9 a.m. Thursday.
	   Fisher was convicted on March 25, 1994, of shooting an unarmed
man at point blank range in a botched 1990 robbery attempt. Woods
was sentenced Jan. 18, 1995, for the 1993 murder of Pauline
Johnson.
	   St. Kitts and Nevis is the only other Caribbean country to hang
a convicted murderer this year, ending a 13-year hiatus there.

Chinese police detain, question dissident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police detained and questioned the organizer of a
group set up by dissidents to monitor official corruption and told
him the group's activities must cease, a human rights group said
Thursday.
	   Police in Xinyang, in central China's Henan province, took An
Jun away Wednesday afternoon and held him until past midnight for
questioning about the group's members, said the Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   The police wanted a list of members with their work and home
addresses, a demand An Jun refused for fear of getting them into
trouble, the Hong Kong-based Information Center said.
	   ``Corruption Watch,'' founded by nine dissidents in seven
provinces, now has nearly 100 members, the center said. It applied
last month to the government to register officially, but received
no response, the center said.
	   The police officers that questioned An Jun said that without
official permission the group must cease its activities, the center
said.
	   Rampant official corruption is a major public gripe in China.
The Information Center said Corruption Watch had already received
reports of graft in its first month of operation.

Bus plunges into river, 15 killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A bus traveling through central India
veered off a bridge and plunged into a river, killing 15 people and
injuring 24 others, domestic news agencies reported Thursday.
	   The accident occurred late Wednesday when the driver lost
control of the bus and it fell into the Poram River in Madhya
Pradesh state, the United News of India said.
	   Villagers in the area gathered to help pull out survivors and
bodies from the water which was five feet (1.5 meters) deep. A
crane was also called in from the nearest town to help pull the bus
out of the river.
	   Most of the injured were in serious condition, UNI said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Several Katyusha rockets hit near Israeli
villages along the border with Lebanon Thursday, causing no
injuries, the Israeli army reported.
	   The small, unguided missiles, apparently fired by Lebanese
guerrillas, landed in an orchard, according to Israel radio.
	   Residents of the villages went into bomb shelters. The Israeli
army said some rockets also landed in the Israeli-controlled
section of Lebanon just across the border.

Japanese coast guard fights to contain oil spill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese coast guard ships rushed to contain an oil
spill Thursday after a South Korean cargo ship ran aground off the
Japanese island of Shikoku, an official said.
	   No injuries were reported among the 15 crew members of the
2,831-ton Chun Il, said Maritime Safety Agency spokesman Shingo
Nakamura.
	   The spill covered about 13 square kilometers (5 square miles) of
the Pacific Ocean, which the agency dispatched 20 ships to clean
using booms and chemicals, Nakamura said.
	   Oil gushed from the ship's fuel tank after it struck partially
submerged rocks around 1:00 a.m. just off the southwestern coast of
Shikoku, 680 kilometers (425 miles) west of Tokyo.
	   The 15 crew _ 12 Koreans, 2 Filipinos and a Chinese _ were still
on board the Chun Il, which sat stranded atop the rocks.
	   The ship, bound for the Japanese port of Yokohama from Pusan,
South Korea, was carrying a single container of unknown content
weighing 100 tons, Nakamura said.

Forest fires spread in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Wildfires have spread in the Russian Far East in
recent days and now cover 475,000 hectares (1.17 million acres),
the ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday.
	   The fires are burning in the Khabarovsk, Amur and Maritime
territories, the Jewish Autonomous Region and Sakhalin Island, it
said. Worst hit is Sakhalin, where 445,000 hectares (1.09 million
acres) of taiga are on fire.
	   More than 2,000 firefighters and 300 pieces of equipment are
battling the fires in Khabarovsk.
	   No one has died in the fires, although smoke has caused road
accidents in which seven people have been killed recently,
ITAR-Tass said. Smoke is also reported to be causing health
problems and forcing the closure of airports.
	   Firefighters have been unable to control the blazes because of
severe funding shortages and an unusually dry summer. The fires may
burn until snow or rain extinguishes them, officials said.

Militants kill two soldiers in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Jammu, India (AP) _ Two Indian soldiers were killed in a clash
with separatist militants in Kashmir on the eve of Indo-Pakistan
talks on the disputed territory, officials said Thursday.
	   Army officials said the two soldiers were killed in a gunbattle
with militants, but police said the militants ambushed the soldiers
at a checkpoint. The clash occurred Wednesday night in Poonch, a
district bordering Pakistan, about 200 kilometers (120 miles)
northwest of Kashmir's winter capital Jammu.
	   Indian and Pakistani negotiators were meeting in Islamabad
Thursday for their first in-depth talks about Kashmir in a year.
Tensions rose after both countries conducted nuclear tests in May.
	   India accuses Pakistan of backing an insurgency in Kashmir, its
only Muslim-majority state, where several groups are fighting for
independence or to merge with officially Islamic Pakistan. Pakistan
denies the charge.
	   The Himalayan territory is divided between India and Pakistan
but both countries lay claim to a united Kashmir.

Japanese stocks finish lower, dollar falls against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices finished lower Thursday amid
gloomy outlook for corporate profits and rumors that a major
Japanese brokerage was suffering massive losses. The U.S. dollar
fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 75.36 points,
or 0.58 percent, closing the day's trading at 12,995.37. On
Wednesday, it had fallen 172.06 points, or 1.30 percent.
	   The dollar bought 118.56 yen at mid-afternoon, down 1.16 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 118.98 yen overnight.
	   Share prices opened higher but quickly moved into negative
territory by midmorning following a sharp plunge in shares of
Nomura Securities, Japan's top brokerage, amid rumors that the
company was facing massive losses.
	   During the midday break, Nomura announced it posted an
unconsolidated 33.72 billion yen (dlrs 285 million) valuation loss
on its domestic securities holdings for the six-month period ended
Sept. 30.
	   Shares of Nomura Securities were down 82 yen (69 cents), or 9.0
percent, to close at 827 yen (dlrs 7.0) per share.
	   Investors bid up shares of some banks earlier in the session
amid optimism Japan's upper house of Parliament will swiftly
approve a bill setting guidelines for pumping public funds into a
weakened banking system, traders said.
	   The lower house already passed the bill on Tuesday.
	   But traders said gains were capped by lingering worry that a
stagnant domestic economy and the yen's recent strengthening _
which erodes profits from overseas _ will trim earnings.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 4.07 points, or 0.41 percent, to 980.11. The
TOPIX had lost 14.80 points, or 1.48 percent, the previous day.
	   In currency dealings, traders said much anxiety remained over
the state of U.S. hedge funds, which were largely blamed for
driving the dollar down last week to its worst falls against the
yen in a quarter century.
	   Thursday, the dollar drifted lower from late New York levels on
selling by foreign players and Japanese institutional investors.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond stood at 0.850 percent, unchanged from Wednesday's finish. Its
price was slightly lower at 108.48 yen, from the previous day's
108.68 yen.

Surgery, water therapy help Singapore baby elephant's broken leg

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Intensive hand care, water therapy and a unique
team of human and animal surgeons worked together to save the leg,
and perhaps the life, of the first elephant born at Singapore's
Zoological Gardens.
	   Sri Utama, whose name means ``First Lady'' in the Tamil
language, now swims daily in the elephant pool with her caretakers
as part of the therapy to strengthen the leg, zoo officials said
Wednesday.
	   The Asian elephant's humerus bone was fractured when she was
born April 18 at a weight of 107 kilograms (235 pounds) to
19-year-old Jamilah.
	   ``We don't know what happened. The birth occurred early in the
morning,'' said zoo spokeswoman Priscilla Yim-Stacey. ``The mother
had never seen a birth and the herd had not experienced one. The
babies are very fragile.''
	   Surgery on elephants is risky. There have been so few operations
that safe doses of anesthetics have not been established for
juveniles.
	   So veterinarians put Sri Utama's leg in a splint to keep it from
touching the ground and fed her milk by hand. The mother is brought
near each day, but is controlled by zoo workers, ``because she
might get too excited, or be clumsy if the baby tries to nurse,''
said Mrs. Yim-Stacey.
	   Meanwhile elephant specialists, veterinarians and orthopedic
surgeons were consulted. When X-rays indicated the bone was not
healing well, an elaborate surgery was conducted Aug. 3 at the
Singapore Turf Club, where horses receive treatment.
	   A team of doctors found that Sri Utama's bone was healing much
stronger than the X-rays had shown, although the injured leg was
shorter than the other three. Screws were inserted at a weak point,
and by the end of August the surgical wound had healed.
	   Zoo veterinarians believe that over Sri Utama's long life span,
the injured leg can grow to normal length. She now weighs 186
kilograms (409 pounds).
	   Asian elephants, often used as beasts of labor, are endangered
and there are less than 30,000 left in the wild.

Industry chief: Proposed new tax will hurt tourism business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's planned
new tax on all goods and services would make the Australian tourism
industry less internationally competitive, the Tourism Council of
Australia said Thursday.
	   Australia was currently ninth on a list prepared by the council
of 20 holiday destinations which were comparable in terms of
affordability. If the new tax is introduced, Australia will drop to
10th place, council managing director Don Larkin said.
	   ``The impact of a GST (goods and services tax) will downgrade
our price competitiveness and take Australia from a ranking of nine
to a ranking of ten among our global competitors,'' Larkin said.
	   Howard has refused to exempt the industry from the new tax,
which was the centerpiece of the tax reform package which saw his
conservative coalition re-elected in Oct. 3 balloting.
	   The package includes a 10 percent tax on all goods and services,
offset by big personal income tax cuts.
	   Larkin said Howard should rethink including tourist services
because the industry is struggling due to the Asian financial
crisis.
	   ``Australia's tourism industry is at the crossroads with tight
profit margins, international demand softening and a flat domestic
market, so further improving our competitiveness is vital,'' Larkin
said.
	   The council released a survey Thursday which shows Australia is
more expensive than Indonesia, Thailand, China, Malaysia, South
Korea, Turkey, Taiwan and Singapore when it came to food, drinks,
accommodation and tours.
	   Australia was cheaper than New Zealand, North America, the
United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Japan and most of Europe.
	   The survey did not take account of recent fluctuations in the
Australian dollar, which has fallen in value by about 13 Australian
cents against the U.S. dollar in the past year.
	   Analysis of the survey showed Australia was relatively price
competitive for business travelers, but less so for travelers
visiting friends and relatives, Larkin said.

Lesotho government, opposition, agree on transitional government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Government and opposition parties agreed
to set up a transitional government to prepare for new elections, a
gesture of reconciliation after months of upheaval.
	   The agreement was announced late Wednesday by a South African
mediator who said the transitional government would include
opposition party representatives.
	   Tensions in Lesotho, a small mountainous kingdom surrounded by
South Africa, have been running high since the May elections, which
opposition groups claim were rigged.
	   After an army revolt and crippling strikes, South Africa and
nearby Botswana sent about 1,000 troops into the country on Sept.
22 to restore calm. South Africa expected to establish order
quickly and leave, but scores were killed and its soldiers remain
in Lesotho.
	   South Africa's Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, who
has been mediating the conflict, said the transitional government
would be established by Oct. 31.
	   Earlier Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent a
message to the rival parties in Lesotho urging them to resolve the
conflict.
	   ``You did not disappoint ... Annan, who implored you to work
towards an agreement,'' Mufamadi said.
	   The Southern African Development Community, a 14-nation regional
group, uncovered serious irregularities in the May elections.
	   Mufamadi said the transitional government would seek to promote
a climate conducive to free and fair elections within 18 months.
	   The Independent Electoral Commission is slated for
reorganization by the end of the year, and is expected to draft a
new code of conduct for political parties.

Romanian Health Ministry authorizes drug against impotence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The anti-impotence pill Viagra has
been legally authorized in Romania, officials said Thursday.
	   The Health Ministry gave its approval Wednesday but is only
allowing the pills to be sold through drugstores on a doctor's
recommendation and following a medical investigation, said Ion
Fulga, head of the ministry's pharmacy department.
	   ``We have to be sure any secondary effect of Viagra is
avoided,'' Fulga said.
	   Viagra will be available in Romania in the next four to five
weeks, said Dr. Gabriel Hanganu, Romanian manager for Pfizer Inc.,
which produces Viagra. The price of one pill will be about 150,000
lei (dlrs 16) _ about half the current black-market price, he said.

Philippine President Estrada meets Anwar's daughter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
on Thursday met the eldest daughter of arrested Malaysian dissident
leader Anwar Ibrahim and expressed his continued support for her
father.
	   ``President Estrada reiterated his personal moral support for
the plight of Anwar, emphasizing that this is his personal position
and that this is not the official stand of the government,'' said
press undersecretary Ike Gutierrez.
	   ``The issue involves human rights, which is a universal
concern,'' Gutierrez added. ``He asked other other world leaders to
give their personal support to Anwar.''
	   Estrada and Anwar's daughter, Nurul Izzah, talked for 20 minutes
in the hurriedly arranged meeting at Estrada's private residence in
suburban San Juan.
	   ``She was very happy,'' Gutierrez said of Nurul Izzah, 18, a
first-year engineering student.
	   Estrada has made a number of public statements about Anwar's
Sept. 20 arrest and subsequent beatings while in police custody.
Chastising a neighboring country is unusual in Southeast Asia,
where governments customarily avoid mutual criticisms.
	   Estrada, who calls Anwar a personal friend, was the first leader
of a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to
express concern for the jailed Malaysian dissident.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has also expressed concern
over Anwar's treatment. Habibie and Estrada met Tuesday night on an
Indonesian island near Singapore specifically to discuss Anwar's
arrest and how they should respond.
	   The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are among the founders
of ASEAN, which also includes Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Singapore,
Thailand, and Vietnam.
	   Estrada has said he has not yet decided whether he will attend
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit to be held next month
in Malaysia.
	   ``He said the APEC meeting is separate from the issue of Anwar,
particularly his personal stand on the issue,'' Gutierrez said.
	   Nurul Izzah handed over a letter from her mother, Azizah Ismail,
who expressed gratitude for Estrada's support.
	   Gutierrez said Estrada is ``thinking of writing a personal
letter'' to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to ask that
Anwar be held in house arrest during his upcoming trial on
corruption and sexual misconduct charges. Anwar has denied the
charges, calling them politically motivated.
	   Gutierrez also said Anwar's daughter met earlier with former
President Corazon Aquino, who had expressed her own ``personal
moral support'' for Anwar.
	   Anwar's wife earlier wrote Mrs. Aquino that she wants to learn
from the Philippines' struggle against the late dictator Ferdinand
Marcos to push the democratic reform movement in her country.
	   Mrs. Aquino had written to Azizah, praising her courage.
	   ``By your example, I'm sure that there will be many more who
will join you as you carry on with Anwar's commitment for
reforms,'' Mrs. Aquino said in her letter.

Primakov launches debt-settlement plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Cabinet launching debt-settlement plan
without additional discussion, other details; ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov ordered the
government and its agencies to start settling their huge
outstanding bills, a problem that has paralyzed the Russian
economy.
	   The Cabinet discussed these measures a week ago and was
scheduled to finalize them Thursday. But Primakov abruptly canceled
the Cabinet meeting, saying the proposals were already clear and
needed to be implemented.
	   ``We have had enough discussions, we now must act,'' spokesman
Igor Shchegolev quoted him as saying.
	   The plan worked out by the economics and finance ministries
would require the government and state-owned companies to clear
their mutual debts of some 50 billion rubles (dlrs 3.8 billion) by
mid-December.
	   The cash-strapped government has been a major debtor in the
Russian economy, failing to pay wages and pensions to workers and
other bills to state-run companies. The workers and companies then
cannot pay their bills, leading to a chain of non-payments that is
disabling Russian industries.
	   Officials admit that the unpaid bills among the government and
the state-owned companies and organizations are small compared to
those in the private sector. They estimate all debts in Russia
total a staggering 1.2 trillion rubles (dlrs 92 million), or about
40 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
	   Primakov has said the government bills must be settled without
printing new money, a move that would lead to high inflation.
However, he has not said where the money will come from and it is
likely that many of the debts will be settled through barter or
other non-cash transactions.
	   In other economic news Thursday:
	   _ Russia's hard currency reserves rose from dlrs 12.8 billion to
dlrs 13.3 billion in the week ending Oct. 9, the Central Bank said.
The bank has been actively buying dollars in recent weeks to
strengthen its reserves depleted at the start of the crisis.
	   _ Inflation for the first 12 days of October was 0.8 percent,
after soaring last month following the ruble's sharp plunge.
Average daily price increases decreased from 1.09 percent in
September to 0.66 percent this month, the State Statistics
Committee said.

	   SURFERS PARADISE, Australia (AP) _ For almost 18 months,
Christian Fittipaldi has carried a reminder of his last Australian
IndyCarnival _ a stainless steel rod in his right leg.
	   In that race in March, 1997, the Brazilian-born Fittipaldi _
nephew of Indy legend Emerson _ didn't get past the second lap
after Gil de Ferran nudged him from behind to send him crashing
into the wall.
	   He was rushed to the Gold Coast Hospital where doctors found his
right leg broken in three places. His left foot was also fractured.
	   But Fittipaldi was back in action again in just over two months.
	   ``I've recovered very well,'' Fittipaldi said as he prepared for
Sunday's race. ``I still have screws and one rod in the leg but I'm
going to get that out as soon as the season's over.''
	   Fittipaldi, 27, and now in his fourth season in the CART series,
said he felt no mixed emotions when he returned, although the view
from his hotel room left something to be desired.
	   ``My hotel is actually facing the place where I had the
accident,'' said Fittipaldi, who drives for Newman/Haas Racing with
Michael Andretti.
	   ``I just put the bad memories behind me and try to use
everything that I learned out of the accident to build up a little
bit and be a stronger person in general.''
	   - - -
	   An 18-month gap between Gold Coast races after the Australian
IndyCarnival was shifted from its former March timespot in 1997 to
October has has cost organizers nearly US dlrs 600,000 extra in
expenses.
	   The drop in the Australian dollar against the American has also
negated much of the profit from world television sales of about US
dlrs 11 million. This year's Indy is expected to be shown in 180
countries.
	   - - -
	   Local organizers have a contract to stage a CART race on the
Gold Coast until 2000, with negotations underway to extend that by
another three years. Next year's Gold Coast race has been set for
Oct. 14-17, 1999.
	   - - -
	   The 12-turn temporary street circuit around the highrises and
along the beachfront in Surfers Paradise is 4.5 kilometers (2.794
miles) long. It is installed in six weeks and taken down in three.
Lining the circuit are 2,354 concrete safety barriers each weighing
4.5 metric tons.
	   There is a push from the local community at Surfers Paradise to
constuct a permanent circuit at The Broadwater at nearby Southport,
which organizers estimate would save them up to US dlrs 3 million a
year.
	   ``One of the problems we have is that every year, we have to put
this track up and pull it down,'' said race chairman Terry Jackman.

Report: Malaysia to prosecute Anwar on all 10 charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from opposition activists, grafs 10-11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities are ready to
prosecute jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim on six sodomy and
corruption charges in addition to the four charges he now faces,
newspapers said Thursday.
	   Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah said the prosecution had
applied to the High Court to fix a trial date, the New Straits
Times daily reported.
	   ``The prosecution has all the necessary evidence ... for all the
10 charges against Anwar,'' he said, rejecting speculation that
authorities weren't ready to prosecute.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and
arrested 18 days later. He had clashed with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad over economic policy before being dismissed for alleged
immoral homosexual acts and corruption.
	   Anwar has pleaded innocent to all five counts of corruption and
five counts of sodomy, claiming they were trumped up by his
political adversaries. He has been ordered to stand trial Nov. 2.
	   Mohtar said that if the hearings on the first four corruption
charges could be completed by November, the prosecution would apply
for hearing dates for the other charges in December or January.
	   Meanwhile, Mahathir was quoted by a newspaper Thursday as saying
he had thought about abolishing the Internal Security Act, the
harsh law that was used to arrest Anwar and his supporters. It
provides for indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   But he reportedly dropped the idea after security forces told
him that there was still the threat of instability in Malaysia.
	   ``That is why the ISA must be maintained, to prevent people from
creating chaos in the country without seeking justice in the
courts,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying by The Star newspaper.
	   Activists from the opposition Malaysian People's party told
Mahathir to stop blaming the security forces for repeatedly using
the ``draconian and obnoxious'' legislation.
	   ``The decision to introduce the ISA was a political one and it
now needs the political decision of the government to repeal it,''
said the party's president, Syed Husin Ali. ``For once, he must
take responsibility.''
	   On Wednesday, police decided to drop the use of the ISA in
detaining Anwar, following weeks of condemnation by domestic and
international civil rights groups. Anwar was later moved to a
regular jail on the outskirts of the capital.
	   Speaking to thousands at a pro-government rally Wednesday,
Mahathir defended the Internal Security Act.
	   Referring to demonstrations in the capital mounted by Anwar's
supporters after his arrest, Mahathir said such kinds of behavior
justified use of the security law, enacted in 1960 to combat
militant communists.
	   Malaysia has used the sweeping law to crack down on hundreds of
people, from mechanics to ministers, jailing them on charges of
threatening national security.

Power cut half the day to Kamchatka Peninsula

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An energy shortage has forced local authorities to
limit electricity, hot water and heating to homes and businesses on
the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia's Far East, a news agency said
Thursday.
	   Electricity will be switched on twice a day for six hours at a
time, ITAR-Tass said, quoting Kamchatka region First Deputy Gov.
Boris Sinchenko. Hot water and central heating will also be
reduced, it said.
	   Sinchenko said that as winter arrives, the region has only a
10-day supply of fuel and that the next oil tanker will not arrive
to restock power stations until Oct. 28.
	   Local authorities blame the federal government for failing to
deliver promised funds to buy fuel.

Malaysia forecasts 1 percent growth in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia hopes to pull out of its
recession and achieve economic growth of 1 percent in 1999, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday.
	   But he acknowledged that next year's budget plans will have to
struggle with the economy's laggard performance in 1998, during
which its gross domestic product has been forecast to contract by
4.8 percent.
	   ``It is certain the 1999 budget will be influenced by the
unhealthy economic situation, and we will have a deficit budget for
next year,'' the national news agency Bernama quoted him as saying.
	   Mahathir also said Malaysia will introduce new taxes and fiscal
policies in the 1999 budget to help jump start its economy. The
budget will be announced in Parliament on Oct. 23.
	   Earlier this week, Deputy Finance Minister Wong See Wah said
further expansionary policies would be introduced in the budget.
	   Government spending has already been raised by nearly 20 percent
in 1998, after Malaysia turned its back on International Monetary
Fund-style, tight-money, low-spending policies.
	   Malaysia imposed capital controls at the beginning of the month,
which curbed flows of speculative funds, and effectively pegged the
country's currency at 3.80 ringgit to the dollar.
	   These measures, which allow the government to boost spending
without undermining the stability of the currency, would make
Malaysia the first country in Southeast Asia to recover from the
Asian economic malaise, Mahathir said last week.
	   Some economists warn otherwise.
	   ``We have yet to see signs of good economic management in the
country,'' said Roger Rasiah, an economics professor at the
Institute of Malaysian and International Studies.
	   ``And if the global economy is indeed heading toward depression,
then it'll be bleak for Malaysia. Their initiative to insulate the
economy from external shocks will only result in a bubble
economy.''

Japanese coast guard fights to contain oil spill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details in 6th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese coast guard ships rushed to contain an oil
spill Thursday after a South Korean cargo ship ran aground off the
Japanese island of Shikoku, an official said.
	   No injuries were reported among the 15 crew members of the
2,831-ton Chun Il, said Maritime Safety Agency spokesman Shingo
Nakamura.
	   The spill covered about 13 square kilometers (5 square miles) of
the Pacific Ocean, which the agency sent 20 ships to clean using
booms and chemicals, Nakamura said.
	   Oil gushed from the ship's fuel tank after it struck partially
submerged rocks around 1 a.m. just off the southwestern coast of
Shikoku, 680 kilometers (425 miles) west of Tokyo.
	   The crew of 12 Koreans, two Filipinos and a Chinese were still
aboard the Chun Il, which sat stranded atop the rocks.
	   Nakamura said the coast guard was still trying to determine how
much oil had spilled or how much the Chun Il was carrying.
	   The ship, bound for the Japanese port of Yokohama from Pusan,
South Korea, was carrying a single container of unknown content
weighing 100 tons, Nakamura said.

Financial crisis hasn't hurt Sakhalin energy projects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's financial crisis has not affected foreign
investment in Sakhalin Island's oil and gas projects, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said Thursday.
	   The regional government and the Russian company formed to
explore and develop oil and gas fields has attracted dlrs 1.2
billion in foreign investment in the last three years, including
dlrs 643 million in 1998, said First Deputy Gov. Vladimir Shapoval.
	   Widescale production is expected to start in 1999 and provide
50,000 jobs, he said.
	   The seabed around Sakhalin in Russia's Far East is believed to
hold billions of barrels of oil and huge deposits of natural gas.
Foreign investors include the American companies Exxon, Mobil and
Texaco.

Penguins say new arena is only option
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ The Pittsburgh Penguins say they're not moving
despite filing for bankruptcy, but their assurances aren't
preventing nervous government officials from taking steps to block
any relocation bid.
	   ``We're not going anywhere,'' team co-owner Roger Marino said
Wednesday.
	   Still, Mayor Tom Murphy warned he would take any legal action
necessary to keep the Penguins from fleeing their financial
misfortunes in Pittsburgh by trying to leave town.
	   By filing for Chapter 11 protection, the Penguins could
theoretically ask the federal bankruptcy court to void their Civic
Arena lease that extends through 2007, thus freeing them to leave.
	   The Penguins claim to have lost dlrs 37.5 million over the last
two seasons, despite playing to more than 90 percent of arena
capacity.
	   Murphy's first step was to call on prosecutors to investigate
whether the cash-poor Penguins were criminally negligent for not
paying dlrs 1 million in city amusement taxes.
	   ``We're not a collection agency. If we determine this is a
criminal matter, we're going to go on it,'' said Allegheny County
District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr.
	   The Penguins said ``heavy-handed tactics such as these aren't
going to help us keep the Penguins viable in Pittsburgh.''
	   Murphy's request to put additional heat on the Penguins came
after Marino, who on Tuesday became the first major pro sports
franchise owner to take his team into bankruptcy in nearly a
quarter-century, said the need for a new arena has become glaringly
apparent.
	   Marino insists he means a new arena in Pittsburgh, not one
elsewhere, even though he visited other cities earlier this year.
	   ``For the most part, the teams doing well are those in the new
arenas ... with the additional streams of revenue they produce,''
Marino said. ``Those that aren't doing so well are those in the
older arenas.''
	   The 37-year-old Civic Arena, known as the Igloo because of its
spherical steel roof, will become the oldest in the NHL later this
season when the Toronto Maple Leafs vacate Maple Leaf Gardens.
	   Complicating the Pengsuins' quest for a new arena is a decision
18 months ago to seek a renovated arena rather than a new one.
	   The Penguins accepted dlrs 12.9 million in renovations in
exchange for extending their Civic Arena lease through 2007.
	   But, faced with millions of dollars in ever-mounting debt that
includes dlrs 28.6 million owed to former star Mario Lemieux in
deferred payments, the Penguins are arguing the arena facelift
wasn't nearly enough.
	   Murphy said the Penguins' about-face is indicative of the team's
shortsightedness rather than the failure of local government to
recognize the fiscal plight of one of Pittsburgh's best-known
assets.
	   Still, Murphy isn't ruling out working with the Penguins on a
new arena once they get their finances sorted out and the team
solidifies its commitment to the city.

<TEXT>
	   ERMELO, Netherlands (AP) _ Ceaseless rain and wind keep Payman
Taha and her young daughter inside the canvas tent, one of dozens
serving as temporary homes for those seeking asylum in Holland.
	   ``This is not good,'' the Kurdish refugee who fled Iraq said
Wednesday, gesturing first to her shoeless toddler, then to the
muddy field outside the tent. Inside, the tent leaks and the heater
gives off a musty odor.
	   That the situation is ``not good'' is the one fact everyone
agrees on. But the Dutch have found themselves deeply divided over
how their country _ which prides itself on centuries of taking in
the desperate and downtrodden _ should handle the latest crush of
refugees.
	   Each day, as many as 300 people seek asylum in the Netherlands.
Most come from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Bosnia.
	   Through September, a total of 31,466 refugees have applied for
permission to stay this year, the Interior Ministry says _ a 30
percent jump from the same period a year ago. By the end of the
year, some officials fear that number could swell to 50,000.
	   The increase has created a shortage of space in Europe's most
densely populated nation. This week, at least 50 tents were erected
near Ermelo, a town 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Amsterdam.
	   Critics call the camp _ with its small tents, portable toilets
and single water tank _ inhumane.
	   ``The tents are fine for soldiers _ they have boots and coats _
but not for the refugees,'' said Jan Schonewille, a church
volunteer helping shuttle refugees from the local train station to
the tent camp.
	   Under army and police guard, 80 people are housed there for one
or two days before being moved to another refugee center, said
shelter manager Toon van Dyk, who works with the Ministry of
Justice. When refugees leave, more come to the camp.
	   ``We hope to get a better facility as soon as possible,'' Van
Dyk said, though he conceded he had no idea when that would happen.
	   Job Cohen, the Dutch state secretary for justice, has demanded
an accelerated search for better temporary housing than the tents,
which do little to protect from the weather.
	   ``With the rain we've been having, this isn't a pretty
picture,'' he said.
	   Outside the camp, the debate over how to handle the influx has
triggered a squabble between Cohen's center-left Labor Party and
the right-leaning Liberal Party, both partners in the Netherlands'
governing coalition.
	   The Labor Party came under fire this week for its suggestion
that Dutch housing authorities set aside five out of every 4,000
available housing units for refugees.
	   ``The days of a free stay must end,'' said Henk Kamp, a Liberal
leader. ``Over the past three years, the stream of refugees has
tripled. We're moving into an absolute emergency situation.''
	   More sturdy and comfortable tents have been erected in another
refugee camp near the western city of Leiden, said Werner van
Bastelaar, spokesman for the Asylum Seeker Accommodation Center, a
government funded organization. Refugees further along in the
asylum-seeking process may move into those tents by the end of the
week.
	   A man who fled his native Sudan by boat with just dlrs 25 in his
pocket says the Dutch government must help refugees who came
because they fear for their lives.
	   ``I did not leave my family to find an easy life,'' said the
man, identifying himself only as M.F.A. for fear the Sudanese
government will harm his family.
	   ``I left to rescue myself,'' he said. ``If I return, maybe I
don't live long.''

Preparations for more settlement construction under way
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Coinciding with the start of a Mideast summit,
Israel radio reported Thursday that bulldozers are leveling ground
for the 12-fold expansion of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
	   The Israeli group Peace Now said the construction site is more
than 1 kilometer (mile) away from the Alei Zahav settlement. The
building constitutes the start of a new settlement, not the
expansion of an existing one, the group said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised the United States
and the Palestinians that he will not start new settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, but only expand existing ones to
accommodate natural population growth.
	   The Palestinians say settlement construction is part of an
illegal land grab by Israel and undercuts their claims to statehood
in the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Israel radio said the Defense Ministry has approved the
construction of 1,200 homes near Alei Zahav, which is located about
5 kilometers from the invisible line between Israel and the West
Bank. Peace Now said Alei Zahav has about 100 homes now.
	   Project manager Arieh Ofri told the radio that in the first
stage, 100 homes would be built and future construction would
depend on demand. ``This is a very desirable area,'' Ofri said,
noting the proximity of the settlement to Israel and the Tel Aviv
metropolitan area. ``So far, everything that has been built has
been sold.''
	   Peace Now leader Mossi Raz said that calling the project an
expansion of Alei Zahav was a ruse. He said that while the
construction was taking place within the municipal boundaries of
Alei Zahav, in fact a new, separate community was being built.
	   ``Legally, it's not a new settlement, but for all intents and
purposes, it is, to any rational person,'' Raz said.

Myanmar opposition insists on right to hold mass rallies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The National League for Democracy,
Myanmar's main opposition party, says it has the same right as the
military government to stage mass rallies.
	   A statement from the NLD, received Thursday, also criticized a
series of mass pro-government gatherings being held around the
country, saying, ``Such rallies only complicate the political
conditions.''
	   Since the end of last month, the military government has been
organizing mass rallies at which participants have called for the
removal of NLD leaders, accusing them of disturbing the peace and
hindering economic progress.
	   The NLD statement claimed that ``people from various social and
economic organizations and public servants were forced to attend
the state-sponsored mass rallies, and read out proposals and passed
resolutions.''
	   The NLD is informally banned from holding public meetings, and
severely restricted in almost all its other activities. Almost
1,000 members have been detained without charge in recent months.
	   On Tuesday, a government press release said, 23,000 people
attended one of its rallies in Lashio in northern Shan state.
	   It said participants approved two motions ``calling for
safeguarding and maintaining already achieved economic development
... and the already achieved stability of the state.''
	   The NLD statement said the party's chairman had written to junta
chairman Gen. Than Shwe on Tuesday saying that the NLD had the
right to organize a mass rally to give its view of the prevailing
political situation.
	   The statement noted that not only had the government failed to
convene a parliament whose members were elected eight years ago,
but it had also been detaining the elected members of parliament.
	   The NLD won a landslide election in the 1990 poll.
	   According to the party, some 979 of its members, including 203
elected members of parliament, have been detained in recent months.
	   The government began the detentions when the NLD announced plans
to convene parliament on its own. It began holding the mass rallies
after senior NLD members starting holding meetings it said were the
equivalent of parliamentary sessions.

In landmark shift, Germany to liberalize citizenship

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 1997 figures for new citizens released &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After years of denial, Germany is taking a
big step toward accepting immigrants and their children by knocking
down barriers in the nation's 85-year-old citizenship law.
	   The decision by the future government is the first major policy
shift resulting from the left's election victory last month and an
important gesture to Germany's 7 million foreign residents, who
make up nearly 10 percent of the population.
	   ``This government will recognize that Germany is a country of
immigrants,'' said Kerstin Mueller, a domestic policy for the
Greens party, the junior partner in the incoming government
coalition.
	   The language took aim at outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government, which insisted that Germany is not an immigration land.
	   Germany's 2 million Turks have fought especially hard for the
changes. Most Turkish children born here have grown up virtually as
Germans, but they still feel excluded from an increasingly
multicultural society by the 1913 citizenship law, which grants
automatic citizenship only on the basis of German blood.
	   More than half of the 82,913 foreigners who made it through the
arduous process and received German citizenship last year were from
Turkey, the federal statistics office reported Thursday.

Russia threshes less grain so far in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In more bad news for Russia's food situation, the
country has harvested only half as much grain so far this year as
it did in the same period last year, a news agency reported
Thursday.
	   Russia's farms and agricultural companies threshed 50 million
metric tons (55 million tons) of grain from Jan. 1 to Oct. 12, down
46 percent from the same time in 1997, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said, citing the State Statistics Committee.
	   Russia is expecting one of its worst harvests in 40 years
because of drought. The government is reportedly seeking up to 3.3
million tons of donated grain from the United States.
	   In other bad harvest news, the country's potato crop is also
down for the same Jan. 1-Oct. 12 period. The country harvested 30
million metric tons (33 million tons), down 10.7 percent from last
year.
	   Farmers are also planting less for the 1999 harvest. They plowed
22 million hectares (54 million acres) this fall, down from 25
million hectares (61 million acres) last year.
	   However, the sugar beet harvest was up by 22 percent, and the
sunflower seed harvest almost doubled, ITAR-Tass said, without
providing specific figures.

body; CLARIFIES body aimed only at elections, and not new
government; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Government and opposition parties agreed
to set up a special body to prepare for new elections, a gesture of
reconciliation after months of upheaval.
	   The agreement came late Wednesday, when a mediator announced
that the arrangement would include opposition party representatives
and be responsible for creating the basis for free and fair
elections within 18 months.
	   Tensions in Lesotho, a small mountainous kingdom surrounded by
South Africa, have been running high since the May elections, which
opposition groups claim were rigged.
	   After an army revolt and crippling strikes, South Africa and
nearby Botswana on Sept. 22 sent about 1,000 troops into the
country to restore calm. South Africa expected to establish order
quickly and leave, but scores were killed and its soldiers remain
in Lesotho.
	   A South African government statement said the parties would
appoint technical teams to examine proposals for the new election
body, expected to be appointed by Oct. 31.
	   South Africa's Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi
mediated the daylong talks.
	   Earlier on Wednesday, United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan urged the rival parties to resolve the conflict.
	   ``You did not disappoint ... Annan, who implored you to work
towards an agreement,'' Mufamadi said.
	   The Southern African Development Community, a 14-national
regional group, uncovered serious irregularities in the May
elections.
	   The Independent Electoral Commission is slated for
reorganization by year's end, and is expected to draft a new code
of conduct for political parties.

Industry chief: Proposed new tax will hurt tourism business
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with travel agent's bookings showing more Australians
visiting Asia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's planned
new tax on all goods and services would make the Australian tourism
industry less internationally competitive, the Tourism Council of
Australia said Thursday.
	   Australia was currently ninth on a list prepared by the council
of 20 holiday destinations that were comparable in terms of
affordability. If the new tax is introduced, Australia will drop to
10th place, council managing director Don Larkin said.
	   ``The impact of a GST (goods and services tax) will downgrade
our price competitiveness and take Australia from a ranking of 9 to
a ranking of 10 among our global competitors,'' Larkin said.
	   Howard has refused to exempt the industry from the new tax,
which was the centerpiece of the tax reform package which saw his
conservative coalition re-elected in Oct. 3 balloting.
	   The package includes a 10 percent tax on all goods and services,
offset by big personal income tax cuts.
	   Larkin said Howard should rethink including tourist services
because the industry is struggling due to the Asian financial
crisis.
	   ``Australia's tourism industry is at the crossroads with tight
profit margins, international demand softening and a flat domestic
market, so further improving our competitiveness is vital,'' Larkin
said.
	   The council released a survey Thursday that showed Australia was
more expensive than Indonesia, Thailand, China, Malaysia, South
Korea, Turkey, Taiwan and Singapore when it came to food, drinks,
accommodation and tours.
	   Australia was cheaper than New Zealand, North America, the
United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Japan and most of Europe.
	   The survey did not take into account recent fluctuations in the
Australian dollar, which has fallen in value by about 13 Australian
cents against the U.S. dollar in the past year.
	   Analysis of the survey showed Australia was relatively price
competitive for business travelers, but less so for travelers
visiting friends and relatives, Larkin said.
	   Meanwhile, one of Australia's largest travel agents said
declining currency values in Asia meant more Australians were
traveling to Asia rather than North America and Europe.
	   Thomas Cook Ltd. said Thursday its records show that Australian
bookings for Asia rose 16.4 percent overall in the 12 months to
Aug. 31.
	   The biggest winners were Thailand, where bookings had rocketed
26 percent in the period, and the Indonesian island of Bali, where
bookings rose by 14 percent, said Peter Hansen, Thomas Cook's
communications manager for Australasia.
	   During the same period, bookings to the United States dropped 30
percent. Bookings to Europe rose slightly, by 4.6 percent.

Saints claim Kerry Collins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEVEL JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Kerry Collins, saying he never quit on the
Carolina Panthers as was reported last week, is starting a new
career with the New Orleans Saints.
	   The Saints, planning to start their third quarterback of the
season on Sunday, claimed Collins for a dlrs 100 waiver fee after
18 other teams passed.
	   ``All we're trying to do is find a way to get better,'' said
coach Mike Ditka, whose team has lost two straight, including last
week's 31-0 drubbing by San Francisco. ``I hope he can give us some
stability and some leadership.''
	   On Tuesday, Carolina released Collins, who was demoted from
starting quarterback to third string last week.
	   Collins broke his week-long silence Wednesday about his demotion
and subsequent release, saying he never told coach Dom Capers that
he didn't want to play.
	   ``That hurt,'' Collins told The Associated Press in a interview
from his agent's office in Newport Beach, California. ``That wasn't
what I was trying to get across. At no point did I say that.''
	   During a conference call Wednesday, Tampa Bay defensive tackle
Warren Sapp, who goes against Carolina (0-5) on Sunday, called
Collins a coward.
	   ``He disgraced the game,'' Sapp said. ``He disgraced Johnny
Unitas and all the great quarterbacks who ever played the game.''
	   Tampa Bay plays the Saints in New Orleans on Oct. 25. New
Orleans meets Carolina on Nov. 1 at Charlotte.
	   Collins said he was happy to get another chance to play, but
made it clear that he wasn't satisfied with the way he left the
Panthers, who in 1995 made him the franchise's first-ever draft
pick.
	   ``Everything happened so fast. It just got out of hand, really,
and before I knew it, it was too late,'' he said. ``I feel bad
about it. Obviously, this is very hard for me. I never said my
heart wasn't in it.''
	   Instead, Collins said he had what he thought was ``a very good,
civil discussion'' with Capers about the Panthers' winless start
and the quarterback's role in it.
	   ``I told him, `If this is all happening because of me, if it's
my fault, I would understand if you wanted to go in another
direction,''' Collins said. ``I never intended to quit. I never
intended to withdraw my services. I basically wanted to feel them
out.''
	   After the meeting, Capers said Collins had told him that he felt
partly responsible for the team's poor start and that he felt his
heart was no longer into leading the team. Many of Collins'
teammates heard about that remark and questioned whether he could
ever return to lead the offense.
	   At that point, Collins said, he realized that his days with the
Panthers were numbered.
	   The Saints will pick up the remaining dlrs 746,048 of Collins'
dlrs 1.153 million contract. He becomes a free agent at the end of
the season.
	   Collins said he's excited about the new opportunity in New
Orleans, which began the season at quarterback with Billy Joe
Hobert, who was injured and knocked out for the season in the first
game.
	   On Wednesday, Ditka benched Danny Wuerffel and gave the starting
job to Billy Joe Tolliver.

McEnroe says he'll never beg to Sampras
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ John McEnroe says Davis Cup tennis is
at its ``lowest point in history'' and he couldn't become the
United States' captain because it might involve begging to Pete
Sampras.
	   ``Tennis has become a joke in the Davis Cup and the Olympics,''
McEnroe said Thursday at the Champions senior tour event.
	   ``It just doesn't seem the players ultimately care about
playing. That I never will understand. Considering the amount of
money and all the attention they get from the game, you'd think
they'd at least want to represent their country for four weeks a
year maximum.''
	   McEnroe said it would be too difficult for him to play a direct
role in lifting Davis Cup out of the doldrums.
	   ``I guess I'd have to get on my knees and beg Sampras to play,
which is one reason I don't want to take the job (as U.S.
captain),'' McEnroe said. ``I can't imagine bending that low.''
	   Meanwhile McEnroe, who once wrote off Pat Rafter as a one slam
wonder, now says the two-time US Open title winner is a potential
world No.1.
	   But McEnroe believes the feature that endears Rafter most to his
fellow Australians, his nice guy approach, may prove his nemesis.
	   McEnroe said after Rafter's 1997 US Open title that he did not
expect the No. 2-ranked player to back it up with a second.
	   ``The way it appears right now, he's got a real good opportunity
to be potentially the best player in the world,'' McEnroe said.
	   Rafter slumped after his 1997 win but was back to his best form
in time to defend his title at Flushing Meadows last month.
	   ``The question is how he reacts this time,'' said McEnroe.
``Clearly, when you've won two straight, you're going to be
favorite next time.''
	   He described Rafter as a popular player who cared about his
friendships _ and it was not meant as a compliment.
	   ``When you care about your friendships sometimes you're not as
mean as you need to be maybe on the court,'' said McEnroe, known
through his career as Superbrat.

Russia returns remains of Japanese POWs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia returned to Japan the remains of 13 former
prisoners of war found in a former concentration camp where they
were kept from 1945-48, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday.
	   Workers supervised by a delegation from the Japanese Health
Service and Social Welfare Ministry have been digging up the
remains from the Khalaza-2 concentration camp in the Russian Far
East since the beginning of October.
	   Russia and Japan have been working together for six years to
find the remains of missing POWs, said Valentina Buraya, first
deputy chairman of the Primorye branch of the Russian Peace Fund.
Japan is paying for the project.
	   Buraya said 113 burial sites have been found in the Primorye
region alone and that 1,100 remains have been returned to Japan.
	   Of the 600,000 Japanese POWs held in the Soviet Union after the
war, 60,000 died and were buried there. Russia and Japan have never
formally signed a peace treaty formally ending hostilities.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Most of the banks examined by

capital-adequacy ratios below the required standard, Bank Indonesia
Gov. Sjahril Sabirin said Thursday.
	   Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a seminar on foreign
exchange and corporate debt, Sjahril said audits had been finished
on ``around 80'' banks.
	   ``Only a few banks have a capital-adequacy ratio of more than
(the minimum requirement of) 4 percent,'' the governor said. He
declined to name these banks.
	   A bank's capital-adequacy ratio is one of the key measures of a
bank's financial strength. Usually, the higher the ratio, the
sounder the bank.
	   Sjahril reiterated that banks with capital adequacy ratios below
4 percent, and down to minus 25 percent, must recapitalize and that
the government will provide up to 80 percent of the cash.
	   Banks whose ratios are below minus 25 percent have to inject
fresh capital to bring their ratios to that level, after which the
government would help them recapitalize. In return for the cash,
the government will take equity in the banks.
	   The central bank, assisted by international audit companies, has
been auditing all local banks as part of the country's economic
reform agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
	   Reform of the ailing banking sector is regarded as a key step in
overcoming the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The government has already closed more than 20 banks and
nationalized four others.

Students demanding reform gear up for national protest

	   PARIS (AP) _ French high school students Thursday were carrying
out a nationwide day of protests, keeping up their pressure on the
leftist government to cut class sizes and buy more equipment.
	   About 25,000 students were expected to march in Paris, while
thousands were expected to rally in other cities across France in a
third day of protest this week. Authorities braced for new
violence.
	   Meanwhile a student union leader predicted protests at least up
to Toussaint vacation at the end of next week, unless Education
Minister Claude Allegre quickly carries out his promises to improve
school conditions.
	   ``We'll see what is won or not,'' said Thibault Cotta,
secretary-general of the Independent and Democratic Federation of
High Schoolers (FIDL), calling for ``concrete action'' by Allegre.
	   ``The students support a movement that can last at least until
vacation,'' he told France Inter radio. Without progress this week,
Cotta said his federation would march on the National Assembly on
Tuesday, the day before a budget vote.
	   Educational reform can't happen without ``an increase in the
budget to raise the number of teachers,'' Cotta said, and he called
for dialogue between students and education officials. ``That's the
beginning of reform.''
	   He denounced violence during marches earlier this week but said
that in student marches ``things get broken. It's normal. ... We'll
try to keep it from happening again today.''
	   After youths smashed store windows and damaged cars during
marches earlier this week, authorities were advising merchants to
shutter their shops and motorists not to park their cars along
march routes.
	   Allegre on Wednesday insisted the government had heard the
students.
	   ``I think it is logical for the young, when there are needs,
when there aren't enough teachers, when classrooms are overcrowded,
to demand good working conditions,'' the minister said at the close
of the weekly Cabinet meeting.
	   ``I'm doing what I can to give this to them,'' he said. At the
Cabinet meeting, Allegre presented his plan to spread teachers out
more equitably around the country, a decree that bypasses the
parliamentary process.
	   On Tuesday, he said the plan aims at ``putting a teacher in
front of every student.'' He promised that a plan to lighten the
course load for high school students would be presented next month.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, himself a former
education minister, hailed the plan, saying it would bring about
``very rapid improvements.''
	   Even some teachers were beginning to root for protesting
students. One of the largest teacher's unions called on Tuesday for
its members to show solidarity with their protesting students.

Primakov launches debt-settlement plan

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov ordered the
government and its agencies to start settling their huge
outstanding bills, a problem that has paralyzed the Russian
economy.
	   The Cabinet discussed these measures a week ago and was
scheduled to finalize them Thursday. But Primakov abruptly canceled
the Cabinet meeting, saying the proposals were already clear and
needed to be implemented.
	   ``We have had enough discussions, we now must act,'' spokesman
Igor Shchegolev quoted him as saying.
	   The plan worked out by the economics and finance ministries
would require the government and state-owned companies to clear
their mutual debts of some 50 billion rubles (dlrs 3.8 billion) by
mid-December.
	   The cash-strapped government has been a major debtor in the
Russian economy, failing to pay wages and pensions to workers and
other bills to state-run companies. The workers and companies then
cannot pay their bills, leading to a chain of non-payments that is
disabling Russian industries.
	   Officials admit that the unpaid bills among the government and
the state-owned companies and organizations are small compared to
those in the private sector. They estimate all debts in Russia
total a staggering 1.2 trillion rubles (dlrs 92 billion), or about
40 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
	   Primakov has said the government bills must be settled without
printing new money, a move that would lead to high inflation.
However, he has not said where the money will come from and it is
likely that many of the debts will be settled through barter or
other non-cash transactions.
	   In other economic news Thursday:
	   _ Russia's hard currency reserves rose from dlrs 12.8 billion to
dlrs 13.3 billion in the week ending Oct. 9, the Central Bank said.
The bank has been actively buying dollars in recent weeks to
strengthen its reserves depleted at the start of the crisis.
	   _ Inflation for the first 12 days of October was 0.8 percent,
after soaring last month following the ruble's sharp plunge.
Average daily price increases decreased from 1.09 percent in
September to 0.66 percent this month, the State Statistics
Committee said.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A wary NATO and world leaders are
keeping up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, saying he
needs to withdraw many more Serb forces from Kosovo before
Saturday's deadline.
	   About halfway through the four-day grace period given Milosevic
to show he's met international demands on ending Kosovo turmoil,
NATO officials said he had a long way to go. And despite noting
signs of progress, a U.S. spokesman called compliance efforts ``a
mixed bag.''
	   ``NATO authorities will have to make a judgment at the end of
the week, whether there is substantial and serious compliance on
the part of President Milosevic,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin said in Washington on Wednesday.
	   In case there isn't, the alliance is continuing with
preparations for air raids against the Serbs. NATO warplanes are
being moved to bases in Italy, just across the Adriatic Sea from
Yugoslavia.
	   International officials gathered in Paris and Vienna on Thursday
as part of the assessment process and push for peace in Kosovo.
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia was to meet in Paris.
	   Later Thursday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe was set to approve the verification mission it will oversee
in Kosovo. The move will authorize Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, the OSCE chairman, to sign an agreement on the
mission with Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade on Friday.
	   The verification mission was a key part of the deal struck
Monday by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke with Milosevic to end his
seven-month crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Western nations are discussing naming Jacques Klein, the
American deputy to Bosnia's top international mediator Carlos
Westendorp, as head of the 2,000-person mission _ to be composed
largely of Europeans.
	   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said Wednesday that Britain
will contribute 200 people to the verification force, and both
Russia and Germany are expected to make similar contributions.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement, which put off the
threat of impending airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   The U.N. refugee agency resumed aid convoys to refugees
Wednesday, two days after suspending them for fear of Serb
retaliation if NATO attacked. Rubin said European and American
monitors _ the advance team for the verification force _ found
evidence of refugees returning.
	   But many refugees remained in hiding, fearing reprisals from
Serb special police who have torched their villages and been
accused of atrocities against civilians _ not just rebel fighters
fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   ``He's lying!'' said Hajdin Mehmeti, a 70-year-old refugee in
the forested hamlet of Baks, referring to the Yugoslav president's
pledges. ``Until the NATO planes fly here, Milosevic will say
whatever people want to hear.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic
Albanian separatists in the southern Serbian province. Many are
crammed into houses with relatives and other refugees; tens of
thousands of others remain camped and are vulnerable to worsening
weather in hilly Kosovo.
	   Among the demands Milosevic must meet by Saturday, the one in
which he appears to be the furthest from compliance is withdrawal
of his forces to levels before the crackdown began on Feb. 28.
	   A NATO official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Wednesday in Brussels that some Yugoslav units remained in Kosovo.
He declined to say how many but said they far exceed the level
required by NATO.
	   A week ago, Washington said Milosevic had withdrawn only 40
percent of the troops he sent into Kosovo and only 1,000 of 10,000
special police.
	   International officials acknowledge they won't have a full
picture of the situation until the monitoring mission begins. It's
expected to take days or weeks to assemble the force from the
OSCE's 54 member nations.
	   The monitors will be unarmed, and officials in Washington said
Wednesday the NATO allies are planning to protect them by deploying
an offshore backup force in the Adriatic Sea, capable of carrying
out rescue missions.

China Oct. 19-23 at the invitation of Premier Zhu Rongji, according
to a Foreign Affairs statement.
	   The statement, issued Wednesday and published in local media
Thursday, did not indicate what topics that Khai hopes to address.

over the Spratly and Paracel islands, commerce between the two

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. officials are making sure Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators have their cozy comforts and security as
they try to negotiate a peace settlement in a secluded compound
outside Washington this week.
	   At Israel's request, summit organizers have installed
bulletproof windows in Wye Plantation rooms set aside for the
Israeli negotiators, the Haaretz daily said. A kosher kitchen was
also established.
	   Meanwhile, backgammon sets have been obtained for the
Palestinians, known to be big fans of the game.
	   Flowers and cigars will be provided to both sides, though
smoking is only allowed outdoors.
	   Israel's delegation gets a nice view of the Wye River, while the
Palestinians' rooms overlook plantation fields.

	   Lahoud, 62, won the backing of a public fed up with bickering
and corrupt politicians who have ruled Lebanon since the end of the
devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   He also won the all-important approval from Syrian President
Hafez Assad, whose country is the main power broker in Lebanon.
	   The general, a naval officer trained in Britain and the United
States, overcame constitutional hurdles and concerns among
politicians about the ascent of a military man to the nation's
highest office.
	   His election also respects the tradition in Lebanon's
sectarian-based political system that the president is a Maronite
Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament
speaker a Shiite Muslim.
	   It was the first balloting for a head of state in Lebanon in
peacetime since the 1970 election of Suleiman Franjieh. Five
presidents have been elected since. Bashir Gemayel was assassinated
in a 1982 bomb explosion before he took office. Rene Mouawad was
killed in a bombing shortly after he took over.

Constitutional Court to rule on whether Yeltsin can run again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Constitutional Court opened hearings
Thursday on whether Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term.
	   The issue was controversial earlier this year when Yeltsin
refused to spell out his intentions and his aides insisted he had
the legal right to seek re-election.
	   It has lost some of its urgency, as Yeltsin has grown physically
and politically weaker and has said he will not run again.
	   The Russian Constitution has a two-term limit for presidents.
But Yeltsin's aides say his first term, from 1991 to 1996, does not
count because it began six months before the Soviet Union collapsed
and before the current constitution took effect.
	   Communists and other Yeltsin opponents in parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, disagreed and appealed to the Constitutional
Court in February.
	   While the case has been waiting to be heard, events have
overtaken it.
	   Yeltsin has flatly said he will not seek another term, and the
opposition has concentrated its efforts on demanding an early
resignation, riding a wave of popular discontent over the economic
crisis.
	   The call for Yeltsin to step down was backed by many
participants in a nationwide labor action earlier this month that
attracted about 1 million people.
	   Yeltsin's growing health problems would also seem to rule out
another election campaign. A respiratory infection forced him to
cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this week.
	   On Wednesday, parliament's upper chamber, the Federation
Council, voted on a resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign, but it
failed narrowly.
	   Even if had passed, the move would have had no legal
consequences, but it highlighted growing anti-Yeltsin sentiments in
the chamber made up of powerful regional leaders, most of whom have
been loyal to the president.
	   Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative on the
Constitutional Court, said Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore calls
for an early resignation.
	   ``The president is a strong person, and he has been through far
more difficult political situations,'' Mityukov said, according to
the Interfax news agency.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7-9 with dissidents unsuccessfully attempting
to register opposition party in Sichuan province &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police detained and questioned the organizer of a
group set up by dissidents to monitor official corruption and told
him the group's activities must cease, a human rights group said
Thursday.
	   Police in Xinyang, in central China's Henan province, took An
Jun away Wednesday afternoon and held him until past midnight for
questioning about the group's members, said the Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   Police wanted a list of members with their work and home
addresses, a demand An Jun refused for fear of getting them into
trouble, the Hong Kong-based Information Center said.
	   Corruption Watch, founded by nine dissidents in seven provinces,
now has nearly 100 members, the center said. It applied last month
to the government to register officially, but received no response,
the center added.
	   The police officers who questioned An Jun said that without
official permission, the group must cease its activities, the
center said.
	   Rampant official corruption is a major public gripe in China.
The Information Center said Corruption Watch had already received
reports of graft in its first month of operation.
	   In a separate report, the center said that an official in the
Sichuan provincial government refused Thursday to accept an
application by three dissidents to form a branch of a would-be
opposition group, the China Democracy Party.
	   Groups of dissidents in cities across China have attempted to
register the group, as required by law, but authorities have
rejected those applications.
	   Signaling that the Communist Party's 49-year-old ban on
opposition groups remains intact, police have detained and
questioned many dissidents associated with the group.

U.N.: poorest countries' progress at risk from slump and storms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Efforts by the world's poorest countries to join
the economic mainstream risk being derailed by natural disasters
and world depression, according to a report released Thursday by
the U.N. trade and development agency.
	   But they should not give up those efforts, the U.N. Conference
on Trade and Development warned in its annual Least Developed
Countries Report.
	   Of the 48 countries classed as the world's least developed, 33
of them are in Africa.
	   Although most African countries' economies showed healthy growth
last year, some stumbled due to disasters caused by the El Nino
weather phenomenon and the falling price of commodities central to
their economy, the report said.
	   Their prospects will improve if European economies stay strong
and South Africa picks up, it added.
	   But the Asian crisis and its knock-on effects are likely to
squeeze the very poorest countries as foreign financing dries up,
the report added.
	   The 210-page study provided no specific prediction for growth,
because of world economic uncertainty and the unpredictability of
the kind of shocks caused by El Nino.
	   ``No one in his right mind would want to hazard a guess beyond
the next few days'' at the moment, senior UNCTAD official Andrew
Whitley told a news conference.
	   The effects of floods which covered much of Bangladesh,
torrential rain in Bhutan, Nepal and Sudan, and hurricane damage in
Haiti ``may take years to repair and may forestall growth in the
foreseeable future,'' UNCTAD secretary-general Rubens Ricupero
conceded.
	   The report singled out Bangladesh's growth rate of 5.7 percent
last year, with a strong farming sector, as a hopeful Asian
performance.

Nearing deadline, Milosevic urged to make pullouts, comply on

Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jacques Klein being considered to head
verification mission; Britain contributing 200 people to
verification force and Russia, Germany likely to make similar
contributions; NATO allies planning offshore backup force &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A wary NATO and world leaders were
keeping up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, saying he
needs to withdraw many more Serb forces from Kosovo province before
Saturday's deadline.
	   About halfway through the four-day grace period given Milosevic
to show he has met international demands for ending the Kosovo
turmoil, NATO officials said he had a long way to go. And despite
noting signs of progress, a U.S. spokesman called compliance
efforts ``a mixed bag.''
	   ``NATO authorities will have to make a judgment at the end of
the week, whether there is substantial and serious compliance on
the part of President Milosevic,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin said in Washington on Wednesday.
	   In case there isn't, the alliance is continuing with
preparations for air raids against the Serbs. NATO warplanes are
being moved to bases in Italy, just across the Adriatic Sea from
Yugoslavia.
	   International officials gathered in Paris and Vienna on Thursday
as part of the assessment process and push for peace in Kosovo.
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia was to meet in Paris.
	   Later Thursday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe was set to approve the verification mission it will oversee
in Kosovo. The move will authorize Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, the OSCE chairman, to sign an agreement on the
mission with Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade on Friday.
	   The verification mission was a key part of the deal struck
Monday by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke with Milosevic to end his
seven-month crackdown on ethnic Albanians, who are the vast
majority in Kosovo, a Serb province.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic
Albanian separatists in the southern Serbian province. Many are
crammed into houses with relatives and other refugees; tens of
thousands of others remain camped and are vulnerable to worsening
weather in hilly Kosovo.
	   Western nations were discussing naming Jacques Klein, the
American deputy to Bosnia's top international mediator Carlos
Westendorp, as head of the 2,000-person mission _ to be composed
largely of Europeans.
	   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said Wednesday that Britain
will contribute 200 people to the verification force, and both
Russia and Germany are expected to make similar contributions.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's Albanian refugees from disaster have
been stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement, which put off
the threat of impending airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   The U.N. refugee agency resumed aid convoys to refugees
Wednesday, two days after suspending them for fear of Serb
retaliation if NATO attacked. Rubin said European and American
monitors _ the advance team for the verification force _ found
evidence of refugees returning.
	   But many refugees remained in hiding, fearing reprisals from
Serb special police who have torched their villages and been
accused of atrocities against civilians _ not just ethnic Albanian
rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence.
	   ``He's lying!'' said Hajdin Mehmeti, a 70-year-old refugee in
the forested hamlet of Baks, referring to the Yugoslav president's
pledges. ``Until the NATO planes fly here, Milosevic will say
whatever people want to hear.''
	   Among the demands Milosevic must meet by Saturday, the one in
which he appears to be the furthest from compliance is withdrawal
of his forces to levels before the crackdown began on Feb. 28.
	   A NATO official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Wednesday in Brussels that some Yugoslav units remained in Kosovo.
He declined to say how many but said they far exceed the level
required by NATO.
	   A week ago, Washington said Milosevic had withdrawn only 40
percent of the troops he sent into Kosovo and only 1,000 of 10,000
special police.
	   International officials acknowledge they won't have a full
picture of the situation until the monitoring mission begins. It's
expected to take days or weeks to assemble the force from the
OSCE's 54 member nations.
	   The monitors will be unarmed, and officials in Washington said
Wednesday the NATO allies are planning to protect them by deploying
an offshore backup force in the Adriatic Sea, capable of carrying
out rescue missions.

Typhoon roars out of Philippines, heads for Taiwan

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Zeb roared out of the
Philippines Thursday, leaving at least 24 people dead, including a
South Korean, and causing floods and mudslides that swept away
thatch homes, disaster officials said.
	   Its punishing winds also were wreaking havoc in Taiwan, where
two more storm-related deaths were reported.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines as Zeb brought rampaging floods and peak sustained
winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per hour. Most have since
returned home, but some 10,160 still were housed in 28 government
shelters.
	   In Benguet province, at least 10 people were killed and an
undetermined number of others were missing after boulders, mud and
debris crashed down a mountain and covered a workers' quarters of
the Luzon Hydroelectric Cooperative, the provincial disaster office
said.
	   In nearby Baguio City, also in Benguet, five people died in
separate landslides, and Kim Young-nin, a 30-year-old student from
Ulsan, South Korea, died after a section of road collapsed, sending
his car plunging into a ravine, said police spokesman Chief
Inspector Ricardo Villena.
	   ``There are so many reports of landslides that will keep us busy
for a while,'' Villena said.
	   In Camarines Sur, a 40-year-old man was electrocuted while
fixing his television antenna when a high-tension wire fell on his
roof, and a 16-year-old boy also died after being bitten by a
snake.
	   In Antipolo, just outside Manila, two brothers _ aged 2 and 4 _
died after tons of mud and debris cascaded down a hill on to their
hut. Their 6-year-old sister survived.
	   Disaster officials said a 16-year-old boy taking shelter at a
church in Solano town in Nueva Vizcaya province was killed when a
wall crumbled and crushed him. Another victim in Nueva Vizcaya died
when a tree fell on him.
	   Two people died in a hospital from their injuries after being
hit by flying debris in Quirino province.
	   More casualties were likely because of the numerous reports of
landslides and floods in remote areas where communications have
been cut, officials said. Government offices and schools in the
worst-affected areas were turned into emergency shelters.
	   At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status, with
sustained winds of 240 kph (150 mph) and gusts measuring (295 kph)
184 mph.
	   Zeb, the strongest of eight storms to hit the Philippines this
year, weakened as it cut through Luzon mountains.
	   At 4 p.m. (0800 GMT), its winds remained at 165 kph (103 mph)
with gusts of up to 200 kph (125 mph). It was about 680 kilometers
(425 miles) north of Manila near the northernmost Philippine
province of Batanes, said weatherman Rene Molina.
	   Molina said Zeb, traveling at 15 kph (9 mph), was expected to
regain strength as it leaves the Philippines. It was not, however,
expected to strike Taiwan with as much force as it had on arrival
in the Philippines.
	   ``There is no warm air where the typhoon can feed to reach peak
power,'' Molina said. ``Taiwan is likely to be spared much
damage.''
	   Taiwan and parts of Japan were bracing for the typhoon, which
was heading toward islands on Japan's southern fringe early
Thursday.
	   Taiwanese police in southeastern Taitung said a man was swept
out to sea by two-story high waves while fishing, and another died
after being trapped overnight in heavy rain.
	   Last month, Tropical Storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers dead and 80
others missing.

Shells fall near Israeli village; Hezbollah claims responsibility

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hezbollah claiming responsibility, army saying
mortar shells, sted Katyusha rockets were fired &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Several mortar shells fell Thursday near an
Israeli village on the border with Lebanon, and the Shiite Muslim
group Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   Hezbollah said in a statement in Beirut that its forces attacked
the Israeli outpost of Birkit Risha, about five kilometers (three
miles) north of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
	   The Israeli army initially said that Katyusha rockets hit
northern Israel, but later said an investigation showed that mortar
shells were fired. The Israeli army said some shells also landed in
the Israeli-controlled section of Lebanon just across the border.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government
and its Syrian allies, demand that Israel pull about 2,000 soldiers
out of its self-declared security zone, a strip of territory 10 to
15 kilometers (six to nine miles) wide inside Lebanon.

	   Lahoud, 62, won the backing of a public fed up with bickering
and the corrupt politicians who have ruled Lebanon since the end of
the devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   He also won the all-important approval from Syrian President
Hafez Assad, whose country is the main power broker in Lebanon.
	   The general, a naval officer trained in Britain and the United
States, overcame constitutional hurdles and concerns among
politicians about the ascent of a military man to the nation's
highest office.
	   His election also respects the tradition in Lebanon's
sectarian-based political system that the president is a Maronite
Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Parliament
speaker a Shiite Muslim.
	   It was the first balloting for a head of state in Lebanon in
peacetime since the 1970 election of Suleiman Franjieh. Five
presidents have been elected since. Bashir Gemayel was assassinated
in a 1982 bomb explosion before he took office. Rene Mouawad was
killed in a bombing shortly after he took over.
	   Lahoud was essentially drafted for the job of head of state.
	   A media shy scion of a prominent Maronite family, Lahoud could
not speak for his candidacy because rules dictate that the army
commander stay out of politics.
	   He also could not campaign because he was a senior public

its 1990 size.
	   Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion in the
civil-war fractured military, is credited with ending political and

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Doctors said Thursday that Boris Yeltsin was still
suffering from a cold, but that his health was ``satisfactory.''
The Russian president went to work in the Kremlin for a second day.
	   Yeltsin, 67, came down with a respiratory infection that forced
him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier in the week.
Doctors had ordered him to stay home, in bed, to recuperate.
	   But Yeltsin showed up at his office for several hours on
Wednesday, holding talks with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on
the economy and developments in Kosovo.
	   In television pictures of the start of the meeting, Yeltsin
appeared pale and tired, and walked stiffly. But he gestured
animatedly and joked with his ministers, scoffed at his doctors'
advice, and complained that ``I can't even sneeze'' without someone
making a fuss about it.
	   On Thursday, Yeltsin's press spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin quoted
doctors as saying the president's health was ``satisfactory''
although he ``still has signs of a cold,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The president met with a judge from the Constitutional Court,
which opened hearings Thursday into whether Yeltsin could legally
seek a third term in office despite a two-year constitutional
limit.
	   Yeltsin has a history of health problems, and underwent heart
bypass surgery in 1996. Still, he insists he has no major illnesses
and plans to serve out the remaining two years of his term.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index slid Thursday
for the third straight day, falling below 13,000 points after
rumors that Japan's top brokerage suffered massive losses. The U.S.
dollar drifted lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 75.36 points,
or 0.58 percent, closing at 12,995.37. The Nikkei index now has
fallen a total of 559.64 points, including Wednesday's 172.06-point
drop, or 1.30 percent, in three days.
	   The Nikkei last traded below 13,000 points last Friday.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 118.73 yen, down 0.99 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 118.98 yen overnight.
	   Share prices started higher but the market had turned down by
midmorning following a sharp plunge in shares of Nomura Securities
Co. amid rumors that the company was facing massive losses.
	   During the midday break, Nomura announced an unconsolidated
33.72 billion yen (dlrs 285 million) valuation loss on its domestic
securities holdings for the six months ended Sept. 30.
	   But Nomura did not comment on other market rumors that it faced
large losses on derivatives, U.S. Treasury bonds or mortgage-backed
securities. Shares of Nomura Securities finished the day's trading
at 827 yen (dlrs 7.00) per share, down 82 yen (69 cents), or 9.0
percent.
	   Investors bid up shares of some banks earlier in the session
amid optimism that Parliament's upper house will swiftly approve a
bill setting guidelines for pumping public funds into the weakened
banking system, traders said.
	   The lower house passed the legislation Tuesday and the upper
house is to vote it into law Friday.
	   But investors were discouraged by the bleak outlook for Japan's
corporate profits in the current recession, and by the domestic
credit crunch, traders said.
	   ``The overall investment environment is poor,'' said Masaaki
Higashida, deputy general manager of investment information at
Nomura Securities.
	   The bank legislation will require banks that receive a capital
infusion to carry out strict restructuring. Many are believed
likely to increase their capital adequacy ratios by reducing
lending rather than applying for public funds.
	   Trading was moderate, with an estimated 408 million shares
changing hands on the first section, up from Wednesday's 358
million. Declines outnumbered advances 701 to 381, with 183 issues
unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 4.07 points, or 0.41 percent, to 980.11. It had
lost 14.80 points, or 1.48 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, traders said much anxiety remained over the state of
U.S. hedge funds, which were largely blamed for driving the dollar
down last week to its worst falls against the yen in a
quarter-century.
	   Thursday, the dollar moved lower from late New York levels on
selling by foreign players and Japanese institutional investors.
	   The dollar ranged between 117.95 yen and 119.10 yen in
Thursday's trading.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond stood at 0.850 percent, unchanged from Wednesday's finish. Its
price was slightly lower at 108.48 yen from the previous day's
108.68 yen.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Representatives of the Contact Group of nations
concerned with the Balkans were meeting Thursday to discuss
implementation of an accord aimed at preventing NATO airstrikes on
Serb positions in Kosovo.
	   Officials from the United States, Russia, Britain, France,
Germany and Italy were to consider how to ensure that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic carry out his promise to withdraw
troops from Kosovo province and begin peace talks.
	   The group was also to discuss the ``respective roles'' of the
United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, and NATO, the French Foreign Ministry said.
	   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine was to host a news conference at
midday, after the meeting.
	   Milosevic has until Saturday to show he is complying with the
accord he reached Monday with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, aimed
at ending a brutal seven-month crackdown on independence-minded
Kosovo. NATO is threatening air strikes if he doesn't.
	   A 2,000-member verification mission, made up mainly of
Europeans, was to monitor compliance. Jacques Klein, the American
deputy to Bosnia's top international mediator Carlos Westendorp,
was being considered to head the mission.
	   Meanwhile, more nations were offering to participate in the
mission. British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said Wednesday that
Britain will contribute 200 people, and French Defense Minister
Alain Richard said his country would provide an unspecified number
of monitors.
	   Russia and Germany are expected to make similar contributions.
	   Milosevic is being pressured to end the crisis in order to
prevent a humanitarian crisis when winter sets in for thousands of
refugees who fled the fighting between Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's crackdown against the
separatists in the southern Serbian province.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade rose again,
climbing 43.6 percent in August from a year ago, the government
announced Thursday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.158 trillion yen (dlrs 9.73 billion) in August, up 43.6
percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise, higher than Tokyo-based economists surveyed by Dow
Jones Newswires had expected, marked the 17th consecutive monthly
year-on-year increase in the surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing international pressure to revive
its sluggish economy to import more goods and cap the ballooning
surplus.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A committee preparing proposals to make
Singapore more competitive during the economic crisis is looking at
a corporate tax cut along with trims in wages, rental prices and
electricity rates, a Cabinet minister was quoted Thursday as
saying.
	   In a report to be presented before Nov. 14 by the Committee on
Competitiveness _ made up of business, labor and public officials _
a corporate tax cut ``is not ruled out,'' The Business Times
reported.
	   It quoted Minister for Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan as
saying further, ``It's something that we have also been looking
at,'' following a property tax cut approved earlier.
	   Singapore's corporate tax rate is 26 percent, down from 27
percent in 1996. The newspaper said the government's medium-term
target is a 25 percent rate.
	   Business associations have lobbied for a corporate tax cut for a
long time.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Tuesday that the
cost-cutting package will cover labor, land, utilities, transport
costs and government fees.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese lawmakers voted a controversial bill into
law Thursday designed to deal with a massive debt burden left over
from the privatization of the country's former state-run railway.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic party
won passage of the legislation through the opposition-dominated
upper house of Parliament on Thursday with the support of two
minority parties.
	   Japan's lower house had approved the bill earlier this month.
	   The measure requires the government to assume 23.5 trillion yen
(dlrs 197.6 billion) in debt, interest payments on which will be
paid for by a special tax on tobacco. The principal is to be repaid
over a six-decade period starting from 2000.
	   It also commits the seven private rail companies born out of the
break up of the former Japan National Railways in 1987 to
contribute a total of 180 billion yen (dlrs 1.51 billion) to help
meet under-funded railroad worker pension obligations.
	   The seven railroad firms had objected strongly to the plan,
saying they had settled their contributions in a separate 1996
agreement.
	   In that accord, the JR companies had to pay a sum of 170 billion
yen (dlrs 1.43) toward the pension obligations, Japan's Kyodo News
service reported.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Most of the banks examined by
international auditors and Indonesia's central bank have
capital-adequacy ratios below the required standard, Bank Indonesia
Gov. Sjahril Sabirin said Thursday.
	   Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a seminar on foreign
exchange and corporate debt, Sjahril said audits had been finished
on ``around 80'' banks.
	   ``Only a few banks have a capital-adequacy ratio of more than
(the minimum requirement of) four percent,'' the governor said. He
declined to name these banks.
	   A bank's capital-adequacy ratio is one of the key measures of a
bank's financial strength. Usually, the higher the ratio, the
sounder the bank.
	   Sjahril reiterated that banks with capital adequacy ratios below
four percent down to minus 25 percent must recapitalize and that
the government will provide up to 80 percent of the cash.
	   Banks whose ratios are below minus 25 percent have to inject
fresh capital in order to bring their ratios to that level after
which the government would help them recapitalize. In return for
the cash, the government will take equity in the banks.
	   In return for the capital injection, the state will take equity
in the banks.
	   The central bank, assisted by international audit firms, has
been auditing all local banks as part of the country's economic
reform agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
	   ___
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia hopes to pull out of its
recession and achieve economic growth of 1 percent in 1999, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday.
	   But he acknowledged that next year's budget plans will have to
struggle with the economy's laggard performance in 1998, during
which its gross domestic product has been forecast to contract by
4.8 percent.
	   ``It is certain the 1999 budget will be influenced by the
unhealthy economic situation, and we will have a deficit budget for
next year,'' the national news agency Bernama quoted him as saying.
	   Mahathir also said Malaysia will introduce new taxes and fiscal
policies in the 1999 budget to help jump start its economy. The
budget will be announced in Parliament on Oct. 23.
	   Government spending has already been raised by nearly 20 percent
in 1998, after Malaysia turned its back on International Monetary
Fund-style, tight-money, low-spending policies.
	   Malaysia imposed capital controls at the beginning of the month,
which curbed flows of speculative funds, and effectively pegged the
country's currency at 3.80 ringgit to the dollar.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Parliament on Thursday formally elected
Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing
of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.
	   All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his
favor.
	   Lahoud is to be sworn for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day
President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
	   The Parliament members cast paper ballots, which were hand
counted with Lahoud's name read out 118 times.
	   Ten members were absent, including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt,
who had pledged to boycott the session to protest the selection of
a military man as president. He was joined in the boycott by eight
members of his political bloc.
	   Omar Karami, a former prime minister, did not attend. He earlier
had said his vote would not make any difference to the outcome.
	   Lahoud, 62, won the backing of a public fed up with bickering
and corrupt politicians who have ruled Lebanon since the end of the
devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   He also won the all-important approval from Syrian President
Hafez Assad, whose country is the main power broker in Lebanon.
	   The general, a naval officer trained in Britain and the United
States, overcame constitutional hurdles and concerns among
politicians about the ascent of a military man to the nation's
highest office.
	   His election also respects the tradition in Lebanon's
sectarian-based political system that the president is a Maronite
Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament
speaker a Shiite Muslim.
	   It was the first balloting for a head of state in Lebanon in
peacetime since the 1970 election of Suleiman Franjieh. Five
presidents were elected during the civil war, including Hrawi in
1989. Of these, Bashir Gemayel was assassinated in a 1982 bomb
explosion before he took office and Rene Mouawad was killed in a
bombing shortly after he took over in 1989.
	   Hrawi's term was lengthened to nine years by a constitutional
exception approved by Parliament three years ago.
	   Lahoud was essentially drafted for the job of head of state.
	   A media shy scion of a prominent Maronite family, Lahoud could
not speak for his candidacy because rules dictate that the army
commander stays out of politics.
	   He also could not campaign because he was a senior public
servant. The Parliament on Tuesday passed an exception to the
constitution allowing a civil servant to become president ``for
once, and exceptionally.''
	   As it became increasingly clear he would be Parliament's choice,
his pictures in military uniform popped up on car windshields and
on walls and shop windows with slogans such as ``The Future of
Lebanon'' and ``Popular Will for a State of Institutions.''
	   Many hope the general will reform the government as he did the
army, a 55,000-strong disciplined force rebuilt to more than twice
its 1990 size.
	   Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion in the
civil-war fractured military, is credited with ending political and
religious interference in the military, influences which continued
to wrack the postwar government.
	   Many hope Lahoud will repeat his success in the sectarian-based
government. But some fear of military dominance of public life.

Shells fall near Israeli village; Hezbollah claims responsibility
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hezbollah claiming responsibility, army saying
mortar shells, sted Katyusha rockets were fired &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Several mortar shells fell Thursday near an
Israeli village on the border with Lebanon, and the Shiite Muslim
group Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   Hezbollah said in a statement issued in Beirut that its forces
had attacked the Israeli outpost of Birkit Risha, about five
kilometers (three miles) north of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
	   The Israeli army initially said that Katyusha rockets hit
northern Israel, but later said an investigation showed that mortar
shells had been fired. The Israeli army said some shells also
landed in the Israeli-controlled section of Lebanon just across the
border.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government
and its Syrian allies, demand that Israel pull about 2,000 soldiers
out of its self-declared security zone, a strip of territory 10 to
15 kilometers (six to nine miles) wide inside Lebanon.

Prodi ready to admit failure in bid to form new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Premier Romano Prodi appeared ready on
Thursday to admit failure in his bid to form a new government.
	   ``Now it's over,'' Prodi told the daily La Stampa after a day of
apparently fruitless negotiations on Wednesday. ``Tomorrow I'll
pass the baton.''
	   Prodi was expected to brief President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on
Thursday. If he tells Scalfaro that he can't put together a new
government, the president could ask someone else to try or he could
call early elections. Most observers thinks elections are unlikely.
	   The premier had been looking to a small center-right party with
29 votes to help him put together a majority. But the Democratic
Union for the Republic, led by ex-president Francesco Cossiga, on
Wednesday night issued a statement rejecting his overtures.
	   ``Cossiga Sinks Prodi,'' the daily newspaper Corriere della Sera
declared on Thursday.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old center-left government collapsed last
Friday in a failed vote of confidence by just one vote after it
lost the support of the hard-line Communist Refoundation Party.
	   The pressure was on Prodi to pass a cost-cutting 1999 budget
that meets requirements of the European common currency, the euro,
and Scalfaro had asked him to make a stab at forming a new
government.
	   Prodi emerged Wednesday from talks with Cossiga acknowledging
that the task of piecing together a new government was ``extremely
difficult.'' Prodi's Olive Tree Coalition later issued an appeal to
Cossiga.
	   ``Given the grave need of the country in regard to approval of
the budget and a strong entry into monetary union, it is deemed
necessary to turn to an appeal ... to build a majority capable of
governing and approving the budget,'' it said.
	   But the appeal appeared to be too late. Cossiga's party had
already issued its own statement saying Prodi had failed to win its
support.

Uganda, Rwanda call on Kabila to negotiate with Congo rebels
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Uganda and Rwanda, accused by Congolese
President Laurent Kabila of being the godfathers of the two-month
rebellion against him, have called on their former protege to open
talks with rebels who now control one fourth of the vast central
African nation.
	   A statement released Wednesday night by Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni's office said he and Rwandan Vice President and Defense
Minister Paul Kagame ``stressed that the resolution of the conflict
must address in an acceptable and sustainable way the legitimate
interests of all Congo's neighboring states.''
	   While both Museveni and Kagame publicly deny they are backing
the rebels _ a mixture of Congolese ethnic Tutsis, disgruntled
soldiers from other tribes in Congo and politicians opposed to
Kabila _ both have sent troops into their large neighbor to the
west.
	   ``The military presence of Uganda in the Democratic Republic of
Congo is based on genuine and legitimate security interests and on
its determination to prevent genocide in the area until a
government of the DRC agreed on by all the belligerent parties and
opposition groups is in place,'' the statement said.
	   Kabila, backed militarily by Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad,
has refused to meet with rebels, whom he dismisses as puppets of
Uganda and Rwanda.
	   The meeting of the two men who masterminded the rebellion two
years ago that ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and put
Kabila in power in May 1997 came three days after the Congolese
rebels captured the eastern town of Kindu and its strategic air
base.
	   Officials in the capital, Kinshasa, have conceded they lost
Kindu but claim that government troops are regrouping.
	   Both Uganda and Rwanda face security threats on their western
frontiers from rebel groups that have found haven in eastern Congo.
	   The statement said Rwanda had expressed concern about what it
termed ``genocidal attacks'' against minority Tutsis living in
eastern Congo.
	   ``Naturally, one expects that we have to be involved, or we have
to be seriously concerned about this situation,'' Kagame told The
Associated Press last month. ``We just can't sit by and watch
things happening that affect us like that and just let it pass.''
	   During three months in 1994, extremist Hutu soldiers and militia
in Rwanda slaughtered at least half a million people, most of them
minority Tutsis, in a government-sponsored genocide. Tutsi rebels,
led by Kagame, ousted the Hutu government and ended the massacre.
	   ``Rwanda has used several fora to explain her concerns about
continuing insecurity in Rwanda caused by the former Rwandan Armed
Forces and interahamwe militia based in eastern Congo and supported
by Kabila,'' the statement said.
	   Rebel military leader Jean-Pierre Ondakane was reported to be in
Washington for discussions with U.S. officials.

Preparations for more settlement construction under way
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Coinciding with the start of a Mideast summit,
Israel radio reported Thursday that bulldozers are leveling ground
for the 12-fold expansion of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
	   The Israeli group Peace Now said the construction site is more
than one kilometer (mile) away from the Alei Zahav settlement. The
building constitutes the start of a new settlement, not the
expansion of an existing one, the group said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised the United States
and the Palestinians that he will not start new settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, but only expand existing ones to
accommodate natural population growth.
	   The Palestinians say settlement construction is part of an
illegal land grab by Israel and undercuts their claims to statehood
in the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Israel radio said the Defense Ministry has approved the
construction of 1,200 homes near Alei Zahav, which is located about
five kilometers (three kilometers) from the invisible line between
Israel and the West Bank. Peace Now said Alei Zahav has about 100
homes now.
	   Project manager Arieh Ofri told the radio that in the first
stage, 100 homes would be built and future construction would
depend on demand. ``This is a very desirable area,'' Ofri said,
noting the proximity of the settlement to Israel and the Tel Aviv
metropolitan area. ``So far, everything that has been built has
been sold.''
	   Peace Now leader Mossi Raz said that calling the project an
expansion of Alei Zahav was a ruse. He said that while the
construction was taking place within the municipal boundaries of
Alei Zahav, in fact a new, separate community was being built.
	   ``Legally, it's not a new settlement, but for all intents and
purposes, it is, to any rational person,'' Raz said.

Malaysian prime minister accused other countries of meddling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
heaped scorn Thursday on the United States and some Asian nations
whose leaders have expressed sympathy for jailed dissident leader
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir said that if Asian nations continued to comment on
Malaysia's internal affairs, Malaysia would begin to do the same
toward them, Bernama news agency reported.
	   Angry with reports about U.S. officials commenting on Anwar's
arrest, Mahathir said: ``They should look at themselves.''
	   ``When white police beat the blacks half-dead, the courts
decided that the police were not guilty. ... As a result riots
occurred in Los Angeles,'' he said.
	   The latest U.S. comment came Wednesday from Stanley Roth, the
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.
	   The United States is ``deeply worried about .. the horrifying
treatment of one of the most respected of the new generation of
Asian leadership,'' said Roth, who was visiting neighboring
Singapore.
	   Mahathir responded: ``They preach to us about justice when over
here we do not discriminate over the hair, skin color, government
or non-government.''
	   Despite all the anger in Kuala Lumpur, some of Malaysia's
partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have openly
supported Anwar. On Thursday, Philippine President Joseph Estrada
met with Anwar's eldest daughter, Nurul Izzah, and expressed his
continued support for her father.
	   ``President Estrada reiterated his personal moral support for
the plight of Anwar, emphasizing that this is his personal position
and that this is not the official stand of the government,'' said
press undersecretary Ike Gutierrez.
	   Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie met Tuesday night
specifically to discuss Anwar, whom both have described as a
friend. Neither Estrada nor Habibie have decided whether to attend
the Kuala Lumpur summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum in November.
	   ``I wish they would give a chance for the courts to decide,''
Mahathir said.
	   And, in an obvious reference to the recent violence in Indonesia
that preceded President Suharto's downfall, he said: ``Maybe in
their country it is not the courts which decide. ... It is the mob
on the streets.''
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2. Anwar was subsequently arrested
and charged with 10 counts of corruption and illegal sex. He faces
trial beginning Nov. 2.
	   Anwar denies all the charges. He says Mahathir fired him because
of the political challenge he was starting to pose.

Russia to remark holiday celebrating defeat of Japan in war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The upper house of the Russian parliament voted
Thursday to reinstate a holiday marking the defeat of Japan in
World War II that was dropped after the fall of the Soviet Union, a
news agency reported.
	   The Federation Council agreed to reestablish the Day of Victory
Over Militarist Japan, which marks the Soviet Union's defeat of
Japan on Sept. 3, 1945, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The measure requires President Boris Yeltsin's signature to
become law. It has already been approved by the State Duma lower
house.
	   The vote came just one day before Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura was scheduled to arrive in Russia for a two-day
visit.
	   One of the main reasons for Masahiko's trip is to work on a
peace treaty formally ending World War II, which the two countries
never signed.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has promised that a treaty will be
signed by 2000, although it hinges on solving a dispute over the
Kuril Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off
Russia's Pacific coast.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who is to hold talks
with Komura, told the Federation Council after its vote that the
government approves of the measure.
	   Meanwhile, Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said
Russian-Japanese relations ``are on the rise and are becoming
increasingly constructive,'' the Interfax news agency said.

Police launch new search after rape victim's account
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NANCY, France (AP) _ French police have launched a new search
for a suspect in the rape-murder of an English schoolgirl, after
the police sketch of her attacker was identified by a rape victim,
a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Police in the Meurthe-et-Moselle area of eastern France received
the order Wednesday to search for a suspect, Est Republicain
reported.
	   The order came from judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke, who is
investigating the July 1996 slaying of 13-year-old Caroline
Dickinson in the western region of Brittany, the paper said.
	   A student in Nancy, in eastern France, said the police sketch of
Dickinson's attacker looked much like the man who raped her while
he held a knife to her throat on May 25, 1993, the newspaper said.
	   Dickinson was raped and then strangled in a youth hostel in
Pleine Fougeres, Brittany, while on a five-day trip with 39 other
youngsters and five adults from the school where she was a pupil.
	   She died in her youth hostel bed in a first-floor dormitory she
was sharing with four other girls.
	   Nearly 700 voluntary DNA tests carried out to find Caroline's
killer on Pleine Fougeres villagers, hostel staff, and boys and
teachers from the school have all proved negative.
	   However, French police were still receiving calls following the
release in February of a composite picture of a suspect seen in the
two days before the murder. The composite was compiled with the
help of Caroline's friends.
	   Her mother, Sue Dickinson, has begun a civil claim for damages
against Cornwall County Council, alleging breach of duty and
negligence.

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels in northern Uganda have abducted
570 teachers and 12,000 schoolchildren during their 12-year
insurgency, a private radio said Thursday.
	   Citing regional government official Peter Odongo W'Cheng,
Central Broadcasting Service radio said the Ugandan army had
rescued about 6,000 schoolchildren abducted by the Lord's
Resistance Army.
	   Fifty of the 570 abducted teachers were hacked to death by the
LRA, while the rest were being held with the schoolchildren in
parts of southern Sudan controlled by Sudanese government troops,
said W'Cheng, district commissioner in troubled northern Gulu
district.
	   Most of the children are forced to become fighters or porters or
concubines.
	   Sudanese rebels have been waging a 15-year war against the
Sudanese government for control of the country's south. Sudan
accuses Uganda of backing Sudanese rebels, while Uganda charges
that Sudan is sponsoring the LRA.
	   LRA activities along the northern border with Sudan have driven
more than 200,000 people from their homes.

Philippine President Estrada tells Anwar not to waver
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with quotes from Estrada, Anwar's daughter &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Thursday that arrested Malaysian dissident leader Anwar
Ibrahim, whom he considers a personal friend, should not waver in
his fight for reforms.
	   Estrada said this was the message he gave Anwar's eldest
daughter, Nurul Izzah, to pass on to the ousted Malaysian deputy
prime minister.
	   ``I am just telling Izzah here to tell her father not to waver
because he is fighting for a cause, the cause of the Malaysian
people,'' Estrada told reporters.
	   ``This is a trial that he has to face. I am very hopeful and
sure that ... Anwar Ibrahim will triumph in the end,'' Estrada
added.
	   He said he was giving personal moral support, but not
interfering in the internal problems of Malaysia.
	   ``As I have said, human rights and due process transcend all
boundaries and this is a universal concept that must be respected
not only by people but all leaders of the world,'' Estrada said.
	   Press undersecretary Ike Gutierrez stressed that Estrada was
stating ``his personal position and that this is not the official
stand of the government.''
	   Estrada and Anwar's daughter talked for 20 minutes in the
hurriedly arranged meeting at Estrada's private residence in
suburban San Juan.
	   ``I just want to thank him for his support ... and the Filipino
people for their support. I appreciate it greatly,'' said Nurul
Izzah, 18, a first-year engineering student.
	   She said her father has lost a lot of weight, ``but he is in
high spirits, so I am very thankful for that.''
	   Before boarding a flight to Singapore, Nurul Izzah told
reporters that she was given permission by her father to visit
Manila.
	   She said she was returning to Singapore ``because my father
wanted to see us.''
	   Estrada has made a number of public statements about Anwar's
Sept. 20 arrest and subsequent beatings while in police custody.
Chastising a neighboring country is unusual in Southeast Asia,
where governments customarily avoid mutual criticisms.
	   Estrada was the first leader of a member of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations to express concern for the jailed Malaysian
dissident.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has also expressed concern
over Anwar's treatment. Habibie and Estrada met Tuesday night on an
Indonesian island near Singapore specifically to discuss Anwar's
arrest and how they should respond.
	   The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are among the founders
of ASEAN, which also includes Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Singapore,
Thailand, and Vietnam.
	   Estrada has said he has not yet decided whether he will attend
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit to be held next month
in Malaysia.
	   ``He said the APEC meeting is separate from the issue of Anwar,
particularly his personal stand on the issue,'' Gutierrez said.
	   Nurul Izzah handed over a letter from her mother, Azizah Ismail,
who expressed gratitude for Estrada's support.
	   Gutierrez said Estrada is ``thinking of writing a personal
letter'' to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to ask that
Anwar be held in house arrest during his upcoming trial on
corruption and sexual misconduct charges. Anwar has denied the
charges, calling them politically motivated.
	   Gutierrez also said Anwar's daughter met earlier with former
President Corazon Aquino, who had expressed her own ``personal
moral support'' for Anwar.

Launch of cargo ship to Mir delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The last cargo ship scheduled to go to Mir in
1998, to take water, food and New Year's gifts to the space
station's crew, has been postponed 10 days from Thursday because of
a lack of funds.
	   The Progress cargo ship was also to carry scientific equipment
for measuring data about meteorites. The Mir's two Russian
cosmonauts, Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev, need to receive the
equipment and install it outside of the station before Mir enters a
meteorite cloud in mid-November, deputy flight commander Viktor
Blagov said.
	   After the meteorite shower begins, the spacewalk needed to
install the equipment would be too dangerous, Blagov said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Progress was to be carried into space by a Soyuz booster
rocket. But the lack of money meant that the booster could not be
bought from the manufacturer on time, Blagov said.
	   The new launch has been scheduled for Oct. 25. The mission will
take off from the Baikonur cosmodrome, which Russia rents from the
Central Asian country of Kazakstan.
	   The Progress will also carry a few packages marked ``Open on
Dec. 31'' containing gifts for the crew, ITAR-Tass reported.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Parliament on Thursday formally elected
Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing
of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.
	   All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his
favor.
	   Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, is to be sworn in for a six-year
term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
	   The Parliament members cast paper ballots, which were hand
counted with Lahoud's name read out 118 times.
	   Ten members were absent, including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt,
who had pledged to boycott the session to protest the selection of
a military man as president. He was joined in the boycott by eight
members of his political bloc.
	   Lahoud, 62, won the backing of a public fed up with bickering
and the corrupt politicians who have ruled Lebanon since the end of
the devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   He also won the all-important approval from Syrian President
Hafez Assad, whose country is the main power broker in Lebanon.
	   The general, a naval officer trained in Britain and the United
States, overcame constitutional hurdles and concerns among
politicians about the ascent of a military man to the nation's
highest office.
	   His election also respects the tradition in Lebanon's
sectarian-based political system that the president is a Maronite
Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Parliament
speaker a Shiite Muslim.
	   It was the first balloting for a head of state in Lebanon in
peacetime since the 1970 election of Suleiman Franjieh. Five
presidents were elected during the civil war, including Hrawi in
1989. Of these, Bashir Gemayel was assassinated in a 1982 bomb
explosion before he took office and Rene Mouawad was killed in a
bombing shortly after he took over in 1989.
	   Hrawi's term was lengthened to nine years by a constitutional
exception approved by Parliament three years ago.
	   Lahoud was essentially drafted for the job of head of state.
	   A media shy scion of a prominent Maronite family, Lahoud could
not speak for his candidacy because rules dictate that the army
commander stay out of politics.
	   He also could not campaign because he was a senior public
servant. The Parliament on Tuesday passed an exception to the
constitution allowing a civil servant to become president ``for
once, and exceptionally.''
	   As it became increasingly clear he would be Parliament's choice,
pictures of Lahoud in military uniform popped up on car windshields
and on walls and shop windows with slogans such as ``The Future of
Lebanon.''
	   Many hope the general will reform the government as he did the
army, a 55,000-strong disciplined force rebuilt to more than twice
its 1990 size.
	   Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion in the
civil-war fractured military, is credited with ending political and
religious interference in the military, influences which continued
to wrack the postwar government.
	   Many hope Lahoud will repeat his success in the sectarian-based
government. But some express fear of military dominance in public
life.

NATO plans to send Solana, top allied commanders to Belgrade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL;

 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO was planning on Thursday to send
Javier Solana, its secretary general, and two top commanders to
Belgrade to sign an air surveillance deal for Kosovo, part of a
peace accord for the Serbian province.
	   ``I may be going this afternoon or this evening to finalize the
agreement,'' Solana told reporters at the NATO headquarters.
	   The NATO ambassadors were debating the composition of the
alliance delegation.
	   They also considered sending NATO's top military commander in
Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Klaus Naumann, a German general
who heads NATO's panel of chiefs of staffs from the 16 alliance
nations.
	   Solana reiterated Milosevic was still not complying with the
accord, forged this week by U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke,
for Belgrade to withdraw troops from Ksovo, begin peace talks with
ethnic Albanians and allow 2,000 monitors into the province.
	   ``The information that we have is that that compliance is still
not a reality ... although some efforts have been made,'' Solana
said.
	   ``I will send (Milosevic) a very clear message. And that is that
the solution to the problem (in Kosovo) is not signing papers but
to comply with agreements that have been achieved.''
	   He said troops were not being withdrawn fast enough for refugees
to confident they can return home.
	   ``It is very important for (refugees) to return to their
villages. For that, compliance with the withdrawal of troops is
very, very important. We'll keep our eyes and ears open.''
	   His comments contrasted with those made on Wednesday by U.S.
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin who gave an upbeat
appraisal of Yugoslav compliance with its commitments.
	   Rubin said American and European monitoring teams in Kosovo
reported a much smaller Serb police presence in the Kosovo
countryside than on Sunday.
	   On Wednesday, NATO officials said the alliance would likely keep
in place its Oct. 13 airstrikes order beyond Saturday, the deadline
for compliance with the Kosovo peace accord.
	   In addition to allow 2,000 peace monitors on the ground,
Belgrade must allow unarmed NATO spy planes into the airspace over
Kosovo to check on compliance with the agreement from the air.
	   NATO planned to use high-flying eye-in-the-sky planes such as
U-2s and P3 Orion aircraft.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has been
asked to provide the 2,000 ``compliance verifiers.''

Red Cross orders halt to transfusions of possibly tainted blood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Hong Kong Red Cross on Thursday ordered all
hospitals to stop transfusions using blood products that might be
tainted with syphilis bacteria.
	   The Red Cross was alerted that some blood products might have
been contaminated after the manufacturer ordered an urgent recall
of two lots of syphilis screening test kits, a statement said.
	   Dr. Lin Che-kit, the group's hospital chief executive, said in
the statement that the transfusion unit had used those screening
kits to test 68,173 donations between June 15 and Wednesday.
	   Since the syphilis bacteria die in 24 hours of refrigeration at
4 degrees Celsius (39 F), it is likely that only platelet
concentrates, which are stored at 20 degrees Celsius (68 F), and
red cell components that have been refrigerated for less than 72
hours were affected, it said. Other products are safe for
transfusion, it added.
	   Lin said in the statement the unit was waiting for more
information from the manufacturer.
	   The statement added that syphilis transmitted by transfusion is
rare. It gave no other details on why the products were recalled,
and officials were not immediately available for comment.

Ethiopian minister meets Mubarak on conflict with Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin
said Thursday it remained unclear if his country could peacefully
resolve its border dispute with Eritrea.
	   He spoke to reporters after a morning meeting with President
Hosni Mubarak, during which he presented the Egyptian leader with a
message from Ethiopian President Negasso Ghidada dealing with the
border conflict.
	   There has been no improvement in relations in recent months
between Ethiopia and Eritrea, said Mesfin, adding that the chances
for a peaceful solution were ``not clear.''
	   Several hundred people were killed during cross-border air
strikes and shelling in early June. Both sides have been observing
a June 14 moratorium, brokered by the United States, on further air
strikes.
	   Ethiopia says it is ready to hold talks with Eritrea, but only
after Asmara withdraws its troops from territories occupied after
May 12, when the fighting broke out. Eritrea has refused, saying it
is on its own territory as delineated in Italian colonial maps in
the first part of the century.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
	   Mesfin said he hoped that efforts by members of the Organization
of African Unity would lead to a peaceful solution to the problem.

Voters in Africa's only absolute monarchy, Swaziland, go to polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ Government opponents are urging a
peaceful boycott of Friday's parliamentary elections in one of the
world's last absolute monarchies.
	   Police, who raided the homes of three opposition leaders
Tuesday, also are urging citizens to avoid violence but are
planning to boost surveillance at polling precincts throughout the
mountainous kingdom.
	   Voters in this kingdom of 1 million people, bordered by South
Africa and Mozambique, were to choose 55 representatives in the
House of Assembly.
	   Candidates were nominated individually because parties have been
banned by royal decree since 1973. The legislature serves little
purpose other than a rubber stamp, and King Mswati III can rule by
decree.
	   But observers will be watching the vote closely in a part of
Africa where democracy received a major boost with South Africa's
first democratic election, in 1994, and where leaders of nearby
countries like Namibia and Zimbabwe are showing autocratic
tendencies.
	   The stakes have been raised further by events in the region's
other monarchy, Lesotho, where the king operates under a
constitution. After months of unrest and violence over May election
results, the South African military intervened, leaving scores dead
and the downtown razed from looting.
	   Opposition leaders here after the police raids last week.
	   ``The situation is tense,'' said Mario Masuku, president of
PUDEMO, the People's United Democratic Movement. ``People are angry
at what the government has done,'' he said. The movement operates
underground because of the ban on political activity.
	   The country's largest labor group, the Swaziland Federation of
Trade Unions, has called on its members to go to work and boycott
the vote, even through Friday has been declared a national holiday
and most businesses are expected to be shut.
	   Swaziland chief electoral officer Robert Thwala says about
200,000 people are registered to vote and the government is making
all of its vehicles available to carry people to the polls.
	   Thwala defends the Swaziland system.
	   ``People believe the government rules by the consensus of the
people,'' he said. If political parties were permitted, he said,
they would ``exploit the ignorance of people. In Africa, where do
you have stability within a multi-party system? It doesn't work
here.''

Hong Kong share prices higher as funds return to Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices ended higher Thursday as
overseas fund managers turned their attention back to Asian stocks.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 131.41 points, or 1.5
percent, closing at 8,970.42. The index had climbed 1.4 percent
Wednesday.
	   Trading amounted to 5.9 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 766
million), compared with 6.77 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
879 million) Wednesday.
	   Traders said fund managers had turned their attention to Asian
equities, buying into Hong Kong markets to diversify their
portfolios and increase their Asian stocks toward the end of the
third quarter.
	   Overseas hedge funds also continued to cover short positions,
scooping up oversold property stocks, traders said. Short-covering
is the buying back of borrowed shares.
	   It appeared that buyers were returning to several of the Asian
markets most battered this year, said Richard Verin, head of
trading for Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. He noted that markets
in South Korea and the Philippines were up Thursday, while Taipei
was down.
	   Market heavyweight HSBC Holdings was particularly in demand,
with major overseas investment banks buying heavily, said John Lo
of BNP Prime Peregrine Ltd.
	   HSBC closed up 4.00 Hong Kong dollars at 162.50.
	   Other gainers were Hang Seng Bank, up 3.75 to 59.00, and Sun
Hung Kai Properties, up 1.60 to 37.90.
	   Among the losers were Hutchison Whampoa, down 0.70 to 47.60; New
World Development, down 0.50 to 13.90, and Television Broadcasts,
down 0.45 to 19.85.
	   Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific was up 0.20 to 8.00.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with NATO chief saying Milosevic not in compliance,
NATO officials planning to head to Belgrade, new aid convoys to
refugees; trims &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A wary NATO and world leaders kept
up the pressure Thursday on President Slobodan Milosevic over
Kosovo, where they said he needs to withdraw more Serb forces by
Saturday's deadline.
	   About halfway through the four-day grace period given Milosevic
to show he's met international demands on ending Kosovo turmoil,
NATO's chief said the Yugoslav leader was making progress toward
compliance but still had a ways to go.
	   The alliance planned to send its secretary-general, Javier
Solana, and two top commanders to Belgrade to sign an air
surveillance deal for Kosovo and reinforce that he is not yet
complying with the accord reached this week with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   ``I will send (Milosevic) a very clear message. And that is that
the solution to the problem is not signing papers but to comply
with agreements that have been achieved,'' Solana said Thursday in
Brussels, Belgium.
	   International officials also gathered in Paris and Vienna on
Thursday as part of the assessment process to make sure Milosevic
is keeping his word.
	   In Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency tried to deliver more aid to
those displaced by the crackdown in the secessionist Serbian
province, which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   Convoys were sent toward Golubovac and Novo Selo, according to
agency spokesman Kris Janowski in Geneva, who said most refugees
didn't appear to have returned to their homes despite this week's
agreement.
	   Despite noting signs of progress, a U.S. spokesman called
compliance efforts ``a mixed bag.''
	   ``NATO authorities will have to make a judgment at the end of
the week, whether there is substantial and serious compliance on
the part of President Milosevic,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin said in Washington on Wednesday.
	   In case there isn't, the alliance is continuing with
preparations for air raids against the Serbs. NATO warplanes are
being moved to bases in Italy, just across the Adriatic Sea from
Yugoslavia.
	   Two top NATO commanders _ U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Germany's
Klaus Naumann, chairman of the alliance's military committee _ were
expected to fly to Belgrade along with Solana later Thursday.
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia was meeting in Paris.
	   Later, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
was set to approve the verification mission it will oversee in
Kosovo. The move will authorize Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek, the OSCE chairman, to sign an agreement on the mission
with Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade on Friday.
	   The verification mission was a key part of the deal struck
Monday by Holbrooke with Milosevic to end his seven-month crackdown
on Kosovo Albanians.
	   Western nations were discussing naming Jacques Klein, the
American deputy to Bosnia's top international mediator Carlos
Westendorp, as head of the 2,000-person mission _ to be composed
largely of Europeans.
	   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook says Britain will contribute
200 people to the verification force, and both Russia and Germany
are expected to make similar contributions. But it's expected to
take weeks to organize the OSCE force.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement, which put off the
threat of impending airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   There is mixed evidence on how many are returning to their
homes.
	   Rubin said small groups of European and American monitors _ the
advance team for the verification force _ found evidence Wednesday
of refugees coming back.
	   But many remain in hiding, fearing reprisals from Serb special
police who have torched their villages and been accused of
atrocities against civilians _ not just rebel fighters fighting for
Kosovo's independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's use of force against
ethnic Albanian separatists. Many are crammed into houses with
relatives and other refugees; tens of thousands of others remain
camped outside with winter approaching.
	   Among the demands Milosevic must meet by Saturday, the one in
which he appears to be the furthest from compliance is withdrawal
of his forces to levels before the crackdown began on Feb. 28.
	   A NATO official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Wednesday that some Yugoslav units remained in Kosovo. He declined
to say how many but said they far exceed the level required by
NATO.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels in northern Uganda have abducted
570 teachers and 12,000 schoolchildren during their 12-year
insurgency, a private radio said Thursday.
	   Citing regional government official Peter Odongo W'Cheng,
Central Broadcasting Service radio said the Ugandan army had
rescued about 6,000 schoolchildren abducted by the Lord's
Resistance Army.
	   Fifty of the 570 abducted teachers were hacked to death by the
LRA, while the rest were being held with the schoolchildren in
parts of southern Sudan controlled by Sudanese government troops,
said W'Cheng, district commissioner in troubled northern Gulu
district.
	   Most of the children are forced to become fighters or porters or
concubines.
	   Sudanese rebels have been waging a 15-year war against the
Sudanese government for control of the country's south. Sudan
accuses Uganda of backing Sudanese rebels, while Uganda charges
that Sudan is sponsoring the LRA.
	   LRA activities along the northern border with Sudan have driven
more than 200,000 people from their homes.

Thai central bank against compromise with fugitive financier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank wants no
compromises in its legal action against executives of what once was
the country's biggest finance company, a bank spokesman said
Thursday.
	   The central bank has filed criminal charges accusing former
chairman Pin Chakkaphak and two other executives of Finance One of
failing to adequately scrutinize loans to two affiliated companies.
They are charged with violating Thai law by approving loans without
collateral to loss-ridden companies, driving Finance One into
bankruptcy.
	   The spokesman quoted Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol
Sonakul as saying the decision not to make a deal with Pin and his
colleagues was a matter of principle.
	   ``The Bank of Thailand believes that this is a matter that has
far greater implications then just in the courtroom. It would send
a wrong message to the public if there were any deal made,'' said
the spokesman, who asked not to be named.
	   The Bangkok newspaper The Nation reported Thursday that Pin was
offering to surrender and cooperate in regaining 2.1 billion baht
(dlrs 53.2 million) in bad loans he was allegedly responsible for,
in return for an agreement that no new charges would be filed
against him.
	   Pin is reportedly in the United States, and his colleagues are
also believed to be abroad.
	   If found guilty, the executives could face 5 to 10 years in
prison and fines of 500,000 to 1 million baht (dlrs 12,800 to dlrs
25,600).
	   ``The social pains are significantly higher than the financial
damages of 2 billion baht to Finance One,'' The Nation quoted Chatu
Mongol as saying. ``Easy money comes and easy money goes. ... The
objective of our legal action is not to recover the money, as seen
by our willingness to go ahead with even small cases.''
	   The Thai Foreign Ministry has asked the United States to
extradite Pin and the other two executives to stand trial in
Thailand. It has been reported that they have been residing in New
York for the past several months.
	   Finance One, like dozens of other finance companies, was closed
by the government last year when it fell into virtual bankruptcy
after an economic downturn. Several banks were also forced to halt
business.
	   Reckless lending, sometimes to business cronies and politicians,
contributed to the crisis in Thailand's financial sector that led
to the closing of 56 of the country's 93 finance companies.

Seven helicopters donated by U.S. arrive in Bosnia

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Seven helicopters donated by
the United States to the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation army have
arrived at a military base in Rajlovac near Sarajevo, media
reported Thursday.
	   The UH-1H Iroques are primarily intended for transporting
troops. Eight more helicopters are to be delivered by the end of
the year, the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje said.
	   The equipment is part of the dlrs 400 million U.S.-backed Train
and Equip program, designed to help the Muslim-Croat Federation
establish a military balance with the Bosnian Serbs.
	   During Bosnia's 1992-95 war, the Bosnian Serbs had an
overwhelming advantage in firepower.
	   The program also aims to bring together Muslim and Croat forces,
who fought fiercely against each other in 1993-94.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The upper house of the Russian parliament voted
Thursday to reinstate a holiday marking the defeat of Japan in
World War II that was dropped after the fall of the Soviet Union, a
news agency reported.
	   The Federation Council agreed to reestablish the Day of Victory
Over Militarist Japan, which marks the Soviet Union's defeat of
Japan on Sept. 3, 1945, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The measure requires President Boris Yeltsin's signature to
become law. It has already been approved by the State Duma lower
house.
	   The vote came just one day before Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura was scheduled to arrive in Russia for a two-day
visit.
	   One of the main reasons for Komura's trip is to work on a peace
treaty formally ending World War II, which the two countries never
signed.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has promised that a treaty will be
signed by 2000, although it hinges on solving a dispute over the
Kuril Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off
Russia's Pacific coast.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who is to hold talks
with Komura, told the Federation Council after its vote that the
government approves of the measure.
	   Meanwhile, Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said
Russian-Japanese relations ``are on the rise and are becoming
increasingly constructive,'' the Interfax news agency said.

Russian, American astronauts inspect international station module
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and American astronauts who will work on
the international space station inspected on Thursday the first
component of the station to be sent into space.
	   The 20-ton Zarya cargo module, built by the Russian Khrunichev
company under contract with the U.S. firm Boeing, will be launched
on Nov. 20. NASA will follow in December with the launch of the
second part, an American-built passageway.
	   ``The module already has the configuration it will have in
space, so before it is launched into orbit, the (space station
crews) must see what they will have to work with later,''
Khrunichev spokesman Konstantin Lantratov was quoted as saying by
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Members of four crews went to the Baikonur cosmodrome, which
Russia rents from the Central Asian country of Kazakstan, to
inspect the Zarya. They included the NASA crew that will deliver
the passageway in December, two other shuttle teams, and the first
crew to live on the international space station in 2000, ITAR-Tass
reported.

After sightseeing, China, Taiwan try again to bridge differences
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Koo and Wang meeting Thursday, Koo comments at
lunch with Taiwanese businessmen &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Before beginning his second round of
talks with his Chinese counterpart, Taiwan's top negotiator with
rival China told Taiwanese businessmen Thursday he would press
their concerns over investment security and taxes.
	   Taiwan's Koo Chen-fu and China's Wang Daohan later met for tea
in the ballroom of a swanky Shanghai hotel, in a setting that
appeared calculated to stress the informal nature of talks aimed at
bridging the differences between the estranged governments.
	   The two officials met for the first time in five years
Wednesday, holding an hour-long discussion that mixed pleasantries
with the divisive positions that have kept the two sides from
resuming the formal negotiations Beijing scrubbed three years ago.
	   On Thursday, Koo renewed his effort to address practical issues,
such as business concerns, that his government wants to deal with
first before tackling the more intractable issue of Taiwan's
reunification with the mainland.
	   During a luncheon with Taiwanese business executives _ who have
committed dlrs 35 billion in investment in China over the past
decade _ Koo said he was aware of their urgent concerns about the
safety of their investments and their personal security. He said
both sides had agreed to discuss the problems of Taiwan investors.
	   ``I hope that we can at an early point hold consultations to
establish a normal order for economic and trade relations between
the two sides. That will allow each of you to feel secure and at
ease in investing in the mainland,'' Koo said.
	   It was unclear whether Koo's meeting with Wang over
Chinese-style tea would result in any substantial discussion. The
two sat and chatted amiably at a round table at one end of the
ballroom, with their aides sitting at similar tables nearby.
	   Later Wang and Koo were to dine and attend a traditional Beijing
opera together.
	   While the schedule and setting seemed designed to downplay the
political significance of the meetings, just the fact that the two
elder statesmen are meeting face-to-face may be enough to propel
relations between the divided governments forward.
	   Political heirs to the antagonists in the Chinese civil war,
China and Taiwan split after Mao Tse-tung's Communists forced
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists off the mainland in 1949.
	   Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and Nationalist Party elder,
and Wang, an 84-year-old Communist Party stalwart and mentor to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, held their first and until Wednesday
only meeting in Singapore in 1993.
	   China suspended the lower-level dialogue Wang and Koo started
after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui traveled to the United States
in 1995, a move Beijing interpreted as a signal he was reneging on
eventual reunification. Chinese test-missile launches and war games
near Taiwan strained relations to their most tense since the height
of the Cold War.
	   China has since insisted that revived talks should deal directly
with thorny political issues, including reunification. Taipei wants
negotiations to pick up where they left off, settling practical
issues like fishing disputes, partly to build up confidence between
the two sides.
	   Koo pressed his practical agenda at Wednesday's meeting with
Wang and during sightseeing Thursday morning. After touring
Shanghai's Pudong district _ a swath of farmland transformed over
the past decade into a collection of factories and office towers _
Koo toured the fledgling stock exchange.
	   ``Open and fair business dealings require stricter laws and more
transparent regulation,'' Koo told reporters as floor traders
looked on.
	   In an indication of the hopes China is placing on the visit, Koo
will meet Chinese President Jiang and Vice Premier Qian Qichen over
the weekend in Beijing.
	   Both sides are under pressure to achieve an accommodation.

Pope defends church's central truths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore cycle designator &QL; 
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II called on his church
Thursday to battle challenges to its most fundamental religious
beliefs, cautioning Roman Catholics not to lose their way ``in the
shifting sands of widespread skepticism.''
	   Summing up one of the central themes of his papacy over the past
20 years, John Paul issued an encyclical that warned against the
temptations posed by some modern schools of philosophy and
theology.
	   It did not go into specifics of church teaching for which he has
repeatedly demanded fidelity, but he made clear he rejected any
positions that ``called into question the certitudes of faith.''
	   An encyclical is one of the most important documents a pope can
issue. This one, the 13th of John Paul's papacy, was timed for the
20th anniversary Friday of his election as pope.
	   It was addressed to his bishops, in effect a call to action for
the proper education of Catholics.
	   ``For it is undeniable that this time of rapid and complex
change can leave, especially the younger generation, to whom the
future belongs and on whom it depends, with a sense they have no
valid points of reference.''
	   The 154-page encyclical is titled ``Fides and Ratio,'' Latin
meaning Faith and Reason, and stresses that the two are not
incompatible.
	   Although 78 and ailing, John Paul has shown every intent of
pushing ahead with his papacy, the longest this century.
	   The leader of the world's 1 billion Roman Catholics is preparing
his church for the start of Christianity's third millennium in
2000, as well as keeping up his global travel. He is scheduled to
visit Mexico and the United States in January and has repeatedly
expressed the hope to visit Christianity's holy sites in the Middle
East.
	   The encyclical, however, effectively sums up the views he has
expressed over the past 20 years, particularly his preaching
against the idea that there are no absolute truths.
	   A recent crackdown on theologians underlined that John Paul saw
no room for debate over such issues as the ban on women becoming
priests.
	   During a September visit to the birthplace of Pope Paul VI, John
Paul praised his predecessor for going against the tide of the
times and retaining the church's ban on contraception in a 1963
encyclical.
	   The new encyclical grapples with the issue of religion in the
modern world, when expectations have been raised by scientific and
technological progress.
	   John Paul complained that agnosticism and relativism ``have led
philosophical research to lose its way in the shifting sands of
widespread skepticism. Recent times have seen the rise to
prominence of various doctrines which tend to devalue even the
truths which had been judged certain.''
	   Other threats, he said, come from the philosophy that
``relegates religious, theological, ethical and aesthetic knowledge
to the realm of mere fantasy.''
	   The pope said he encouraged scientific progress but that it
``should be wedded to the philosophical and ethical values which
are the distinctive and indelible mark of the human being.''

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A wary NATO and world leaders kept
up the pressure Thursday on President Slobodan Milosevic over
Kosovo, where they said he needs to withdraw more Serb forces by
Saturday's deadline.
	   About halfway through the four-day grace period given Milosevic
to show he has met international demands on ending the Kosovo
turmoil, NATO's chief said the Yugoslav leader was making progress
toward compliance but still had a ways to go.
	   The alliance planned to send its secretary-general, Javier
Solana, and two top commanders to Belgrade to sign an air
surveillance deal for Kosovo and reinforce that he is not yet
complying with the accord reached this week with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   ``I will send (Milosevic) a very clear message. And that is that
the solution to the problem is not signing papers but to comply
with agreements that have been achieved,'' Solana said Thursday in
Brussels, Belgium.
	   International officials also gathered in Paris and Vienna on
Thursday as part of the assessment process to make sure Milosevic
is keeping his word.
	   In Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency tried to deliver more aid to
those displaced by the crackdown in the secessionist Serbian
province, which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   Convoys were sent toward Golubovac and Novo Selo, according to
agency spokesman Kris Janowski in Geneva, who said most refugees
don't appear to have returned to their homes despite this week's
agreement.
	   Despite noting signs of progress, a U.S. spokesman called
compliance efforts ``a mixed bag.''
	   ``NATO authorities will have to make a judgment at the end of
the week, whether there is substantial and serious compliance on
the part of President Milosevic,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin said in Washington on Wednesday.
	   In case there isn't, the alliance is continuing with
preparations for air raids against the Serbs. NATO warplanes are
being moved to bases in Italy, just across the Adriatic Sea from
Yugoslavia.
	   Two top NATO commanders _ U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Germany's
Klaus Naumann, chairman of the alliance's military committee _ were
expected to fly to Belgrade along with Solana later Thursday.
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia was meeting in Paris.
	   Later, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
was set to approve the verification mission it will oversee in
Kosovo. The move will authorize Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek, the OSCE chairman, to sign an agreement on the mission
with Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade on Friday.
	   The verification mission was a key part of the deal struck
Monday by Holbrooke with Milosevic to end his seven-month crackdown
on Kosovo Albanians.
	   Western nations were discussing naming Jacques Klein, the
American deputy to Bosnia's top international mediator Carlos
Westendorp, as head of the 2,000-person mission _ to be composed
largely of Europeans.
	   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook says Britain will contribute
200 people to the verification force, and both Russia and Germany
are expected to make similar contributions. But it's expected to
take weeks to organize the OSCE force.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement, which put off the
threat of impending airstrikes against Yugoslavia, whose main
republic is Serbia.
	   There is mixed evidence on how many refugees are returning to
their homes.
	   Rubin said small groups of European and American monitors _ the
advance team for the verification force _ found evidence Wednesday
of refugees coming back.
	   But many remain in hiding, fearing reprisals from Serb special
police who have torched their villages and been accused of
atrocities against civilians _ not just rebels fighting for
Kosovo's independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's use of force against
ethnic Albanian separatists. Many are crammed into houses with
relatives and other refugees; tens of thousands of others remain
camped outside with winter approaching.
	   Among the demands Milosevic must meet by Saturday, the one in
which he appears to be the furthest from compliance is withdrawal
of his forces to levels before the crackdown began on Feb. 28.
	   A NATO official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Wednesday that some Yugoslav units remained in Kosovo. He declined
to say how many but said they far exceed the level required by
NATO.

Primakov launches debt-settlement plan

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government and Gazprom reaching agreement on tax

investigate government's action, plans of food imports from the
U.S. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Thursday
ordered the government and its agencies to start settling their
huge outstanding bills, a problem that has paralyzed the Russian
economy.
	   The Cabinet discussed the measures a week ago and was scheduled
to finalize them Thursday. But Primakov abruptly canceled the
Cabinet meeting, saying the proposals were already clear and needed
to be implemented.
	   ``We have had enough discussions, we now must act,'' spokesman
Igor Shchegolev quoted him as saying.
	   The plan worked out by the economics and finance ministries
would require the government and state-owned companies to clear
their mutual debts of some 50 billion rubles (dlrs 3.8 billion) by
mid-December.
	   The cash-strapped government has been a major debtor in the
Russian economy, failing to pay wages and pensions to workers and
other bills to state-run companies. The workers and companies then
cannot pay their bills, leading to a chain of non-payments that is
disabling Russian industries.
	   Officials admit that the unpaid bills among the government and
the state-owned companies and organizations are small compared to
those in the private sector. They estimate all debts in Russia
total a staggering 1.2 trillion rubles (dlrs 92 billion), or about
40 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
	   Primakov has said the government bills must be settled without
printing new money, a move that would lead to high inflation.
However, he has not said where the money will come from and it is
likely that many of the debts will be settled through barter or
other non-cash transactions.
	   The government has also reached agreement with the natural gas
monopoly Gazprom, Russia's largest company, to pay its overdue
taxes. Gazprom has dragged its feet on the payments, citing the
government's failure to pay for gas supplies.
	   Gazprom will pay 3.5 billion rubles (dlrs 260 million) in taxes
this month, and 4.5 billion rubles (dlrs 333 million) in November,
the deputy head of board, Pyotr Rodionov said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   In other economic news Thursday:
	   _ Russia will continue talks with the United States in the next
few days on receiving grain and other foods on long-term credit and
as a humanitarian aid. Leonid Cheshinsky, head of a state-run
company in charge of grain imports gave no details, but said that
the conditions would be ``extremely beneficial'' for Russia. With
food imports falling sharply, and the grain harvest likely to be
the worst in 40 years, the government is building up emergency food
reserves.
	   _ Russia's hard currency reserves rose from dlrs 12.8 billion to
dlrs 13.3 billion in the week ending Oct. 9, the Central Bank said.
The bank has been actively buying dollars in recent weeks to
strengthen its reserves depleted at the start of the crisis.
	   _ Inflation for the first 12 days of October was 0.8 percent,
after soaring last month following the ruble's sharp plunge.
Average daily price increases decreased from 1.09 percent in
September to 0.66 percent this month, the State Statistics
Committee said.
	   _ Parliament's upper chamber set up a panel to investigate the
previous government's Aug. 17 decision to devalue the ruble and
default on its domestic debt. Primakov and other officials said the
move was a grave mistake.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Premier Romano Prodi appeared ready on
Thursday to admit failure in his bid to form a new government.
	   ``Now it's over,'' Prodi told the daily La Stampa a day earlier
after a round of apparently fruitless negotiations. ``Tomorrow I'll
pass the baton.''
	   Prodi's office said the premier would meet with President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro at 1030 gmt on Thursday.
	   If, as expected, he tells Scalfaro that he can't put together a
new government, the president could ask someone else to try or he
could call early elections. Most observers thinks elections are
unlikely.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French high school students were staging a day of
protests throughout France on Thursday, keeping up the pressure on
the leftist government to cut class sizes and buy more equipment.
	   In Bordeaux in the southwest, 20,000 students were already
marching late Thursday morning. In Rennes in the north, 10,000 were
in the streets.
	   About 25,000 students were expected to march in Paris, staring
in the early afternoon. Already there were witness reports of
vandalism at a subway station in eastern Paris.
	   In Grenoble, a protesting student was seriously injured hit by a
tramway after jumping over security barriers. And in Rouen, about a
dozen students were arrested for breaking store windows and
rampaging through an outdoor cafe.

Gov't transfers four sick separatist prisoners back home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government on Thursday announced the
transfer of four jailed Basque separatists in its first
conciliatory gesture since the armed group ETA declared an
indefinite cease-fire last month.
	   A statement issued by the prison authorities said the four would
be transferred from jails in eastern and southern areas to prisons
in the northern Basque Country for treatment in the hospitals of
their choice. All four are ill.
	   No information was immediately available concerning when the
prisoners would be moved.
	   The policy of dispersing ETA's 535 prisoners around the country
_ in some cases hundreds of miles from their families in the
northern Basque region _ is one of the most contentious issues in
the Basque conflict.
	   The decision to transfer the prisoners was greeted as the
government's first gesture of goodwill towards the truce that ETA
announced on Sept. 18.
	   Prior to the announcement, the government had repeatedly said it
would not respond to the ETA truce until after regional elections
in the Basque country take place on Oct. 25.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people during its 30-year campaign for
an independent Basque nation straddling a small section of northern
Spain and southern France. The group's name is an acronym in the
Basque language for Basque Homeland and Freedom.
	   Supporters of Basque independence are keen to draw parallels
between ETA's cease-fire announcement and the Northern Irish peace
process which has attracted a significant level of international
support.
	   From the opposite corner Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja,
the minister responsible for internal security, on Wednesday
appealed to European governments while he was in Strasbourg to
leave the resolution of conflict entirely in the Spanish
government's hands.
	   The four ETA prisoners to be transferred are Fernando Diez
Torres, Miguel Angel Vazquez de Luis, Pedro Juan Guridi Arocena,
Francisco Javier Etxeverria Gonzalez.
	   A fifth prisoner, Patricio Goyenetxe Telletxea, was granted a
relaxed jail regime

Taiwan holds line on insistence of equality with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ With informal contacts under way in China,
Taiwan's government reiterated Thursday that progress toward
restoring dialogue will depend on Beijing recognizing its
legitimacy and ending hostility toward the island.
	   China must concede to a separate and equal status of the
governments, said Sheu Ke-sheng, a vice chairman of the Cabinet's
Mainland Affairs Council.
	   ``If you stop threatening us militarily and suppressing our
foreign relations, then under such conditions we could raise
dialogue on issues such as ending the state of hostility,'' Sheu
told a news conference.
	   Ending Taiwan's ban on direct trade, transportation and
communications with China could also be discussed if such
conditions were met, he said. China says those two issues should
top the agenda for political talks that would be a first step
toward reunification between the two.
	   Shu's comments appeared aimed at shoring up Taiwan's position
during high-level contacts in China that it hopes will foster a
return to negotiations severed by China in 1995. Top Taiwanese
envoy Koo Chen-fu was meeting his Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan,
Thursday night in Shanghai for a meeting, dinner, and a night at
the opera.
	   But the sides so far have shown no willingness to offer
concessions to end their estrangement.
	   China demands that Taiwan first return to the ``one China
principle'' _ with Taiwan accepting a place as a local government
under Chinese sovereignty. It wants an agreement from Taiwan to
discuss political issues as a condition for restarting talks.
	   Sheu's comments echoed the positions bluntly voiced by Taiwanese
official Shi Hwei-yow in Shanghai on Wednesday. Newspapers in
Taiwan reported that Koo was similarly frank in earlier discussions
with Wang, in which he asserted Taiwan's sovereignty and
separateness from China.
	   Koo's comments prompted sometimes angry retorts from Chinese
official Tang Shubei at their joint news conference Wednesday
night, the reports said.
	   But Sheu said the uninhibited exchange of views marked a ``good
beginning.''
	   ``That's better than you guessing and me guessing. It's better
to state your positions clearly,'' Shu said.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government driven off the
mainland by Communist forces in 1949. Beijing considers the island
a renegade province to be reunified with the mainland by force if
necessary. It says Taiwan has no right to independent foreign
relations, and broke off talks after a visit to the United States
by Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui.

Poisonous mushrooms sicken 11, kill 1 in southern Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Poisonous mushrooms sickened 11 people in the
southern Russian town of Belgorod, killing one of them, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday.
	   Not only were the mushrooms a poisonous variety, they also were
not washed properly before being cooked, ITAR-Tass said, quoting
the local sanitary inspection center.
	   Mushroom-picking is a favorite Russian hobby, but cases of food
poisoning are common when people mistake toxic mushrooms for edible
varieties.

Parliament prepares to debate no-confidence motion against Moi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEGE MBITIRU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Police sealed off streets around
parliament building Thursday as legislators prepared to debate a no
confidence motion which, if successful, could lead to the collapse
of President Daniel arap Moi's 20-year rule.
	   A police source said authorities were determined to ensure there
would be no gathering outside parliament by supporters of
politicians who back or opposed the motion.
	   Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union party has a majority
in the 222-member house and could easily garner the 113 votes
needed to defeat the motion.
	   But it during a nationwide teachers strike and during the East
African nation's worst economic crisis since independence in 1963.
	   There is also growing dissatisfaction Muslim legislators, who
have traditionally either belonged to KANU or supported Moi, but
who have lately been accusing his government of ignoring the
interests of Kenya's Muslims, estimated at between 5 and 30 percent
of the population of 29 million.
	   The no-confidence motion, to be presented by James Orengo of the
opposition FORD-Kenya party, is the third against a Kenyan
government. The other two, unsuccessful, motions were presented
against the government of Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta,
in 1964 and 1967.
	   As vice-president, Moi assumed office on Kenyatta's death in
1978. Single-party rule was instituted after a failed coup attempt
by non-commissioned air force officers in 1982.
	   Orengo's motion is based on a constitutional clause that permits
any legislator to request parliament to vote ``Yes'' or ``No'' on a
motion that says ``this house resolves and declares it has no
confidence in the government of Kenya.''
	   If the motion is carried, Moi has two options: he can resign and
seek a new mandate in presidential elections while the parliament
remains seated, or he can remain president, dissolve parliament and
call general elections.
	   Moi is president as well as an elected member of parliament.
	   If he does neither, parliament must then dissolve itself on the
fourth day after the vote.
	   On Tuesday, the Safina opposition party urged Moi to form a
government of national unity to last four years. His current
presidential term expires in 2002.
	   Safina leader Paul Muite said no government formed by any single
political party could fight corruption in high places and enact the
constitutional and economic reforms necessary to get Kenya out of
the mess it is in..

NATO plans to send Solana, top allied commanders to Belgrade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO was planning to send Javier
Solana, its secretary general, and two top commanders to Belgrade
on Thursday to sign an air surveillance deal for Kosovo, part of a
peace accord for the Serbian province.
	   ``I may be going this afternoon or this evening to finalize the
agreement,'' Solana told reporters at NATO headquarters.
	   The NATO ambassadors were debating the composition of the
alliance delegation.
	   They also considered sending NATO's top military commander in
Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, and Klaus Naumann, a German general
who heads NATO's panel of chiefs of staffs from the 16 alliance
nations.
	   Solana reiterated that Milosevic was still not complying with
the accord, forged this week by U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke, that obligates Belgrade to withdraw troops from Kosovo,
begin peace talks with ethnic Albanians, and allow 2,000
international monitors into the province.
	   ``The information that we have is that that compliance is still
not a reality ... although some efforts have been made,'' Solana
said.
	   ``I will send (Milosevic) a very clear message. And that is that
the solution to the problem (in Kosovo) is not signing papers but
to comply with agreements that have been achieved.''
	   He said Serbian troops were not being withdrawn fast enough for
refugees to feel confident they can return home.
	   ``It is very important for (refugees) to return to their
villages. For that, compliance with the withdrawal of troops is
very, very important. We'll keep our eyes and ears open.''
	   His comments contrasted with those made on Wednesday by U.S.
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin who gave an upbeat
appraisal of Yugoslav compliance with its commitments.
	   Rubin said American and European monitoring teams in Kosovo
reported a much smaller Serb police presence in the Kosovo
countryside than on Sunday.
	   On Wednesday, NATO officials said the alliance would likely keep
in place its Oct. 13 airstrikes order beyond Saturday, the deadline
for Milosevic to comply with the Kosovo peace accord.
	   In addition to permitting 2,000 peace monitors on the ground,
Belgrade must allow unarmed NATO spy planes into the airspace over
Kosovo to check on compliance with the agreement from the air.
	   NATO planned to use high-flying eye-in-the-sky planes such as
U-2s and P3 Orion aircraft.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has been
asked to provide the 2,000 ``compliance verifiers.''

	   The agreement on having aides to Koo and Wang consider a
resumption of routine talks was reached in the convivial atmosphere
of a meeting over Chinese-style tea at a swank Shanghai hotel.
	   The two officials met for the first time in five years
Wednesday, holding an hour-long discussion that mixed pleasantries
with the divisive positions that have kept the two sides from
resuming the formal negotiations Beijing scrubbed three years ago.
	   The informal setting of Thursday's meeting _ Koo and his wife
joined Wang and his wife at a round tea table with their aides
sitting at similar tables nearby _ belied the importance of the
talks.
	   Just the fact that the two elder statesmen were meeting
face-to-face appeared to be enough to propel relations between the
divided governments forward.

Burundian rebels propose amnesty at peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Delegates to a third round of peace
talks on Thursday debated a rebel group's proposal that a general
amnesty be declared to end five years of civil strife in Burundi.
	   Establishing a commission to investigate all massacres since
independence in 1962, then granting amnesty would allow a new
beginning for more than 6 million Burundians, said Joseph Karumba,
leader of the rebel FROLINA.
	   ``The constant recall of past killings and exchanges of
accusations of atrocities is an obstacle to reconciliation and
dialogue,'' Karumba said Wednesday.
	   At least 200,000 Burundians have died in violence that surged in
October 1993 after Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu.
	   Karumba also suggested at the closed-door talks that the
international community help to strengthen the judiciary system to
help build trust.
	   ``The law of the jungle is a sheer reality in Burundi today. All
magistrates have become fervent defenders of their tribe and
repressive instruments rather than giving justice,'' Karumba said
in an interview.
	   More than a dozen delegations representing the government,
ruling and opposition political parties, members of civil society
and rebels are taking part in the talks, which resumed Wednesday
after a 2-month break.
	   Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere is the chief mediator.
	   Among the key participants are the government of Burundi and the
opposition Council for the Defense of Democracy. Not invited was
the CNDD's armed wing, Forces for Defense of Democracy, the largest
Hutu rebel group fighting to topple the minority Tutsi government.
	   The first round of all-party talks opened in June and was
followed by another in July when a cease-fire took hold in most of
the country.

Parliament approves army commander Emile Lahoud as president

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Parliament on Thursday formally elected
Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing
of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.
	   In a rare unanimous vote, all 118 legislators present at the
25-minute session cast votes in favor of Lahoud. They included
three legislators who had hoped for the job themselves.
	   Lahoud is to be sworn for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day
President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
	   The Parliament members cast paper ballots and during the count,
Emile Lahoud's name was read out 118 times.
	   Ten legislators were absent, including Druse leader Walid
Jumblatt who opposed the choice of a military officer for president
and eight members of his Parliament bloc. The other missing
legislator was Omar Karami, a former prime minister who has been
boycotting Parliament.
	   Later, as protocol dictates, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri
personally informed Lahoud of his election.
	   The two hugged at the Central Military Club on Beirut's
waterfront before they traveled to the Presidential Palace for a
meeting with Hrawi.
	   ``We are grateful,'' Lahoud said to journalists as he waved his
fist in the air outside his quarters at the club. The media-shy
general _ who traded his military camouflage uniform for a
double-breasted navy blue suit on Thursday _ made no other
comments.
	   Upon hearing of news, which was broadcast live on television, an
army officer at the club popped the cork on a bottle of champagne.
	   Cookies were distributed to motorists on the street outside.
	   Elsewhere in the city, Lahoud supporters drove in convoys
through the streets, honking and waving flags and pictures of the
general in uniform.
	   His election continues to respect the tradition in Lebanon's
sectarian-based political system that the president is a Maronite,
the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a
Shiite Muslim.
	   Lahoud, 62, won the backing of a public fed up with bickering
and corrupt politicians who have ruled Lebanon since the end of the
devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   And he won the all-important approval from Syrian President
Hafez Assad, whose country is the main power broker in Lebanon.
	   The general, a naval officer trained in Britain and the United
States, also overcame constitutional hurdles and concerns among
politicians about the ascent of a military man to the nation's
highest office.
	   Many hope the general will reform the government as he did the
army, a 55,000-strong disciplined force rebuilt to more than twice
its 1990 size.
	   Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion in the
civil-war fractured military, is credited with ending political and
religious interference in the military _ influences which have
continued to wrack the postwar government.
	   Lahoud was essentially drafted for the job of head of state.
While other candidates openly sought the backing of Parliament
members, politicians and Syria, Lahoud remained silent as his
supporters worked on his behalf.
	   A media shy scion of a prominent Maronite family, Lahoud could
not speak for his candidacy because of rules dictating that the
army commander stay out of politics.
	   To get around a constitutional provision barring senior public
servants from the presidency, the Parliament on Tuesday passed
legislation allowing it ``for once, and exceptionally.''
	   Thursday's vote signified widespread support for the general
that cut through sectarian lines in the half-Muslim, half-Christian
legislature.
	   It was the first balloting for a head of state in peacetime
since the 1970 election of Suleiman Franjieh. Five presidents were
elected during the civil war, including Hrawi in 1989. Of these,
Bashir Gemayel was assassinated in a 1982 bomb explosion before he
took office and Rene Mouawad was killed in a bombing shortly after
he took over in 1989.
	   Hrawi's term was lengthened to nine years by a constitutional
exception approved by Parliament three years ago.

	   Political heirs to the antagonists in the Chinese civil war,
China and Taiwan split after Mao Tse-tung's Communists forced
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists off the mainland in 1949.
	   Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and Nationalist Party elder,
and Wang, an 84-year-old Communist Party stalwart and mentor to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, held their first and until Wednesday
only meeting in Singapore in 1993.
	   China suspended the lower-level dialogue Wang and Koo started
after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui traveled to the United States
in 1995, a move Beijing interpreted as a signal he was reneging on
eventual reunification. Chinese test-missile launches and war games
near Taiwan strained relations to their most tense since the height
of the Cold War.
	   A resumption of talks would suit both sides. The Nationalists
hope to win business support through improved ties with China _ a
key destination for Taiwan investment. Chinese President Jiang,
likewise, faces pressure from the powerful Chinese military and
communist old guard to get Taiwan to agree to reunification.

SHANGHAI: to reunification.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Until now, talks have been held up by China's insistence that
negotiations deal directly with thorny political issues, including
reunification, while Taipei wants to have the talks pick up where
they left off, settling practical issues like fishing disputes.
	   On Thursday, Koo renewed his effort to address practical issues,
such as business concerns, that his government wants to deal with
first.
	   During a luncheon with Taiwanese business executives _ who have
committed dlrs 35 billion in investment in China over the past
decade _ Koo said he was aware of their urgent concerns about the
safety of their investments and their personal security. He said
both sides had agreed to discuss such problems.
	   ``I hope that we can at an early point hold consultations to
establish a normal order for economic and trade relations between
the two sides. That will allow each of you to feel secure and at
ease in investing in the mainland,'' Koo said.
	   Koo pressed his practical agenda at Wednesday's meeting with
Wang and during sightseeing Thursday morning. After touring
Shanghai's Pudong district _ a swath of farmland transformed over
the past decade into a collection of factories and office towers _
Koo toured the fledgling stock exchange.
	   ``Open and fair business dealings require stricter laws and more
transparent regulation,'' Koo told reporters as floor traders
looked on.
	   Later Thursday, Wang and Koo were to dine and attend a
traditional Beijing opera together.
	   In an indication of the hopes China is placing on the visit, Koo
will meet Chinese President Jiang and Vice Premier Qian Qichen over
the weekend in Beijing.

Sri Lankan army renews offensive, 118 rebels, 58 soldiers killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan troops, regrouping after a
fierce battle last month, have killed 118 Tamil Tiger rebels in
renewed fighting for control of a strategic highway in the north in
the last two weeks, losing 58 of their men, a military spokesman
said Thursday.
	   ``We are maintaining steady military pressure and we are
successfully clearing rebel bases, one after another,'' Brigadier
Sunil Tennekoon said at a weekly briefing.
	   The casualties were from 10 separate clashes with the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Tennekoon said. There was no independent
confirmation since the government bars journalists from the war
theater.
	   Last month, government forces supported by warplanes and
helicopter gunships drove the rebels out of the town of Mankulam,
but the rebels recaptured the larger town of Kilinochchi which they
had lost in 1996.
	   The battle for the two cities, about 20 miles (32 kms) apart
along the strategic highway to the Jaffna Peninsula left at least
1,800 dead or missing on both sides, according to the military.
	   Tennekoon said most of the fatalities _ 47 rebels and 46
soldiers _ occurred in fighting along the highway.
	   In another development, Tennekoon said 2,889 army deserters have
been detained since the beginning of a campaign launched Oct. 7 to
find some of the estimated 25,000 soldiers who have abandoned their
units in recent years.
	   ``The result is very encouraging,'' he said. The deserters will
be given a refresher course and returned to military duties.
	   The 100,000-man Sri Lankan army, which has been fighting Tamil
separatists since 1983, has been plagued by desertions. Deserters
who accept an amnesty are allowed to rejoin the military without
punishment.
	   The rebels are fighting to establish a Tamil homeland in the
country's north and east, claiming that they are discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese who control the government and
the military. More than 55,000 people have died in 15 years of
fighting.

Opposition party says arrest of soldiers violates new agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with arrest of mutinous soldiers and expanded
functions of special committee; RECASTS and EDITS to conform; NO
pick up

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Opposition officials on Thursday accused
the government of violating a new agreement after 30 rebel soldiers
were arrested by peacekeeping troops from South Africa.
	   The 30 were among 1,500 soldiers who returned to army
headquarters after participating in a mutiny in September.
	   ``Their arrest violates the spirit of agreements reached at
yesterday's talks'' with the government, said opposition alliance
spokesman Vincent Malebu.
	   It was not clear whether the development would sink the new
agreement.
	   On Wednesday, government and opposition parties agreed to set up
a special body to prepare for new elections, a gesture of
reconciliation after months of upheaval.
	   The group was to create the basis for free and fair elections
within 18 months and help normalize the security situation, said
Ronnie Mamoepa, a South African government spokesman who was
present at the talks.
	   Party tensions in Lesotho, a small mountainous kingdom
surrounded by South Africa, have been running high since the May
elections, which opposition groups claim were rigged.
	   But Mamoepa said the new body was expected to adopt a code of
conduct for members of political parties, to prevent a recurrence
of violence.
	   ``Normalization is not just a task of police and security forces
alone. It's the responsibility of all the political parties,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
	   After an army revolt and crippling strikes, South Africa and
nearby Botswana on Sept. 22 sent about 1,000 troops into the
country to restore calm. South Africa expected to establish order
quickly and leave, but scores were killed and its soldiers remain
in Lesotho.
	   Malebu charged that the foreign troops had arrested the 30
soldiers in violation of their mission to maintain law and order.
	   After Wednesday's agreement, a South African government
statement said the parties would appoint technical teams to examine
proposals for the new election body, expected to be appointed by
Oct. 31.
	   South Africa's Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi
mediated the daylong talks.
	   The Southern African Development Community, a 14-nation regional
group, uncovered serious irregularities in the May elections.

Foreign creditors demand return of four Philippine Airlines planes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Three foreign creditors have demanded
the return of four Boeing 737-300 planes they have leased to
Philippine Airlines, officials said Thursday.
	   The creditors separately petitioned the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Manila's corporate watchdog, to order PAL to pay
overdue lease charges and return the planes.
	   Debt-laden PAL reopened Oct. 7 with domestic flights after a
13-day shutdown caused by disagreements with its largest labor
union over a management recovery plan.
	   PAL had planned to resume international flights this week but
indefinitely postponed them while potential investors review the
struggling air carrier's financial records.
	   The creditors _ GE Capital Corp., the financial unit of General
Electric Co.; Ireland-based aircraft lessor GPA Group PLC, and
Airplanes Finance Ltd. _ said PAL failed to pay its financial
obligations due between June 23 and Oct. 1, 1998.
	   In its petition, GE Capital said it leased two Boeing 737-300s
to PAL in 1989, and the flag carrier owed it dlrs 1.65 million in
rent and other charges.
	   GPA Group said it leased one plane and supplied spare parts to
PAL, which owes the group dlrs 608,162. PAL has to pay Airplanes
Finance dlrs 1.23 million for the lease of a Boeing 737-300.
	   The SEC would study the petitions and issue a decision soon,
officials said.
	   Two of the airline's Boeing 747-400 planes have already been
seized recently by authorities in Hong Kong and Los Angeles on
orders of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which financed them for PAL.
	   PAL was granted permission by the SEC in June to temporarily
suspend payments on foreign and local financial obligations
amounting to dlrs 2.1 billion. Asia's financial crisis and a
crippling pilots' strike in June have worsened its financial
problems.
	   The SEC is overseeing a committee formed to try to rehabilitate
PAL.

Queen to curtail pageantry in state opening of Parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II will dispense with some of the
traditional pageantry when she opens Parliament next month,
dropping 14 people from the grand procession, Buckingham Palace
said Thursday.
	   The procession had grown to 56 people in their ceremonial finery
for the State Opening of Parliament, when the monarch reads the
government's legislative program to the assembled lords and
commoners.
	   ``The initiative to look at the arrangements for the royal
procession came from the palace as part of our overall, ongoing
look at how the process is carried out,'' royal spokeswoman Penny
Russell-Smith said Thursday.
	   ``It is simply a fine-tuning of the ceremonial.''
	   She confirmed that 14 people were being eliminated from the
procession but said details would be announced by the Earl Marshal,
the Duke of Norfolk.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the ceremony would be speeded up by
having Black Rod bang on the closed door of the House of Commons to
summon members while the queen is making her way to the Lords. In
the past, Black Rod has not gone to the Commons until the queen has
taken her seat in the Lords, leaving her nothing to do while the
commoners slowly file in.
	   The queen has taken a number of steps to update the image of the
monarchy, notably her decision to pay taxes, announced in 1992. She
has also reduced the number of family members on the public
payroll, and recently has sought to project a more common touch by
visiting a McDonald's restaurant in England and autographing a
soccer ball for some children in Malaysia.

Vladivostok mayoral elections set for January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ New mayoral elections will be held in
Russia's Pacific port city of Vladivostok on Jan. 17, after the
last vote was declared invalid, an election official said Thursday.
	   Voters last month rejected all candidates, thereby voiding the
election, said City Electoral Commission head Ilya Grinchenko.
	   Incumbent Mayor Viktor Cherepkov was barred from the race hours
before the polls opened. A court ruled he violated electoral laws
by using public funds for his campaign.
	   Elections for Vladivostok's city council are scheduled to take
place Sunday, said regional Electoral Commission chairman Sergei
Knyazev.
	   Vladivostok, about 6400 kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow,
has not had a legal city legislature in five years.

U.N.: poorest countries' progress at risk from slump and storms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Efforts by the world's poorest countries to join
the economic mainstream risk being derailed by natural disasters
and the global economic crisis, according to a report released
Thursday by the U.N. trade and development agency.
	   But they should not give up those efforts, the U.N. Conference
on Trade and Development said in its annual Least Developed
Countries Report.
	   Of the 48 countries classed as the world's least developed, 33
are in Africa.
	   Although most African countries' economies showed healthy growth
last year, some stumbled due to disasters caused by the El Nino
weather phenomenon and the falling price of commodities central to
their economies, the report said.
	   Their prospects will improve if European economies stay strong
and South Africa picks up, it added.
	   But the spreading impact of the Asian crisis is likely to
squeeze the very poorest countries as foreign financing dries up,
the report added.
	   The 210-page study provided no specific prediction for growth,
because of world economic uncertainty and the unpredictability of
the kind of shocks caused by El Nino.
	   ``No one in his right mind would want to hazard a guess beyond
the next few days'' at the moment, senior UNCTAD official Andrew
Whitley told a news conference.
	   The effects of floods which covered much of Bangladesh;
torrential rains in Bhutan, Nepal and Sudan, and hurricanes in the
Caribbean ``may take years to repair and may forestall growth in
the foreseeable future,'' UNCTAD secretary-general Rubens Ricupero
conceded.
	   The report singled out Bangladesh's growth rate of 5.7 percent
last year, with a strong farming sector, as a hopeful Asian
performance.

Most Asian stocks gain on falling interest rates, stronger

currencies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets closed higher Thursday
because of falling interest rates and stronger regional currencies,
but the Tokyo market fell on a dismal corporate profits outlook.
	   In Japan, an announcement by Nomura Securities on its losses
sparked fears about further losses and pulled the market down.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Average shed 75.36 points, or
0.58 percent, closing at 12,995.37. On Wednesday, it had fallen
172.06 points, or 1.30 percent.
	   In late afternoon, meanwhile, the dollar bought 118.73 yen, down
0.99 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York level of 118.98 yen overnight.
	   At the opening, investors bid up shares of some banks amid
optimism that Parliament's upper house will quickly approve a bill
that would pump public funds into Japan's weakened banking system.
	   Traders said earlier gains were reversed on worries that a
stagnant domestic economy and the yen's recent strengthening _
which erodes profits from overseas _ will trim earnings.
	   Nomura announced in the afternoon that the value of its Japanese
stock holdings had fallen by 33.72 billion yen (U.S. dlrs 285
million).
	   Hong Kong share prices ended higher as fund managers turned
their attention back to Asian stocks.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng gained 131.41 points, or 1.5 percent,
closing at 8,970.42. It had gained 1.4 percent Wednesday.
	   Traders said fund managers bought back into Hong Kong markets to
diversify their portfolios and increase their Asian stocks toward
the end of the third quarter. Overseas hedge funds covered short
positions in the oversold property sector.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Stock prices ended higher as foreigners returned to the
market. The SET index gained 10.07 points, or 3.5 percent, closing
at 295.19.
	   JAKARTA: Shares closed slightly higher, boosted by the stronger
rupiah. The JSX Index was up 1.657 points, or 0.54 percent, at
304.847.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices extended their rally at the close as
investors continued bargain hunting. The Composite Index was up
9.03 points, or 2.4 percent, to 393.25.
	   MANILA: Shares closed higher, buoyed by an appreciating peso and
Wall Street's gain. The PSE index was up 18.56 points, or 1.4
percent, closing at 1,342.78.
	   TAIPEI: Stocks finished lower for the fourth straight session
due to faltering confidence over lackluster corporate earnings. The
Weighted Price Index was down 19.24 points, or 0.28 percent,
closing at 6,799.88.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed sharply higher, resuming the upward
trend that began last week. The Straits Times Index was up 38.97
points, or 4 percent, closing at 1,024.75.
	   SEOUL: Share prices soared on a sharp fall in interest rates and
rumors that Ford Motor Co. could win the Kia auction. The KOSPI was
up 22.60 points, or 6.5 percent, at 368.74.
	   SYDNEY: Share prices ended lower, with blue chips and new issues
taking center stage. The All Ordinaries index was down 6.3 points,
or 0.25 percent, at 2,459.3.
	   WELLINGTON: Share prices finished higher, boosted by a rise in
key stocks such as Independent Newspapers Ltd. and Brierley
Investments Ltd. The NZSE-40 capital index was up 19.18 points, or
1 percent, at 1,765.30.

US envoy, Russian officials discuss crisis, export controls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia promised a top U.S. State Department envoy
it was trying to tighten export controls to limit illegal weapons
proliferation, a news agency said Thursday.
	   Export controls and Russia's financial crisis dominated meetings
this week with Stephen Sestanovich, an adviser to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, and other U.S. officials.
	   ``We intend to continue active and close cooperation with the
U.S. in export control,'' said Nikolai Berdyuzha, secretary of
Russia's Security Council, according to the Interfax news agency.
The government has submitted a bill on export control to the lower
house of parliament, he said.
	   Still, Berdyuzha insisted that stricter export controls didn't
mean Russia would cut back on legitimate arms deals, which are a
crucial source of income for the cash-starved country.
	   ``This does not mean we will be breaking legitimate mutually
beneficial trade and economic relations with other countries,'' he
said.
	   Sestanovich was accompanied by Treasury aide Mark Medish and
Carlos Pascual of the U.S. National Security Council, Interfax
said.
	   They met with President Boris Yeltsin's foreign policy adviser,
Sergei Prikhodko, Deputy Central Bank Chairman Andrei Kozlov and
Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov.
	   They also met officials from the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank in Moscow.

 &UR; Police launch new search after rape victim's account,
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with arrest of man in England &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police have arrested a suspect in the rape-murder
of an English schoolgirl in France, while French police were
pursuing yet another suspect after a rape victim identified a
police sketch of the girl's killer.
	   The murdered girl, 13-year-old Caroline Dickinson,was raped and
smothered in a hostel in Brittany in 1966.
	   A 41-year-old man was arrested Friday in Frome in southwestern
England, and was released on bail pending the outcome of DNA tests,
Avon and Somerset police said. His name was not released.
	   Police in the Meurthe-et-Moselle area of eastern France have
launched a new search for a suspect, the newspaper Est Republicain
reported Thursday.
	   The order came from judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke, who is
investigating the slaying.
	   A student in Nancy, in eastern France, said the police sketch of
Dickinson's attacker looked much like the man who raped her while
he held a knife to her throat on May 25, 1993, the newspaper said.
	   Dickinson was raped and then strangled in a youth hostel in
Pleine Fougeres, Brittany, while on a five-day trip with 39 other
youngsters and five adults from the school where she was a pupil.
	   Nearly 700 voluntary DNA tests carried out to find Caroline's
killer on Pleine Fougeres villagers, hostel staff, and boys and
teachers from the school have all proved negative.
	   However, French police were still receiving calls following the
release in February of a composite picture of a suspect seen in the
two days before the murder. The composite was compiled with the
help of Caroline's friends.
	   Her mother, Sue Dickinson, has begun a civil claim for damages
against Cornwall County Council, alleging breach of duty and
negligence.

South African behemoth Anglo-American announces major
</HEADLINE>
restructuring &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's corporate
behemoth, Anglo American Corp., on Thursday unveiled a huge
restructuring and announced it was moving its headquarters to
London.
	   The new company, Anglo American PLC, would become one of the
world's largest mining and natural resources conglomerates, with
major holdings in precious and base metals, diamonds, industrial
minerals and other industrial and financial activities.
	   At the core of the restructuring is the acquisition of minority
stakes in Minorco SA, its offshore natural resources arm, and Anglo
American Coal Corp.
	   The shakeup is a major streamlining of Anglo's Byzantine
structures, which for years have kept its share price valued at a
discount to its actual assets.
	   The new group would have a market capitalization of 6.1 billion
pounds (dlrs 10.37 billion) and would seek listing on the London
Stock Exchange. It would also carry listings in Johannesburg and
other major European stock exchanges, Anglo American said.
	   The restructuring would effectively move ownership of South
Africa's most prized assets abroad. The South African Reserve Bank
has approved the plan, the company said.
	   Anglo American shareholders will receive one Anglo PLC share for
each company share, while Minorco shareholders will receive one
Anglo PLC share for every two of Minorco's shares, or an
alternative cash offer of dlrs 16 a share.
	   As part of the restructuring, Minorco will dispose of its 32
percent investment in Engelhard Corp., a U.S. automobile catalyst
maker, and its 57 percent stake in Terra Industries Inc., a U.S.
agribusiness group.
	   Anglo American will sell off its 16 percent interest in Beverage
and Consumer Industry Holdings Ltd., which controls South African
Breweries Ltd.
	   The restructuring will take effect after shareholders receive
documentation in early 1999, and following compliance with London
Stock Exchange requirements, Anglo American said.
	   ``Anglo PLC will form a new platform to develop the ability of
the group to compete more effectively around the world and to
exploit new business and growth opportunities, supported by
improved access to international capital markets,'' Anglo American
said.
	   Anglo American Corp., which accounts for half of the
Johannesburg stock market's capitalization, owns the world's
biggest diamond miner and marketer, De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd., and some of the world's largest gold and platinum mines.
	   Anglo American also has investments around the world in coal,
steel, paper, timber, chemicals, motor manufacturing, food,
financial services and property.

China, Taiwan move closer to resuming routine talks

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China and Taiwan moved closer Thursday to
resuming formal negotiations broken off three years ago, as their
top envoys agreed to have their aides explore re-establishing
routine talks.
	   In a further sign of the improving atmosphere, Taiwan's Koo
Chen-fu invited his Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, to visit
Taiwan, and Wang agreed to visit at a mutually convenient time,
Koo's spokesman said.
	   The agreement on having aides to Koo and Wang consider a
resumption of routine talks was reached in the convivial atmosphere
of a meeting over Chinese-style tea at a swank Shanghai hotel.
	   The two officials met for the first time in five years
Wednesday, holding an hour-long discussion that mixed pleasantries
with the divisive positions that have kept the two sides from
resuming the formal negotiations Beijing scrubbed three years ago.
	   The informal setting of Thursday's meeting _ Koo and his wife
joined Wang and his wife at a round tea table with their aides
sitting at similar tables nearby _ belied the importance of the
talks.
	   Just the fact that the two elder statesmen were meeting
face-to-face appeared to be enough to propel relations between the
divided governments forward.
	   Political heirs to the antagonists in the Chinese civil war,
China and Taiwan split after Mao Tse-tung's Communists forced
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists off the mainland in 1949.
	   Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and Nationalist Party elder,
and Wang, an 84-year-old Communist Party stalwart and mentor to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, held their first and until Wednesday
only meeting in Singapore in 1993.
	   China suspended the lower-level dialogue Wang and Koo started
after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui traveled to the United States
in 1995, a move Beijing interpreted as a signal he was reneging on
eventual reunification. Chinese test-missile launches and war games
near Taiwan strained relations to their most tense since the height
of the Cold War.
	   A resumption of talks would suit both sides. The Nationalists
hope to win business support through improved ties with China _ a
key destination for Taiwan investment. Chinese President Jiang,
likewise, faces pressure from the powerful Chinese military and
communist old guard to get Taiwan to agree to reunification.
	   Until now, talks have been held up by China's insistence that
negotiations deal directly with thorny political issues, including
reunification, while Taipei wants to have the talks pick up where
they left off, settling practical issues like fishing disputes.
	   On Thursday, Koo renewed his effort to address practical issues,
such as business concerns, that his government wants to deal with
first.
	   During a luncheon with Taiwanese business executives _ who have
committed dlrs 35 billion in investment in China over the past
decade _ Koo said he was aware of their urgent concerns about the
safety of their investments and their personal security. He said
both sides had agreed to discuss such problems.
	   ``I hope that we can at an early point hold consultations to
establish a normal order for economic and trade relations between
the two sides. That will allow each of you to feel secure and at
ease in investing in the mainland,'' Koo said.
	   Koo pressed his practical agenda at Wednesday's meeting with
Wang and during sightseeing Thursday morning. After touring
Shanghai's Pudong district _ a swath of farmland transformed over
the past decade into a collection of factories and office towers _
Koo toured the fledgling stock exchange.
	   ``Open and fair business dealings require stricter laws and more
transparent regulation,'' Koo told reporters as floor traders
looked on.
	   Later Thursday, Wang and Koo were to dine and attend a
traditional Beijing opera together.
	   In an indication of the hopes China is placing on the visit, Koo
will meet Chinese President Jiang and Vice Premier Qian Qichen over
the weekend in Beijing.

Regional official in Russia charged with bribery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A trade official in the Ural Mountains city of
Chelyabinsk was charged with bribery after demanding dlrs 800 from
a businessman trying to open an electronics store, a news agency
said Thursday.
	   Mark Zlotver, chairman of a district trade committee in
Chelyabinsk, was arrested after accepting the bribe that was paid
in specially marked bills, ITAR-Tass said. It said the transaction
was videotaped by a hidden camera.
	   It said the businessman, who wanted to sell audio and video
equipment, first agreed to pay the bribe, but then reported Zlotver
to police who set up the sting.
	   Corruption is a widespread problem in Russia as it tries to move
to a free-market economy.

U.N. police monitor mission in eastern Croatia ends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A United Nations police monitoring
mission in Croatia's tense eastern region ended Thursday, ending a
six-year presence by the international organization in the area.
	   U.N. troops were first deployed in eastern Croatia, known as
Eastern Slavonia, to ensure an internationally brokered cease-fire
agreement between government forces and minority rebel Serbs in
1992.
	   During its tenure, the mission evolved from a peacekeeping force
in the early stages to a monitor of the ethnically mixed local
police units.
	   In its final phase, the mission mostly kept tabs on ethnically
motivated crime and the process of refugee returns.
	   Croatia fought a bloody war with local Serbs backed by the
Yugoslav army in 1991 after it seceded from the old Yugoslav
federation. More than 10,000 lives were lost in the fighting, while
hundreds of thousands were left homeless.
	   The situation in this once-volatile region has calmed
significantly in the last year but there is a need for further
reconciliation between the former war foes and large-scale economic
reconstruction.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a
54-nation forum which has monitor missions in European trouble
spots, will assume the responsibilities held by the United Nations.

Prosecutors open inquest into hard-line protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian prosecutors have opened an investigation
into opposition calls to overthrow President Boris Yeltsin's
government by force, officials said Thursday.
	   The Moscow city prosecutor's office will look into statements
made by Communists and other hard-liners during protests in the
capital earlier this month that marked the bloody fighting between
opposition lawmakers and government troops five years ago.
	   Some speakers at the rallies, including retired Gen. Albert
Makashov, a Communist member of parliament, called for the
government's ouster by force.
	   Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov said earlier this month
that criminal proceedings could be launched against Makashov and
several other opposition activists.
	   Prosecutor's office has refused to identify which specific
individuals it was investigating, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Under Russian law, public calls for the violent ouster of the
government are punishable by a fine or a prison term of up to three
years.
	   Makashov has immunity from prosecution because he is a lawmaker
Communists who dominate the parliament's lower house, together with
other hard-liners, are certain to block any attempt to lift his
immunity.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Prodi giving up on forming new government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Premier Romano Prodi on Thursday gave up on
his bid to form a new government, informing President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro that his negotiations had failed.
	   ``I believe it was my duty to take up Scalfaro's invitation to
form a new government,'' Prodi told reporters after their meeting.
	   ``I knew the difficulties I would face, but in the best
interests of my country, I needed to take risks and face a
difficult situation. But my assignment proved impossible.''
	   Scalfaro can now ask someone else to try to form a government or
he can call early elections. Most observers think elections are
unlikely.
	   ``I hope Italy will soon have a stable government and a cohesive
majority,'' Prodi said.

Uganda, Rwanda call on Kabila to negotiate with Congo rebels

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Uganda and Rwanda, accused by Congolese
President Laurent Kabila of being the godfathers of the two-month
rebellion against him, have called on their former protege to open
talks with rebels who now control one fourth of the vast central
African nation.
	   A statement released Wednesday night by Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni's office said he and Rwandan Vice President and Defense
Minister Paul Kagame ``stressed that the resolution of the conflict
must address in an acceptable and sustainable way the legitimate
interests of all Congo's neighboring states.''
	   While both Museveni and Kagame publicly deny they are backing
the rebels _ a mixture of Congolese ethnic Tutsis, disgruntled
soldiers from other tribes in Congo and politicians opposed to
Kabila _ both have sent troops into their large neighbor to the
west.
	   ``The military presence of Uganda in the Democratic Republic of
Congo is based on genuine and legitimate security interests and on
its determination to prevent genocide in the area until a
government of the DRC agreed on by all the belligerent parties and
opposition groups is in place,'' the statement said.
	   Kabila, backed militarily by Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad,
has refused to meet with rebels, whom he dismisses as puppets of
Uganda and Rwanda.
	   The meeting of the two men who masterminded the rebellion two
years ago that ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and put
Kabila in power in May 1997 came three days after the Congolese
rebels captured the eastern town of Kindu and its strategic air
base.
	   Officials in the capital, Kinshasa, have conceded they lost
Kindu but claim that government troops are regrouping.
	   In the rebel stronghold at Goma in eastern Congo, rebel
political leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said Thursday the time for
negotiations with Kabila was ripe, but if Kabila did not respond,
the rebels would push on.
	   ``Our troops will continue advancing until we hear from
Kabila,'' he told reporters. ``It is up to him. We're ready to
talk, but we cannot wait indefinitely.''
	   Both Uganda and Rwanda face security threats on their western
frontiers from rebel groups that have found haven in eastern Congo.
	   The statement said Rwanda had expressed concern about what it
termed ``genocidal attacks'' against minority Tutsis living in
eastern Congo.
	   ``Naturally, one expects that we have to be involved, or we have
to be seriously concerned about this situation,'' Kagame told The
Associated Press last month. ``We just can't sit by and watch
things happening that affect us like that and just let it pass.''
	   During three months in 1994, extremist Hutu soldiers and militia
in Rwanda slaughtered at least half a million people, most of them
minority Tutsis, in a government-sponsored genocide. Tutsi rebels,
led by Kagame, ousted the Hutu government and ended the massacre.
	   ``Rwanda has used several fora to explain her concerns about
continuing insecurity in Rwanda caused by the former Rwandan Armed
Forces and interahamwe militia based in eastern Congo and supported
by Kabila,'' the statement said.
	   Rebel military leader Jean-Pierre Ondakane was reported to be in
Washington for discussions with U.S. officials.

Russian tax service to review tax bills of alcohol producers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's tax officers will review the tax returns
of alcohol producers and revoke licenses of those that fail to
settle their tax debts, the Federal Tax Service said Thursday.
	   The crisis-stricken Russian government established a state
monopoly on alcohol sales and distribution last month in hopes of
boosting its tax collections.
	   Producers will have to settle their back taxes no later than a
month after tax officials review their accounts, the Federal Tax
Service statement said.
	   In Soviet times, alcohol taxes amounted to about 25 percent of
the federal budget, but the figure has since fallen to about two
percent to four percent, officials say. About half the alcohol
consumed in Russia _ mostly vodka _ goes untaxed, according to
government estimates.
	   Also Thursday, a Moscow official said the city would enforce a
ban on alcohol at produce and wholesale markets starting Nov. 16,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said. The city will set up a new network
of 100 wholesale and retail alcohol distributors, said Vladimir
Malyshkov, head of the city's consumer services department.
	   Mayor Yuri Luzhkov announced the ban on Saturday because he said
the federal government was losing out on liquor taxes that were
going uncollected at Moscow markets.

	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Rivals China and Taiwan moved closer
Thursday to resuming a formal dialogue broken off three years ago
by agreeing to step up contacts between their main negotiators.
	   To cement the improving atmosphere, Taiwan's top envoy Koo
Chen-fu invited his Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, to visit
Taiwan, and Wang agreed to come at a mutually convenient time.
	   Agreement on having aides to Koo and Wang consider a resumption
of routine talks was reached in the convivial atmosphere of a
meeting over Chinese-style tea at a swank Shanghai hotel in the
second day of their talks, their first in five years.
	   While the agreement stopped short of resuming a formal dialogue,
it was the most concrete advance since 1995, when relations fell to
their lowest point since the Cold War.
	   Under the agreement, the two government-backed bodies that Wang
and Koo head will hold discussions on resuming negotiations. Wang's
chief aide, Tang Shubei, said the talks would cover all issues,
including political matters. The two organizations also will step
up contacts.
	   Out of concern for Taiwanese public sentiment after some
high-profile murders, the two bodies also agreed to discuss issues
of safety for Taiwanese citizens in mainland China.
	   Koo's top aide, Shi Hwei-yow, said that Wang was invited to
visit Taiwan during the general election campaign in November and
December to give China a better understanding of Taiwanese
democracy.
	   Tang said Wang ``was willing to visit Taiwan to better
understand the situation,'' but added that his schedule for the
rest of the year was too busy.
	   The informal setting of Thursday's meeting _ Koo and his wife
joined Wang and his wife at a round tea table with their aides
sitting at similar tables nearby _ belied the importance of the
talks.
	   Political heirs to the antagonists in the Chinese civil war,
China and Taiwan split after Mao Tse-tung's Communists forced
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists off the mainland in 1949.
	   Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and Nationalist Party elder,
and Wang, an 84-year-old Communist Party stalwart and mentor to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, held their first and until Wednesday
only meeting in Singapore in 1993.
	   China suspended the lower-level dialogue Wang and Koo started
after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui traveled to the United States
in 1995, a move Beijing interpreted as a signal he was reneging on
eventual reunification.
	   A resumption of talks would suit both sides. The Nationalists
hope to win support from the business community through improved
ties with China. Chinese President Jiang faces pressure from the
powerful Chinese military and communist old guard to get Taiwan to
agree to reunification.
	   Until now, talks have been held up by China's insistence that
negotiations deal directly with thorny political issues, including
reunification, while Taipei wants to have the talks pick up where

Explosion near oil refinery kills one, injures another
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MATOSINHOS, Portugal (AP) _ An explosion near an oil refinery in
this northern coastal town killed one fisherman, seriously injured
another and left an oil slick in the port area, officials said
Thursday.
	   The explosion occurred Wednesday at 11.20 p.m. (2220 gmt) as a
tanker discharged crude into a refinery owned by the Petrogal
company in Matosinhos, some 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of
Lisbon, Petrogal spokesman Antonio Mocho said.
	   The tanker was offloading its oil, a mile off the coast, through
a recently-installed pipeline when some spilled into the sea.
	   A build up gases in the area was thought to have followed,
Matosinhos fireman Simoes Duarte said.
	   ``The fishermen must have smelled something and went over to see
what was going on. One of them might have been smoking or might
have lit a match,'' he said, adding that there was still some crude
near the port area.
	   But company spokesman Mocho said the cause of the explosion was
not yet known. He said the refinery was still operating because the
equipment was undamaged.
	   Petrogal _ Petroleos de Portugal S.A. _ is Portugal's largest
petroleum company. It has two refineries with a capacity of 300
thousand barrels per day and providing the local market with 85
percent of its local petroleum products.
	   ``Petrogal needs to stop its procedures here and check to make
certain that it is meeting Portuguese and European regulations,''
Matosinhos mayor Narciso Miranda told Lisbon radio TSF.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets ended higher Thursday on the
back of falling interest rates and stronger regional currencies,
but the biggest market, Tokyo, fell on dismal corporate profits
outlooks. In Japan, an announcement of losses by Nomura Securities
sparked fears of further declines in profits. The benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Average shed 75.36 points, or 0.58 percent, to
close at 12,995.37. The dollar bought 118.56 yen at mid-afternoon,
down 1.16 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo. In Hong Kong, the
blue-chip Hang Seng gained 131.41 points, or 1.5 percent, to close
at 8,970.42. Traders said fund managers bought back into Hong Kong
markets to diversify their portfolios and increase their Asian
stocks towards the end of the third quarter. Overseas hedge funds
covered short positions, or bought back borrowed shares, in the
oversold property sector. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Thursday
ordered the government and its agencies to start settling their
huge outstanding bills, a problem that has paralyzed the Russian
economy. But Primakov abruptly canceled a Thursday Cabinet meeting
to finalize the proposals, saying the proposals were already clear
and needed to be implemented. ``We have had enough discussions, we
now must act,'' spokesman Igor Shchegolev quoted him as saying. The
plan worked out by the economics and finance ministries would
require the government and state-owned companies to clear their
mutual debts of some 50 billion rubles (dlrs 3.8 billion) by
mid-December. The cash-strapped government has been a major debtor
in the Russian economy, failing to pay wages and pensions to
workers and other bills to state-run companies. The workers and
companies then cannot pay their bills, leading to a chain of
non-payments that is disabling Russian industries. Officials admit
the government's unpaid bills are small compared to those in the
private sector. They estimate all debts in Russia total a
staggering 1.2 trillion rubles (dlrs 92 billion), or about 40
percent of the country's gross domestic product. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank wants no
compromises in its legal action against executives of what once was
the country's biggest finance company, a bank spokesman said
Thursday. The central bank has filed criminal charges accusing
former chairman Pin Chakkaphak and two other executives of Finance
One of failing to scrutinize loans to two affiliated companies.
They are charged with violating Thai law by approving loans without
collateral, driving Finance One into bankruptcy. The spokesman
quoted Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul as saying the
decision not to make a deal with Pin and his colleagues was a
matter of principle. Pin was offering to surrender and cooperate in
regaining 2.1 billion baht (dlrs 53.2 million) in bad loans he was
allegedly responsible for, in return for an agreement that no new
charges would be filed against him, Bangkok's The Nation newspaper
reported Thursday. Pin is reportedly in the United States, and his
colleagues are also believed to be abroad. (THAILAND-FUGITIVE

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese coast guard ships rushed to contain an oil
spill Thursday after a South Korean cargo ship ran aground off the
Japanese island of Shikoku, an official said. No injuries were
reported among the 15 crew members of the 2,831-ton Chun Il, said
Maritime Safety Agency spokesman Shingo Nakamura. The spill covered
about 13 square kilometers (5 square miles) of the Pacific Ocean,
which the agency sent 20 ships to clean using booms and chemicals,
Nakamura said. Oil gushed from the ship's fuel tank after it struck
partially submerged rocks just off the southwestern coast of
Shikoku, 680 kilometers (425 miles) west of Tokyo. Nakamura said
the coast guard was still trying to determine how much oil had
spilled or how much the Chun Il was carrying. (JAPAN-OIL SPILL)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Amartya Sen is still haunted by boyhood
memories of a famine that gripped his native India. Neither he nor
his family starved _ a fact that later formed the basis of his
economic theories that earned him a Nobel prize on Wednesday.
Emaciated rural laborers died by the thousands in 1943 while most
people were untouched by wartime inflation that pushed food prices
beyond reach of the poorest members of the then-British colony. ``I
knew of no one who was affected by the famine _ no relation, no
friend, no one I ever associated with. That, to me, was a great
insight later, I thought, though I didn't see it at that time. I
just thought we were very lucky,'' Sen said Wednesday. The
experience stirred his interest in the cause of famines _ an
interest that led ultimately to his pioneering work in development
economics. Sen, 64, was awarded the prestigious prize for his
contributions to welfare economics, which help explain the economic
mechanisms underlying famines and poverty, the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences said Wednesday. (NOBEL-ECONOMICS)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A wary NATO and world leaders were
keeping up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, saying he
needs to withdraw many more Serb forces from Kosovo province before
Saturday's deadline. About halfway through the four-day grace
period given Milosevic to show he has met international demands for
ending the turmoil in the secessionist province, NATO officials
said he had a long way to go. And despite noting signs of progress,
a U.S. spokesman called compliance efforts ``a mixed bag.'' If case
he doesn't halt a crackdown against ethnic Albanians, the alliance
is continuing with preparations for air raids against the Serbs.
NATO warplanes are being moved to bases in Italy, just across the
Adriatic Sea from Yugoslavia. International officials gathered
Thursday in Paris and Vienna as part of the assessment process, and
the Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia was to meet in Paris. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The leaders of Israel and the Palestinians are
sitting down with President Bill Clinton to negotiate a U.S.
proposal to withdraw more Israeli troops from the West Bank in
exchange for stricter Palestinian measures against terrorism. With
the approach of a May 1999 deadline for completing a full
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, U.S. officials said they felt a
sense of urgency to end 19 months of stalemate over the West Bank.
Clinton was meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat early
Thursday at the White House, then flying to a secluded resort about
70 miles (112 kilometers) from Washington to convene the talks.
Although there was no timetable, officials said the talks most
likely would run through Sunday. Under a U.S. proposal, Israeli
troops would withdraw from a further 13 percent of the West Bank,
giving Palestinians a measure of control of 40 percent of the
territory. (US-MIDEAST)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Zeb roared out of the
Philippines Thursday, leaving at least 24 people dead and causing
floods and mudslides that swept away thatch homes, disaster
officials said. Its winds also were wreaking havoc in Taiwan, where
two more storm-related deaths were reported. At least 103,000
people were forced to flee their homes in the Philippines as Zeb
brought rampaging floods and peak sustained winds of 240 kph (150
mph). Most have since returned home, but more than 10,000 were
still in government shelters. In Benguet province, at least 10
people were killed and an undetermined number of others were
missing after boulders, mud and debris crashed down a mountain and
covered a workers' quarters of the Luzon Hydroelectric Cooperative,
the provincial disaster office said. (PHILIPPINES-TYPHOON)
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China and Taiwan moved closer Thursday to
resuming formal negotiations broken off three years ago, when top
envoys agreed to have their aides explore re-establishing routine
negotiations. In a further sign of improvement, Taiwan's Koo
Chen-fu invited his Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, to visit
Taiwan and Wang agreed, Koo's spokesman said. The two officials are
meeting for the first time in five years, and mixed pleasantries
with the divisive positions that kept the two sides from resuming
the formal negotiations. The informal setting of Thursday's meeting
_ Koo and his wife joined Wang and his wife at a round tea table in
a swank Shanghai hotel _ belied the importance of the talks. Just
the fact that the two elder statesmen were meeting face-to-face
appeared to be enough to propel relations between the divided
governments forward. (CHINA-TAIWAN)
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's parliament on Thursday formally
elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the
backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.
Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, is to be sworn in for a six-year term
on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office. All 118
members voted for him. Ten members were absent, including Druze
leader Walid Jumblatt, who had pledged to boycott the session to
protest the selection of a military man as president. Lahoud, 62,
won the backing of a public fed up with bickering and corrupt
politicians who have ruled since the end of the devastating 1975-90
civil war. He also won approval from Syrian President Hafez Assad,
whose country is the main power broker in Lebanon. The general, a
naval officer trained in Britain and the United States, overcame
constitutional hurdles to obtain his office. (LEBANON-PRESIDENT)

High school students come out in force for national protest

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French high school students were staging a day of
protests throughout France on Thursday, keeping up the pressure on
the leftist government to cut class sizes and buy more equipment.
	   By midday, an estimated 150,000 students were in the streets. In
Bordeaux in the southwest, 20,000 students were marching. In Rennes
in the north, 10,000 were out in force, and a similar number
rallied in Caen in Normandy.
	   At least 25,000 students were expected to march in Paris,
staring in the early afternoon. Already there were witness reports
of vandalism at a subway station in eastern Paris.
	   In Grenoble, a protesting student was seriously injured hit by a
tramway after jumping over security barriers. And in Rouen, about a
dozen students were arrested for breaking store windows and
rampaging through an outdoor cafe.
	   A student union leader, meanwhile, predicted protests at least
until a school vacation at the end of next week, unless Education
Minister Claude Allegre quickly carries out his promises to improve
school conditions.
	   ``We'll see what is won or not,'' said Thibault Cotta,
secretary-general of the Independent and Democratic Federation of
High School Students, calling for ``concrete action'' from Allegre.
	   He told France Inter radio that without progress this week, his
federation would march on the National Assembly on Tuesday, the day
before a budget vote.
	   He denounced violence during marches earlier this week but said
that in student marches ``things get broken. It's normal. ... We'll
try to keep it from happening again today.''
	   Authorities were advising merchants to shutter their shops and
motorists not to park their cars along march routes.
	   Allegre on Wednesday insisted the government had heard the
students.
	   ``I think it is logical for the young, when there are needs,
when there aren't enough teachers, when classrooms are overcrowded,
to demand good working conditions,'' the minister said at the close
of the weekly Cabinet meeting.
	   ``I'm doing what I can to give this to them,'' he said. At the
meeting, Allegre presented his plan to spread teachers out more
equitably around the country, a decree that bypasses the
parliamentary process.
	   He also promised that a plan to lighten the course load for high
school students would be presented next month.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, himself a former
education minister, hailed the plan, saying it would bring about
``very rapid improvements.''
	   Teachers were rooting for their protesting students. One of the
largest teacher's unions has called for its members to show
solidarity with their protesting students.

Controller air blamed for close call at Heathrow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two passenger jets nearly collided near Heathrow
airport last year because of a breakdown in communication between
air traffic controllers, a official inquiry reported Thursday.
	   A Virgin Express Boeing 737 which had aborted a landing to make
a second pass came within 200 feet (60 m) vertically and 1,000 feet
(300 m) horizontally of a British Airways Boeing 757 which was
taking off, said the report by Air Accidents Investigation Branch.
	   The incident on Aug. 28, 1997 was on a cloudy day, shortly after
the Virgin jet initiated a missed approach or a ``go-around'' _ a
procedure carried out when a pilot or controller is not satisfied
with the aircraft's approach.
	   Both the air departures controller and the training supervisor
failed to tell the air arrivals controller the British Airways jet
was airborne, and the latter did not get agreement from air
departures before advising the Virgin Express of which path to
take.
	   The report said Heathrow's instructions relating to missed
approaches were not sufficiently clear, and should be revised.
Those changes have already been made, the Civil Aviation Authority
said.

Anwar's lawyers to press for his release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with lawyers pushing for release &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for Malaysian dissident
Anwar Ibrahim still will push for his unconditional release
following his move from solitary confinement to a regular jail, a
defense attorney said Thursday.
	   Anwar's eight lawyers had asked earlier for his release when he
was being detained under the Internal Security Act, under which he
could be denied visits by his lawyers and family. A hearing was set
for Oct. 24.
	   That detention ended Wednesday when he was shifted from solitary
confinement in Kuala Lumpur's police headquarters to a prison in
the outskirts of the city.
	   But the lawyers still plan to seek his outright release, one of
them, Pawancheek Marican, was quoted as saying by Bernama news
agency.
	   Meanwhile, Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah said the prosecution
had applied to the High Court to fix a trial date for one count of
corruption and five counts of illegal sex, the New Straits Times
daily reported.
	   ``The prosecution has all the necessary evidence ... for all the
10 charges against Anwar,'' he said, rejecting speculation that the
authorities weren't ready to prosecute.
	   A trial on four charges of corruption is to begin Nov. 2. Anwar
has pleaded innocent to all counts, claiming they were trumped up
by his political adversaries.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and
arrested 18 days later. He had clashed with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad over economic policy before being dismissed for alleged
immoral homosexual acts and corruption.
	   Mohtar said that if the hearings on the first four corruption
charges could be completed by November, the prosecution would apply
for hearing dates for the other charges in December or January.
	   Meanwhile, Mahathir was quoted by a newspaper Thursday as saying
he had thought about abolishing the Internal Security Act, the
harsh law that was used to arrest Anwar and his supporters. It
provides for indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   But he reportedly dropped the idea after security forces told
him that there was still the threat of instability in Malaysia.
	   ``That is why the ISA must be maintained, to prevent people from
creating chaos in the country without seeking justice in the
courts,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying by The Star newspaper.
	   Activists from the opposition Malaysian People's party told
Mahathir to stop blaming the security forces for repeatedly using
the ``draconian and obnoxious'' legislation.
	   ``The decision to introduce the ISA was a political one and it
now needs the political decision of the government to repeal it,''
said the party's president, Syed Husin Ali. ``For once, he must
take responsibility.''
	   Speaking to thousands at a pro-government rally Wednesday,
Mahathir defended the Internal Security Act.
	   Referring to demonstrations in the capital mounted by Anwar's
supporters after his arrest, Mahathir said such kinds of behavior
justified use of the security law, enacted in 1960 to combat
militant communists.
	   Malaysia has used the sweeping law to crack down on hundreds of
people, from mechanics to ministers, jailing them on charges of
threatening national security.

Families of Palestinian prisoners protest near Jewish settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Relatives of Palestinians held in
Israeli jails on Thursday blocked traffic near a Jewish settlement
and demanded that the fate of the detainees be discussed at this
week's Mideast peace summit at Wye Plantation near Washington.
	   About 250 Palestinians rallied at a crossroads between Gaza City
and the Jewish settlement bloc of Gush Katif. They carried banners
reading, ``Wye must lead to the release of prisoners.''
	   Traffic backed up, holding up Jewish settlers and Palestinian
motorists for about 20 minutes.
	   Palestinian policemen took up positions between the protesters
and the Israeli motorists. The protesters eventually left quietly.
	   The protest coincided with the start of the Mideast peace summit
in which Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will try to reach an
agreement on an Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank and
Palestinian security measures.
	   One of the issues on the table is the release of 3,000
Palestinians held by Israel for security offenses.
	   Hisham Abdel Razik, who has been negotiating the release of the
prisoners with Israel, accompanied Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Wye Plantation.

Prodi admits failure in bid to form new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout, edits to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Premier Romano Prodi on Thursday gave up on
his bid to form a new government, informing President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro that his political negotiations had failed.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old center-left government collapsed last
Friday in a failed vote of confidence after losing the support of
the hard-line Communist Refoundation Party.
	   With pressure on Italy to pass a cost-cutting 1999 budget
meeting requirements of the European common currency, Scalfaro had
asked Prodi to make a stab at forming a new government.
	   But Prodi said Thursday that ``my assignment proved
impossible.''
	   Scalfaro can now ask someone else to try to form a government or
he can call early elections. Most observers think elections are
unlikely.
	   ``I hope Italy will soon have a stable government and a cohesive
majority,'' Prodi told reporters after his meeting with the
president.
	   Prodi headed Italy's 55th government since World War II and, at
2 1/2 years, its second longest-lasting.
	   The premier had been looking to a small center-right party with
29 votes to help him put together a new majority. But the
Democratic Union for the Republic, led by ex-president Francesco
Cossiga, rejected his overtures on Wednesday night.
	   Many political observers are speculating that Scalfaro might now
turn to an apolitical premier to shepherd through the budget and
the debut of the euro, the common European currency.
	   But he could also opt to give someone a shot at hammering
together a new political majority. Speculation on this front
centers on Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democratic Left, the
largest party in Prodi's old coalition.

Report: Citigroup seeks tie up with two major Japanese banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES name of newspaper, 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Citigroup Inc., the United States' largest
financial services company, will begin talks this month on a
securities business tie-up with two major Japanese banks, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Citigroup hopes to forge a link with an existing alliance of two
so-called city banks in Japan, Asahi Bank Ltd. and Tokai Bank Ltd.,
to develop and sell mutual funds in the Japanese market, the
newspaper Tokyo Shimbun said, without citing named sources.
	   It said an agreement could be reached as soon as early next
year.
	   But spokesmen for Asahi Bank and Tokai Bank denied the report,
saying no talks on a tie-up with Citigroup are planned.
	   The report comes amid a series of similar alliances between
foreign and Japanese financial institutions triggered by the recent
deregulation of Japan's banking, brokerage and insurance
industries.
	   Earlier this month, Wall Street investment bank J.P. Morgan and
Co. said it would set up a Tokyo-based mutual fund business with
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., one of Japan's largest lenders.
	   Prudential Insurance Co. and Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. agreed
in July to open a joint mutual fund company. Earlier this year,
Merrill Lynch and Fidelity Investments Co. both announced plans to
set up separate nationwide retail networks in Japan.
	   Citigroup is the product of a merger announced in April between
Citicorp and the Travelers Group Inc. _ which bought Nikko
Securities Co., Japan's third-largest brokerage house, in June.
	   In September, Asahi Bank and Tokai Bank announced their decision
to join hands in fields such as private banking and mutual fund
marketing. They also plan to purchase shares of one another and
eventually set up a joint holding company.
	   A deal with Citigroup would expand the New York-based financial
giant's access to an estimated dlrs 9 trillion pool of personal
financial assets held by Japanese savers and investors.
	   Tokyo-based Asahi Bank has 429 offices worldwide, employs 12,688
people and has total deposits of 20.4 trillion yen (dlrs 172
billion).
	   Tokai Bank, based in Nagoya, western Japan, has 303 offices
worldwide, employs 11,407 people and has total deposits of 19.9
trillion yen (dlrs 167 billion).

Parliament approves army commander Emile Lahoud as president

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Parliament on Thursday formally elected
Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing
of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.
	   Lahoud is to be sworn for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day
President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
	   In a rare unanimous vote, all 118 legislators voted in favor of
Lahoud. They included three legislators who had hoped for the job
themselves.
	   Ten legislators were absent, including Druse leader Walid
Jumblatt who opposed the choice of a military officer for president
and eight members of his Parliament bloc. The other missing
legislator was Omar Karami, a former prime minister who has been
boycotting Parliament.
	   Later, as protocol dictates, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri
personally informed Lahoud of his election.
	   The two hugged at the Central Military Club on Beirut's
waterfront before they traveled to the Presidential Palace for a
meeting with Hrawi.
	   ``We are grateful,'' Lahoud said to journalists as he waved his
fist in the air outside his quarters at the club. The media-shy
general _ who traded his military camouflage uniform for a
double-breasted navy blue suit on Thursday _ made no other
comments.
	   Upon hearing of news, which was broadcast live on television, an
army officer at the club popped the cork on a bottle of champagne.
	   Cookies were distributed to motorists on the street outside.
	   Elsewhere in the city, Lahoud supporters drove in convoys
through the streets, honking and waving flags and pictures of the
general in uniform.
	   His election continues to respect the tradition in Lebanon's
sectarian-based political system that the president is a Maronite,
the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a
Shiite Muslim.
	   Lahoud, 62, won the backing of a public fed up with bickering
and corrupt politicians who have ruled Lebanon since the end of the
devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   And he won the all-important approval from Syrian President
Hafez Assad, whose country is the main power broker in Lebanon.
	   The general, a naval officer trained in Britain and the United
States, also overcame constitutional hurdles and concerns among
politicians about the ascent of a military man to the nation's
highest office.
	   Many hope the general will reform the government as he did the
army, a 55,000-strong disciplined force rebuilt to more than twice
its 1990 size.
	   Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion in the
civil-war fractured military, is credited with ending political and
religious interference in the military _ influences which have
continued to wrack the postwar government.
	   Lahoud was essentially drafted for the job of head of state.
While other candidates openly sought the backing of Parliament
members, politicians and Syria, Lahoud remained silent as his
supporters worked on his behalf.
	   A media shy scion of a prominent Maronite family, Lahoud could
not speak for his candidacy because of rules dictating that the
army commander stay out of politics.
	   To get around a constitutional provision barring senior public
servants from the presidency, the Parliament passed legislation
Tuesday allowing it ``for once, and exceptionally.''
	   Thursday's vote signified widespread support for the general
that cut through sectarian lines in the half-Muslim, half-Christian
legislature.
	   It was the first balloting for a head of state in peacetime
since the 1970 election of Suleiman Franjieh. Five presidents were
elected during the civil war, including Hrawi in 1989. Of these,
Bashir Gemayel was assassinated in a 1982 bomb explosion before he
took office and Rene Mouawad was killed in a bombing shortly after
he took over in 1989.
	   Hrawi's term was lengthened to nine years by a constitutional
exception approved by Parliament three years ago.

Air force details jets in its forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fighter jets make up 38 percent of the planes in
Russia's air force, which is scheduled to be modernized in
November, the Interfax news agency reported Thursday.
	   Bombers make up 28 percent of the air force, while strike planes
make up 28 percent, Interfax said, citing the air force's main
headquarters.
	   The air force plans to modernize many of its jets in November, a
move that would involve purchasing new versions of the twin-engine
MiG-29 fighter jet, a mainstay of the Russian air force.
	   Funding shortages have crippled Russia's air force since the
fall of the Soviet Union. The air force cannot maintain its fleet
and pilots are rarely given enough time to practice.
	   Only about half of all Russian fighter jets are in flying shape,
the rest being grounded for ``technical reasons,'' air force
officials have said.

New Amsterdam crackdown targets dogs _ and humans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Answering the call of nature has
become a crime in the Dutch capital for dogs _ and humans _ who
dare to do their thing in public places.
	   The Amsterdam police force announced fines this week as part of
an ambitious crackdown on pet owners who don't clean up after their
dogs, and on people who don't behave much better than canines.
	   Dog owners face fines of 75 guilders (dlrs 40) if they're caught
letting their pets foul the sidewalks. The fine for people who
urinate in public is a bit less: 60 guilders (dlrs 32.50).
	   And for those citizens tempted to express their indignation by
lifting a finger in the direction of an officer, there's also a new
fine for insulting a policeman: 250 guilders (dlrs 135).
	   The fines, which took effect Tuesday, were detailed in
``Streetwise,'' a manual mailed to the homes of all 5,000 Amsterdam
police officers. The crackdown also slaps motorists who run red
lights with a 50-guilder (dlrs 27) fine, and subjects people who
put their garbage out on the street a day early to a penalty of 150
guilders (dlrs 80).
	   Bewildered capital prosecutors said they hadn't been consulted
and expressed concerns that the crackdown would further burden an
already clogged judicial system.
	   Amsterdammers, meanwhile, have been flooding police headquarters
with calls expressing outrage and fears that the new fines will
violate the spirit of traditional Dutch tolerance.
	   ``People are calling like crazy, asking whether we've launched a
witchhunt,'' said police spokesman Klaas Wilting. ``That's
certainly not the case. Everything is at the officers'
discretion.''

Tatars remember siege by Ivan the Terrible's troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tatars rallied in the central Russian city of
Kazan on Thursday to remember those killed during the siege of
their city by Czar Ivan the Terrible's troops in 1552.
	   The demonstrators later attended a memorial service in the Kazan
Kremlin led by Tatar Mufti Gusman-hadhret, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   ``Let the day of memory prod us into doing good things in memory
of our ancestors, help strengthen civil peace and accord, and
establish social justice,'' the Tatar Public Center said in a
statement.
	   Local residents are restoring the mosque of Kul Sharif, which
was ruined in the siege. It is expected to re-open in 2000.
	   Ivan the Terrible built the landmark, onion-domed St. Basil's
Cathedral outside the walls of the Moscow Kremlin to commemorate
the Russian victory over the Tatars.

Former Festina masseur Voet files suit against Virenque
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ In the escalating war of words between
members of the Festina cycling team, lawyers for ex-masseur Willy
Voet on Thursday filed a libel suit against star cyclist Richard
Virenque.
	   The action was taken during a meeting called by Patrick Keil,
the Lille judge who has been investigating the use of banned doping
substances at Festina since the team was thrown out of the
scandal-plagued Tour de France.
	   Voet, Virenque and Festina team doctor Eric Ryckaert were each
questioned at the meeting.
	   Voet's lawyer Jean-Louis Bessis accused Virenque of making
libelous accusations and adopting a hostile attitude during the
meeting.
	   Virenque already has been in a dispute with his former
teammates.
	   Voet and Ryckaert both recognize the use of banned doping
products at Festina, but Virenque still denies he knowingly took
such substances.

World Bank grants Ukraine dlrs 200 million and discusses new loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The World Bank has granted the Ukrainian
capital a dlrs 200 million loan to modernize its electricity and
heating systems, a news agency said Thursday.
	   The agreement was signed in Washington on Wednesday, where a
delegation of top Kiev officials was proposing projects to U.S.
investors, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The 20-year loan will finance most of a dlrs 309 million
electricity and heating system renovation project, with the rest of
the funds to be supplied by the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and Ukrainian companies.
	   In a related development Thursday, the Ukrainian Finance
Ministry said it has almost reached agreement with the World Bank
over a new dlrs 120 million loan to support Ukrainian exports.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Serhiy Makatsaria said the loan would be
directed primarily at agricultural exports, which were seriously
hurt by the fallout in Ukraine from Russia's economic crisis.
	   The World Bank and International Monetary Fund suspended
cooperation with Ukraine earlier this year over the country's
stalled economic reforms. The World Bank resumed ties with Ukraine
last month, lending the former Soviet republic dlrs 950 million for
several projects.
	   Ukraine has received more than dlrs 1 billion from the World
Bank since it became a member in 1992.

NATO plans to send Solana, top allied commanders to Belgrade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to fix typos, coding &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; With BRU101 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO was planning on Thursday to send
Javier Solana, its secretary general, and two top commanders to
Belgrade to sign an air surveillance deal for Kosovo, part of a
peace accord for the Serbian province.
	   ``I may be going this afternoon or this evening to finalize the
agreement,'' Solana told reporters at the NATO headquarters.
	   The NATO ambassadors were debating the composition of the
alliance delegation.
	   They also considered sending NATO's top military commander in
Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Klaus Naumann, a German general
who heads NATO's panel of chiefs of staffs from the 16 alliance
nations.
	   Solana reiterated Milosevic was still not complying with the
accord, forged this week by U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke,
for Belgrade to withdraw troops from Kosovo, begin peace talks with
ethnic Albanians and allow 2,000 monitors into the province.
	   ``The information that we have is that that compliance is still
not a reality ... although some efforts have been made,'' Solana
said.
	   ``I will send (Milosevic) a very clear message. And that is that
the solution to the problem (in Kosovo) is not signing papers but
to comply with agreements that have been achieved.''
	   He said troops were not being withdrawn fast enough for refugees
to feel confident they can return home.
	   ``It is very important for (refugees) to return to their
villages. For that, compliance with the withdrawal of troops is
very, very important. We'll keep our eyes and ears open.''
	   His comments contrasted with those made on Wednesday by U.S.
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin who gave an upbeat
appraisal of Yugoslav compliance with its commitments.
	   Rubin said American and European monitoring teams in Kosovo
reported a much smaller Serb police presence in the Kosovo
countryside than on Sunday.
	   On Wednesday, NATO officials said the alliance would likely keep
in place its Oct. 13 airstrikes order beyond Saturday, the deadline
for compliance with the Kosovo peace accord.
	   In addition to allowing 2,000 peace monitors on the ground,
Belgrade must let unarmed NATO spy planes into the airspace over
Kosovo to check on compliance with the agreement from the air.
	   NATO planned to use high-flying eye-in-the-sky planes such as
U-2s and P3 Orion aircraft.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has been
asked to provide the 2,000 ``compliance verifiers.''

OSCE says Belgrade should stop its ``war'' against Serbian media
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The Belgrade government should cease its
``war'' against independent media in Yugoslavia and adhere to
international standards on media freedom, an international envoy
said Thursday.
	   Feimut Duve, the special envoy for media of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said Yugoslav and Serb
authorities were ignoring international warnings and instead
imposing even more stringent curbs on freedom of expression.
	   In a radio interview, Duve called on Belgrade ``to stop the war
against independent media in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   Duve called for an end to restrictions on the retransmission of
foreign radio programs in the Serbian language and for allowing
foreign and Yugoslav correspondents to report freely from Kosovo.
	   Duve planned to visit Yugoslavia in September to discuss media
freedom with Yugoslav and Serbian authorities but was himself
denied a visa.
	   Late Tuesday, Serbian police closed two independent newspapers
-- Dnevni Telegraf and Danas -- saying their recent reports on NATO
threats violated a broad, vaguely worded ban on unpatriotic
behavior.
	   On Saturday, the authorities shut down Belgrade's Index Radio,
citing its lack of broadcast license. Index and other members of
the Association of Independent Electronic Media have for years been
denied licenses, giving the government the leverage to shut down
any of them when they become critical of authorities.
	   The decree against unpatriotic behavior was issued last week and
applies to individuals, businesses and institutions alike. Open to
interpretation and misuse, it was presented as necessary at a time
of possible attack from abroad.
	   Yugoslav authorities say foreign and independent media reports
of Serb actions in Kosovo have aggravated the crisis in Kosovo and
that reports of NATO threats and developments surrounding them
could cause widespread alarm.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Thursday
ordered the government and its agencies to start settling their
huge outstanding bills, a problem that has paralyzed the Russian
economy.
	   The Cabinet discussed the measures a week ago and was scheduled
to finalize them Thursday. But Primakov abruptly canceled the
Cabinet meeting, saying the proposals were already clear and needed
to be implemented.
	   ``We have had enough discussions, we now must act,'' spokesman
Igor Shchegolev quoted him as saying.
	   The plan worked out by the economics and finance ministries
would require the government and state-owned companies to clear
their mutual debts of some 50 billion rubles (dlrs 3.8 billion) by
mid-December.
	   The cash-strapped government has been a major debtor in the
Russian economy, failing to pay wages and pensions to workers and
other bills to state-run companies. The workers and companies then
cannot pay their bills, leading to a chain of non-payments that is
disabling Russian industries.
	   Officials admit that the unpaid bills among the government and
the state-owned companies and organizations are small compared to
those in the private sector. They estimate all debts in Russia
total a staggering 1.2 trillion rubles (dlrs 92 billion), or about
40 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
	   Primakov has said the government bills must be settled without
printing new money, a move that would lead to high inflation.
However, he has not said where the money will come from and it is
likely that many of the debts will be settled through barter or
other non-cash transactions.
	   The government has also reached agreement with the natural gas
monopoly Gazprom, Russia's largest company, to pay its overdue
taxes. Gazprom has dragged its feet on the payments, citing the
government's failure to pay for gas supplies.
	   Gazprom will pay 3.5 billion rubles (dlrs 260 million) in taxes
this month, and 4.5 billion rubles (dlrs 333 million) in November,
the deputy head of board, Pyotr Rodionov said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   In other economic news Thursday:
	   _ Russia will continue talks with the United States in the next
few days on receiving grain and other foods on long-term credit and
as a humanitarian aid. Leonid Cheshinsky, head of a state-run
company in charge of grain imports gave no details, but said that
the conditions would be ``extremely beneficial'' for Russia. With
food imports falling sharply, and the grain harvest likely to be
the worst in 40 years, the government is building up emergency food
reserves.
	   _ Russia's hard currency reserves rose from dlrs 12.8 billion to
dlrs 13.3 billion in the week ending Oct. 9, the Central Bank said.
The bank has been actively buying dollars in recent weeks to
strengthen its reserves depleted at the start of the crisis.
	   _ Russian stocks rose on healthy volume, with the Russian
Trading System up 14.16 percent to 59.24 points.
	   _ Inflation for the first 12 days of October was 0.8 percent,
after soaring last month following the ruble's sharp plunge.
Average daily price increases were 0.066 percent this month,
compared with 1.09 percent in September, the State Statistics
Committee said.
	   _ Parliament's upper chamber set up a panel to investigate the
previous government's Aug. 17 decision to devalue the ruble and
default on its domestic debt. Primakov and other officials said the
move was a grave mistake.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ An Okinawan high school student has died of
injuries from a hit-and-run accident in which a U.S. Marine has
been charged, raising fears of renewed tensions on the island
between residents and the American military.
	   At the center of the controversy is a 1995 agreement between the
United States and Japan on the handover to Japanese authorities of
American servicemen suspected of ``heinous crimes'' such as murder
and rape, even before they are officially charged.
	   That agreement stemmed from the rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan
schoolgirl in which three U.S. servicemen were convicted. That rape
set off an outburst of anger on the island, 1,600 kilometers (1,000
miles) southwest of Tokyo, where most of the American troops in
Japan are based.
	   U.S. Marine Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge, 23, of La Porte, Indiana,
a flight equipment technician, is suspected of driving the car that
struck 18-year-old Yuki Uema's small motorcycle Oct. 7, then
fleeing the scene, the Marines said. She died late Wednesday from
head injuries, police said.
	   Although the Japanese government decided not to demand
Eskridge's handover prior to his indictment, Okinawa wanted the
handover, Okinawan official Hitoshi Kugai said.
	   ``We view this as a very serious, evil crime,'' Kugai said in a
telephone interview Thursday, adding that many Okinawans don't want
the U.S. military to decide what constitutes a heinous crime.
	   Since the hit and run, there have been demonstrations on Okinawa
demanding that the agreement on handing over suspects be reworked.
	   ``If the Marines are good neighbors, they should have
voluntarily cooperated with our desires,'' Kugai said.
	   Marine spokesman Capt. Bret Curtis said the hit and run was not
a heinous crimes as defined by the agreement. The Marines refused
to hand over Eskridge when the Okinawa police demanded it last
week.
	   Eskridge was charged Tuesday with hit and run, driving under the
influence of alcohol and causing injury through professional
negligence. He was handed over the same day.
	   ``It can't be forgiven as a mistake,'' Uema's father, Tomihiro
Katsuren, was quoted as saying by The Ryukyu Shimpo, an Okinawan
newspaper, as he brought her body home from the hospital. ``She was
always determined and went after what she had her heart set on.''
	   The Marines have repeatedly expressed their condolences to
Uema's family.
	   ``This is a tragic, needless loss,'' said Lt. Gen. Frank
Libutti, commander of Marine Corps bases in Japan. ``We know there
is little we can say to ease the Uema family's tremendous grief and
pain, but we are very sorry.''

Report: 500 investors protest financial losses in central China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ About 500 investors who said they were cheated
out of their money by real estate developers demonstrated Thursday
in the central China city of Wuhan, a human rights group reported.
	   The crowd gathered outside a commercial building they had
invested in, and police dispersed the demonstrators in the
afternoon because they were tying up traffic, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. There
were no arrests, it added.
	   The Nanxi Real Estate Development Co. and three other companies
offered high interest rates in newspaper advertisements to build a
28-story commercial building, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center reported.
	   About 1,000 city residents invested 55 million yuan (dlrs 6.6
million), but the companies went bankrupt and scaled back their
plans, making the building only five stories tall, and investors
lost money, the report said.
	   It said the demonstrators had tried holding the government
responsible, but failed to win any compensation.

<TEXT>
	   Here are some excerpts from Pope John Paul II's encyclical
``Fides et Ratio'' (``Faith and Reason), which was released by the
Vatican Thursday:
	   ____
	   PERENNIAL QUESTIONS:
	   ``... a cursory glance at ancient history shows clearly how in
different parts of the world, with their different cultures, there
arise at the same time the fundamental questions which pervade
human life: Who am I? Where have I come from and where am I going?
Why is there evil? What is there after this life? ... In fact, the
answer to these questions decides the direction which people seek
to give to their lives.''
	   ____
	   TRUTH:
	   ``... at the present time in particular, the search for ultimate
truth seems often to be neglected. ... Recent times have seen the
rise to prominence of various doctrines which tend to devalue even
the truths which had been judged certain. A legitimate plurality of
positions has yielded to an undifferentiated pluralism, based upon
the assumption that all positions are equally valid, which is one
of today's most widespread symptoms of the lack of confidence in
truth.''
	   ____
	   NIHILISM:
	   ``As a philosophy of nothingness, it has a certain attraction
for people of our time ... Nihilism is at the root of the
widespread mentality which claims that a definitive commitment
should no longer be made, because everything is fleeting and
provisional.
	   ____
	   POSTMODERNITY:
	   ``According to some of them, the time of certainties is
irrevocably past, and the human being must now learn to live in a
horizon of total absence of meaning, where everything is
provisional and ephemeral.''
	   ____
	   SCIENTISTS:
	   ``I would urge them to continue their efforts without even
abandoning the sapiential horizon within which scientific and
technological achievements are wedded to the philosophical and
ethical values which are the distinctive and indelible mark of the
human being.''

Philippine President Estrada tells Anwar not to waver

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Thursday that arrested Malaysian dissident leader Anwar
Ibrahim, whom he considers a personal friend, should not waver in
his fight for reforms.
	   Estrada said this was the message he gave Anwar's eldest
daughter, Nurul Izzah, to pass on to the ousted Malaysian deputy
prime minister.
	   ``I am just telling Izzah here to tell her father not to waver
because he is fighting for a cause, the cause of the Malaysian
people,'' Estrada told reporters.
	   ``This is a trial that he has to face. I am very hopeful and
sure that ... Anwar Ibrahim will triumph in the end,'' Estrada
added.
	   He said he was giving personal moral support, but not
interfering in the internal problems of Malaysia.
	   ``As I have said, human rights and due process transcend all
boundaries and this is a universal concept that must be respected
not only by people but all leaders of the world,'' Estrada said.
	   Press undersecretary Ike Gutierrez stressed that Estrada was
stating ``his personal position and that this is not the official
stand of the government.''
	   Estrada and Anwar's daughter, who arrived late Wednesday, talked
for 20 minutes in the hurriedly arranged meeting at Estrada's
private residence in suburban San Juan.
	   ``I just want to thank him for his support ... and the Filipino
people for their support. I appreciate it greatly,'' said Nurul
Izzah, 18, a first-year engineering student.
	   She said her father has lost a lot of weight, ``but he is in
high spirits, so I am very thankful for that.''
	   Before boarding a flight to Singapore, Nurul Izzah told
reporters that she was given permission by her father to visit
Manila.
	   She said she was returning to Singapore ``because my father
wanted to see us.''
	   Estrada has made a number of public statements about Anwar's
Sept. 20 arrest and subsequent beatings while in police custody.
Chastising a neighboring country is unusual in Southeast Asia,
where governments customarily avoid mutual criticisms.
	   Estrada was the first leader of a member of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations to express concern for the jailed Malaysian
dissident.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has also expressed concern
over Anwar's treatment. Habibie and Estrada met Tuesday night on an
Indonesian island near Singapore specifically to discuss Anwar's
arrest and how they should respond.
	   The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are among the founders
of ASEAN, which also includes Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Singapore,
Thailand, and Vietnam.
	   Estrada has said he has not yet decided whether he will attend
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit to be held next month
in Malaysia.
	   ``He said the APEC meeting is separate from the issue of Anwar,
particularly his personal stand on the issue,'' Gutierrez said.
	   Nurul Izzah handed over a letter from her mother, Azizah Ismail,
Gutierrez said.
	   ``Thank you for all the support that you have extended to us all
this while following the illegal arrest of my husband and the
oppression put on to him by the authorities here,'' Azizah said in
the letter.
	   She asked Estrada to help her daughter return immediately and
safely to Malaysia because Anwar had asked for an ``urgent
meeting'' with his family Thursday after he was transferred to a
detention camp outside Kuala Lumpur.
	   In Malaysia, Azizah said Anwar was in ``high spirits'' when she
told him about the reception their daughter had received in Manila.
	   Gutierrez said Estrada is ``thinking of writing a personal
letter'' to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to ask that
Anwar be held in house arrest during his upcoming trial on
corruption and sexual misconduct charges. Anwar has denied the
charges, calling them politically motivated.
	   Gutierrez also said Anwar's daughter met earlier with former
President Corazon Aquino, who had expressed her own ``personal
moral support'' for Anwar.

Chechnya begins forming own constitutional court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Breakaway Chechnya has started forming its own
constitutional court, and judges are expected to be appointed next
week, an official said Thursday.
	   A parliamentary commission has begun selecting candidates, and
nominees are expected to be approved at the legislature's session
on Tuesday, parliament speaker Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev was quoted as
saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Chechnya's previous constitutional court was disbanded by the
separatist republic's first president, Dzhokhar Dudayev, after
judges objected to his order to suspend the parliament's work.
	   The new constitutional court will begin its work by reviewing
demands by opposition field commanders for President Aslan
Maskhadov's resignation. The court is charged with interpreting and
upholding Chechnya's constitution.
	   One of the opposition leaders, Shamil Basayev, declared on
national television that Maskhadov is ``constantly betraying''
Chechnya's interests by negotiating with Russia, Interfax reported
Thursday.
	   ``The people cannot be expected to abide by the law when the
president is allowed to treat the constitution as he pleases,''
Basayev added during the television appearance Wednesday.
	   Chechnya maintains it is an independent state and has been
running its own affairs _ often in open defiance of Moscow _ since
Russia pulled out its troops in 1996. No country, including Russia,
has recognized its independence.

Hong Kong protesters continue hunger strike for second day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa on
Thursday urged a group of hunger strikers who wanted to force him
out of office for his handling of the economy to express their
views ``in more constructive ways.''
	   But the seven activists who began the protest Wednesday said
they would not budge. Organizer Tsang Kin-shing, a former
legislator, said, ``Tung should try to come up with more
constructive ways to save Hong Kong.''
	   The activists set up a booth in the teeming commercial district
of Tsim Sha Tsui to protest Tung's policy address last week, which
they criticized as short on relief for citizens coping with the
recession.
	   Tung told a news conference the protesters ``should take care of
their health, and use more constructive channels to give us their
advice.''
	   ``Hong Kong is a free society, and citizens can use all sorts of
action to express their views,'' he said before departing for a
visit to Beijing, where he planned to discuss various Hong Kong
economic and political issues with Chinese leaders.
	   ``We are facing a big challenge from the financial crisis,'' he
said. ``We are walking on a painful path and, in the short run, we
will experience more pain.''
	   Asked whether he would seek Beijing's help, Tung said, ``Hong
Kong has to handle its own affairs.''
	   Tung has praised Beijing's support as the territory rides out
the economic downturn. Beijing has reiterated it would stand by
Hong Kong, and that it would not devalue its currency, the yuan.
	   Analysts have warned a yuan devaluation would put enormous
strain on the Hong Kong dollar's currency link to the U.S. dollar.
	   Public confidence in the government has plunged since Hong Kong
was swept into the protracted regional contagion last October.
	   On Thursday, the hunger strikers, including four city
councilors, sat under a banner saying, ``Tung Chee-hwa must step
down to calm the citizens' anger.''
	   Wearing red banners reading ``Unforgivable sin,'' the protesters
said they had collected about 2,000 signatures in protest against
Tung's government.
	   Tsang said they would keep up the hunger strike as their bodies
could stand it.
	   Tung said he would stay in China with his wife for his first
vacation since taking office in July 1997, when China regained
sovereignty over Hong Kong from Britain.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italian Premier Romano Prodi on Thursday gave up on
his bid to form a new government, informing President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro that his political negotiations had failed.
	   Scalfaro can now ask someone else to try to form a government or
he can call early elections. Most observers think elections are
unlikely.
	   The president planned to start political party consultations
later Thursday aimed at finding a new candidate for premier. They
were scheduled to run through midday Friday.
	   Many political observers are speculating that Scalfaro might now
turn to an apolitical premier to shepherd through the budget and
the debut of the euro, the common European currency.
	   But he could also opt to give someone a shot at hammering
together a new political majority. Speculation on this front
centers on Massimo D'Alema, 49, the leader of the Democratic Left,
the largest party in Prodi's Olive Tree coalition.
	   Other potential candidates are Senate speaker Nicola Mancino,
67, or lower house speaker Luciano Violante, 57. Both were elected
as part of Olive Tree.
	   Mancino had been a member of the Christian Democrat Party, which
was destroyed by corruption scandals. Violante began his political
life with the old Italian Communist Party and now belongs to
Democratic Left.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old center-left government collapsed last
Friday in a failed vote of confidence after losing the support of
the hard-line Communist Refoundation Party.
	   With pressure on Italy to pass a cost-cutting 1999 budget
meeting requirements of the European common currency, Scalfaro had
asked Prodi to make a stab at forming a new government.
	   But Prodi said Thursday that ``my assignment proved
impossible.''
	   Prodi headed Italy's 55th government since World War II and, at
2 1/2 years, its second longest-lasting.
	   ``I hope Italy will soon have a stable government,'' Prodi told
reporters after his meeting with the president.
	   The premier had been looking to a small center-right party with
29 votes to help him put together a new majority. But the
Democratic Union for the Republic, led by ex-president Francesco
Cossiga, rejected his overtures on Wednesday night.

Alleged drug traffickers battle Thai police with hand grenades
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police killed one suspected drug
trafficker and arrested three others after a two-hour gunfight in
which the suspects used assault rifles and hand grenades, an
officer said Thursday.
	   Four officers and three civilians were seriously wounded by one
of two grenades thrown by the suspects in Wednesday night's clash
on the outskirts of Bangkok, said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The suspects also used M-16 automatic rifles in battling about
50 police officers called to the confrontation, which started
Wednesday evening at a police roadblock set up after a tip from a
local resident that one of his neighbors was making amphetamines.
	   Two men stepped out of their pickup truck as it was about to be
searched and one fired two shots at a police officer before
fleeing.
	   The two ran to a house where the other two suspects were
staying, and battled the police reinforcements who came to help the
first officer, who was wounded.
	   Police returned to the scene Thursday after the fighting and,
with the help of drug-sniffing dogs, found almost 800,000
amphetamine tablets.
	   The country's interior minister, meanwhile, was quoted as
proposing that convicted drug traffickers on death row be executed
immediately to deter others from entering the illegal business.
	   ``If we want the death penalty to have an obvious effect, it
should be done right away,'' Sanan Kachornprasart, who is also
deputy prime minister, was quoted as saying by the Bangkok Post.
	   Criminals sentenced to death can petition for royal clemency or
ask that their sentence be commuted to life in prison. Only a few
have been executed in the past decade. A change in the law last
year made trafficking in amphetamines a capital crime, as was
already the case with heroin.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with refugees getting aid, accusing Serbs of
intimidation, Serb accusations of ethnic Albanian ambushes &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A wary NATO and world leaders kept
up the pressure Thursday on President Slobodan Milosevic over
Kosovo, where they said he needs to withdraw more Serb forces by
Saturday's deadline.
	   About halfway through the four-day grace period given Milosevic
to show he's met international demands on ending Kosovo turmoil,
NATO's chief said the Yugoslav leader was making progress toward
compliance but still had a ways to go. That came amid new
accusations by refugees of Serb police intimidation.
	   The alliance planned to send its secretary-general, Javier
Solana, and two top commanders to Belgrade to sign an air
surveillance deal for Kosovo and reinforce that he is not yet
complying with the accord reached this week with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   ``I would send a very clear message'' to Milosevic, Solana said
Thursday in Brussels, Belgium. ``And that is that the solution to
the problem is not signing papers but to comply with agreements
that have been achieved.''
	   International officials also gathered in Paris and Vienna on
Thursday as part of the assessment process to make sure Milosevic
is keeping his word.
	   In Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency delivered more aid to those
displaced by the crackdown in the secessionist Serbian province,
which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   In the town of Kisna Reka, refugees living in a makeshift camp
of 3,000 people in a nearby gully carted off 50-kilogram
(110-pound) sacks of flour, bags of clothing, cooking oil and other
supplies delivered by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Asked how long they could stay in the woods, a man who gave his
name only as Rexhep said: ``Until we die. We don't know how much we
can take. We are afraid to go back.''
	   Efforts to restore more stability to Kosovo moved forward.
	   Two top NATO commanders _ U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Germany's
Klaus Naumann, chairman of the alliance's military committee _ were
expected to fly to Belgrade along with Solana later Thursday.
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia met for several hours in Paris.
	   Later, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
was set to approve the verification mission it will oversee in
Kosovo. The move will authorize Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek, the OSCE chairman, to sign an agreement on the mission
with Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade on Friday.
	   The verification mission was a key part of the deal struck
Monday by Holbrooke with Milosevic to end his seven-month crackdown
on Kosovo Albanians.
	   Western nations were discussing naming Jacques Klein, the
American deputy to Bosnia's top international mediator Carlos
Westendorp, as head of the 2,000-person mission _ to be composed
largely of Europeans.
	   Britain has pledged to contribute 200 people to the verification
force, and both Russia and Germany are expected to make similar
contributions. But it's expected to take weeks to organize the OSCE
force.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement, which put off the
threat of impending airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   But many remain in hiding or refuse to return to their homes,
fearing reprisals from Serb special police who have torched their
villages and been accused of atrocities.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's crackdown.
	   At Kisna Reka, the refugees complained that Serbian security
forces fired machine guns, mortars and other weapons throughout the
night, apparently to intimidate them from planning a return to
their villages.
	   ``There's nobody there'' in the villages, said Fatmir Nuhaj, 27,
his arms wrapped around his young son's shoulders. ``It's only to
keep us from our homes.''
	   They complained that unarmed monitors will do them no good.
	   The Serbs, for their part, complain that the Kosovo Liberation
Army is continuing attacks on police in the province.
	   A Serb police source who declined to give his name said three
policemen were wounded Wednesday and another one Thursday when they
were ambushed on a major Kosovo road, some 30 kilometers (20 miles)
west of the capital Pristina.
	   Among the demands Milosevic must meet by Saturday, the one in
which he appears to be the furthest from compliance is withdrawal
of his forces to levels before the crackdown began on Feb. 28.
	   A NATO official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Wednesday that some Yugoslav units remained in Kosovo. He declined
to say how many but said they far exceed the level required by
NATO.

Borg advances in Champions tennis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Bjorn Borg overcame a tenacious
challenge from Australian Wally Masur to win their second-round
match at the Champions senior tennis tournament Thursday.
	   The Swedish winner of 11 grand slam titles raced away with the
first set and won the deciding tie-break set for a 6-2, 3-6, 10-6
victory.
	   Masur, 35, was playing his first match against the 42-year-old
Borg and was unable to keep pace early in the match.
	   ``I was bleeding to death slowly through the first set,'' Masur
said. ``If I can't beat Borg now, I guess I'll never beat him. I'm
just glad to be on the same court as one of the great athletes of
the century.''
	   Borg will play the winner of Friday's match between South
African Johan Kriek and Frenchman Henri Leconte. Kriek beat John
Fitzgerald 6-2, 6-3 earlier Thursday.

Taylor and Langer put Australia on top
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with play until stumps. CHANGES overline &QL; 
 &UR; By Rizwan Ali &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Mark Taylor cracked a century, while
Justin Langer was just three runs away from his maiden Test hundred
as play ended on the first day of the second Test with Australia a
strong 224 for the loss of one wicket Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   Bad light ended the day's play 21 overs early.
	   Taylor was unbeaten on 112 while Langer was unconquered on 97.
Taylor had hit 13 boundaries with some strong drives on either side
of the wickets. At the wicket for well over six hours, Taylor's
innings came off 240 balls.
	   Langer, who brought up his 50 in 68 balls with six boundaries,
batted resolutely afterward, but hit only three more boundaries
during his 156-ball patient unbeaten 97.
	   Sloppy fielding helped Taylor score his fourth Test hundred
against the home team -- his first in Pakistan. His previous three
hundreds against Pakistan -- 123, 101 not out and 100 -- all were
scored in Australia.
	   Pakistan's young pace duo of Mohammad Zahid and Shoaib Akhtar
bowled with lot of venom early in the first session, but once both
the left-handers settled down, Pakistan struggled to find the
breakthrough.
	   Skipper Aamir Sohail rotated his bowlers in short spells and
also turned his arm over for 12 overs with his left-arm spin, but
the two Australian batsmen stayed the course.
	   Earlier, after electing to bat first, Australia lost opener
Michael Slater (2) in the ninth over of the day when Akhtar had him
caught by Azhar Mahmood in the gully.
	   Pakistan was missing its star fast bowler Wasim Akram, who is
suffering a sore throat.
	   Akhtar in particular was quite quick and accurate in his opening
first five overs in which he gave away only five runs and was
rewarded with the one wicket. Although Zahid matched his partner,
he bowled a number of no balls, including three in succession in
his third over.
	   Pakistan made four team changes after its opening Test loss in
Rawalpindi. Akram made way for Zahid, while off-spinner Saqlain
Mushtaq was replaced by Akhtar. Yousuf Youhanna and Ijaz Ahmed were
included in the side to replace Mohammad Hussain and Mohammad
Wasim.
	   Australia made only one change from the team which recorded its
first victory on Pakistan soil after 39 years. Darren Lehmann, who
was not fully recovered from a groin injury, was replaced by
middle-order batsman Ricky Ponting.

Hand transplant patient calls procedure a `miracle'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN PHILLIPS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Saying he could wiggle his new fingers _ but
declining to do so for the cameras _ a man who underwent the first
hand transplant in decades said Thursday the operation was ``a
miracle.''
	   ``My hand is very fine,'' said 48-year-old Clint Hallam of New
Zealand. ``I've probably never been so well in all my life.''
	   Hallam smiled through a 40-minute news conference at the Edouard
Herriot hospital in this southeastern French city, except when the
subject of his criminal past was brought up.
	   News reports say Hallam is due to appear before an Australian
court in January on seven fraud-related charges, relating to a
marketing investment scam allegedly worth Australian dlrs 1 million
(U.S. dlrs 620,000.)
	   Hallam was serving a two-year sentence for fraud in New Zealand
when the accident occurred in prison _ not, as Hallam originally
claimed, at a building construction site.
	   At the news conference, he wore a plaster cast up to his elbow,
and his arm was propped up on a large white splint. The skin on his
new hand appeared slightly wrinkled.
	   Twenty-two days after the 13-hour operation, doctors said Hallam
was doing fine.
	   ``Mr. Hallam is in an excellent condition after the operation
and is showing no signs of complications,'' said Dr. Jean-Michel
Dubernard, co-head of the transplant team.
	   After transplants, patients must take anti-rejection drugs,
which can prove fatal since they supress the immune system. That in
turn raises the risk of infection, or even cancer.
	   The only other known hand transplant was in Ecuador in the
1960s, and the patient's body rejected the hand after two weeks. A
Kentucky hospital is planning a to Hallam's.
	   For five years, doctors had tried to fully reattach Hallam's
hand after a 1984 chainsaw accident. In 1989, Hallam gave up and
had doctors amputate him at the upper forearm.
	   Asked if the new hand felt like his own, Hallam replied, ``Of
course it does.''
	   He said he could move his fingers, but declined to do so, saying
he didn't want to strain the nerves. He did lift the fingers with
his left hand.
	   Asked about the fraud allegations, Hallam said he was fighting
some of the charges. Dubernard told reporters the patient's legal
history was irrelevant.
	   ``In France, doctors don't normally ask patients for their penal
record before operating on them,'' the doctor said. He said the
patient had had been ``deeply affected'' by news reports
documenting his criminal record.
	   Doctors said they hoped Hallam would be able to return to
Australia in December. In the meantime, he will live near the
hospital and report daily for rehabilitation.
	   ``I must start all over again,'' Hallam said.

Cambodian opposition rejects accusations of trickery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's main opposition party on
Thursday denounced government suggestions that it was engaging in
trickery by demanding that a summit of party leaders be held
outside the country.
	   The two-party opposition and Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling
party have asked King Norodom Sihanouk to chair a summit after a
series of post-election talks by the three parties failed to
produce agreement on the next government.
	   But the opposition has asked Sihanouk to hold the summit outside
the country, suggesting the king's residence in Beijing. It says
intimidation from the ruling party and the threat of arrest make it
impossible to negotiate freely inside Cambodia.
	   Hun Sen's side has countered that the opposition's demand is a
trick to portray the ruling party to the international community as
hostile toward the opposition.
	   A senior official in Hun Sen's government repeated Thursday the
ruling party's stance that the summit should be held inside
Cambodia.
	   ``Cambodia is an independent sovereign country. We are able to
settle any problems inside our country,'' Cabinet Minister Sok An
said.
	   The FUNCINPEC party led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, citing Hun
Sen's threats to arrest opposition politicians after an alleged
attempt on his life, denied any trickery Thursday and insisted that
its leader's safety could not be guaranteed inside Cambodia.
	   The party added that it considered the king's residence in
Beijing, where the 75-year-old monarch often stays while receiving
medical treatment from his Chinese doctors, as sovereign Cambodian
territory.
	   In a statement, FUNCINPEC said it ``merely sought a neutral
venue with an objective toward solving the nation's grave current
crisis.''
	   Both parties have deferred the decision on a venue to the king,
but Sihanouk said Wednesday in a letter to Ranariddh that he could
not make the decision himself.
	   ``If there is no agreement from the three parties, Papa cannot
decide to do anything,'' the monarch wrote to Ranariddh, who is his
son.
	   Hun Sen's party won a July national election, capturing 64 of
122 seats in parliament, but fell short of the two-thirds necessary
to form a government alone.
	   The opposition, which claims Hun Sen's victory was achieved
through fraud and intimidation, has been reluctant to cooperate
with the ruling party until its allegations of fraud are thoroughly
investigated.
	   Both Ranariddh and junior opposition party leader Sam Rainsy
have stayed outside the country since parliament was ceremonially
opened Sept. 24.
	   Sam Rainsy and several other opposition politicians have been
under court investigation since a Sept. 7 grenade attack on Hun
Sen's residence in the capital sparked a crackdown on
demonstrations contesting the ruling party's electoral victory.
	   Hun Sen was not in Phnom Penh at the time and no one was hurt in
the attack. The opposition claimed it was staged as an excuse to
break up the anti-government protests.
	   A second alleged attempt on Hun Sen's life came before the
opening of parliament in the northwestern town of Siem Reap. A
remote-fired rocket-propelled grenade exploded near Hun Sen's car
as it drove to the ceremony, killing a 12-year-old bystander.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A wary NATO and world leaders kept
up the pressure Thursday on President Slobodan Milosevic, saying he
needs to withdraw more Serb forces by Saturday's deadline or face a
renewed threat of airstrikes.
	   About halfway through the four-day grace period given Milosevic
to show he's met international demands on ending Kosovo turmoil,
NATO's chief said the Yugoslav leader was making progress toward
compliance but still had a ways to go. That came amid new
accusations by refugees of Serb police intimidation.
	   The alliance planned to send its secretary-general, Javier
Solana, and two top commanders to Belgrade to sign an air
surveillance deal for Kosovo and reinforce that he is not yet
complying with the accord reached this week with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   ``I would send a very clear message'' to Milosevic, Solana said
Thursday in Brussels, Belgium. ``And that is that the solution to
the problem is not signing papers but to comply with agreements
that have been achieved.''
	   International officials also gathered in Paris and Vienna on
Thursday as part of the assessment process to make sure Milosevic
is keeping his word.
	   In Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency delivered more aid to those
displaced by the crackdown in the secessionist Serbian province,
which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   In the town of Kisna Reka, refugees living in a makeshift camp
of 3,000 people in a nearby gully carted off 50-kilogram
(110-pound) sacks of flour, bags of clothing, cooking oil and other
supplies delivered by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Asked how long they could stay in the woods, a man who gave his
name only as Rexhep said: ``Until we die. We don't know how much we
can take. We are afraid to go back.''
	   International efforts to restore more stability to Kosovo moved
forward Thursday.
	   Two top NATO commanders _ U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Germany's
Klaus Naumann, chairman of the alliance's military committee _ were
set to fly to Belgrade along with Solana.
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia met for several hours in Paris.
	   Later, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
was to approve the verification mission it will oversee in Kosovo.
The move will authorize Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek,
the OSCE chairman, to sign an agreement on the mission with
Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade on Friday.
	   The verification mission was a key part of the deal struck
Monday by Holbrooke with Milosevic to end his seven-month crackdown
on Kosovo Albanians.
	   Western nations were discussing naming Jacques Klein, the
American deputy to Bosnia's top international mediator Carlos
Westendorp, as head of the 2,000-person mission _ to be composed
largely of Europeans.
	   Britain has pledged to contribute 200 people to the verification
force, and both Russia and Germany are expected to make similar
contributions. But it's expected to take weeks to organize the OSCE
force.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement, which put off the
threat of impending airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   But with many reluctant to return home, Solana said troops are
not being withdrawn fast enough for refugees to feel confident
enough to go back.
	   ``It is very important for (refugees) to return to their
villages,'' he said. ``For that, compliance with the withdrawal of
troops is very, very important.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's crackdown.
	   At Kisna Reka, the refugees complained that Serbian security
forces fired machine guns, mortars and other weapons throughout the
night, apparently to intimidate them from planning a return to
their villages.
	   ``There's nobody there'' in the villages, said Fatmir Nuhaj, 27,
his arms wrapped around his young son's shoulders. ``It's only to
keep us from our homes.''
	   They said unarmed monitors will do them no good.
	   The Serbs, for their part, complain that the Kosovo Liberation
Army is continuing attacks on police.
	   Serb police said three policemen were wounded Wednesday and
another one Thursday when they were ambushed on a major Kosovo
road, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital Pristina.
	   Among the demands Milosevic must meet by Saturday, the one in
which he appears to be the furthest from compliance is withdrawal
of his forces to levels before the crackdown began on Feb. 28.
	   A NATO official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Wednesday that some Yugoslav units remained in Kosovo. He declined
to say how many but said they far exceed the level required by
NATO.

China, Taiwan move closer to resuming routine talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from banquet, briefing, Taipei &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Rivals China and Taiwan moved closer to
resuming the dialogue Beijing broke off three years ago by agreeing
Thursday to step up contacts between their main negotiators.
	   To secure the improving atmosphere, Taiwan's top envoy to the
mainland, Koo Chen-fu, invited his Chinese counterpart, Wang
Daohan, to visit Taiwan, and Wang agreed to come at a mutually
convenient time.
	   The elder statesmen reached the agreement over convivial cups of
tea at a swanky Shanghai hotel during their second day of talks,
their first meeting in five years. Their wives sat with them at the
small table, and aides shared tables nearby.
	   While stopping short of resuming a formal dialogue, the
agreement was the most concrete advance in relations since Beijing
scrubbed the talks in 1995. Angered that Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui seemed to be backing away from eventual reunification,
China then launched test-missiles and war games near the island,
sending relations to their lowest point since the height of the
Cold War.
	   Under the four-point deal, members of the two government-backed
bodies that Wang and Koo head will hold discussions on all matters
to explore resuming routine, formal negotiations. Wang's chief
aide, Tang Shubei, said the talks would cover the political matters
like reunification that Beijing has long sought to put on the
agenda.
	   Out of concern for Taiwanese public sentiment after some
high-profile killings on the mainland, the two bodies also agreed
to discuss issues of safety for Taiwanese citizens in China.
	   ``Our dialogue this time embodied real spirit,'' Wang, an
84-year-old Communist Party stalwart and mentor to President Jiang
Zemin, said in offering a toast at a banquet after the day's
meeting.
	   ``We will wholeheartedly and sincerely wait to see you in
Taipei,'' said Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and Nationalist
Party elder.
	   After dinner, Koo, Wang and their wives attended a traditional
Chinese opera. Koo will travel on to Beijing Friday and over the
weekend meet Chinese President Jiang.
	   Wang and Koo represent governments that are the political heirs
to the seven-decade-old Chinese civil war. Mao Tse-tung's
Communists forced Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists off the mainland
in 1949, and Beijing still looks on Taiwan as a rebel province.
	   Amid the pleasantries that surrounded Thursday's agreement, both
sides displayed the prickliness that has made engineering a
rapprochement so difficult.
	   In issuing the formal invitation, Koo suggested Wang come during
the general election campaign in November and December to ``see
Taiwan's democratic electoral process,'' according to an account of
the meeting by Koo aide Shi Hwei-yow.
	   Tang said Wang ``was willing to visit to Taiwan to better
understand the situation,'' but added that his schedule for the
rest of the year was too busy.
	   In Taipei, a senior mainland specialist for the Nationalist
government said full, formal dialogue would be restored only when
Beijing recognizes Taiwan as an equal.
	   ``If you stop threatening us militarily and suppressing our
foreign relations, then under such conditions we could raise
dialogue on issues such as ending the state of hostility,'' Sheu
Ke-sheng said at a news conference.
	   A resumption of talks would suit both sides. The Nationalists
hope to win support from the business community through improved
ties with China. Chinese President Jiang faces pressure from the
powerful Chinese military and communist old guard to get Taiwan to
agree to reunification.
	   Until Thursday, talks have been held up by China's insistence
that negotiations deal directly with thorny political issues,
including reunification. Taipei wanted the talks to pick up where
they left off, settling practical issues like fishing disputes.
	   On Thursday, Koo renewed his effort to address practical issues,
such as business concerns.
	   During a luncheon with Taiwanese business executives _ who have
committed dlrs 35 billion in investment in China over the past
decade _ Koo said he was aware of their urgent concerns about the
safety of their investments and their personal security.
	   ``I hope that we can at an early point hold consultations to
establish a normal order for economic and trade relations between
the two sides. That will allow each of you to feel secure and at
ease in investing in the mainland,'' Koo said.

Yemen executes man for murder of father in front of his children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ More than 3,000 people turned out to watch
the execution of a Yemeni man convicted of murdering a pediatrician
in front of his three children, a police official said Thursday.
	   Faisal Saleh bin Zabe was convicted of shooting to death Dr.
Mohammed Hayel al-Areeqi earlier this month. He was executed
Wednesday by a firing squad in the northern city of Marib, where
the murder took place.
	   Police said the murder occurred on Oct. 5 after al-Areeqi, who
was on his way to drop off his two daughters and a son at primary
school, stopped to give a lift to Zabe, who was hitchhiking.
	   Zabe then attempted to steal the car, and al-Areeqi resisted,
the police official said. He said Zabe killed the doctor, threw his
body and the children out of the car, and sped away. The official
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Doctors and nurses in Marib went on strike the day of the
murder, demanding that the killer be brought to justice.
	   Yemen imposes the death penalty for rape and murder. Most
executions are carried out in public to set an example.

Prime minister's son gets lost near kindergarten
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ When Avner, the son of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said he wanted to leave kindergarten, he meant it.
	   But no one took the 4-year-old seriously until well after he had
picked up his backpack and quietly left the building without anyone
noticing, the Israeli daily Maariv reported Thursday.
	   For nearly half an hour, Avner wandered around the street and
parking lot near his kindergarten Tuesday, occasionally calling,
``Yaakov, Yaakov,'' the name of the driver who takes him to and
from kindergarten. Yaakov didn't answer, but three teen-agers heard
his calls and asked him what his father's name was.
	   ``Bibi,'' said little Avner, using his father's nickname.
	   Netanyahu was notified of Avner's disappearance and took a break
from a tense Cabinet dealing with Israel's negotiating positions in
this week's Mideast summit.
	   Soon after, Sarah Netanyahu reached the parking lot and found
her son quietly talking to his rescuers, Maariv said.
	   ``I didn't want a fruit snack,'' Avner explained, referring to
the kindergarten's usual afternoon break when fruits are served.
``I wanted to go home.''

Iraqi girl returns home after cancer treatment in Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By Waiel Faleh &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi girl who was successfully treated
in Scotland for leukemia arrived home Thursday.
	   The 4-year-old Mariam Hamza, who has lost her hair from
chemotherapy, was accompanied by her grandmother and the British
member of parliament, George Galloway, who took her to Scotland in
April and raised the funds for her treatment.
	   ``Mariam is well now, thank God, they all took good care of her
(in Britain) and they all hoped for sanctions to be lifted,'' her
grandmother, Faten Hamid, said with tears in her eyes.
	   Mariam's group arrived at al-Rashid military airport on a
private plane from Amman, Jordan. The plane had been granted an
exemption from U.N. sanctions on air links with Baghdad to spare
her the 10-hour drive across the desert from the Jordanian capital.
	   ``This is one of the happiest days of my life,'' Galloway told
reporters. ``When we left here six months ago, this child was at
death's door.''
	   Mariam's father, Hamza Abid Mita'b, met her at the airport.
	   ``I hope the happiness which I feel now will be for all Iraqi
parents with sick children,'' he said, his voice choking with
emotion.
	   Galloway, a maverick left-wing member of the Labor Party, has
long campaigned for the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``I do not have any promises,'' he said. ``What I will say is
this: the British government made the treatment of Mariam Hamza
possible. This morning the British government sent a senior Royal
Air Force Commander to the airport in Amman to say goodbye to the
child and to make sure that she was safely on the plane. This is
encouraging.''
	   Galloway spotted Mariam in a Baghdad hospital during one of his
trips to Iraq. Her doctors had almost give up hope owing to their
lack of medicine and equipment.
	   The legislator arranged for Mariam to be treated in Scotland. He
has said he wanted to highlight the plight of the Iraqi public
under the embargo.
	   ``She has been a symbol for six months of the suffering that all
Iraqi people have endured all these eight years of sanctions,''
Galloway said Wednesday.
	   An Iraqi-British physician, Foutouh Binyamin, who accompanied
Mariam to Jordan, told reporters Wednesday that her cancer was in
remission and she was recovering.
	   Galloway said Mariam's treatment cost ``around 75,000 pounds
sterling'' (dlrs 127,500) and one of the biggest donations came
from Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.
	   ``The proper thing to do is to lift sanctions so the sick
children of Iraq can all be treated,'' he said.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said the sanctions will be lifted
once Iraq has shown that it has eliminated all its long-range
missiles and weapons of mass destruction.

Malaria outbreak in Yemen kills more than 110
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A rapidly spreading outbreak of malaria has
killed more than 110 people, most of them children, in southern and
central Yemen, Al-Thawra newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The newspapers said 2,600 people were ill with the disease.
	   During the past three weeks, the central province of al-Dhali
has recorded 1,800 cases, and the central province of al-Beida
reported 300 cases.
	   The disease spread to the southern province of Lahej this week,
where 510 cases have been reported, the paper said, quoting health
officials.
	   Malaria is spread by mosquitoes that breed in pools of stagnant
water.
	   Unhygienic conditions and lack of medicine were making the
outbreak difficult to control, the paper said.
	   A malaria outbreak in Yemen in 1996 killed more than 200 people
and infected thousands.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country of 17 million in the southern
part of the Arabian Peninsula, spends only 400 riyals (dlrs 3)
annually per person for health care.

Government files on sects missing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Just days after hundreds of legal documents on the
Church of Scientology disappeared from a Paris court, computer
files have now vanished from a government task force on sects, news
reports said Thursday.
	   Task force members feel the two events aren't a coincidence, but
signs that French sects have declared an all-out war on attempts to
investigate them.
	   On Wednesday, French Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou announced
an investigation into the disappearance of hundreds of court
documents from the Palais de Justice, Paris' main courthouse,
regarding judicial action still pending against the Church of
Scientology.
	   A lawyer for the church said it was ``out of the question'' that
church members were involved.
	   And judicial officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
it was unclear whether the documents were stolen or simply
misplaced.
	   According to the daily Le Parisien, files containing names,
addresses, correspondence and detailed reports prepared by an
interministerial group on sects ``mysteriously'' disappeared about
12 days ago from a computer hard disk.
	   The disappearance was kept secret while the government replaced
the group with a tougher anti-sect task force endowed with
wider-ranging powers, Le Parisien said.
	   ``Whether it's a robbery or a malfunction, it's unacceptable,''
Olivier Morice, a lawyer representing a victims' group, was quoted
as saying.
	   Task force members say they routinely receive threatening phone
calls and are victims of various forms of psychological harassment.
One member's home was broken into several weeks ago.
	   Last year, a Lyon court reduced the sentence of a Church of
Scientology leader convicted of involuntary homicide. It threw out
the convictions of nine Scientologists on charges of theft,
complicity or abuse of confidence, and reduced the fines of four
others. An appeal is pending.

German automakers on track for record year, but problems loom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ German automakers will produce more than
5 million cars this year, significantly exceeding forecasts, but
global economic problems mean the boom may not last into 1999, a
trade group said Thursday.
	   The German Auto Industry Association reported 502,000 passenger
cars were produced in September, an increase of 18 percent on
year-earlier levels and more than ever before in a single month.
	   ``The latest data confirm that the auto industry's remarkable
dynamism shows a considerable ability to resist an increasingly
difficult climate,'' association president Bernd Gottschalk said in
a speech in Dresden.
	   However, ``we can't ignore the fact that dark clouds are
looming,'' he added, pointing to domestic political developments as
well as stock market turbulence and regional crises elsewhere.
	   In the nine months from January to September, car output totaled
3.88 million units, 11 percent more than in the year-earlier
period, the industry association said.

Policeman sporting a swastika charged with promoting fascism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A policeman wearing a swastika on
his dress was charged with promoting fascism and faces up to five
years in prison if convicted, the CTK news agency reported
Thursday.
	   The policeman, wearing a red ribbon embossed with a swastika on
his sleeve, was detained in January by a police patrol in the town
of Ostrov, 150 kilometers (94 miles) west of Prague.
	   Several people saw the policeman sporting the swastika, CTK
quoted Vera Sequardtova as saying.
	   A police investigator dealing with the charges refused to
comment on the case.
	   Illegal promotion of movements aimed at suppressing human
rights, such as fascism and communism, is punishable in the Czech
Republic with one to five years in prison.
	   A total of 1,415 racially-motivated crimes have been committed
since the fall of communism in 1989.

Split between unions and bosses threatens German jobs-creation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; With BC-Germany-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ As more unions joined a call for hefty
wage increases Thursday, the president of a key umbrella group for
employers warned the demands would kill jobs and damage Germany's
economy.
	   Analysts, meanwhile, warned the fight brewing between unions and
bosses could make it harder for Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder's to bring both sides together to fight unemployment _
the main objective he set for his incoming Social Democratic
government.
	   ``Going into wage talks with such a high demand gives the
impression the unions ... are seeking conflict and aren't ready for
this alliance,'' said Meinhard Miegel, director of the Bonn-based
Institute for Economy and Society.
	   Germany's biggest union, IG Metall, declared this week it was
through with the wage restraint of recent years. Citing healthy
profits achieved by many German firms, it said it would seek a 6.5
percent wage increase for the 3.4 million workers it represents.
	   Three more unions representing white-collar and service-industry
employees joined on Thursday, saying they would ask for more too.
	   But Dieter Hundt, president of Germany's key employer's
association, said many companies were only making modest profits
and couldn't afford large wage increases.
	   Meeting the union demands will ``definitely'' lead to increased
unemployment, he told German radio.
	   The German Auto Industry Association, while reporting its
members were on track for a record year, also warned that next year
could be a tough one because of fallout from the global economic
turmoil.
	   ``We can't ignore the fact that dark clouds are looming,'' said
association president Bernd Gottschalk.
	   Big wage hikes would hurt Germany's competitiveness by making
its workers too expensive, he said.
	   But unions say they have for years stifled requests for bigger
wage increases and that it's time for employees to share in
Germany's economic growth, expected this year to be around 2.6
percent.
	   ``Redistributing (profits) at the expense of employees has got
to stop,'' said Roland Issen, chairman of a white-collar union, the
DAG.
	   The Social Democrats' spokesman, Michael Donnermeyer, declined
to comment on how the conflicting demands will affect Schroeder's
jobs-creation plan, noting only that the talks weren't expected to
be easy anyway.
	   Schroeder envisages bringing together government, business and
labor officials to brainstorm on a solution to Germany's high
unemployment, now at 10.3 percent.
	   The country's chronic high joblessness was one of the main
reason for the Sept. 27 defeat of the conservative coalition
government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   The plan was already under strain before the latest split, with
industry leaders vowing to fight Social Democratic plans to repeal
limited reforms passed by the outgoing government that were aimed
at reducing the high cost of doing business in Germany.

Bulgaria arrests Yugoslav Swiss wanted in diamond theft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police arrested a Yugoslav citizen wanted
in a dlrs 2.3 million diamond theft in Switzerland, the Interior
Ministry announced Thursday.
	   Miroslav Bojanic, 31, has been wanted by Interpol since 1993
when Switzerland charged him with stealing three diamonds from a
jewlery fair in Basel, a ministry statement said.
	   The diamonds were sold in Munich, Germany, and Antwerp, Belgium,
officials said.
	   Under Swiss law Bojanic may be sentenced up to 10 years in
prison if found guilty of the theft, the statement said.
	   Bojanic was arrested Tuesday while entering Bulgaria from
Yugoslavia at the Kalotina border crossing, 50 kilometers (30
miles) west of Sofia.

Czechs sign contract on gas imports from Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A Czech importer signed a dlrs 10
billion contract Thursday with the Russian giant Gazprom on imports
of natural gas to the Czech Republic, the news agency CTK reported.
	   The agency said the contract was signed in Prague by the Czech
importer Transgas and Gazexport, a Gazprom sibsidiary.
	   According to Transgas' director Miroslav Grec, the state-owned
company will import some 7 billion cubic meters of natural gas per
year from Russia over the next 15 years, CTK said.
	   The contract succeeds a previous three-year contract between the
two groups and includes an option to extend the contract by an
additional 10 years.
	   It also allows Transgas to continue acting as an agent for
Gazprom in shipments of natural gas across the Czech Republic to
other countries, CTK said.

Contact Group backs accord and air strike threat: Vedrine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with news conferences

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Contact Group of nations concerned with
Yugoslavia gave its full support Thursday to an agreement hammered
out with Belgrade on ending the crisis in Kosovo province.
	   But the group of U.S., European and Russian officials also
maintained its support for the threat of NATO air strikes in case
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't keep his word, said
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   The agreement reached Monday between Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke ``has the full support of the Contact Group,''
Vedrine told a news conference after the meeting.
	   NATO has threatened air strikes on Milosevic's Serb army
positions unless they pull out of Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanian rebels are fighting for independence from Serb-dominated
Yugoslavia.
	   In the accord, Milosevic has also agreed to peace talks, a
verification group, cooperation with war crimes investigators, the
unhindered humanitarian shipments and the return of refugees to
their homes.
	   Hundreds of thousands of refugees in heavily Albanian Kosovo
face a deadly winter if the conflict doesn't end soon.
	   When asked if the air strike threat remained strong, Vedrine
said the Contact Group ``is the same state of mind, but we observe
that things have begun to move and we remain extremely vigilant.''
	   The group discussed coordination between NATO air surveillance
and the 2,000-member verification group, Vedrine said.
	   They also agreed on the need for a new U.N. Security Council
resolution ``to endorse the accord,'' and that discussions ``must
begin immediately,'' he said.
	   British and Russian proposals were on the table, Vedrine said,
without elaborating.
	   Moscow's opposition to the air strikes has remained a sore point
among the Contact Group. But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said his country was ``satisfied that our partners have come to
support our point of view.
	   ``Our position is that the essence of the resolutions of the
Security Council must be fulfilled by the authorities of Yugoslavia
and the representatives of the Kosovar Albanians. The solution can
only be political.
	   ``Any efforts to force the issue by military means will only
have negative consequences,'' he told a separate news conference.
	   Asked if Russia would join in NATO-led overflights to verify
Serb compliance, Ivanov said that once NATO and Yugoslavia agree on
the plan, Russia would consider whether or not to participate.
	   Meanwhile, several nations were offering to participate in the
verification mission. Britain has offered 200 people, while France,
Germany and Russia are also expected to provide monitors.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's seven-month-old crackdown
against the separatists in the southern Serbian province.

Indonesian foreign minister briefs East Timorese on autonomy plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ After days of big protests in East
Timor, Indonesia's foreign minister met community leaders from the
troubled territory Thursday to outline a plan to grant autonomy,
but not independence, to their homeland.
	   A government spokesman said 39 East Timorese leaders who support
continued Indonesian rule and 19 who want to break away traveled to
the tourist island of Bali to listen to Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas.
	   Absent from the gathering, which is to end Friday, was 1996
Nobel Peace laureate Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, East
Timor's spiritual leader.
	   Belo, who has repeatedly urged Indonesia to withdraw its troops
from East Timor as part of any peace plan, told reporters he was
too busy attending to church matters to meet Alatas.
	   Friday's meeting followed big protests Sunday and Monday in East
Timor's capital, Dili.
	   The demonstrators wanted a referendum held to determine the
future of the former Portuguese colony, which Indonesia invaded in
1975 and annexed the following year.
	   Indonesia has rejected their demands and instead has offered to
grant a form of autonomy to East Timor in connection with
U.N.-sponsored negotiations with Portugal.
	   Thursday's meeting, which was to continue into Friday, was also
held amid unconfirmed reports that troop numbers have been boosted
in East Timor following a partial withdrawal recently.
	   There also have been unconfirmed reports of clashes between
troops and pro-independence rebels.
	   Ghaffar Fadyl, a spokesman of the foreign office, said many of
the East Timorese representatives at the Bali meeting had not known
the details of the autonomy plan.
	   ``In general, the East Timorese representatives appreciated what
Alatas explained to them,'' Fadyl said. ``But it is not yet known
what their views are on the proposal.''
	   Meanwhile in Surabaya, the East Java capital, a group of East
Timorese demonstrated at the local council, demanding immediate
withdrawal of Indonesian troops from East Timor.
	   The group of about 200 also demanded an end to all kinds of
violence _ killing, massacre, torture and rape _ in the region.
	   Also Thursday, a smaller group staged a similar protest outside
the U.N. building in Jakarta. Besides a troop withdrawal, the
protesters also called for a referendum on East Timor's future and
the release of political prisoners.

Anti-uranium protesters thrown out of miner's annual meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A rowdy group of protesters was ejected
from uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.'s annual
general meeting Thursday after interrupting chairman Campbell
Anderson's address.
	   Those ejected, members of an environmental group called the
Wilderness Society, had been protesting against the company's
Jabiluka mine development in the Northern Territory.
	   The demonstrators had bought shares in ERA, a subsidiary of
North Ltd., to gain entry to the meeting.
	   Most of those ejected by security guards were young women who
were carried out of the meeting still screaming.
	   During the melee, one protester cried out: ``Don't you care
about our children?''
	   ``Hopefully you won't have any,'' Anderson replied.
	   Protesters also repeatedly asked the board questions about
environmental risks of the proposed mine.
	   Construction has begun at Jabiluka, where ERA has identified
more than 90,000 metric tons of uranium oxide, making it one of the
largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world.
	   It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (6.2 billion
Australian dollars) to Australia's gross domestic product over
about 30 years, and boost the country's share of the world uranium
market.

Second phase of Singapore aid to Indonesia starting Friday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The second phase of Singapore's dlrs 7 million
humanitarian assistance to Indonesia will start Friday, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
	   Medical supplies and 4,000 tons of rice will be delivered in two
batches to Indonesia's Riau province.
	   In July, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie asked his country's
200 million people to fast twice a week due to dangerously low rice
supplies.
	   Shortly afterward, Singapore announced it would send 12 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 7 million) worth of rice and medicine to
its beleaguered neighbor. The first shipment of 10,000 tons of rice
reached Indonesia in August.
	   Last year, Singapore also committed dlrs 5 billion to the dlrs
43 billion Indonesian rescue package orchestrated by the
International Monetary Fund.

Activist claims volunteer's murder was act of intimidation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A human rights activist on Thursday
described the murder of a volunteer rape counselor as an act of
intimidation and terror against those helping sexual assault
victims from Indonesia's May riots.
	   The body of Martadinata Haryono, 17, a counselor with the
Volunteers for Humanity group, was found in her home Friday night
with stab wounds and a slashed neck.
	   Haryono, a member of the ethnic Chinese minority in Indonesia,
had been helping other ethnic Chinese women raped during May riots.
	   Police have arrested a 20-year-old male neighbor and say he has
confessed that he killed her during a bungled burglary.
	   Romo Sandyawan, a Roman Catholic priest who leads Volunteers for
Humanity, said other members of his group had been harassed and
threatened by those who don't want the truth known about the rapes.
	   ``The assassination of Ita can't be simply parted from the
intimidation and terror that continuously shake other members of
the Volunteers for Humanity,'' Sandyawan told a news conference.
	   Sandyawan is also a member of a government-appointed, but
independent, fact-finding team investigating the causes of the May
riots, in which 1,200 were killed.
	   The team, whose members include government officials as well as
security officers and human rights activists, is expected to issue
its findings Oct. 23.
	   Many ethnic Chinese homes and businesses were targeted by mobs
during the widespread unrest, which led to the resignation of
authoritarian President Suharto. The ethnic Chinese often are made
scapegoats in Indonesia because of their perceived relative
prosperity.
	   Human rights groups say at least 168 women, mostly ethnic
Chinese, were raped during the riots.

Indonesia asks for time for immigrants to return home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Indonesian Embassy asked
Malaysia Thursday for two months' grace to repatriate thousands of
jobless migrants who face arrest in Malaysia.
	   Malaysia has given all immigrants without proper work permits
and travel documents until Nov. 1 before they are arrested and
deported.
	   ``I hope the Malaysian authorities would not arrest Indonesian
illegal workers who are ... waiting for their turn to board the
ship home,'' embassy spokesman Nawawi Hasbi was quoted as saying by
the national news agency Bernama.
	   During Asia's boom years, Malaysia imported millions of foreign
workers to build its modern cityscape. Now, with rising
unemployment and a plunging economy, the welcome mat has been
yanked away.
	   Nawawi told reporters that tens of thousands of Indonesians have
flooded the embassy to obtain travel documents that would enable
them to return home by sea.
	   He said that if the authorities are unable to grant them the
extra time requested, the company in charge of repatriating the
immigrants might have to drop them off at one of the closest
Indonesian points, such as Batam Island just south of Malaysia.

North Korean defectors were in love with each other
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two North Korean soldiers who trekked
across a heavily mined border to defect to South Korea were lovers,
South Korean military officials said Thursday.
	   Capt. Seok Myong Hwan, 32, a doctor, and Sgt. 1st Class Song
Myong Soon, 23, crawled across the Korean border, the world's most
heavily armed, on the foggy morning of Wednesday.
	   After crossing the demarcation line, the couple used a
flashlight and shouted for help to South Korean guards, who guided
them through the mine field.
	   On Thursday, military investigators said Seok, married with two
children, was in love with Song, a telephone operator. Song was the
first female soldier to defect to the South since 1974.
	   Seok proposed to Song last Friday that they flee to the South.
It took the pair three days to reach their destination after
leaving Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Sunday, the
officials said.
	   Seok comes from an elite military family, his father being a
colonel in a special military unit guarding North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il.
	   The officials divulged no further details. But local news media
reported Seok also feared punishment for pocketing medicine and
other goods.
	   The Koreas remain technically at war, with no peace treaty
signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

Philippine peso gains, stocks end higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso ended stronger
against the U.S. dollar Thursday, shadowing the Japanese yen's
performance, traders said.
	   A slack dollar demand from corporate clients and banks also gave
the peso a push, the traders said.
	   The dollar ended at an average of 43.23 pesos, down from
Wednesday's average of 43.288 pesos. The dollar was last dealt at
43.229 pesos, close to its intraday low of 43.19 pesos.
	   Volume declined to dlrs 97 million from Wednesday's dlrs 106.5
million.
	   Traders see the peso trading in a tight range against the
dollar, swayed largely by the yen's performance.
	   A trader for a foreign bank sees the peso gaining in the coming
months as Filipinos working abroad start sending home increasing
amounts of dollars ahead of Christmas.
	   The Philippine Central Bank said it expects dollar remittances
from the workers to increase by 10 percent this year from last
year's dlrs 5.7 billion.
	   The central bank didn't participate in the spot market, and held
its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 14 percent and 16
percent, respectively.
	   Philippine shares, meanwhile, ended higher, helped along by the
peso's appreciation and Wall Street's gain, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange gained 18.56 points, or
1.4 percent, closing at 1,342.78. A 43.55-point loss Wednesday had
snapped a six-day gaining streak.
	   The main index had surged by about 35 points at mid-session, but
tapered off on some profit-taking.
	   The broader All Shares Index rebounded by 5.23 points to 439.29
after declining 11.68 points Wednesday.
	   Blue-chip stocks such as Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.
and Ayala Corp. paced advancers. Gains outnumber retreats 61 to 19,
with 29 issues unchanged.
	   Julie Villena, analyst for Magnum International Securities, said
foreigners continue to accumulate selected blue-chip stocks,
apparently heartened by news about Japan's effort to reform its
banking system and the impending deal between the U.S. Congress and
president to pass the budget.
	   ``Sentiment seem to have improved,'' she said.

Skate under attack after firing deputy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The government in Papua
New Guinea was in turmoil Thursday after Prime Minister Bill Skate
abruptly fired five of his Cabinet ministers, including Deputy
Prime Minister Michael Nali.
	   Confirming the dismissals to reporters, Nali accused Skate of
running the nation's affairs in a ``generally irresponsible and
whiskey and rock-and-roll manner.''
	   At a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Nali said, Skate had ``very
unceremoniously'' fired all 12 members of Nali's Peoples Progress
Party from the multiparty coalition government headed by Skate's
Papua New Guinea First party.
	   Those dismissed included himself and five other ministers, Nali
said.
	   Nali blamed Skate for causing instability and a loss of business
confidence in government.
	   ``(Instability) has always been caused by Skate himself, through
his continuous changes of ministries and the generally
irresponsible and whiskey and rock'n roll manner in which he tries
to manage the affairs of this nation,'' Nali told reporters.
	   Observers said this was a reference to Skate's observed fondness
for whiskey and his occasional renditions of Elvis Presley songs at
nightclubs.
	   Skate said Nali's party had been dismissed from the government
because it was going to ``cause instability.''
	   Nali said Skate had an unreasonable fear that members of Nali's
party were helping former prime minister and party leader Sir
Julius Chan to make a political comeback.
	   He said Skate also wanted to avoid opposition to his
reinstatement Wednesday of Brig. Gen. Jerry Singirok as commander
of the Papua New Guinea defense force.
	   Singirok was fired after an inquiry found he had acted illegally
in leading an army revolt that evicted mercenaries from Sandline
International hired by Chan in March 1997 to end the 10-year
secessionist conflict on Bougainville island. A peace settlement
has since been reached.
	   A second inquiry last month found that Singirok had accepted
31,000 British pounds (U.S. dlrs 53,000) from British-based
military supply company J and S Franklin while defense force
commander.
	   It found the payments amounted to a bribe.
	   Nali said he would have opposed Singirok's reinstatement.
	   A spokesman for Skate said Nali's dismissal had nothing to do
with Singirok.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the spokesman said new
ministers would be sworn in Monday.

Maskhadov calls on international community to recognize Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA  &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The president of Russia's breakaway
Chechnya region called on the United Nations and the European
Parliament Thursday to recognize an independent Chechnya.
	   In a statement to an international human rights conference,
Aslan Maskhadov said international recognition would help Chechnya
establish legitimacy as an independent state alongside other former
Soviet republics in the eyes of Moscow.
	   The statement was read by Chechen Foreign Minister Movladi
Udugov, who wore the traditional Chechen tall sheepskin hat, as
Maskhadov rested in his hotel room.
	   The statement also called on the international community to
establish an international tribunal to try those responsible for
crimes during the 1994-96 war with Russia. It did not name any
suspects.
	   Maskhadov won a landslide election victory in January 1997, but
during his time in office, Chechnya has seen a steep rise in
kidnappings and other crimes. No country has recognized Chechnya's
claims of independence, and Russia still considers it a
semi-autonomous Russian republic.
	   Maskhadov accused Russia of failing to keep its side of a peace
agreement ending the war, saying that Moscow regarded Chechnya as a
colony.
	   ``The Chechen nation would rather die than return to the
colonial past,'' Maskhadov's statement said.
	   During his five-day visit, Maskhadov is protected by a body
guard assigned by the Foreign Ministry. He, however, will not meet
with any government leaders to avoid straining Poland's relations
with its former communist-era big brother, Russia.
	   Maskhadov is attending the third international conference on
human rights, sponsored by the Polish parliament.

Newcastle defender joins Premier League leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Premier League leader Aston Villa
Thursday paid 4 million pounds (dlrs 6.68 million) for Newcastle
defender Steve Watson.
	   The 24-year-old rightback, who has signed a 5-year contract,
likely will be on the team to face West Ham at Upton Park on
Saturday.
	   Watson, a lifelong Newcastle fan, had played for the Magpies
since he joined it as a teenager in 1990. But new coach Ruud Gullit
was warned he would have to sell players before he could buy new
ones and admitted he was prepared to let the talented defender go
at the right price.
	   ``When I was told I could leave and Villa were interested then
there was no problem joining a club at the top of the Premier
League,'' Watson said on his arrival at Villa Park.
	   ``I'm amazed that Villa have already built up such a commanding
points lead so early in the season. But this is an indication of
the quality that is in the side.''

American professor angers Indonesian with corruption allegations

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An American college professor has
angered the Indonesian government by alleging that its top
economics minister had been involved in a shady business deal
involving a U.S. mining company.
	   Ginandjar Kartasasmita, coordinating minister for the economy,
finance and industry, has angrily denied corruption allegations
made this week by Jeffrey Winters of Northwestern University in
Evanston, Illinois.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said police should investigate Winters,
the newspaper The Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
	   ``The police must investigate him. ... A coordinating minister
is harassed by a foreign expert. That's not on,'' Muladi said.
	   The Post quoted one unidentified official as saying Ginandjar
had been ``humiliated'' by the accusations.
	   Later Thursday, the official Antara news agency quoted Muladi as
saying Winters ``is not allowed to set foot on Indonesian soil
before clearing up his insulting remark against the state
official.''
	   Newspapers say Winters has accused Ginandjar, a former mines
minister, of being involved in a share deal between a local company
and PT Freeport Indonesia, a subsidiary of New Orleans-based
Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc.
	   Freeport, which operates a massive copper and gold mine in
Indonesian-controlled western New Guinea, said Thursday it would
not comment on Winters' ``irresponsible statements'' since he ``has
was only repeating what he had read in reports from others.''
	   A statement from the company said all its contracts ``are
negotiated in accordance with good business practices and in
accordance with the laws of both Indonesia and the U.S.''
	   Ginandjar said he did not violate any laws or abuse his
ministerial power. He also did not make any personal profit, he
said.
	   He said that if the accusations against him are proven, the
government would take legal action.
	   Winters, who visited Indonesia this month, left the country
several days ago.
	   Antara quoted him as saying from the United States that he stood
by his comments about government corruption, although he said he
did not directly accuse Ginandjar of being involved in corruption.
	   ``I'm not scared about being arrested or interrogated by police.
That is up to the Indonesian government,'' he said.
	   Winters' allegation is the latest in a long list of accusations
of corruption and collusion made against senior officials who
served under former President Suharto.
	   Suharto ended 32 authoritarian years in power when he quit
office in May after a wave of riots and protests ended with the
deaths of 1,200 people.
	   Suharto himself is now under investigation for corruption but
has denied allegations that he has stashed billions of dollars away
in foreign banks.
	   Ginandjar was a senior minister under Suharto and remained in
Indonesia's Cabinet when Suharto's successor and friend, Habibie,
took over.
	   Ginandjar has been a major player in the setting up of a
multibillion-dollar economic rescue package with the International
Monetary Fund to help overcome Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
three decades.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French high school students were staging a day of
protests throughout France on Thursday, keeping up the pressure on
the leftist government to cut class sizes and buy more equipment.
	   By mid-afternoon, an estimated 200,000 students were in the
streets. In Bordeaux in the southwest, 20,000 students were
marching. In Rennes in the north, 10,000 were out in force, and a
similar number rallied in Caen in Normandy.
	   About 20,000 marched in the capital, and some of them smashed
windows and vandalized stores near Place de la Nation, a square in
eastern Paris where the students gathered early in the day. About
30 were arrested.
	   Police in the capital were prepared for the worst. At the
Boulevard du Montparnasse in southern Paris, and along the route to
the Education Ministry, riot police with shields waited for
trouble.
	   The students shouted slogans criticizing Education Minister
Claude Allegre.
	   ``Allegre, you're finished, the high schools are in the
streets,'' one slogan went.
	   In Grenoble, a protesting student was seriously injured hit by a
tramway after jumping over security barriers. And in Rouen, about a
dozen students were arrested for breaking store windows and
rampaging through an outdoor cafe.
	   A student union leader, meanwhile, predicted protests at least
until a school vacation at the end of next week, unless Allegre
quickly carries out his promises to improve school conditions.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A South Korean cargo ship smashed into some rocks
near southwestern Japan Thursday, spilling 7,000 liters (1,820
gallons) of fuel oil into the water, the Japanese coast guard said.
	   Some of that oil, spread over an area 4 kilometers by 2
kilometers (2.5 miles by 1 mile), was floating toward Shikoku
Island, and foam that might be oil has fouled some 4 kilometers
(2.5 miles) of beach, said Maritime Safety Agency spokesman Shingo
Nakamura.
	   Oil was still leaking from the ship's fuel tanks, which
contained about 105,000 liters (27,300 gallons), and it was unclear
when the ship could be salvaged and brought into port, Nakamura
said.
	   No injuries were reported among the 15 crew members of the
2,831-ton Chun Il _ 12 Koreans, two Filipinos and a Chinese.
	   The ship, bound for Yokohama from Pusan carrying a container of
machine parts, struck partially submerged rocks at around 1 a.m.
(1600 GMT Wednesday) about 2 kilometers (a mile) off the
southwestern coast of Shikoku, 680 kilometers (425 miles) west of
Tokyo.
	   The agency sent 23 ships to put up oil fences and clean up the
spill with chemicals but temporarily halted the operation after
sunset, Nakamura said. The cleanup will continue Friday.

Government again promises to get tough on hooligans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sports Minister Tony Banks on Thursday promised a
renewed clampdown on soccer hooliganism following the arrests of 90
English fans in Luxembourg for Wednesday's European Championship
qualifying match.
	   The tiny Grand Duchy of Luxembourg had some 1,000 police to deal
with 2,500 English fans for the Euro 2000 qualifying match.
Although England won 3-0, the match was marred by the same sort of
violence that involved English fans at the World Cup in France and
in Sweden last month.
	   Luxembourg police said about 50 English fans were arrested
before kickoff for fighting and drunken behavior, while another 40
fans without tickets were detained by police after trying to rush
the gates at the stadium.
	   Fans later attacked riot police who were herding them towards
buses and away from the city centre.
	   Earlier 25 English fans, who were en route from Manchester to
Luxembourg, were intercepted and deported from Belgium for what
local police described as being drunk and ``a menace to the public
order.''
	   Banks, who is a regular spectator at Chelsea, said hooliganism
was a continuing problem the British Government was determined to
deal with.
	   ``There will be proposals put forward that will enable us to
deal with these determined troublemakers that continue to besmirch
the reputation of football in this country and the reputation of
the nation,'' he said.
	   Soccer violence is no longer a problem at domestic games in
England largely due to sophisticated security measures. But English
fans remain serious troublemakers whenever they leave the country.
	   A Government spokesman said Thursday the existing powers of
restriction and legislation including the Public Order Act was
under review and a consulation paper would be released within
weeks.
	   The reputation of English fans in Luxembourg is low after the
last two visits by the national team.
	   English visits in 1977 and 1983 were marred by crowd violence,
when hooligans ripped up seats at Josy Barthel national stadium and
then rampaged through the streets, demolishing cars and
storefronts.
	   This time police sealed off streets around the stadium, and were
only letting ticket holders past their barriers.
	   So far this year, a trail of destruction has followed the
English team. In France, riots with locals, particularly North
African youths in the port city of Marseille, erupted during the
World Cup.
	   Violence again marred England's European qualifier with Sweden
in Stockholm last month when the Swedes won 2-1 and fans began
tearing apart a section of Rasunda Stadium.

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azerbaijan's authoritarian president
Geidar Aliev has been re-elected, according to final results
released Thursday, in a vote international observers called
undemocratic and stacked in his favor.
	   The opposition boycotted Sunday's election in this oil-rich
former Soviet republic on the Caspian Sea to protest Aliev's
control of the Central Electoral Commission, a crackdown on
opposition rallies, and promotion of the president by the state-run
media.
	   The election commission announced Thursday that Aliev won 76.1
percent of the vote, while his nearest rival, Etibar Mamedov,
garnered just 11.6 percent. A candidate needed two-thirds of the
vote to win.
	   Aliev ran against five other candidates, but they were widely
perceived to be participating only to make the race seem
competitive.
	   An aide to Mamedov, Fuad Agayev, cast doubt on the results,
saying Mamedov's observers had found ``mass violations, in
particular falsification of ballots in favor of Aliev.''
	   The election commission chairman, Dzhafar Veliyev, acknowledged
Thursday there were some violations but said they were too
insignificant to affect the results.
	   The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, a
private U.S. watch-dog and educational group, said Tuesday that
Azerbaijani observers were intimidated, ballot boxes were stuffed
and that in some cases government officials ran polling stations
instead of election commission members.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the
Council of Europe have made similar comments.
	   Both groups said further study was needed to determine whether
the fraud was significant enough to invalidate the election
outcome.
	   Aliev criticized international observers for calling the vote
fraudulent.

NATO sends Solana, top allied commanders to Belgrade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO alliance on Thursday sent
Javier Solana, its secretary general, and two top commanders to
Belgrade to sign an air surveillance deal for Kosovo, part of a
peace deal for the Serbian province. They were to arrive in
Belgrade at about 1600GMT.
	   Travelling with Solana will be NATO's top military commander in
Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Klaus Naumann, a German general
who heads NATO's panel of chiefs of staffs from the 16 alliance
nations.
	   Solana was to sign an accord in which Yugoslavia gives NATO spy
planes unfettered access to Kosovo airspace to check compliance
with the peace agreement for that province.
	   Solana was also to give a press conference in Belgrade Thursday
evening.
	   Before leaving Solana said Milosevic was not complying with the
Kosovo peace accord, forged this week by U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   The agreement forces Milosevic to withdraw troops from Kosovo,
begin peace talks with ethnic Albanians and allow 2,000 monitors
into the province.
	   Officials said Solana would also carry a message to Milosevic
warning him that unless he lives up to the agreement, NATO will not
hesitate to use airstrikes.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with refugees getting aid, accusing Serbs of
intimidation, Serb accusations of ethnic Albanian ambushes &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A wary NATO and world leaders kept
up the pressure Thursday on President Slobodan Milosevic to
withdraw more Serb forces from the Kosovo province before
Saturday's deadline for threatened airstrikes.
	   About halfway through the four-day grace period given Milosevic
to show he's met international demands on ending turmoil in the
secessionist province, NATO's chief said the Yugoslav leader was
making progress toward compliance but still had a ways to go. That
came amid new accusations by ethnic Albanian refugees of
intimidation by Serb police.
	   The alliance planned to send its secretary-general, Javier
Solana, and two top commanders to Belgrade to sign an air
surveillance deal for Kosovo and reinforce that he is not yet
complying with the accord reached this week with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   ``I would send a very clear message'' to Milosevic, Solana said
Thursday in Brussels, Belgium. ``And that is that the solution to
the problem is not signing papers but to comply with agreements
that have been achieved.''
	   International officials also gathered Thursday in Paris and
Vienna as part of the assessment process to make sure Milosevic is
keeping his word.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes during Milosevic's crackdown on the
Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence of the largely
ethnic Albanian province.
	   In Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency delivered more aid to those
displaced by the crackdown in the secessionist province in Serbia,
the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   In the town of Kisna Reka, refugees living in a makeshift camp
of 3,000 people in a nearby gully carted off 50-kilogram
(110-pound) sacks of flour, bags of clothing, cooking oil and other
supplies delivered by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Asked how long they could stay in the woods, a man who gave his
name only as Rexhep said: ``Until we die. We don't know how much we
can take. We are afraid to go back.''
	   Efforts to restore more stability to Kosovo moved forward.
	   Two top NATO commanders _ U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Germany's
Klaus Naumann, chairman of the alliance's military committee _ were
expected to fly to Belgrade with Solana later Thursday.
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia met for several hours in Paris.
	   Later, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
was set to approve the verification mission it will oversee in
Kosovo. The move will authorize Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek, the OSCE chairman, to sign an agreement on the mission
with Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade on Friday.
	   The verification mission was a key part of the deal Holbrooke
struck Monday with Milosevic to end the seven-month crackdown on
Kosovo Albanians.
	   Western nations were discussing naming Jacques Klein, the
American deputy to Bosnia's top international mediator Carlos
Westendorp, as head of the 2,000-person mission _ to be composed
largely of Europeans.
	   Britain has pledged to contribute 200 people to the verification
force, and both Russia and Germany are expected to make similar
contributions. But it's expected to take weeks to organize the OSCE
force.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped up since the agreement, which put off the threat of
impending airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   But many remain in hiding or refuse to return to their homes,
fearing reprisals from Serb special police who have torched their
villages and been accused of atrocities.
	   At Kisna Reka, the refugees complained that Serbian security
forces fired machine guns, mortars and other weapons throughout the
night, apparently to intimidate them from planning a return to
their villages.
	   ``There's nobody there'' in the villages, said Fatmir Nuhaj, 27,
his arms wrapped around his young son's shoulders. ``It's only to
keep us from our homes.''
	   They complained that unarmed monitors will do them no good.
	   The Serbs, for their part, complain that the KLA rebels, who
declared a cease-fire, are continuing attacks on police in the
province.
	   A Serb police source who declined to give his name said three
policemen were wounded Wednesday and another one Thursday when they
were ambushed on a major Kosovo road, some 30 kilometers (20 miles)
west of the capital Pristina.
	   Among the demands Milosevic must meet by Saturday, the one in
which he appears to be the furthest from compliance is withdrawal
of his forces to levels before the crackdown began on Feb. 28.
	   A NATO official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Wednesday that some Yugoslav units remained in Kosovo. He declined
to say how many but said they far exceed the level required by
NATO.

World's first lion breeding center to be set up in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ India will set up the world's first
breeding center for Asiatic lions near the Taj Mahal by the end of
the year, zoo officials said Thursday.
	   The population of pure Asiatic lions is slowly dwindling as most
of the 25 lions in captivity in India are being mated with African
lions, diluting their gene pool.
	   ``The primary purpose behind setting up this breeding center is
to meet the rising global demand for purebred Asiatic lions,'' said
R.L. Singh, chief wildlife warden in the northern state of Uttar
Pradesh.
	   Singh hoped lions born on this farm can be exchanged for rare
wildlife species from other states and countries.
	   There are as many as 300 Asiatic lions in the Gir reserve forest
in western India. Under the country's wildlife protection laws,
those remaining in the wild cannot be taken away for zoos.
	   The proposed breeding farm in Agra, 180 kilometers (110 miles)
south of New Delhi, has been cleared by the Central Zoo Authority
of India. It will initially have three females and two males, which
should produce up to 10 cubs within two years, Singh said.

Estrada urges more support to stop discrimination against women in
</HEADLINE>
APEC &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
urged Asia-Pacific nations Thursday to continue moves to stop
discrimination against women in the economy and society.
	   ``We must make sure that the avenue of progress is wide enough
to accommodate all men and women, and in such a way that not too
many, least of all women, are facing the backs of the lucky few who
are at the head of the march,'' Estrada said.
	   Much progress has already been made in removing distinctions in
race, religion, color and class, Estrada said in a statement at a
ministerial conference of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum.
	   ``But the world has yet to make enough progress in looking at
gender and seeing that it is not a difference that should make a
difference,'' he said.
	   He said that in the Philippines, women still have to fight for
their rights but promised he will give them support.
	   ``I will be the last to deny that Filipino women still have less
in life. But I will be the first to make sure that they will have
more in law,'' he said.
	   In her opening statement at the two-day conference on women,
Philippine Vice President Gloria Arroyo said ``gender equity will
not evolve naturally'' and governments must take action to remove
discrimination.
	   ``Women will not be empowered by market forces if they do not
have the power to have themselves felt as a force in the market,''
she said. ``The market is not in the business of empowerment. It is
in the business of recognizing power already possessed.''
	   She said women's participation in the economy is being hampered
by their subordinate role in society.
	   Women are being relegated to household work, have fewer
educational opportunities than men, and face wage discrimination
and poor working conditions, she said.
	   Businesswomen also have less access to loans to boost their
enterprises than businessmen, Arroyo said.
	   Women's significant contributions to the economy also are not
properly measured and valued, she added.
	   She said the conference will urge leaders to integrate women's
issues in APEC programs, conduct gender impact analysis of all
projects of the economic grouping and ensure equitable
participation of women in all of its structures and forums.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The advisory board of Thyssen on
Thursday unanimously approved a merger with its longtime competitor
Krupp, in a deal that will create one of Europe's largest
companies.
	   Krupp approved the deal earlier this week.
	   The merger has been approved by European Union officials but
also requires a vote by stockholders and is expected to take effect
next March.
	   The combined company would be Germany's fifth largest industrial
concern, behind electronics giant Siemens and carmaker Volkswagen,
employing 180,000 people with 70 billion marks (dlrs 38 billion) in
annual sales.
	   Last year, the two companies merged their steel operations to
create Europe's largest steelmaker, in a move that led to talks on
a full merger.
	   Thyssen AG, based in Duesseldorf, has operations in capital
goods, manufactured products, trading and services, in addition to
steel.
	   Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp resulted from the merger of German steel
and engineering groups Krupp AG and Hoesch AG in December 1992.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It has been nearly four months since Anna
Kournikova injured her right thumb, and she still doesn't feel
right on the court.
	   ``I need to have some more match experience and get a lot of
matches in a row to try to get back to where I was before the
injury happened,'' Kournikova said during a conference call
Wednesday to announce she was the ninth player to qualify for next
month's 16-player Chase Championships at Madison Square Garden.
	   The 17-year-old Russian strained ligaments in her thumb when she
tumbled on a slippery grass court at Eastbourne, England, during
the quarterfinals against Steffi Graf. Kournikova managed to beat
Graf, but had to pull out of the semifinals of the Wimbledon
tuneup.
	   ``After it happened my hand was blue and green,'' said
Kournikova, who was sidelined for the next two months missing
Wimbledon.
	   Kournikova returned before the U.S. Open but in the six
tournaments since, she has not advanced past the quarterfinals. On
Tuesday, Kournikova lost in the first round at the European
Championships in Zurich, double-faulting 17 times in her loss to
Dominique Van Roost of Belgium.
	   Despite her recent troubles, this has been a breakthrough season
for Kournikova. She cracked the world's top 10 for the first time
before dropping out and is now No. 12, and she also scored wins
over six top-10 players this season.

``Boring, boring'' England win earns coach slight reprieve
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Glenn Hoddle kept his tenuous grip on the England
coach's job when his side dawdled to a 3-0 win over Luxembourg's
part-timers in Wednesday's Euro 2000 qualifier. But it came at the
expense of public respect.
	   Once again the players were booed off the field by their own
fans and that reaction was reflected in the tabloid Daily Mirror's
headlines after a less than impressive win over Luxembourg.
	   ``Boring, boring, Hoddle: Three jeers as fans turn on England
again.'' the paper said.
	   ``What a sorry shower of mismanaged, uninspired, disorganized
amateurs. And no, we're not talking about Luxembourg,'' the Mirror
splashed across its back page.
	   True, Hoddle went into the game with everything to lose.
Luxembourg had won only three of its previous 68 matches and has
lost 11 in a row. England desperately needed the win after losing
2-1 to Sweden in Stockholm and stumbling to a 0-0 tie with Bulgaria
at Wembley on Saturday.
	   The visitors were spared international humiliation in the sixth
minute when Luxembourg's Dany Theis sent a penalty shot over the
bar and into the stands, wasting a chance to go 1-0 up.
	   One commentator said England had been saved by the worst penalty
attempt in history.
	   But England recovered and scored first through the teenage star
Michael Owen in the 19th minute. Captain Alan Shearer added a
second goal with a penalty in the 40th minute and Gareth Southgate
scored in the final minute to add a touch of respectability to the
scoreline.
	   A big win would have saved face. But a mediocre victory over a
bunch of amateurs only served to increase calls for Hoddle's scalp.
	   The tabloid Sun newspaper said the angry fans chanted ``Boring,
boring Hoddle'' and ``What a load of rubbish'' as England
``scrambled and scraped to victory.''
	   The Sun reported that the abuse came just four days after Hoddle
was pelted with rubbish following the ``bore draw'' with Bulgaria.
	   England supporter David Timmin _ one of thousands who took time
off work and spent up to travel to Luxembourg and sit in the rain
watching the game _ was quoted saying England was a ``shambles and
an utter disgrace.''
	   ``I had to pinch myself because it looked like two pub teams
playing in a Sunday morning league,'' he said.
	   Under the headline ``You Lucky Hod'', the Daily Mail reported
that not even a three goal win saved Hoddle from the boos of a
dissatisfied army of travelling fans.
	   Yet the Evening Standard said Hoddle still had the full support
of his playing staff.
	   Hoddle is due to go into negotiations with the Football
Association within days to extend his contract and while he's
seemingly out of favor with the fans and the media, the players
have backed him.
	   The Standard quoted Phil Neville saying ``the boss has our total
support.''
	   ``We played well enough in the first half but playing two
matches in five days took its toll a bit in the second half,'' he
said.
	   Southgate was quoted saying Hoddle was starting the feel the
pressure.
	   ``It's time the players rallied around and lifted him. When the
fans jeer the boss, they are jeering us as well. It's a collective
thing. There is no doubt we are behind him,'' he said.
	   Darren Anderton said ``the booing (Wednesday) was a surprise
considering we won 3-0.''

	   LYON, France (AP) _ Saying he could wiggle his new fingers _ but
declining to do so for the cameras _ a man who underwent the first
hand transplant in decades said Thursday the operation was ``a
miracle.''
	   ``My hand is very fine,'' said 48-year-old Clint Hallam of New
Zealand. ``I've probably never been so well in all my life.''
	   Hallam smiled through a 40-minute news conference at the Edouard
Herriot hospital in this southeastern French city, except when the
subject of his criminal past was brought up.
	   News reports say Hallam is due to appear before an Australian
court in January on seven fraud-related charges, relating to a
marketing investment scam allegedly worth Australian dlrs 1 million
(U.S. dlrs 620,000.)
	   Hallam was serving a two-year sentence for fraud in New Zealand
when the accident occurred in prison _ not, as Hallam originally
claimed, at a building construction site.
	   At the news conference, he wore a plaster cast up to his elbow,
and his arm was propped up on a large white splint. The skin on his
new hand appeared slightly wrinkled.
	   Twenty-two days after the 13-hour operation, doctors said Hallam
was doing fine.
	   ``Mr. Hallam is in an excellent condition after the operation
and is showing no signs of complications,'' said Dr. Jean-Michel
Dubernard, co-head of the transplant team.
	   After transplants, patients must take anti-rejection drugs,
which can prove fatal since they supress the immune system. That in
turn raises the risk of infection, or even cancer.
	   The only other known hand transplant was in Ecuador in the
1960s, and the patient's body rejected the hand after two weeks. A
Kentucky hospital is planning an operation similar to Hallam's.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Contact Group of nations concerned with
Yugoslavia gave its full support Thursday to an agreement hammered
out with Belgrade on ending the crisis in Kosovo province.
	   The group of U.S., European and Russian officials also
maintained its support for the threat of NATO airstrikes in case
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't keep his word, said
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   But there remained Russian resistance to a new U.N. resolution
specifically authorizing airstrikes against their historic ally,
Germany's foreign minister said.
	   The agreement reached Monday between Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke ``has the full support of the Contact Group,''
Vedrine told a news conference after the meeting.
	   NATO has threatened air strikes on Milosevic's Serb army
positions unless they pull out of Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanian rebels are fighting for independence from Serb-dominated
Yugoslavia. Milosevic has been given until Saturday to begin
complying.
	   In the accord, Milosevic has also agreed to peace talks, a
verification group, cooperation with war crimes investigators, the
unhindered humanitarian shipments and the return of refugees to
their homes.
	   Hundreds of thousands of refugees in heavily Albanian Kosovo
face a deadly winter if the conflict doesn't end soon.
	   When asked if the air strike threat remained strong, Vedrine
said the Contact Group ``is the same state of mind, but we observe
that things have begun to move and we remain extremely vigilant.''
	   The group discussed coordination between NATO air surveillance
and the 2,000-member verification group, Vedrine said.
	   They also agreed on the need for a new U.N. Security Council
resolution ``to endorse the accord,'' and that discussions ``must
begin immediately,'' he said.
	   British and Russian proposals were on the table, Vedrine said,
without elaborating.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told a news briefing the
Russians opposed a U.N. resolution backing airstrikes, but Russia's
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov sought to finesse any disagreement.
	   ``We are satisfied that our partners have come to support our
point of view,'' he told another separate news briefing.
	   ``Our position is that the essence of the resolutions of the
Security Council must be fulfilled by the authorities of Yugoslavia
and the representatives of the Kosovar Albanians. The solution can
only be political.
	   ``Any efforts to force the issue by military means will only
have negative consequences,'' he said.
	   Ivanov left open the possibility Russia would join in NATO-led
overflights to verify Serb compliance, once the Atlantic alliance
and Yugoslavia agree on the plan.
	   Meanwhile, several nations were offering to participate in the
verification mission. Germany on Thursday offered up to 200
monitors, Britain 200 people, France an undetermined number, and
Russia was expected to provide monitors.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's seven-month-old crackdown
against the separatists in the southern Serbian province.

British shipbuilders penalized for delay in delivering frigates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Britain's Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd.
has paid an undisclosed sum for delays in delivering two missile
frigates to Malaysia's navy, outgoing naval chief Rear Adm. Ahmad
Ramli Nor said Thursday.
	   The shipyard had been scheduled to deliver the two warships in
March 1996 under a 1.4 billion ringgit (dlrs 350 million) deal
signed in 1988.
	   Ahmad Ramli said Yarrow now has fixed delivery dates for the
ships in May and August next year.
	   Both sides have cited the sophistication of the various systems
on board as the main reason for the delays.
	   Ahmad Ramli said the navy was confident that the shipyard would
be able to solve all the problems and deliver the ships as
scheduled next year.
	   The two frigates are to be fitted with some of the most modern
weapons available, including the Bofors 40mm cannon and Seawolf air
defense missiles.

Constitutional Court to rule on whether Yeltsin can run again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in 3rd graf that court will take at least week to
consider case. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Constitutional Court opened hearings
Thursday on whether Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term.
	   The issue was controversial earlier this year when Yeltsin
refused to spell out his intentions and his aides insisted he had
the legal right to seek re-election.
	   It has lost some of its urgency, as Yeltsin has grown physically
and politically weaker and has said he will not run again. The
court will take at least a week to consider the issue, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The Russian Constitution has a two-term limit for presidents.
But Yeltsin's aides say his first term, from 1991 to 1996, does not
count because it began six months before the Soviet Union collapsed
and before the current constitution took effect.
	   Communists and other Yeltsin opponents in parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, disagreed and appealed to the Constitutional
Court in February.
	   While the case has been waiting to be heard, events have
overtaken it.
	   Yeltsin has flatly said he will not seek another term, and the
opposition has concentrated its efforts on demanding an early
resignation, riding a wave of popular discontent over the economic
crisis.
	   The call for Yeltsin to step down was backed by many
participants in a nationwide labor action earlier this month that
attracted about 1 million people.
	   Yeltsin's growing health problems would also seem to rule out
another election campaign. A respiratory infection forced him to
cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this week.
	   On Wednesday, parliament's upper chamber, the Federation
Council, voted on a resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign, but it
failed narrowly.
	   Even if had passed, the move would have had no legal
consequences, but it highlighted growing anti-Yeltsin sentiments in
the chamber made up of powerful regional leaders, most of whom have
been loyal to the president.
	   Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative on the
Constitutional Court, said Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore calls
for an early resignation.
	   ``The president is a strong person, and he has been through far
more difficult political situations,'' Mityukov said, according to
Interfax.

Russia to bring back holiday celebrating defeat of Japan in war

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The upper house of the Russian parliament voted
Thursday to reinstate a holiday marking the defeat of Japan in
World War II that was dropped after the fall of the Soviet Union, a
news agency reported.
	   The Federation Council agreed to reestablish the Day of Victory
Over Militarist Japan, which marks the Soviet Union's defeat of
Japan on Sept. 3, 1945, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The measure requires President Boris Yeltsin's signature to
become law. It has already been approved by the lower house, the
State Duma.
	   The vote came just one day before Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura was scheduled to arrive in Russia for a two-day
visit.
	   One of the main reasons for Komura's trip is to work on a peace
treaty formally ending World War II, which the two countries never
signed.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has promised that a treaty will be
signed by 2000, although it hinges on solving a dispute over the
Kuril Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off
Russia's Pacific coast.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who is to hold talks
with Komura, told the Federation Council after its vote that the
government approves of the measure reinstating the holiday.
	   Meanwhile, Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said
Russian-Japanese relations ``are on the rise and are becoming
increasingly constructive,'' the Interfax news agency said.
	   Karasin met Thursday with Japan's ambassador to Russia to
discuss disputes over fishing off the Kurils, which Japan also
claims, ITAR-Tass said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French high school students were staging a day of
protests throughout France on Thursday, keeping up the pressure on
the leftist government to cut class sizes and buy more equipment.
	   By mid-afternoon, an estimated 200,000 students were in the
streets. In Bordeaux in the southwest, 20,000 students were
marching. In Rennes in the north, 10,000 were out in force, and a
similar number rallied in Caen in Normandy.
	   About 20,000 marched in the capital, where the protest was
marred by violent incidents. Youths smashed windows and vandalized
stores near Place de la Nation, a square in eastern Paris where the
students gathered early in the day. About 30 were arrested.
	   Police were prepared for the worst. At the Boulevard du
Montparnasse in southern Paris, and along the route to the
Education Ministry, riot police with shields waited for trouble.
	   The students shouted slogans criticizing Education Minister
Claude Allegre.
	   ``Allegre, you're finished, the high schools are in the
streets,'' one slogan went.
	   But the Paris protest ended in mid-afternoon in a drizzling
rain, when the students agreed to disperse before reaching the
Education Ministry. Allegre agreed to meet them later in the day.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Police sealed off streets around
parliament building Thursday as legislators debated a no confidence
motion which, if successful, could lead to the collapse of
President Daniel arap Moi's 20-year rule.
	   A police source said authorities were determined to ensure there
would be no gathering outside parliament by supporters of
politicians who backed or opposed the motion.
	   Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union party has a majority
in the 222-member house and could easily garner the 113 votes
needed to defeat the motion.
	   ``We will defeat them thoroughly by a large, large majority,''
said Minister of East African and Regional Cooperation Nicholas
Biwott as he entered the parliament building.
	   ``Wait and see. They will have to be taught a lesson.''
	   However, the motion was raised during a nationwide teachers
strike as well as during the East African nation's worst economic
crisis since independence in 1963.
	   There is also growing dissatisfaction among Muslim legislators,
who have traditionally either belonged to KANU or supported Moi,
but who have lately been accusing his government of ignoring the
interests of Kenya's Muslims, estimated at between 5 and 30 percent
of the population of 29 million.
	   The no-confidence motion, to be presented by James Orengo of the
opposition FORD-Kenya party, is the third against a Kenyan
government. The other two, unsuccessful motions were presented
against the government of Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta,
in 1964 and 1967.
	   As vice-president, Moi assumed office on Kenyatta's death in
1978. Single-party rule was instituted after a failed coup attempt
by non-commissioned air force officers in 1982.
	   Orengo's motion is based on a constitutional clause that permits
any legislator to request parliament to vote ``Yes'' or ``No'' on a
motion that says ``this house resolves and declares it has no
confidence in the government of Kenya.''
	   If the motion is carried, Moi has two options: he can resign and
seek a new mandate in presidential elections while the parliament
remains seated, or he can remain president, dissolve parliament and
call general elections.
	   Moi is president as well as an elected member of parliament.
	   If he does neither, parliament must then dissolve itself on the
fourth day after the vote.
	   On Tuesday, the Safina opposition party urged Moi to form a
government of national unity to last four years. His current
presidential term expires in 2002.
	   Safina leader Paul Muite said no government formed by any single
political party could fight corruption in high places and enact the
constitutional and economic reforms necessary to get Kenya out of
the mess it is in..

KLA representative: NATO should go ahead with airstrikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ NATO should demonstrate with airstrikes its
seriousness in pressing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
meet international demands on Kosovo, a political representative of
the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army said Wednesday.
	   ``There must be strikes because Milosevic knows no language
other than force,'' Swiss-based representative Bardhyl Mahmuti told
reporters.
	   He accused Milosevic of building up forces in Kosovo and defying
the conditions of the accord reached this week with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke to end turmoil in the troubled Yugoslav province.
	   ``The agreement reached between Milosevic and Holbrooke only
serves Milosevic,'' Mahmuti said. ``There's no real progress on the
ground.''
	   ``There can be no bargaining on our demands,'' Mahmuti said,
referring to the KLA's demand for full Kosovo independence. ``No
one can make agreements on the status of Kosovo without the
participation of the KLA.''
	   He indicated that the organization's ceasefire, declared last
week, wouldn't hold indefinitely.
	   ``If the international community ... tries to create the
illusion that Serbia is conforming with the demands of the (United
Nations) resolution, we won't be able to tolerate it for long,''
Mahmuti said.
	   In a Sept. 23 resolution, the U.N. Security Council demanded a
cease-fire, the withdrawal of special Serb police units from the
province, and movement toward a negotiated settlement. It demanded
the safe return of refugees and humanitarian access to them.
	   The council threatened unspecified action if both sides failed
to comply.

President asks parliament to review law on judiciary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's president asked parliament on
Thursday to review a new law reforming the country's judiciary,
saying it gives too much power to the government legal officials.
	   President Petar Stoyanov said parliament should review those
parts of the new law which allow the minister of justice to
discipline or punish members of the judiciary.
	   Under current legislation all legal officials _ judges,
prosecutors and investigators _ are appointed, dismissed or moved
in rank by the 25-member Higher Judicial Council, which is elected
partly by parliament and by a representative panel of the legal
profession.
	   Stoyanov also opposed a provision that entitles the minister of
justice to approve the judiciary's budget. Now this is a
prerogative of the council.
	   The new law was adopted in parliament but requires the
president's signature to get enacted.
	   Stoyanov said investigators who handle pre-court criminal probes
should remain independent from courts to which the law attaches
them.
	   Bulgaria's legal system has drawn mounting criticism for being
slow, bureaucratic and byond public control. Politicians and media
have repeatedly alleged corruption among legal officials as crime
mushroomed. Only a small number of criminal cases reach the courts
and end with a verdict.
	   Stoyanov's move only suspends enactment, but parliament does not
have to comply with the president's demands.

EU clears accord with Japan on anti-dumping inquiries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission on
Thursday cleared an accord between the EU and Japanese computer
chip industries aimed at quick settlements of anti dumping cases.
	   In a statement, the Commission said the agreement between the
European Electronic Components Manufacturers and the Japanese
Electrical Industries Association will not threaten competition in
the European chip industries.
	   The agreement calls for the creation of a common database on
prices and supply of certain kinds of chips, to be used when an
anti dumping case is brought by either side.
	   The chip makers believe that the database will help to reach
rapid settlement in such case.

Hong Kong police seize largest ever haul of `ice' and heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Authorities seized more than 170 kilograms (375
pounds) of high-grade drugs in a waterfront raid early Thursday,
the largest haul ever in Hong Kong, police officials said.
	   Four men aged between 31 and 41 _ two from Hong Kong and two
from mainland China _ were arrested shortly after loading several
bags and cartons from a river boat into a car, they added.
	   More than 160 kilograms (352 pounds) of methamphetamine
hydrochloride _ or `ice' _ and 14 kilograms (31 pounds) of
high-grade heroin were found in the trunk of the car in Hong Kong's
red-light Sham Shui Po district, Superintendent Philip Wong told
reporters.
	   The drugs had an estimated value of 9.3 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.2 million), a statement released after the
raid said.
	   Wong said the ``ice'' was on its way to Southeast Asia, while
the heroin was for local consumption.
	   Hong Kong authorities have cracked down heavily on production
and distribution of illicit drugs, forcing drug syndicates run by
triads _ or Chinese gangs _ to smuggle increasing amounts of the
finished product from China.
	   The drugs usually are hidden on fishing boats that ply the Pearl
River Delta between Hong Kong and the southern mainland Chinese
province of Guangdong.

Prime minister: fiscal deficit is too high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India has managed to avoid the worst
ailments of other Asian economies, but needs to control its deficit
and shed unprofitable industries to stay healthy, the prime
minister said Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called on his top economic
advisors to formulate a program to raise tax revenue, trim spending
and make the financial sector ``more resilient to shocks.''
	   The economy is expected to grow by 6.3 percent this fiscal year
ending March 31, up from 5.1 percent last year _ a rate no other
Asian country will achieve while keeping inflation in check,
Vajpayee said.
	   But the fiscal deficit is ``unacceptably high,'' Vajpayee said.
This year's deficit is forecast at 6.1 percent of gross domestic,
against a target of 5.6 percent for next year.
	   He was speaking to the Economic Advisory Council, a newly formed
body of businessmen and policy makers mandated to recommend policy
and ways to carry it out.
	   As have all governments elected this decade, Vajpayee called for
a restructuring of publicly owned industries. ``The losses of these
enterprises is a fiscal drain and we cannot afford this,'' he said
in a prepared speech.
	   Previous administrations were stymied in their efforts to
disinvest in companies, many of which have strong unions and
provide employment in undeveloped areas. Vajpayee gave no
indication how his 6-month-old government would fare any better.
	   He boasted that while Asian currencies have undergone turmoil,
India's foreign exchange markets were kept ``relatively orderly.''
The rupee dropped sharply when India was hit by economic sanctions
for exploding a nuclear device in May, but now has recovered
slightly to stand 16 percent lower than at the beginning of the
year.
	   The prime minister restated his government's goals: a growth
rate of 7-8 percent over the next three years and an increase in
industrial growth by up to 13 percent. Exports, which currently are
shrinking by nearly 3 percent, should rise by up to 15 percent,
Vajpayee said.

Iraqi girl returns home after cancer treatment in Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi girl who was treated in Scotland
for leukemia arrived home Thursday.
	   The 4-year-old Mariam Hamza, who has lost her hair from
chemotherapy, was accompanied by her grandmother and the British
member of parliament, George Galloway, who took her to Scotland in
April and raised the funds for her treatment.
	   ``Mariam is well now, thank God, they all took good care of her
(in Britain) and they all hoped for sanctions to be lifted,'' her
grandmother, Faten Hamid, said with tears in her eyes.
	   Mariam's group arrived at al-Rashid military airport on a
private plane from Amman, Jordan. The plane had been granted an
exemption from U.N. sanctions on air travel to Baghdad to spare her
the 10-hour drive across the desert.
	   ``This is one of the happiest days of my life,'' Galloway said.
``When we left here six months ago, this child was at death's
door.''
	   Mariam's father, Hamza Abid Mita'b, met her at the airport.
	   ``I hope the happiness which I feel now will be for all Iraqi
parents with sick children,'' he said, his voice choking with
emotion.
	   Galloway, a member of the Labor Party, has long campaigned for
the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council has said the
sanctions will be lifted once Iraq has shown that it has eliminated
all its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
	   The legislator had arranged for Mariam to be treated in
Scotland. He has said he wanted to highlight the plight of the
Iraqi public under the embargo.
	   An Iraqi-British physician, Foutouh Binyamin, who accompanied
Mariam to Jordan, said Wednesday that her cancer was in remission
and she was recovering.

NATO plans to send Solana, top allied commanders to Belgrade

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Solana leaving for Belgrade &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; With BRU101 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary Javier Solana and two
top commanders flew to Belgrade Thursday to sign an air
surveillance deal for Kosovo, part of a peace accord for the
Serbian province.
	   Solana also carried a stern message for Slobodan Milosevic,
telling the Yugoslav leader to honor a deal _ forged this week by
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke _ to withdraw troops from
Kosovo, begin peace talks with ethnic Albanians and allow 2,000
monitors into the province.
	   ``The information that we have is that that compliance is still
not a reality ... although some efforts have been made,'' Solana
said to reporters earlier Thursday.
	   ``I will send (Milosevic) a very clear message,'' he added.
	   ``And that is that the solution to the problem (in Kosovo) is
not signing papers but to comply with agreements that have been
achieved.''
	   Last Tuesday, NATO issued orders for airstrikes to begin at
0500GMT on Saturday unless it Milosevic shows he is serious about
restoring peace and stability to Kosovo.
	   Accompanying Solana was NATO's top military commander in Europe,
U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Klaus Naumann, a German general who
heads NATO's panel of chiefs of staffs from the 16 alliance
nations.
	   Before leaving, Solana said Milosevic was not acting fast enough
to withdraw special police forces from Kosovo for refugees to feel
confident they can return home in safety.
	   ``It is very important for (refugees) to return to their
villages. For that, compliance with the withdrawal of troops is
very, very important. We'll keep our eyes and ears open,'' he said.
	   His comments contrasted with those on Wednesday by U.S. State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin who said American and European
monitoring teams in Kosovo reported a much smaller Serb police
presence in the Kosovo countryside than on Sunday.
	   Yet on Wednesday, NATO officials said the alliance would likely
keep in place its Oct. 13 airstrikes order beyond Saturday, the
deadline for compliance with the Kosovo peace accord. A decision on
effectively extending the airstrikes order is to be made on Friday.
	   In addition to allowing 2,000 peace monitors on the ground,
Belgrade must let unarmed NATO spy planes into the airspace over
Kosovo to check on compliance with the agreement from the air.
	   NATO planned to use high-flying eye-in-the-sky planes such as
U-2s and P3 Orion aircraft.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has been
asked to provide the 2,000 ``compliance verifiers.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A wary NATO and world leaders kept
up the pressure Thursday on President Slobodan Milosevic, saying he
needs to withdraw more Serb forces by Saturday's deadline or face a
renewed threat of airstrikes.
	   About halfway through the four-day grace period given Milosevic
to show he's met international demands on ending Kosovo turmoil,
NATO's chief said the Yugoslav leader was making progress toward
compliance but still had a ways to go. That came amid new
accusations by refugees of Serb police intimidation.
	   Secretary-General Javier Solana and two top commanders left for
Belgrade later Thursday to sign an air surveillance deal for Kosovo
and reinforce that he is not yet complying with the accord reached
this week with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   ``I would send a very clear message'' to Milosevic, Solana in
Brussels, Belgium, before leaving. ``And that is that the solution
to the problem is not signing papers but to comply with agreements
that have been achieved.''
	   International officials also huddled in Paris and Vienna on
Thursday as part of the assessment process to make sure Milosevic
is keeping his word.
	   In Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency delivered more aid to those
displaced by the crackdown in the secessionist Serbian province,
which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   In the town of Kisna Reka, refugees living in a makeshift camp
of 3,000 people in a nearby gully carted off 50-kilogram
(110-pound) sacks of flour, bags of clothing, cooking oil and other
supplies delivered by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Asked how long they could stay in the woods, a man who gave his
name only as Rexhep said: ``Until we die. We don't know how much we
can take. We are afraid to go back.''
	   International efforts to restore more stability to Kosovo moved
forward Thursday.
	   Two top NATO commanders _ U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Germany's
Klaus Naumann, chairman of the alliance's military committee _ flew
to Belgrade along with Solana.
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia, meeting in Paris, fully endorsed the agreement on Kosovo
but maintained its support for airstrikes if Milosevic fails to
comply.
	   The accord reached Monday by Holbrooke with Milosevic to end his
seven-month crackdown on Kosovo Albanians ``has the full support of
the Contact Group,'' French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said
afterward.
	   Later, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
was to approve the verification mission it will oversee in Kosovo.
The move will authorize Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek,
the OSCE chairman, to sign an agreement on the mission with
Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade on Friday.
	   The verification mission was a key part of the Kosovo deal.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio will
present the winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Literature with
Portugal's highest honor normally reserved for heads of state, news
reports said Thursday.
	   Sampaio was to request a special bill allowing Jose Saramago to
receive the Great-Necklace of the Order of Sant'Iago of the Sword,
the daily newspaper Publico reported.
	   ``The prize is his. Ours is the pride in Saramago, a great
Portuguese writer,'' Sampaio said, adding that the laureate had
``given our literature and the Portuguese language outstanding
prominence and great prestige.''
	   At another tribute late Wednesday at the Belem Cultural Center,
near Lisbon, Saramago was overwhelmed when greeted by a crowd of
more than 1,500, Publico said.
	   ``Right now, I feel like the humblest creature on earth.
Everything feels greater than me,'' Saramago said, according to
Publico.
	   Saramago, 75, was the first Portuguese writer to win the
literature honor. His latest novel translated into English is
called ``Blindness''.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A wary NATO and world leaders kept
up the pressure Thursday on President Slobodan Milosevic, saying he
needs to withdraw more Serb forces from the Kosovo province by
Saturday's deadline or face a renewed threat of airstrikes.
	   About halfway through the four-day grace period given Milosevic
to show he's met international demands on ending turmoil in the
secessionist province, NATO's chief said the Yugoslav leader was
making progress toward compliance but still had a ways to go. His
assessment came as ethnic Albanian refugees accused Serb police of
intimidation.
	   The alliance planned to send its secretary-general, Javier
Solana, and two top commanders to Belgrade to sign an air
surveillance deal for Kosovo and reinforce their view that he is
not yet complying with this week's accord negotiated by U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke.
	   ``I would send a very clear message'' to Milosevic, Solana said
Thursday in Brussels, Belgium. ``And that is that the solution to
the problem is not signing papers but to comply with agreements
that have been achieved.''
	   International officials also gathered Thursday in Paris and
Vienna as part of the assessment process to make sure Milosevic is
keeping his word.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes during Milosevic's crackdown against the
Kosovo Liberation Army, which seeks independence for the mostly
ethnic Albanian province.
	   In Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency delivered more aid to those
displaced by the crackdown in the southern province in Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   In the town of Kisna Reka, refugees living in a makeshift camp
of 3,000 people in a nearby gully carted off 50-kilogram
(110-pound) sacks of flour, bags of clothing, cooking oil and other
supplies delivered by the U.N. High Commission for Refugees.
	   Asked how long they could stay in the woods, a man who gave his
name only as Rexhep said: ``Until we die. We don't know how much we
can take. We are afraid to go back.''
	   International efforts to restore more stability to Kosovo moved
forward Thursday.
	   Two top NATO commanders _ U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Germany's
Klaus Naumann, chairman of the alliance's military committee _ were
set to fly to Belgrade with Solana.
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia met for several hours in Paris.
	   Later, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
was to approve the verification mission it will oversee in Kosovo.
The move will authorize Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek,
the OSCE chairman, to sign an agreement Friday with Yugoslav
authorities in Belgrade.
	   The verification mission was a key part of the deal Holbrooke
struck Monday with Milosevic to end his seven-month crackdown on
Kosovo Albanians.
	   Western nations were discussing naming Jacques Klein, the
American deputy to Bosnia's top international mediator Carlos
Westendorp, as head of the 2,000-person mission _ to be composed
largely of Europeans.
	   Britain has pledged to contribute 200 people to the verification
force, and both Russia and Germany are expected to make similar
contributions. But it's expected to take weeks to organize the OSCE
force.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped since the agreement, which put off the threat of impending
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   But with many reluctant to return home, Solana said troops are
not being withdrawn fast enough for refugees to feel confident
enough to go back.
	   ``It is very important for (refugees) to return to their
villages,'' he said. ``For that, compliance with the withdrawal of
troops is very, very important.''
	   At Kisna Reka, the refugees complained that Serbian security
forces fired machine guns, mortars and other weapons throughout the
night, apparently to intimidate them from planning a return to
their villages.
	   ``There's nobody there'' in the villages, said Fatmir Nuhaj, 27,
his arms wrapped around his young son's shoulders. ``It's only to
keep us from our homes.''
	   They said unarmed monitors will do them no good.
	   The Serbs, for their part, complain that KLA rebels, who
declared a cease-fire, are continuing attacks on police.
	   Serb police said three policemen were wounded Wednesday and
another one Thursday when they were ambushed on a major Kosovo
road, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital Pristina.
	   Among the demands Milosevic must meet by Saturday, the one in
which he appears to be the furthest from compliance is withdrawal
of his forces to levels before the crackdown began on Feb. 28.
	   A NATO official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Wednesday that some Yugoslav units remained in Kosovo. He declined
to say how many but said they far exceed the level required by
NATO.

Lukashenko meets with Milosevic's aide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
met with a senior aide to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on
Thursday in a show of support over the Kosovo crisis.
	   ``The situation around Yugoslavia is our pain, because we in the
former Soviet Union may become the next (victim),'' Lukashenko said
after holding closed-door talks with the aide, Zoran Lilic.
	   ``We can see such a trend in NATO's attitude toward us,''
Lukashenko was shown saying on Belarusian television. ``They see,
of course, that it would be more difficult for them to deal with
us.''
	   Lukashenko said he and Lilic discussed ``what precisely we must
do together to avert a war.''
	   Lukashenko, an autocratic leader openly nostalgic for the Soviet
Union, routinely defies the West.
	   Belarus and neighboring Russia oppose NATO airstrikes against
Serbia, which makes up most of present-day Yugoslavia, and favor a
negotiated settlement of the crisis in Kosovo province. Belarus,
Russia and Serbia share common Slavic roots and the Orthodox
Christian religion.
	   Lilic, speaking through an interpreter, thanked Lukashenko for
his support. ``You are the real and brave man,'' he said.
	   Lukashenko earlier offered to supply weapons to Yugoslavia if
NATO launches raids.
	   A group of Belarusian officials is currently in Yugoslavia
meeting with Serb officials. The team includes Lukashenko's son
Viktor, a college graduate who has just joined the Belarusian
Foreign Ministry.

Government troops raid southern Philippine marijuana plantation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SULU, Philippines (AP) _ Police and soldiers raided a major
marijuana plantation Thursday in a southern Philippine hinterland
but several armed men guarding it were able to escape, a police
official said.
	   Police said they uprooted at least two truckloads of marijuana
plants in the four-hectare (9.8-acre) plantation in a remote
mountain area near Maimbung town, Sulu province.
	   Sulu police chief Esa Hasan said plantation guards escaped after
apparently being tipped by informers in several villages where the
raiders' convoy passed.
	   The plantation had been under surveillance for at least a month,
Hasan said, adding that it was the source of most marijuana
supplied in Sulu. The confiscated marijuana plants were to be
burned Friday in a police camp in the province.
	   The Philippines is the biggest source of marijuana in Asia and
the second largest in the world after Mexico, according to the
International Narcotics Control Board.

Gov't transfers four sick separatist prisoners back home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's government made its first
conciliatory gesture to Basque separatists who declared a
cease-fire last month, agreeing Thursday to transfer four prisoners
of the militant group ETA closer to their home.
	   Prison authorities said the four, who are all ill, would be
transferred from eastern and southern jails to the northern Basque
Country for imprisonment and treatment in hospitals. A statement
did not say when the prisoners would be moved.
	   The policy of dispersing ETA's 535 prisoners around the country
_ in some cases hundreds of miles (kilometers) from their families
in the northern Basque region _ is one of the most contentious
issues in the Basque conflict.
	   The decision to transfer the prisoners was greeted as the
government's first gesture of goodwill towards the truce that ETA
announced on Sept. 18.
	   Before the announcement, the government had repeatedly said it
would not respond to the ETA truce until Oct. 25 regional elections
in the Basque country.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people during its 30-year campaign for
an independent Basque nation straddling northern Spain and southern
France. The group's name is an acronym in the Basque language for
Basque Homeland and Freedom.
	   Supporters of Basque independence draw parallels between ETA's
cease-fire announcement and the Northern Irish peace process, which
has attracted significant international support.
	   From the opposite corner Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja,
the minister responsible for internal security, appealed Wednesday
to European governments while he was in Strasbourg to leave the
resolution of conflict entirely in the Spanish government's hands.
	   The four ETA prisoners to be transferred are Fernando Diez
Torres, Miguel Angel Vazquez de Luis, Pedro Juan Guridi Arocena,
Francisco Javier Etxeverria Gonzalez.

Group backs accord and airstrike threat, but Russians hedge

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Contact Group of nations concerned with
Yugoslavia gave full support Thursday to an agreement on ending the
crisis in Kosovo, though disagreement appeared over a proposed U.N.
resolution to strengthen it.
	   The U.S., European and Russian officials also maintained support
for the threat of NATO airstrikes in case Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic doesn't pull his troops out of the province,
said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   But the Russians opposed a new U.N. resolution specifically
authorizing airstrikes against their historic ally, said Germany's
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.
	   The agreement reached Monday between Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke ``has the full support of the Contact Group,''
Vedrine told a news conference after the meeting.
	   When asked if the air strike threat remained strong, Vedrine
said the Contact Group ``is the same state of mind, but we observe
that things have begun to move and we remain extremely vigilant.''
	   NATO has threatened airstrikes on Milosevic's Serb army
positions unless they pull out of Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanian rebels are fighting for independence from Serb-dominated
Yugoslavia. Milosevic has been given until Saturday to begin
complying.
	   In the accord, Milosevic has also agreed to peace talks, a
verification group, cooperation with war crimes investigators, the
unhindered humanitarian shipments and the return of refugees to
their homes.
	   Hundreds of thousands of refugees in heavily Albanian Kosovo
face a deadly winter if the conflict doesn't end soon.
	   The Contact Group agreed on the need for a new U.N. Security
Council resolution ``to endorse the accord,'' he said.
	   British and Russian proposals were on the table, Vedrine said,
without elaborating.
	   Kinkel told a news briefing the Russians opposed a U.N.
resolution backing airstrikes, but Russia's Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov sought to finesse any disagreement.
	   ``We are satisfied that our partners have come to support our
point of view,'' Ivanov told another separate news briefing.
	   ``Our position is that the essence of the resolutions of the
Security Council must be fulfilled by the authorities of Yugoslavia
and the representatives of the Kosovar Albanians. The solution can
only be political,'' he said.
	   ``Any efforts to force the issue by military means will only
have negative consequences,'' he added, saying Russia was ``deeply
convinced that NATO would make a major contribution'' if it dropped
its air strike threat.
	   Ivanov left open the possibility Russia would join in NATO-led
overflights to verify Serb compliance, once the Atlantic alliance
and Yugoslavia agree on the plan.
	   Meanwhile, several nations were offering to participate in the
verification mission. Germany on Thursday offered up to 200
monitors, Britain 200 people, France an undetermined number, and
Russia was expected to provide monitors.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's seven-month-old crackdown
against the separatists in the southern Serbian province.

Government favors settlement of state gas crisis claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The government of Victoria state
favored an out-of-court settlement for residents seeking damages
stemming from a gas crisis that cut supply to Australia's second
most populous state for almost two weeks, Premier Jeff Kennett said
Thursday.
	   Kennett said he preferred a settlement over a class action being
prepared against gas supplier Esso.
	   ``If that (settlement) is a possibility, then we might take it
on board and work with Esso to that end,'' Kennett said in a radio
interview.
	   The crisis followed a Sept. 25 explosion and fire at Esso's
Longford plant, in southeast Victoria, which killed two people and
shut down most of the state's gas supplies for nearly two weeks.
	   Immediately after the explosion, law firms scrambled to lodge
class actions against Esso on behalf of businesses and individuals
affected by the crisis.
	   Kennett said his office had examined the case of Auckland, New
Zealand, which experienced a three-week power blackout earlier this
year.
	   In that case, law firm Slater and Gordon, which has already
begun litigation against Esso, launched a class action on behalf of
Auckland residents and businesses against power company Mercury.
	   The case resulted in an out-of-court settlement, including
refunds and discounts on power bills, within weeks of the blackout
and before litigation had started.
	   Slater and Gordon partner Nick Styant-Browne said Thursday his
firm would happily look at any compensation package Esso put on the
table.
	   ``If it provides fair compensation, I'll say to my clients,
`Let's go,''' Styant-Browne said.
	   ``If it's not fair, I'll say, `Let's litigate.'''
	   He said the decision to settle was up to Esso and not Kennett,
adding that there had been no indication from Esso it would make an
offer.
	   Meanwhile Thursday, a national business insurance agency,
Interruption Underwriting Agencies, estimated lost sales by
industry and commerce stemming from the crisis at about 600 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 370 million).

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The NATO chief headed to Belgrade on
Thursday to sign a Kosovo air surveillance deal with Slobodan
Milosevic's government and deliver another warning: Withdraw your
troops so villagers can return, or face the consequences.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said that
despite some progress the Yugoslav leader has a long way to go to
meet NATO's Saturday deadline for compliance.
	   ``I would send a very clear message'' to Milosevic, Solana said
before leaving Brussels, Belgium, accompanied by two NATO generals.
``And that is that the solution to the problem is not signing
papers but to comply with agreements that have been achieved.''
	   International officials also huddled in Paris and Vienna on
Thursday to push ahead the assessment process aimed at making sure
Milosevic adheres to the breakthrough agreement reached this week
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   In Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency delivered more aid to those
displaced by the seven-month crackdown in the secessionist Serbian
province, which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   In the town of Kisna Reka, refugees living in a makeshift camp
of 3,000 people in a nearby gully carted off 50-kilogram
(110-pound) sacks of flour, bags of clothing, cooking oil and other
supplies delivered by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Asked how long they could stay in the woods, a man who gave his
name only as Rexhep said: ``Until we die. We don't know how much we
can take. We are afraid to go back.''
	   International efforts to restore more stability to Kosovo moved
forward Thursday.
	   Two top NATO commanders _ U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark and Germany's
Klaus Naumann, chairman of the alliance's military committee _ flew
to Belgrade along with Solana.
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia, meeting in Paris, fully endorsed the agreement on Kosovo
but maintained its support for airstrikes if Milosevic fails to
comply when a four-day grace period expires Saturday.
	   But the Russians opposed a proposed new U.N. resolution
specifically authorizing airstrikes, said Germany's Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel.
	   Later, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
met to approve the verification mission it will oversee in Kosovo.
The move will authorize Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek,
the OSCE chairman, to sign an agreement on the mission with
Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade on Friday.
	   The verification mission was a key part of the Kosovo deal.
	   Western nations were discussing naming Jacques Klein, the
American deputy to Bosnia's top international mediator Carlos
Westendorp, as head of the 2,000-person mission _ to be composed
largely of Europeans.
	   Germany and Britain have pledged to contribute 200 people each,
officials said Thursday, and Russia and others were expected to
send similar amounts. But it's expected to take weeks to organize
the OSCE force.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement. But with many
reluctant to return home, Solana said troops are not being
withdrawn fast enough for refugees to feel confident enough to go
back.
	   ``It is very important for (refugees) to return to their
villages,'' he said. ``For that, compliance with the withdrawal of
troops is very, very important.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's crackdown.
	   At Kisna Reka, the refugees complained that Serbian security
forces fired machine guns, mortars and other weapons throughout the
night, apparently to intimidate them from planning a return to
their villages.
	   ``There's nobody there'' in the villages, said Fatmir Nuhaj, 27,
his arms wrapped around his young son's shoulders. ``It's only to
keep us from our homes.''
	   They said unarmed monitors will do them no good.
	   The Serbs, for their part, complain that the Kosovo Liberation
Army is continuing attacks on police.
	   Serb police said three policemen were wounded Wednesday and
another one Thursday when they were ambushed on a major Kosovo
road, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital Pristina.
	   A KLA representative warned Thursday that the rebel force won't
adhere to its cease-fire indefinitely.
	   ``If the international community tries to create the illusion
that Serbia is conforming with demands ... we won't be able to
tolerate it for long,'' said Swiss-based representative Bardhyl
Mahmuti in Geneva.

Media clampdown goes on in Serbia, despite protests

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The authorities ordered closure
Thursday of a major independent daily, Nasa Borba, in a continuing
crackdown on opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic's hard-line
rule, despite strong protests at home and abroad.
	   Privately owned Fininvest company, which publishes Nasa Borba,
was ordered to stop publishing the newspaper, assistant editor
Petar Petrovic told The Associated Press. Otherwise, authorities
threatened to seize its equipment, he said.
	   The daily allegedly violated a recent decree brought by Serbian
government under which any company, especially media, can be banned
or punished for doing anything contrary to the government's view of
patriotic behavior.
	   Officially, the decree is a temporary measure because of the
ethnic warfare in southern Kosovo province and the resulting NATO
threats of military intervention.
	   But with two other major dailies shut down this week, an
independent radio station evicted from its premises and a ban
imposed on news programs in Serbian language produced abroad, the
decree has opened way for a serious crackdown on political
opponents.
	   In Serbia, state-run electronic media enjoy a monopoly on
broadcasting nationwide. Small, local TV stations and FM radios,
together with struggling independent papers, serve as a small
counterweight to the propaganda of government media.
	   The government claimed the situation regarding the Kosovo crisis
and NATO threats was made worse by foreign and domestic independent
media reports. The decree gives the government a free hand to
intervene whenever it deems that ``national interest'' is
jeopardized.
	   Petrovic said Nasa Borba is blamed for allegedly violating the
decree by three recent articles: publishing a statement by a
watchdog group about human rights abuse in Serbia, a report from a
press conference by an ethnic Albanian secessionist leader, and a
commentary posing the question why the authorities provide aid only
for Serb and not also for Albanian children in Kosovo.
	   Petrovic said Nasa Borba will ignore the order. That could
result in the physical shutdown of its premises like what happened
to two other dailies, Dnevni Telegraf and Danas which also tried to
defy the authorities.
	   The journalists and several hundred others outraged by the
crackdown gathered in downtown Belgrade on Thursday to protest.
	   ``Milosevic is using the NATO threats as an opportunity to clamp
down freedom of speech in Serbia,'' said Ivan Markovic, a leader of
last year's anti-Milosevic protests that lasted for months.
	   ``We are defending from dictatorship that is getting stronger
every hour. We are against the state terror. We want democracy
which is impossible without independent media,'' Rade Radovanovic,
Danas editor said at the rally.
	   Strong protests against the crackdown came from democratic
opposition parties in Serbia, Vienna-based Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, London-based International
Center Against Censorship, several non-government organizations,
Greek diplomats in Belgrade, from the office of Britain's prime
minister Tony Blair, UN Commission for Human Rights and from
Serbia's dethroned monarch, crown prince Aleksandar.

	   In Vienna, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe agreed formally Thursday to oversee the 2,000-member
``ground verification mission'' -- unarmed monitors who will roam
through Kosovo to make sure terms of the agreement with Holbrooke
are being honored.
	   The OSCE said in a statement that its current chairman, Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, will sign the ground
verification agreement Friday in Belgrade with Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic.

 &UR; Westwood moves through to quarterfinals
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with all results

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Lee Westwood reached the
quarterfinals of the World Match Play Championship, eliminating
Stuart Appleby of Australia 8 and 7 in Thursday's first round.
	   Colin Montgomerie also got through, defeating Thomas Bjorn 4 and
3, and Ian Woosnam beat Darren Clarke 4 and 3. In the final match,
Patrik Sjoland defeated Steve Stricker 1-up.
	   Westwood plays three-time champion Ernie Els in Friday's
quarterfinals. In the other matchups, it's Montgomerie against Mark
O'Meara, Woosnam playing Tiger Woods, and Sjoland faces defending
champion Vijay Singh.
	   In the most dramatic finish of the day, Sjoland hit his 90-yard
third shot on the par-5 18th (36th hole) to 18 inches (one half
meter) and was given the putt. Stricker chipped his third from the
fringe to 12 feet (4 meters) and then missed his birdie putt.
	   But it was Westwood who was the story.
	   The 25-year-old Englishman shot 8-under 64 on the first 18,
dropping four straight birdie putts _ between 10 and 15 feet (3 and
5 meters) _ on eight, nine, 10 and 11 to break the match wide open.
	   ``All parts of my game are on song,'' Westwood said.
	   ``When you shoot 12-under for 29 holes, it can't help but boost
your confidence.'' he said.
	   Appleby, despite shooting 67, trailed by three holes after 18
and fell four behind when Westwood sank a 25-foot (8 meter) birdie
putt on the 20th hole.
	   Westwood finished 12-under for 29 holes. Appleby was 4-under.
	   Westwood has won five times this season _ four in Europe and one
in the United States _ and is No. 2 on the European money list with
714,812 pounds (dlrs 1,215,180). He trails Colin Montgomerie by
45,000 pounds (76,000) entering the season-ending Volvo Masters
(Oct. 29-Nov. 1).
	   Montgomerie, leading by one hole after 18 but all-square after
23, broke his match open with three straight birdies on the 24th,
25th and 26th _ all in the eight-foot range (3 meters) _ to take a
decisive three-hole lead.
	   Montgomerie was given a penalty during his first 18 when, on the
seventh hole, he and Bjorn drove nearly side by side. Playing
preferred lies because of the wet fairways, the Scot picked up a
ball to mark it _ only to learn it was Bjorn's.
	   The error came when spotters _ who let the crowd know which ball
is which _ got it wrong.
	   ``It's unbelievable something like this could be allowed to
happen,'' said Montgomerie, who went on to concede the hole.

Pope defends church's central truths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Sounding a battle cry for his 20th
anniversary as pope, John Paul II rallied his church Thursday
against assaults on its fundamental beliefs, saying such attacks
have sowed confusion and even despair among Roman Catholics.
	   He spoke out in an encyclical, one of the most important
documents a pope can issue, warning against the temptations posed
by some modern schools of philosophy and theology.
	   It did not go into specifics of church teaching for which John
Paul has repeatedly demanded fidelity. But it summed up one of the
central themes of his long papacy _ that there are unshakable
truths and that positions that ``question the certitudes of faith''
must be rejected.
	   The 154-page document, the 13th encyclical of John Paul's
papacy, was timed for the 20th anniversary Friday of his election
as pope. Thousands of pilgrims from his Polish homeland were
converging on Rome for celebrations, when John Paul becomes one of
only a dozen popes to have served at least two decades.
	   The encyclical is titled ``Fides et Ratio,'' Latin for ``Faith
and Reason,'' and grapples with the issue of religion in the modern
world, when expectations have been raised by scientific and
technological progress. It stresses that faith and reason are not
incompatible.
	   He said mankind has always asked such questions as ``Who am I?
Where have I come from and where am I going? Why is there evil?
What is there after this life? ''
	   But today some Catholics risk ``losing their way in the shifting
sands of widespread skepticism'' while ``many people stumble
through life to the very edge of the abyss without knowing where
they are going,'' John Paul said.
	   ``At times, this happens because those whose vocation is to give
cultural expression to their thinking no longer look to the truth,
preferring quick success to the toil of patient inquiry into what
makes life worth living.''
	   It was addressed to his bishops, in effect a call to action for
the proper education of Catholics.
	   At a Vatican news conference, Polish Archbishop Jozef Miroslaw
Zycinski was asked about New Age philosophy and interest today in
UFOs and astrology. Although the pope didn't mention them, the
archbishop dismissed them as representing ``the intellectual
paucity of our era.''
	   John Paul did cite agnosticism and relativism, saying they were
among doctrines that ``tend to devalue even the truths that had
been judged certain.''
	   Other threats, he said, come from the philosophy that
``relegates religious, theological, ethical and aesthetic knowledge
to the realm of mere fantasy.''
	   Although 78 and ailing, John Paul has shown every intent of
pushing ahead with his papacy, the longest this century.
	   The leader of the world's 1 billion Roman Catholics is preparing
his church for the start of Christianity's third millennium in
2000, as well as keeping up his global travel. He is scheduled to
visit Mexico and the United States in January and has repeatedly
expressed the hope to visit Christianity's holy sites in the Middle
East.
	   A recent crackdown on theologians underlined that John Paul saw
no room for debate over such issues as the ban on women becoming
priests.
	   During a September visit to the birthplace of Pope Paul VI, John
Paul praised his predecessor for going against the tide of the
times and retaining the church's ban on contraception in a 1963
encyclical.
	   The pope wrote in the encyclical that he encouraged scientific
progress but that it ``should be wedded to the philosophical and
ethical values that are the distinctive and indelible mark of the
human being.''

Explosion near oil refinery kills one, injures another
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more detail throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MATOSINHOS, Portugal (AP) _ An explosion near an oil refinery in
this northern coastal town killed one fisherman, seriously injured
another and left an oil slick in the port area, officials said
Thursday.
	   The explosion occurred Wednesday at 11.20 p.m. (2220 gmt) as a
tanker discharged crude into a refinery owned by the Petrogal
company in Matosinhos, some 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of
Lisbon.
	   Petrogal chairman Manuel Ferreira de Oliveira said the tanker
was offloading its oil too fast through a recently-installed
pipeline, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   The ship, bearing a Malta flag, spilled 100 to 200 thousand
liters (25,000-50,000 gallons) of crude into the sea, Lusa quoted
Ferreira de Oliveira as saying.
	   A build-up of gases in the area was thought to have followed
leading to the explosion, Matosinhos fireman Simoes Duarte said.
	   ``The fishermen must have smelled something and went over to see
what was going on. One of them might have been smoking or might
have lit a match,'' he said.
	   Petrogal spokesman Antonio Mocho said the refinery was still
operating because the equipment was undamaged.
	   Petrogal _ Petroleos de Portugal S.A. _ is Portugal's largest
petroleum company. It has two refineries with a capacity of 300
thousand barrels per day, providing the local market with 85
percent of its local petroleum products.
	   ``Petrogal needs to stop its procedures here and check to make
certain that it is meeting Portuguese and European regulations,''
Matosinhos mayor Narciso Miranda told Lisbon radio TSF.

Greek church leaders probe fiscal troubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Greek Orthodox Church will consider
sending two bishops to a disciplinary committee as part of probes
into fiscal scandals involving the church's vast fortune, church
leaders said Thursday.
	   The scandal made headlines earlier this year when church
officials revealed about dlrs 2 million were missing from church
accounts.
	   Two lay employees of the church returned the money, reports
said. But church leaders promised that clergymen who supervised
them would also be held accountable.
	   The most recent meeting, or synod, of 80 church leaders also
looked into the alleged mismanagement of four billion drachmas
(dlrs 14 million) given by the Greek state. Several clergymen are
accused of not following proper procedure in administering the
funds.
	   Meanwhile, the entire scope of church finances is under scrutiny
by a state prosecutor, whose probe includes allegations of
embezzlement.
	   The internal investigation has placed a spotlight on the
church's vast fortune, whose precise size is a closely kept secret
but is estimated to exceed dlrs 1 billion. It includes real estate
in some of Greece's most expensive areas, at least one hotel and a
mine.
	   The synod members will examine whether to refer two bishops to
an ecclesiastical court, which can impose penalties ranging from
suspension from attending mass to demotion, said a church
spokesman, Rev. Theoklitos Koumarianos. No date for a final
decision has been given.
	   Any conclusions reached by the religious court would not affect
the investigation conducted by the prosecutor.
	   ``This is about spiritual penalties,'' Koumarianos noted.
``Criminal penalties are a matter for civil justice.''
	   Other subjects discussed during the synod, which began Oct. 9,
touched on possible easing of church practices.
	   Church leaders ruled that individual priests could decide
whether to conduct funeral services for those who have married in a
civil ceremony.
	   According to church rules, those who did not marry in a
religious ceremony could not have a funeral or memorial mass. Most
Greek Orthodox priests ignored the rule, and those who adhered to
it often caused public outrage.
	   But the synod did not touch upon the subject of priestly
fashion.
	   Earlier this month, the head of the union of parish priests had
complained that the dress code of black robes, stovepipe hats and
long beards was causing problems for seminarians looking to marry.
	   Greek Orthodox priests can be married as long as the wedding
occurred before their ordination.
	   Orthodoxy is Greece's official religion and more than 90 percent
of the country is baptized in the church.

Jewish group takes over old synagogue in Arab Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A group of right-wing Israelis group cleared
dirt and stones Thursday out of an abandoned synagogue in an Arab
neighborhood of east Jerusalem, prompting anger from Palestinians.
	   Israeli lawmaker Benny Elon, along with several members of his
extreme right-wing Moledet party, raised Israeli flags over the
partially destroyed building.
	   Arab neighbors and Palestinian legislators gathered outside and
briefly scuffled with the group before Israeli police broke them
up.
	   ``This is Palestine, this is a provocation and dangerous,'' said
Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
	   ``This is Jewish land,'' Elon charged back.
	   Elon said the building along with the surrounding land, is
Jewish property. He said the group decided to restore the synagogue
because Arab building in the area had harmed the property.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war, later annexed it and encouraged thousands of Jews to move to
the eastern sector, altering its demographic nature.
	   Elon said the synagogue will be restored as a place of worship
only and that Jews would not move in.
	   But Palestinians were weary of the promise. Elon is active in
settling Jews in east Jerusalem, and other areas captured by Israel
in the same war.
	   ``This is a Palestinian area and it is not wise for them to
settle here,'' said palestinian Minister of Jerusalem Affairs,
Faisal Husseini. ``This is very dangerous and that is why there is
a peace process so such issues would be settled,'' he said, adding
that if Jews were allowed to reclaim property, the same right
should be accorded to Palestinians, who have lost property and land
through several wars.

	   PARIS (AP) _ High school students staged a day of sometimes
violent protest throughout France on Thursday, keeping up the
pressure on the leftist government to cut class sizes and buy more
equipment.
	   By mid-afternoon, an estimated 200,000 students were in the
streets in about a dozen cities. In both Paris and Bordeaux in the
southwest, at least 20,000 students were marching, while 10,000
marched in both Rennes and Caen in the north.
	   Youths smashed windows in Paris and Rouen. In Paris, authorities
reported four injuries, including two police officers, and 82
arrests. Both officials and organizers blamed the violence on
hooligans who were not part of the protest.
	   In Grenoble, a student was seriously injured in the head and
back when he broke through a crowd barrier and was struck by a
tram, authorities said.
	   Police were prepared for the worst. At the Boulevard du
Montparnasse in southern Paris, and along the route to the
Education Ministry, riot police with shields waited for trouble.
	   The students shouted slogans criticizing Education Minister
Claude Allegre. ``Allegre, you're finished, the high schools are in
the streets,'' one slogan went.
	   But the Paris protest ended in mid-afternoon in a drizzling
rain, when the students agreed to disperse before reaching the
Education Ministry. Allegre agreed to meet them later in the day.

WTO cooling growth predictions because of economic turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Trade Organization has scaled back its
predictions of trade growth for this year because of the sharp
economic slowdown in Asia, officials said Thursday.
	   WTO experts have trimmed their predictions to a 4 percent growth
in world trade volume this year, down from the 7 percent they were
projecting last spring, said Patrick Low, the organization's chief
economist.
	   WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said the main reason for the
revised estimate has been the persistence of ``the economic
doldrums in Japan'' and the wider effects in Asia.
	   ``Clearly the impact of the global financial crisis is being
felt in the trade arena,'' Rockwell told The Associated Press.
	   ``Asia, which has been a major engine of trade growth, has been
hit very hard by this crisis,'' he said. ``The result is that the
trade numbers in many countries are not what we had hoped them to
be.''
	   Volume growth probably will slow even further to 3 percent for
1999, Low said, but added that the situation is in such flux that
no one really knows for sure.
	   Trade measured in dollars will actually shrink, Low said. The
first half of the year ran 2 percent behind the 1997 pace for the
same period, and the figure for the full year is also likely to be
less than for 1997.
	   Low noted that he said last March it was ``too early to say with
any great confidence'' how much impact the Asian crisis would have.
	   At that time, he said, WTO economists thought the growth in
world trade has been so robust that it might be able to withstand
much of the braking effect of the Asian financial crisis.

Another top presidential adviser steps down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Franjo Greguric, a top adviser to
President Franjo Tudjman, stepped down Thursday, joining a list of
moderates purged from the ruling party.
	   Greguric, a former premier, said that his resignation was a
logical step after being bullied by Tudjman's ruling Croatian
Democratic Union for accusing right-wingers of abusing the nation's
counter-intelligence to discredit moderates in a power struggle.
	   A parliamentary commission led by the ruling party dismissed the
allegations Tuesday despite objections from opposition deputies on
the panel.
	   Rejection of the accusations demonstrates ``that those who
identify abuse of power and the need to redress it in the interest
of democracy are punished,'' Greguric wrote in his letter of
resignation carried by the state-run HINA.
	   ``Perhaps those behind high and freshly accumulated capital are
battling frantically to safeguard their plunder or have risen high
enough to dictate politics,'' Greguric said, alluding to
longstanding rumors of corruption and nepotism in high echelons of
power.
	   The apparent victory of the nationalists in the ruling party has
also unsettled the minority Serbs in Croatia who have long harbored
suspicions against those in power.
	   ``Serbs are justified in fearing for their status as the crisis
in the ruling party unravels,'' said Milan Dukic, president of the
splinter Serb People's Party.
	   Greguric's departure follows two other key resignations _ by the
former Minister of Defense, Andrija Hebrang, and the chief of the
presidential cabinet, Hrvoje Sarinic.
	   Hebrang stepped down unexpectedly Monday to protest hard-liners'
resistance to reforms in the defense sector.
	   Sarinic, a loyal presidential aid since the authoritarian leader
rose to power in 1991, also broke ties with Tudjman Friday in a
demonstration against growing extremist tendencies within the
party.
	   A split has existed for years in Tudjman's ruling party between
pro-Western reformers and hard-line nationalists who oppose broader
democratic reforms and are suspicious of Western ideas.
	   Tudjman's decision to let Greguric go was a clear indication
that the 76-year-old leader has opted to back the hard-liners, a
move likely to lead to even more rigid rule in a country often
criticized by the international community for failing to promote
democracy.
	   Greguric, a mild-mannered strategist who led Croatia's wartime
coalition government in 1992, was also Tudjman's senior adviser for
neighboring Bosnia.

Renowned German circus director Adolf Althoff dead at 85
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOLBERG, Germany (AP) _ Adolf Althoff, a prominent member of
Germany's legendary circus family once honored for saving a Jewish
couple from the Nazis, has died, city officials announced Thursday.
He was 85.
	   Althoff died of heart failure Wednesday evening. He had been
admitted to a hospital for treatment of a fracture two weeks ago in
Stolberg near Aachen where he lived, city officials said in a
statement.
	   Born into a traditional circus family, Althoff formed his own
circus along with a sister at the age of 21. A performer himself,
Althoff led the circus to international fame after World War II,
traveling throughout Europe and even to the United States.
	   During the Nazi era, Althoff concealed the identity of two
performers who were Jewish, Irene and Peter Bento, to save them
from persecution. Irene Bento worked as a trick rider, and her
husband as a clown.
	   In 1995, Althoff and his wife Maria were honored by the Yad
Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel for saving the couple's lives.
	   Althoff turned over his operation to his son Franz in 1965, but
remained involved and continued with his wife to join the circus on
the road periodically, right up until last month.
	   He is survived by his wife and son. Funeral services are planned
for Tuesday in Stolberg.

German prosecutors seek tougher sentence for ``Mehmet''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Prosecutors in the southern German
city of Munich appealed Thursday against a jail term handed down to
a young Turkish delinquent, saying they wanted a tougher sentence.
	   The 14-year-old, identified only as ``Mehmet,'' was convicted
last week of robbery and causing bodily harm and sentenced to one
year in jail.
	   Suspected of more than 60 offenses, Mehmet became an
election-year symbol for Germans demanding action against
``criminal foreigners.''
	   Although born and raised in Munich, Mehmet is considered Turkish
under German citizenship laws.
	   The boy's residence permit ran out in July and city officials
have refused to extend it. A Munich court will rule next week if
the refusal was legal.
	   An attempt by authorities to deport Mehmet's parents, who have
lived in Germany for 30 years, was rejected earlier by Bavaria's
state administrative court, which ruled that the parents couldn't
be punished for their son's wrongdoing.
	   German law allows deportation of any foreigner sentenced to a
year or more in prison.

Jewish group takes over old synagogue in Arab Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A group of right-wing Israelis group cleared
dirt and stones Thursday out of an abandoned synagogue in an Arab
neighborhood of east Jerusalem, prompting anger from Palestinians.
	   Israeli lawmaker Benny Elon, along with several members of his
extreme right-wing Moledet party, raised Israeli flags over the
partially destroyed building.
	   Arab neighbors and Palestinian legislators gathered outside and
briefly scuffled with the group before Israeli police broke them
up.
	   ``This is Palestine, this is a provocation and dangerous,'' said
Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
	   ``This is Jewish land,'' Elon charged back.
	   Elon said the building along with the surrounding land, is
Jewish property. He said the group decided to restore the synagogue
because Arab building in the area had harmed the property.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war, later annexed it and encouraged thousands of Jews to move to
the eastern sector, altering its demographic nature.
	   Elon said the synagogue will be restored as a place of worship
only and that Jews would not move in.
	   But Palestinians were weary of the promise. Elon is active in
settling Jews in east Jerusalem, and other areas captured by Israel
in the same war.
	   ``This is a Palestinian area and it is not wise for them to
settle here,'' said palestinian Minister of Jerusalem Affairs,
Faisal Husseini. ``This is very dangerous and that is why there is
a peace process so such issues would be settled,'' he said, adding
that if Jews were allowed to reclaim property, the same right
should be accorded to Palestinians, who have lost property and land
through several wars.

Viagra goes on sale in France pharmacies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Viagra became available in France Thursday, but the
French didn't appear to be rushing to pharmacies just yet.
	   In fact, many pharmacists said they wouldn't keep it in stock
until customers begin to order it.
	   By mid-afternoon, a big pharmacy behind the Champs-Elysees
hadn't made a single sale of the anti-impotence drug the French are
calling the ``blue miracle pill.''
	   ``So far, no one has asked for it,'' said Gabriel Gain-Prieur, a
pharmacist's assistant. ``But I'm sure people will start to come in
_ it's an unusual drug.''
	   Gerard Cohen, owner of a pharmacy in the posh residential 17th
district, said he sold a total of 28 pills _ all to two foreign
customers.
	   Pills cost 75 francs (about dlrs 15) each and are sold in boxes
of four or eight. They are not reimbursed by the national health
insurance program.
	   About 10 percent of French males, roughly 1.4 million men
between the ages of 18 and 69, are estimated to suffer from a form
of impotence.
	   Pfizer, the U.S. pharmaceutical giant which manufactures Viagra,
expects to tap into a European market of about 15 million.
	   The drug is available in Britain, Germany and Switzerland. It is
expected to go on sale in Belgium before Christmas, and will be
available in Romania in four to five weeks, health officials said
Thursday.
	   Not everyone in the land of the highly touted French lover was
overjoyed at Viagra's arrival.
	   Writing in the daily Liberation, Gabriel Cohn-Bendit rejected
the concept that manhood is a function of sexual prowess. The
retired professor attacked what he described as the ``tyranny of
coitus.''
	   ``To hell with Viagra,'' he wrote.

Incoming German government to seek end to nuclear energy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS share of electricity produced by nuclear energy; ADDS
industry reax, additional details &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Jobs &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Social Democrats and Greens, working to
form a new center-left government, said Thursday they were close to
a deal to pull the plug _ eventually _ on nuclear energy in
Germany.
	   Signaling another major shift in German policy under the new
government, party leaders said they would enshrine the principle of
a complete abandonment of nuclear energy into law in their first
100 days in office. Current legislation promotes the use of nuclear
power.
	   The small, environmentalist Greens party platform calls for an
immediate start to plant closures, although the pace laid out after
the talks reflected the Social Democrats' more moderate approach.
	   In what party leaders called a compromise, the future governing
partners agreed to open talks with the nuclear industry next year
on shutting down the country's 19 atomic power plants.
	   But if no consensus with industry can be reached by November
1999, Greens party leader Juergen Trittin said the new government
will enact legislation setting a timetable for closing the plants.
No specific deadline was set.
	   ``This is the exit from atomic energy,'' Trittin declared.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has talked about a process
lasting as long as three decades, but Trittin insisted ``a series
of atomic power plants will go off line in this legislative
period,'' meaning the next four years.
	   One-third of Germany's electricity is produced by nuclear
energy. Power companies argue shutting them prematurely would
result in higher prices and force them to rely more on burning oil
and coal, creating more pollution.
	   ``We have always said that we wouldn't turn our back on
consensual talks,'' said Hermann Venghaus, spokesman for industry
giant RWE. ``But we have always held the standpoint that nuclear
energy ... should continue to play an important role in the energy
mix.''
	   Share prices of German utilities fell sharply on news of the
deal.
	   The deputy chairman of the Social Democrats, Wolfgang Thierse,
said both parties want to end the use of atomic energy, ``whose
risks I don't have to describe anymore.''
	   The goal of the negotiations, he told German radio, would be to
work out a reasonable solution ``so that it doesn't come to
(forced) closings of nuclear power plants and damage claims against
the government and the taxpayer.''
	   After being backed for years by German law promoting the use of
nuclear energy, German utilities have already threatened to file
multibillion-mark lawsuits against any forced shutdowns.
	   In Sweden, where the government wants to close all nuclear
plants by 2010, attempts to turn off the first one this year have
so far been blocked in court.
	   In other developments:
	   _The Social Democrats and Greens agreed to let the new
parliament debate whether to proceed with a decade-old plan to
build a national Holocaust Memorial in Berlin.
	   Schroeder and his designated culture czar, Michael Naumann, have
expressed doubts about the memorial. Outgoing Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, one of its staunchest backers, put the sensitive project on
hold before the Sept. 27 election, saying he didn't want it to
become a campaign issue.
	   _ And Kohl's Christian Democrats criticized a major policy
departure announced by the incoming government Wednesday, saying
parts of the plan to liberalize Germany's citizenship law could be
unconstitutional.
	   CDU legal expert Rupert Scholz said allowing dual-citizenship on
a broad basis would give those who receive it ``massive
advantages'' over Germans with just one passport.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ As more unions joined a call for hefty
wage increases Thursday, the president of a key umbrella group for
employers warned the demands would kill jobs and damage Germany's
economy.
	   Analysts, meanwhile, warned the fight brewing between unions and
bosses could make it harder for Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder's to bring both sides together to fight unemployment _
the main objective he set for his incoming Social Democratic
government.
	   ``Going into wage talks with such a high demand gives the
impression the unions ... are seeking conflict and aren't ready for
this alliance,'' said Meinhard Miegel, director of the Bonn-based
Institute for Economy and Society.
	   Germany's biggest union, IG Metall, declared this week it was
through with the wage restraint of recent years. Citing healthy
profits achieved by many German firms, it said it would seek a 6.5
percent wage increase for the 3.4 million workers it represents.
	   Three more unions representing white-collar and service-industry
employees joined on Thursday, saying they would ask for more too.
	   With inflation running below 1 percent, most analysts say a wage
hike of 3 to 4 percent would be realistic.

Maskhadov calls on international community to recognize Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA  &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The president of Russia's breakaway
Chechnya region called on the United Nations and the European
Parliament Thursday to recognize an independent Chechnya.
	   In a statement to an international human rights conference,
Aslan Maskhadov said international recognition would help Chechnya
establish legitimacy as an independent state alongside other former
Soviet republics in the eyes of Moscow.
	   The statement was read by Chechen Foreign Minister Movladi
Udugov, who wore the traditional Chechen tall sheepskin hat, as
Maskhadov rested in his hotel room.
	   The statement also called on the international community to
establish an international tribunal to try those responsible for
crimes during the 1994-96 war with Russia. It did not name any
suspects.
	   Maskhadov won a landslide election victory in January 1997, but
during his time in office, Chechnya has seen a steep rise in
kidnappings and other crimes. No country has recognized Chechnya's
claims of independence, and Russia still considers it a
semi-autonomous Russian republic.
	   Maskhadov accused Russia of failing to keep its side of a peace
agreement ending the war, saying that Moscow regarded Chechnya as a
colony.
	   ``The Chechen nation would rather die than return to the
colonial past,'' Maskhadov's statement said.
	   During his five-day visit, Maskhadov is protected by a body
guard assigned by the Foreign Ministry. He, however, will not meet
with any government leaders to avoid straining Poland's relations
with its former communist-era big brother, Russia.
	   Maskhadov is attending the third international conference on
human rights, sponsored by the Polish parliament.

Hand transplant patient calls procedure a `miracle'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos
 &UR; Eds: AMs; recasts and adds details. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN PHILLIPS
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ A man recovering from a rare and risky hand
transplant said Thursday he's never felt better in his life.
	   During a 40-minute news conference at the Edouard Herriot
hospital in this southeastern French city, Clint Hallam wore a
plaster cast up to his elbow, and his arm was propped up on a large
white splint. The skin on his new hand appeared slightly wrinkled.
	   ``It's now a question of my mind saying, `I've got my hand
back,' said Hallam, 48, of New Zealand. ``There's certainly been no
pain at the present time.''
	   Asked if the new hand felt like his own, Hallam replied, ``Of
course it does.'' He said he never thought about the donor.
	   The only other known hand transplant was in Ecuador in the
1960s, and the patient's body rejected the hand after two weeks. A
Kentucky hospital is planning an operation similar to Hallam's.
	   Transplants can be risky because patients must take
anti-rejection drugs, which suppress the immune system. That in
turn raises the risk of infection, or even cancer.
	   Twenty-two days after the 13-hour operation, Hallam was in
``excellent condition,'' showing no signs of complications, said
Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard, co-head of the transplant team.
	   Hallam said he could move his fingers, but declined to do so,
saying he didn't want to strain the nerves. He did lift the fingers
with his left hand.
	   He smiled through the news conference, except when his criminal
past was brought up.
	   News reports say Hallam is to appear before an Australian court
in January on seven fraud-related charges, relating to a marketing
investment scam allegedly worth dlrs 620,000.
	   Hallam was serving a two-year sentence for fraud in New Zealand
when he lost his hand in a sawing accident in prison _ not, as
Hallam originally claimed to the press, at a building construction
site.
	   Hallam said he was fighting some of the charges but did not
provide details.
	   Dubernard told reporters the patient's legal history was
irrelevant.
	   ``In France, doctors don't normally ask patients for their penal
record before operating on them,'' the doctor said.
	   For five years, doctors had tried to fully reattach Hallam's
hand after the 1984 accident. In 1989, Hallam gave up and had
doctors amputate at the upper forearm.
	   Pleased with the outcome of the operation, his French doctors
plan to consult with teams in London, Milan and Sydney ``to try to
learn as much as possible about these pioneer operations.''
	   Doctors hope Hallam can return to Australia in December. In the
meantime, he will live near the hospital and report daily for
rehabilitation.
	   ``I've probably never been so well in all my life,'' Hallam
said.

Kuchma stresses need to complete two reactors before switching off
</HEADLINE>
Chernobyl. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine
reaffirmed Thursday that two new nuclear reactors must come on line
before the Chernobyl plant can be switched off for good.
	   ``We will switch off Chernobyl when the new blocks are put into
operation,'' Kuchma told the Austria Press Agency, referring to the
fourth reactor at the Rovno nuclear plant and the second reactor at
the Khmelnitskiy power station.
	   He said that his government was in favor of closing down
Chernobyl but that was not possible without providing for
replacement energy.
	   Kuchma spoke of an ``obligation'' by the European Bank for
Reconstrctuion and Development to grant a dlrs 180 million credit
toward completing the replacement reactors that are ``90 percent
finished.''
	   In the APA interview, Kuchma said it was, therefore, up to the
international community when the switch-off of Chernobyl actually
can take place.
	   However, he stressed, Ukraine was not waiting for disbursement
of the money but was working quietly with Russia toward completing
the two new reactors.

UEFA moves Red Star-Lyon match to Bucharest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Citing continued security concerns,
UEFA on Thursday moved Red Star Belgrade's UEFA Cup home match
against Lyon of France next week to Bucharest's Cotroceni stadium.
	   ``Given ... that the decision could not be postponed any
further, and that the current security risk in Yugoslavia has not
completely disappeared,'' the European governing body confirmed its
decision to move Tuesday's match to a neutral venue, UEFA said in a
statement.
	   ``UEFA cannot risk obliging players, referees, officials and
supporters to travel into Yugoslavia,'' it added, adding that many
countries are still advising their citizens not to enter the
country.
	   The move was prompted by the threat of NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia unless it complies with international demands over
Kosovo.
	   A final decision on Partizan Belgrade's Cup Winners Cup match
against Lazio of Italy on Nov. 5 will be taken next Thursday, UEFA
said.
	   ``UEFA hopes that by that time the political situation will have
improved to the extent that the ... match can be played in
Belgrade.''
	   UEFA has requested the Yugoslav soccer federation and Red Star
to make match arrangements with the Romanian federation and confirm
the kick-off time by Friday, the statement said.
	   But Red Star officials threatened Wednesday not to play the game
against Lyon if it is moved. They say the danger of air strikes is
gone as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday accepted
all international demands for the solution of the Kosovo crisis.
	   ``We either play in Belgrade, or we won't play at all,'' Red
Star's manager Dragan Dzajic said.

court over a plan forcing it to move its flights to Milan's
Malpensa airport from the more convenient Linate, a spokesman for
the airline said Thursday.
	   Swissair is challenging the plan on the grounds that it is being
discriminated against in comparison to European Union airlines,
spokesman Erwin Schaerer said. He also said the airline hadn't been
given enough notice of the Oct. 25 move.
	   After months of haggling, Italy and the European Union signed a
compromise accord last week that lets other EU countries' airlines
continue to use Linate airport for now.
	   Under Italy's original plan, presented in February, all foreign
airlines flying in and out of Milan would be obliged to move to
Malpensa. Only the Italian carrier Alitalia's shuttle flights
between Rome and Milan would have been exempted.
	   That was rejected by the EU Commission because it was seen as
violating European fair competition rules. Nine European airlines
complained that poor road and rail links from Malpensa to downtown
Milan would make their passengers switch to Alitalia.
	   The compromise allows EU airlines to keep 34 percent of their
flights at Linate until transport links to Malpensa are complete.
But non-EU companies such as Swissair won't benefit from it.
	   Malpensa is 53 kilometers (33 miles) from downtown Milan, while
Linate is just 10 kilometers (six miles) away.
	   The Swissair legal challenge will be heard Monday by the
Lombardy administrative tribunal, Schaerer said.
	   Three other carriers _ Turkish Airways, Royal Air Maroc and Air
Malta _ have also challenged the transfer order, Shaerer said.
Those hearings are also expected to take place Monday.

German plant opens to recycle high-tech waste
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Using the new technology of a
supersonic centrifuge, a high-tech waste plant started operating
Thursday in Rockensussra in Thuringia state.
	   The Trentec AG plant separates compound materials containing
metal and plastic synthetics, including computer scraps, cables or
automobile bumpers.
	   The recycling process separates waste materials based on the
varying strengths of their molecular bonds. Among the items
extracted from the waste are aluminum, copper, gold and a synthetic
granulate, the company said.
	   Dietrich Marquardt, the chairman of Trentec said, that what used
to be useless high-tech waste, will now be turned back into
valuable raw material.
	   About about 70,000 tons of compound waste can be processed
yearly in the 36 million mark (dlrs 22.5 million) plant, he said.
	   Germany, which has some of the toughest recycling laws in
Europe, has been encouraging private enterprise to come up with
better ways to reuse waste and Marquardt said that Trentec plans to
open a second high-tech recycling plant near Berlin next year.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO signed a Kosovo air
surveillance deal with Slobodan Milosevic's army Thursday, and the
Western military alliance's chief delivered another warning:
Withdraw your troops so villagers can return, or face the
consequences.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said that
despite some progress the Yugoslav president has a long way to go
to meet NATO's Saturday deadline for compliance.
	   ``I would send a very clear message'' to Milosevic, Solana said
before arriving in Belgrade Thursday evening, ``and that is that
the solution to the problem is not signing papers but to comply
with agreements that have been achieved.'' Solana was accompanied
by two NATO generals.
	   The air surveillance deal, signed in Belgrade between NATO's
Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and
Yugoslav Army Chief-of-Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic, calls for
unarmed spy planes to watch over Milosevic's compliance to withdraw
his troops from Kosovo and allow safe return of tens of thousands
ethnic Albanian refugees.

Canadian panel recommends ban on British blood donations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Concerned about a fatal disorder possibly linked
to mad cow disease, a private-sector bioethics committee Thursday
recommended that Canada's blood agency refuse to accept blood from
anyone who has lived in Britain since 1980.
	   The agency said it would not follow the recommendation.
	   The committee said it was concerned that people who ate British
beef could carry a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease _ a human
brain disorder which scientists say may be related to mad cow
disease.
	   Burleigh Trevor-Deutsch, head of the Bayer Corporation Advisory
Council on Bioethics, said people in Britain may have been exposed
to mad cow disease, which was present in some British beef before
the government took action against it in the mid-1990s.
	   The Bayer Corporation makes most of the blood products used in
Canada. It provides funding for the bioethics council, but says the
group has free reign to make independent judgments on issues
related to Canada's blood supply.
	   Trevor-Deutsch said there has been no proof that
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be transmitted through blood
products, but he said the lack of evidence doesn't mean there is no
such link. He urged the new national blood agency, Canadian Blood
Services, to take precautionary measures.
	   But the blood agency said refusing blood donations from anyone
who has spent time in Britain since 1980 would result in a severe
blood shortage in Canada. Any significant shortage would force
Canada to import blood from the United States, which hasn't
restricted British donors, the agency said.
	   In Britain, the Department of Health said it did not know of any
other country where similar concerns had been raised about British
blood donors.
	   The European Union banned British beef exports in March 1996
after Britain announced a possible link between mad cow disease and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which has killed 27 people in Britain since
1995.
	   Hundreds of thousands of cattle have been slaughtered and their
carcasses destroyed since March 1996.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police arrested two men Thursday in the bloody
kidnapping of an Italian industrialist after allegedly finding half
the dlrs 3 million ransom stashed in one of the men's account at a
Swiss bank.
	   Kidnap victim Guiseppe Soffiantini was freed in February after
seven months as hostage. His kidnappers had sent slivers of his
ears to his family and killed a policeman who tried to rescue him.
	   The alleged leader of the kidnapping, Giovanni Farina, was
caught at the Sydney airport in August.
	   On Thursday, police arrested criminal lawyer Antonio Carlo Maria
Mannironi in Rome and horse breeder Francesco Biagio Zizi in
Scansano, a city about 70 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Rome,
Italian media reported.
	   Police said the lawyer had about dlrs 1.5 million in dlrs 100
bills in an account at a Swiss bank, to which Zizi also allegedly
had access. In August, police said, some money from the account was
credited to an Australian account set up by the man arrested in
Sydney.
	   Authorities have frozen the Swiss account.

<TEXT>
	   STOLBERG, Germany (AP) _ Adolf Althoff, a prominent member of
Germany's legendary circus family once honored for saving a Jewish
couple from the Nazis, has died, city officials announced Thursday.
He was 85.
	   Althoff died of heart failure Wednesday evening. He had been
admitted to a hospital for treatment of a fracture two weeks ago in
Stolberg near Aachen where he lived, city officials said in a
statement.
	   Born into a traditional circus family, Althoff formed his own
circus along with a sister at the age of 21. A performer himself,
Althoff led the circus to international fame after World War II,
traveling throughout Europe and even to the United States.
	   During the Nazi era, Althoff concealed the identity of two
performers who were Jewish, Irene and Peter Bento, to save them
from persecution. Irene Bento worked as a trick rider, and her
husband as a clown.
	   In 1995, Althoff and his wife Maria were honored by the Yad
Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel and given the ``Righteous among
the Nations,'' awards for saving the couple's lives.
	   Althoff turned over his operation to his son Franz in 1965, but
remained involved and continued with his wife to join the circus on
the road periodically, right up until last month.
	   He is survived by his wife and son. Funeral services are planned
for Tuesday in Stolberg.

Lawyer files suit on behalf of king dead for 3,200 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A lawyer has filed suit to block a planned
move of a statue of the Pharoanic King Ramses II, claiming the
long-dead monarch spoke to him in a dream and opposed the move, a
court official said Thursday.
	   Moustafa Raslan filed suit against Culture Minister Farouk
Hosni, has who agreed to move the 10-meter (33-foot) granite statue
out of Cairo's traffic-clogged Ramses Square after long complaints
it was being damaged by pollution.
	   Ramses ruled Egypt from 1304 to 1237 B.C. His statue is to be
moved to a quieter location but no date for the move has been set.
	   The court official, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity, quoted Raslan's suit as saying that during the lawyer's
dream Ramses stated he wanted to ``look on his nation'' from the
square named for him.
	   Raslan has a history of filing law odd suits, including one
dismissed earlier this year that blamed Britain's Queen Elizabeth
II for the death of Princess Diana.
	   No one at the Culture Ministry could be reached for comment.
Cairo's court of urgent cases will hear the Ramses case Oct. 26.

Turkey investigating millions in privatization deals following
</HEADLINE>
mafia allegations &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's government was investigating all
the nation's pending privatization deals Thursday after the winning
bidder for a state-owned bank was taped talking to a mafia
godfather about potential rival bidders.
	   The development broadens a scandal over mob connections with
business and government that already has cost one Cabinet member
his job.
	   ``Privatization tenders are under scrutiny,'' Deputy Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit said following the government's decision to
suspend the dlrs 600 million sale of state-owned Turkbank to a
media tycoon.
	   Earlier this week, a lawmaker released tapes of a telephone
conversation between fugitive godfather Alaattin Cakici, wanted in
several killings, and businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who recently
acquired the Milliyet and Yeni Yuzyil daily newspapers.
	   On the tape, Cakici assured Yigit that he would fend off rivals
wanting to take part in the bidding for Turkbank.
	   Yigit has admitted that it was his voice on the tape but said he
was trying to keep the Turkish godfather out of the sale.
	   It was the first time that a project was halted over allegations
of mafia involvement. Turkey has acquired dlrs 3.2 billion from the
sales of state enterprises in 1998.
	   Cakici, a former nationalist terrorist, was arrested in France
in August. He had been traveling with four different false
passports, including a diplomatic one, raising suspicion that for
years he had been under the protection of Turkey's public
officials.
	   At least one intelligence officer was recalled to Ankara for
alleged ties with Cakici.
	   Government minister Eyup Asik resigned last month after a
similar taped conversation between himself and Cakici was released.
The tape suggested that the politician, a close aide of Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz, had tipped off the mafia boss about possible
attempts to arrest him. Asik denied wrongdoing.
	   Turkey has been rocked by allegations of secret dealings between
state officials and the underworld ever since a 1996 car crash that
killed a senior police official and a wanted fugitive and injured a
legislator from a ruling party. All three were riding in the
legislator's car.
	   A former interior minister, a deputy, a dozen policemen and an
army sergeant were later brought to trial over alleged connections
between the government and the mafia.

Camdessus upbeat on China, still ready to help Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of the International Monetary Fund said
Thursday that China is going in the right direction to reform its
banking and public sectors, and was right to have resisted the
temptation to devalue its currency.
	   Speaking at a conference organized by the French Banking
Association, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus also reaffirmed
that the Fund is ready to pump more money into Russia -- on
condition the Russian government developes a credible recovery
program.
	   The Chinese has made a ``wise choice'' in keeping their currency
steady despite political and economic pressures they came under as
a result of the Asian financial crisis, he told French bankers.
	   ``I don't believe China will devalue its currency any time
soon,'' Camdessus said. The Chinese central bank's recent layoffs
prove that the government is serious about cutting operational
costs, he added.
	   With 6 percent growth, China is still on ``a solid (upward)
slope,'' Camdessus said, adding that the country identified its two
main problems five years ago.
	   Camdessus said the Russian crisis is the same as the financial
crises in Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea.
	   The IMF, he said, is prepared to organize a new rescue package
for Russia, but said this will depend on the government developing
a credible recovery program. There will be no disbursement of fresh
funds from the IMF or friendly governments until a number of
``prior actions'' are taken and are seen to be working, he said.
	   Camdessus noted that no such program exists at the present time,
but stressed that the sooner a workable plan is drafted, the
better.
	   Camdessus reiterated the IMF's view that the pace of growth in
the world economy should pick up slightly in 1999, and that the
slowdown of the U.S. economy ``will be gradual.''
	   He also predicted that the ``domino of Latin America won't
topple.'' And he observed that his somewhat upbeat view, compared
to the gloom that inhabits many private-sector economists, is
partly based on the fact that India and China -- which together
represent one-third of the world's population -- remain on a 6
percent to 8 percent growth path.
	   ``Despite the panic and depression that are affecting financial
markets,'' he went on, ``we will avoid a world recession.''
	   The IMF has come in for criticism for its failure to foresee the
spread of the Asian crisis and to anticipate how it might
contaminate Russia and other countries, especially those in Latin
America.
	   Camdessus, responding, said that governments are also largely to
blame for withholding information, for fostering corruption and
nepotism and for allowing incestuous relationships between banks
and the business sector.
	   He decried what he termed a ``mediatic lynching'' that, he
suggested, had been ``somewhat Stalinistic.''

Williams reaches quarterfinals after four-day wait
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ American Venus Williams began play
after a four-day waiting period with a lackluster win over
compatriot Corina Morariu on Thursday at the dlrs 1 million
European Championships.
	   A qualifier last year, Williams arrived as second seed at the
European tournament _ which officially changed names to Swisscom
Challenge on Thursday _ and consequently received a bye into the
second round.
	   The powerfully-built 18-year-old, who also played a doubles
match later the same evening, took an hour and a half to defeat
Morariu 7-5, 6-3.
	   ``There's always the possibility it can hurt your game and you
become ``off'' if you start late in the tournament,'' said
Williams, who won her third career title two weeks ago at the Grand
Slam Cup in Munich. ``I never had to start this late before but I
worked hard and got some practice in, and I think I played well.''
	   Morariu played three qualifying matches to reach the main draw,
then posted a first round win over France's Sandrine Testud, who
defeated Lindsay Davenport in the final in Filderstadt last week.
	   The lanky American broke in the third game to go up 2-1, but a
gritty Morariu broke back immediately to regain her serve.
	   Williams had another break opportunity at 3-3, but squandered
five break points, permitting Morariu to remain on serve.
	   At 4-4 Williams again blew a chance to take the lead, pushing
Morariu to deuce eight times but wasting four break points.
	   Morariu continued to labor on her service game, again going to
deuce four times before allowing Williams to break and jump to a
6-5 lead.
	   The second set began similarly with the two players trading
serves before Williams broke twice more to lock up the match.
	   ``I have to get better when it comes to capitalizing on my
opportunities,'' said Williams, who reached the quarterfinals as a
qualifier last year before falling to eventual champion Davenport.
``I also made a lot of unforced errors which I need to improve
on.''
	   Williams, a semifinalist at the U.S. Open, will meet
seventh-seed Mary Pierce in the quarterfinals.
	   Though it was also Nathalie Tauziat's first match of the
tournament Thursday, the French player showed no signs of rust,
defeating American Lisa Raymond 6-2, 6-3 to book her place in the
quarterfinals.
	   ``I was a bit angry when I saw the schedule and I wasn't playing
until Thursday,'' said Tauziat, a finalist here last year. ``You
see everyone play, you see everyone win and defend their points and
it's very frustrating.
	   ``That's why I didn't watch any matches. I have big points to
defend here and I wanted to play.''
	   Eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost had no difficulty getting past
Amelie Mauresmo to reach the round of eight, defeating the French
player 6-3, 6-4.
	   Van Roost, who brought to and end Martina Hingis's reign atop
the world rankings when she defeated the Swiss star in the
quarterfinals at Filderstadt last week, will take on Irina Spirlea
in the round of eight.
	   New world No. 1 Davenport will play sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer
for a berth in the semifinals.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO signed a Kosovo air
surveillance deal with Slobodan Milosevic's army on Thursday, and
the Western military alliance's chief delivered another warning:
Withdraw your troops so villagers can return, or face the
consequences.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said that
despite some progress the Yugoslav president has a long way to go
to meet NATO's Saturday deadline for compliance.
	   ``I would send a very clear message'' to Milosevic, Solana said
before arriving in Belgrade Thursday evening, ``and that is that
the solution to the problem is not signing papers but to comply
with agreements that have been achieved.'' Solana was accompanied
by two NATO generals.
	   The air surveillance deal, signed in Belgrade between NATO's
Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and
Yugoslav Army Chief-of-Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic, calls for
unarmed spy planes to watch over Milosevic's compliance to withdraw
his troops from Kosovo and allow safe return of tens of thousands
ethnic Albanian refugees.

Amnesty International urges Britain to hold Pinochet for quizzing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Amnesty International called on Britain Thursday
to allow a Spanish judge to question former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet about allegations of genocide and international
terrorism.
	   ''This would be a clear manifestation of the British
government's commitment to human rights,'' Amnesty said in a
statement.
	   Pinochet is believed to still be in London after undergoing
surgery for a herniated disc last Friday at London Bridge Hospital.
The hospital refused to confirm whether he was a patient, and
British authorities have declined to comment on Pinochet's
whereabouts or the Spanish judges' request.
	   But Fernando Martinez Collins, Pinochet's press secretary, told
the Associated Press in Chile on Thursday that ``the general is in
Britain, in London, at the clinic.''
	   Pinochet's personal doctor, Henry Olivi, said, ``The general is
recovering, slowly but well.''
	   National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish
magistrates handling probes into human rights violations in Chile
and Argentina, has asked British police to prevent Pinochet from
leaving Britain until he is questioned.
	   The Spanish judges want to question Pinochet as part of their
probes into his 1973-1990 regime. They are investigating
allegations of murder and torture under Pinochet's rule and the
disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in Argentina during
the military dictatorships between 1976-83.
	   Pinochet is implicated in the Argentina probe through his
involvement in ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes
throughout Latin America's southern cone sought to coordinate
anti-leftist campaigns.
	   The Chilean government has said nothing about the judges'
request, but Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza noted that
Pinochet has a diplomatic passport and status, giving him immunity.
The government has previously said that Chile does not recognize
the authority of foreign courts over situations which occurred in
Chile.
	   Pinochet who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a
bloody 1973 coup, remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
until last March, when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a
post established for him by a constitution drafted by his regime.

Lawyer files suit on behalf of Egyptian king dead for 3,200 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A lawyer has filed suit to block a planned
move of a statue of the Pharoanic King Ramses II, claiming the
long-dead monarch spoke to him in a dream and opposed the move, a
court official said Thursday.
	   Moustafa Raslan sued Culture Minister Farouk Hosni, has who
agreed to move the 10-meter (33-foot) granite statue out of Cairo's
traffic-clogged Ramses Square after many complaints that it was
being damaged by pollution.
	   Ramses ruled Egypt from 1304 to 1237 B.C. His statue is to be
moved to a quieter location but no date for the move has been set.
	   The court official, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity, quoted Raslan's suit as saying that during the lawyer's
dream Ramses stated he wanted to ``look on his nation'' from the
square named for him.
	   Raslan has a history of filing law odd suits, including one
dismissed earlier this year that blamed Britain's Queen Elizabeth
II for the death of Princess Diana.
	   No one at the Culture Ministry could be reached for comment. The
court will hear the case on Oct. 26.

With Israel-Settlements, US-Mideast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Sharon said he will not shake Arafat's hand; Hamas planned new
attacks &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LATRUN, Israel (AP) _ Ariel Sharon, in charge of negotiating a
peace settlement with the Palestinians, said Thursday on his second
day as Israel's new foreign minister that he will not shake the
hand of Yasser Arafat, even at a crucial Mideast summit.
	   Sharon is scheduled to join the summit _ which began Thursday at
a retreat in eastern Maryland _ on Saturday, after most of the work
on a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal is to be wrapped up.
	   Sharon, a hawkish former general, leads the far-right camp in
Netanyahu's government which is opposed to the U.S. plan for a
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank. Israel TV said Sharon
chose to attend the summit late in order to review any agreements
reached before deciding whether to give his approval, something
which is essential for a plan to pass through Netanyahu's hardline
government.
	   Asked by a reporter Thursday whether he would shake Arafat's
hand at the summit, Sharon replied ``no.'' A similar statement in a
newspaper interview was made before Sharon was appointed foreign
minister in charge of leading negotiations with Arafat's
Palestinian Authority government.
	   Sharon did say however that he was committed to the peace
process.
	   ``I want to promise you that I'll make every effort, together
with my colleagues, to achieve peace with the Palestinians and with
all the rest of the Arab countries,'' he told reporters after
attending a memorial service for fallen Israeli soldiers.
	   In a telephone poll conducted by Israel's Channel 2 TV, a
majority of Israelis surveyed, 60 percent, said they believed the
Mideast summit would fail in finding agreement for an Israeli
withdrawal. Israel has made any deal contingent on Palestinian
compliance with a set of security demands. The margin of error and
number of people interviewed were not included in the report.
	   Also Thursday, Israel announced that two Palestinian militants
had been arrested by Palestinian police on their way to carrying
out a suicide bombing in Israel. A third Palestinian who holds
Israeli citizenship is being held by Israel as an accomplice.
Israel says the Israeli-Arab planned to drive the two Hamas members
to a crowded location where they were to blow themselves up,
according to court documents on the case made public Thursday.
	   The arrests were made 17 days ago at the Erez crossing point
between Israel and the Palestinian-run Gaza Strip.
	   Israel has said it received intelligence warnings that the
Islamic group, which opposes peace with Israel and has carried out
many deadly attacks in the past, was planning an attack in the
hopes of wrecking chances for success at the summit talks.

Martin, Kucera, Rusedski advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Rafter beating Sweden's Magnus
Norman, ADDS quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Australia's second-seed Patrick Rafter
moved into the quarterfinals of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP
tournament Thursday by ousting Magnus Norman of Sweden 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``I match up well with someone like Magnus,'' Rafter said after
his victory.
	   Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, has a chance of replacing Pete
Sampras as the top-ranked player in the world in the coming weeks.
	   One step in this direction could be Friday's quarterfinal
encounter with Britain's Greg Rusedski, whose powerful serve
stunned local darling Thomas Muster, who is a far cry from his
onetime prowess.
	   Rafter, who has a 5-1 head-to-head record against Rusedski,
said, ``I never played Greg on this surface, and I do not know how
I will react to his serve.
	   ``But I am confident there will be a couple of breaks here and
there,'' he added.
	   Rusedski, last year's finalist at the Vienna tournament, took 64
minutes to defeat Muster in straight sets 6-4, 6-3.
	   ``It's always difficult to play Thomas in Austria,'' said the
Briton afterward. ``But I am very pleased that they did not let the
crowd getting into it.''
	   Asked what his chance was to qualify for the World Championship
in Hanover, Germany, Rusedski said, ``I think I still have a slight
chance, but the other guys in the top eight have solidified their
position.''
	   Earlier in the day, Todd Martin of the United States downed
fourth-seed Petr Korda of the Czech Republic.
	   Opening a day of second-round matches, the unseeded American
beat favored Korda 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).
	   Fifth-seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia then defeated Germany's
Tommy Haas 7-5, 6-4.
	   Haas' main problem was his weakness with the first service.
	   Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden subsequently subdued Bohdan Ulihrach of
the Czech Republic, 6-4, 6-1.

	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ Ivo Wortmann, who became coach
of the Miami Fusion at mid-season, has had his contract extended
through 1999.
	   The Fusion were in last place with a 9-10 record when Carlos
Cordoba was fired and Wortmann hired July 24. The Fusion went 7-6
the rest of the season, more than doubling their scoring average,
before losing in the first round of the Major League Soccer
playoffs.

UN verification team to arrive in Kosovo this weekend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. team will leave Friday for Kosovo
to report on the conflict between Serbs and ethnic Albanians,
fulfilling a request by the Security Council for first-hand
information from the secessionist Serb province.
	   The mission, expected to take up to 10 days, was planned prior
to marathon talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic that resulted in an agreement to send
a 2,000-member verification team to Kosovo, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said Thursday.
	   Since a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians began in February,
the United Nations has relied on other organizations for
information on the conflict. Only U.N. humanitarian workers are in
Kosovo.
	   The Security Council asked Annan to consider ways to get
first-hand information from the province after receiving reports
from other organizations that Serbs hadn't complied with U.N.
resolutions demanding an end to the offensive.
	   The mission, which includes about eight people from U.N.
peacekeeping, political, refugee and humanitarian departments, aims
to help Secretary-General Kofi Annan make a better assessment of
progress toward a negotiated settlement between the two sides,
Eckhard said.
	   Team members will also be assessing the feasibility of a
possible future U.N. role in the province, U.N. officials said.
	   ``When the Security Council first asked the Secretary-General to
report on events in Kosovo, he said that 'I have no eyes and ears
there,''' Eckhard noted.
	   The U.N. mission will be led by Staffan De Mistura, director of
the U.N. Information Center in Rome. De Mistura, a Swede, worked
last year as the world body's humanitarian coordinator for Iraq.
Team members are expected to meet in Europe on Saturday.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo,
begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
the 2,000-member team into Kosovo to verify Serb compliance with
U.N. demands.
	   The Serb crackdown, launched Feb. 28, was aimed at crushing the
Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for independence of the majority
Albanian province.
	   Hundreds have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of thousands
more have been forced from their homes during the operation.

UN: Angola stops flights to supply UN personnel in UNITA territory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with UN saying one flight diverted midair,
flights stopped Thursday, details and TRIMS to tighten. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Angolan government halted U.N. flights
into territories controlled by the former rebel movement UNITA on
Thursday _ even redirecting one in midair _ U.N. officials said.
The move cut off supplies to U.N. personnel in those areas.
	   The announcement came as the Security Council, concerned about
the increasingly precarious security situation for U.N. troops in
Angola, decided to extend the mandate of the U.N. force for only
another six weeks.
	   It wasn't immediately clear if the flight ban would force the
United Nations to withdraw from UNITA-controlled areas. But
spokesman Fred Eckhard cautioned that, ``Without a supply line,
their presence in those areas is just not viable.''
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was bringing up the matter in a
meeting Thursday with the Angolan vice minister for territorial
administration, Higino Carneiro, Eckhard said.
	   Also on the agenda was the Angolan government's decision last
month to prevent Annan's envoy, Issa Diallo, from visiting UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi. The government told Diallo it couldn't assure
his safety and threatened to stop all contact if the meeting
occurred.
	   In the resolution adopted 15-0, the council demanded that the
government give the U.N. envoy free and safe access to visit
Savimbi and all parties in the conflict.
	   The United Nations mediated Angola's 1994 peace accord and has
maintained a peacekeeping presence in the southern African nation
to ensure that it is carried out.
	   The accord, known as the Lusaka Protocol, ended two decades of
fighting that erupted after Angola won independence from Portugal.
Angola and the United Nations say UNITA has resisted implementing
it, particularly by refusing to hand over four key territories and
demobilize its troops.
	   The accord has been crumbling recently with renewed fighting
between the two sides and the government's decision to negotiate
only with a group of UNITA dissidents who split with Savimbi.
	   Carneiro, the Angolan minister, defended the government's
decision to recognize the dissidents as the legitimate UNITA
representation in peace talks and urged the council do the same.
	   ``We are of the belief that Mr. Savimbi has wasted all
opportunities afforded him because he has deluded and deceived all
those (who) are for peace and democracy in Angola,'' Carneiro told
the council before the vote. ``No more chances for Mr. Savimbi.''
	   The council has in the past urged the Angolan government to
reconsider its decision to stop contacts with Savimbi, who still
controls land and troops. The council didn't address the issue of
the disputed UNITA leadership in its resolution Thursday.
	   Nor did it address the flight ban. U.N. officials in Angola
notified U.N. headquarters in New York on Thursday morning that the
government had banned flights by the United Nations and other
international aid organizations into the UNITA-controlled cities
Andulo, Bailundo, Mungo, Nharea and Jamba.
	   One flight, bringing supplies to an Indian U.N. contingent in
Andulo, was redirected in midair, U.N. officials said. Another
flight, carrying the U.N. regional coordinator to Andulo, was
stopped at Huambo airport and prevented from traveling on.
	   One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the U.N.
task force had a one-day food supply, and seven days of emergency
rations.
	   Annan has warned that the precarious security situation in
Angola, and the crumbling of the U.N.-mediated accord, threatened
the U.N. presence there. He has warned that the United Nations may
have to withdraw entirely from Angola by February.
	   In the resolution, the council asked Annan to continue to adjust
the U.N. presence as required.
	   Council members agreed to extend the mandate of the U.N.
Observer Mission until Dec. 3, and asked the U.N. chief to submit a
``comprehensive report'' by Nov. 23 on the future U.N. role in
Angola. Over the past four years, the United Nations has scaled
down its peace monitoring force in Angola from 7,000 to just 800.
	   The council called on UNITA to use the next six weeks to
``transform itself into a genuine political party,'' and do its own
part to fulfill the terms of the peace accord.

Williams reaches quarterfinals at Zurich
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ After a four-day wait, Venus Williams
began play in the dlrs 1 million European Championships with a 7-5,
6-3 victory over Corina Morariu on Thursday.
	   A qualifier last year, Williams was the No. 2 seed at the
European tournament _ which officially changed its name to Swisscom
Challenge Thursday _ and consequently received a bye into the
second round.
	   ``There's always the possibility it can hurt your game and you
become `off' if you start late in the tournament,'' said Williams,
who won her third career title two weeks ago at the Grand Slam Cup
in Munich. ``I never had to start this late before, but I worked
hard and got some practice in, and I think I played well.''
	   Morariu played three qualifying matches to reach the main draw,
then posted a first-round win over France's Sandrine Testud.
	   Williams broke in the third game to go up 2-1, but Morariu broke
back immediately. Williams had another break opportunity at 3-3,
but squandered five break points.
	   At 4-4 Williams again blew a chance to take the lead, pushing
Morariu to deuce eight times but wasting four break points.
	   Morariu continued to struggle with her service game, again going
to deuce four times before allowing Williams to break and take a
6-5 lead.
	   The second set began similarly with the players trading serves
before Williams broke twice more to clinch the victory.
	   ``I have to get better when it comes to capitalizing on my
opportunities,'' said Williams, who reached the quarterfinals last
year before losing to eventual champion Lindsay Davenport. ``I also
made a lot of unforced errors which I need to improve on.''
	   Williams, a semifinalist at the U.S. Open, will meet
seventh-seeded Mary Pierce in the quarterfinals.
	   Nathalie Tauziat of France also played her first match of the
tournament Thursday, defeating Lisa Raymond 6-2, 6-3.
	   ``I was angry when I saw the schedule and I wasn't playing until
Thursday,'' said Tauziat, a finalist last year. ``You see everyone
play, you see everyone win and defend their points and it's very
frustrating.''
	   Eighth-seeded Dominique Van Roost reached the quarterfinals,
beating Amelie Mauresmo of France 6-3, 6-4. Van Roost will face
Irina Spirlea in the quarterfinals, and Davenport, No. 1 in the
world, plays sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer.

One-half million students protest but marches marred by violence

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ One-half million high school students demanding
better conditions in the classroom protested around France on
Thursday. Despite violence that left at least two people seriously
injured, the students called for new marches next week.
	   From Marseille, in the south, to Metz, in the east, and Lille,
in the north, students seeking more teachers and equipment and less
course work pressed their demands in demonstrations for the third
time this week.
	   But brawlers, some reportedly swinging baseball bats, cast a
cloud over the growing movement that organized protest marches in
nearly 350 cities.
	   Street violence left shops, cars and public property badly
damaged in Paris and several other cities. In Nimes, in the
southwest, masked youths smashed shop windows and damaged a
technical school.
	   Paris police reported five injuries, including two police
officers, one reported in serious condition after being attacked by
hooligans while making an arrest. Some 150 arrests were made for
violence that left dozens of cars and stores damaged, police said.
	   There were about a dozen arrests in Rouen and dozens more
elsewhere.
	   In Grenoble, a student was seriously injured in the head and
back when he broke through a crowd barrier and was struck by a
tram, authorities said.
	   Officials, denouncing the violence, distinguished between high
school protesters and hooligans. The Education Ministry demanded
that the Interior Ministry take action ``so that students be
protected.''
	   In Paris, hooligans infiltrated the march of some 30,000
students at its starting point, Place de la Nation, in the east.
	   Amid chants of ``two chairs for three students,'' at least
14,000 high schoolers took to the streets of Grenoble. Another
12,000 protested in Toulouse. Some 20,000 students turned out in
Bordeaux, in the southwest.
	   Small towns, too, had their lot of angry students. Some 2,000
marched in the Alpine town of Thonon-les-Bains and another 4,000 in
Annecy, according to police.
	   Officials put nationwide participation in the demonstrations at
some 500,000.

	   The stabbing took place outside a small rural community in

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Australia's second-seed Patrick Rafter
moved into the quarterfinals of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP
tournament Thursday by ousting Magnus Norman of Sweden 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``I match up well with someone like Magnus,'' Rafter said after
his victory.
	   Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, has a chance of replacing Pete
Sampras as the top-ranked player in the world in the coming weeks.
	   One step in this direction could be Friday's quarterfinal
encounter with Britain's Greg Rusedski, whose powerful serve
stunned local darling Thomas Muster, who is a far cry from his
onetime prowess.
	   Rafter, who has a 5-1 head-to-head record against Rusedski,
said, ``I never played Greg on this surface, and I do not know how
I will react to his serve.
	   ``But I am confident there will be a couple of breaks here and
there,'' he added.
	   Rusedski, last year's finalist at the Vienna tournament, took 64
minutes to defeat Muster in straight sets 6-4, 6-3.
	   ``It's always difficult to play Thomas in Austria,'' said the
Briton afterward. ``But I am very pleased that they did not let the
crowd getting into it.''
	   Asked what his chance was to qualify for the World Championship
in Hanover, Germany, Rusedski said, ``I think I still have a slight
chance, but the other guys in the top eight have solidified their
position.''
	   Earlier in the day, Todd Martin of the United States downed
fourth-seed Petr Korda of the Czech Republic.
	   Opening a day of second-round matches, the unseeded American
beat favored Korda 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).
	   Fifth-seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia then defeated Germany's
Tommy Haas 7-5, 6-4.
	   Haas' main problem was his weakness with the first service.
	   Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden subsequently subdued Bohdan Ulihrach of
the Czech Republic, 6-4, 6-1.

Rodriguez has angioplasty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SACRAMENTO, California (AP) _ Chi Chi Rodriguez is expected to
leave the hospital Friday, two days after angioplasty.
	   The 62-year-old Rodriguez had what he thought was severe
indigestion Tuesday while preparing to play in the Raley's Gold
Rush Classic senior tournament, which begins Friday at Serrano
Country Club in nearby El Dorado Hills.
	   He went to a doctor, who diagnosed him with angina caused by a
partially blocked artery, according to a statement from the company
representing him, Eddie Elias Enterprises Inc.
	   ``The doctors performed a successful angioplasty procedure and
Chi Chi is resting comfortably and doing well'' at Sutter Memorial
Hospital, said the statement.
	   Rodriguez was struggling through his worst year on the Senior
PGA tour. He ranked 71st on the money list with dlrs 115,684 in
earnings.
	   Fellow golfer Lee Trevino told The Sacramento Bee he expects to
see Rodriguez, a longtime smoker, back in action next year.
	   ``Chi Chi's going to be fine,'' Trevino said. ``As long as he
didn't have a heart attack, he'll be as good as new.''

police protection, fears for his safety. Edits throughout. No

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Police threw a tight security cordon
Thursday around Wole Soyinka, Nigeria's Nobel prize-winning
playwright and outspoken junta critic who returned from four years
in exile a day earlier.
	   Soyinka, who spent the day at a friend's home in the posh Lagos
suburb of Victoria Island, was being guarded by a special police
protection squad after compatriots of the literary figure expressed
fears for his safety, a senior police chief said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Armed officers were stationed in the streets near the quiet
residential home and police roadblocks were stepped up in the area.
A family friend said concerns for Soyinka's welfare had prompted
his supporters to rush him into an awaiting Jeep when he arrived
home Wednesday night to throngs of singing people at Lagos'
international airport.
	   Although there was no public sign of an immediate threat against
Soyinka, Nigeria has a turbulent history of hot-blooded politics
that has frequently spilled over into kidnappings, bloodshed and
summary arrests and detentions.
	   It was the threat of arrest that prompted Soyinka to flee
Nigeria in 1994 by slipping across the border, apparently into
neighboring Benin, after his passports were seized. Later, he
helped set up the National Liberation Council of Nigeria, which
lobbied to bring an end to military rule.
	   Both at home and abroad, he was a prominent critic of the regime
of Nigeria's late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, whose abysmal human
rights record left the West African nation an international pariah.
	   Late Wednesday, the poet-playwright was taken to the home of
Moshood Abiola, the Nigerian opposition leader who died in custody
in July.
	   Soyinka, who was expected to remain in Nigeria for about one
week, had no appearances scheduled Thursday. He was to lecture
Friday afternoon at a Lagos university and on Saturday visit
several journalists recently freed from detention under Abacha's
rule.
	   Soyinka, 64, teaches at Emory University in Atlanta. He won the
Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, the first African to win the
award, and is the author of some 20 novels, plays and collections
of poetry.
	   Although Nigeria's new military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar
urged Soyinka to return home and promised a return to democratic
civilian rule, the writer has remained publicly skeptical that the
military will loosen its grip on the country's political and
economic levers.
	   Nigeria has been ruled by military governments for all but 10
years since gaining independence from Britain in 1960. Presidential
elections are scheduled for February, with a return to civilian
rule scheduled for May.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Detroit Tigers interim manager Larry Parrish has
accepted a two-year deal as manager.
	   ``I was really wanting this opportunity,'' Parrish said Thursday
by telephone from his home in Haines City, Florida. ``Now that
you've got it, it's a put up or shut up kind of thing.''
	   Parrish, who beat out more experienced Davey Johnson for the
job, will sign a contract that has him managing through the 2000
season. The club has an option for him to continue in 2001.
	   Financial terms were not disclosed, who stepped in as interim
manager after the Tigers fired Buddy Bell on Sept. 1. The club had
a 13-12 record under him.
	   General manager Randy Smith said the job Parrish did in the last
days of the season helped him win the job.
	   ``After a rough start, they relaxed and played better for LP,''
Smith said in a conference call. ``They were letting their natural
ability take over and not worrying about making mistakes, so they
didn't make as many.''
	   The 44-year-old Parrish has been with the Tigers for seven
seasons, managing at four minor league stops. He made it clear
after taking over for Bell on that he wanted a shot at the job full
time.

Iraq to decides to maintain contacts with U.N. on inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraq to got ahead with more consultations with
Annan on weapons inspections. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will keep up its contacts with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to solve the issue of the stalled
United Nations weapons inspections, the official Iraqi News Agency
reported Thursday.
	   The decision to go ahead with the talks was made at a joint
meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council and the regional
command of the ruling Baath Party chaired by President Saddam
Hussein, the agency said.
	   It quoted a statement issued after the meeting, but did not make
clear whether specific talks were scheduled with the
secretary-general.
	   Annan's personal envoy, Prakash Shah, arrived in Baghdad earlier
Thursday in a further bid to persuade the Iraqi government to allow
U.N. arms inspectors to resume their work.
	   U.N. officials in Baghdad declined to say whether Shah was
carrying any new ideas to defuse the standoff over arms
inspections.
	   Thursday's meeting was the third held by the Iraqi leadership
this week to assess talks Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz had
earlier this month with Annan in New York to work out a formula to
resume the inspections. Shah sat in on those talks.
	   Iraq, on Aug. 5, placed a freeze on spot searches by U.N.
weapons inspectors for the country's illegal weapons, effectively
paralyzing U.N. inspections as mandated under the ceasefire terms
that ended the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.
	   Aziz's talks apparently failed to persuade Annan to back Iraq's
demand for sweeping changes in the inspections program.
	   The inspectors are charged with verifying that Iraq has
eliminated its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction,
a process that Baghdad must complete before the lifting of trade
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq has long maintained it has destroyed its lethal weapons
systems, but the U.N. arms inspectors claim it has failed to show
that it is not still making or capable of making destructive
weapons.

Police send report on Air India bombing to prosecutors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Police have sent a
long-awaited report to government prosecutors so they can assess
whether charges will be filed in the terrorist bombing of an Air
India jetliner in 1985.
	   All 329 people on board Air India Flight 182, including 280
Canadians, were killed when the plane, bound from Canada to London,
blew up over the coast of Ireland.
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has been hunting for the
bombers since then, in what the force calls the most complex
investigation in its history.
	   In a news release Thursday, the RCMP said the submission of the
report to prosecutors does not mean the filing of charges is
imminent. No time frame was set for the review process, and police
declined to reveal any details about their evidence.
	   Criminal charges would be approved only if prosecutors determine
there is ``a substantial likelihood of a conviction and it is in
the public interest to proceed,'' the RCMP said.
	   The RCMP has faced repeated criticism from relatives of the
victims who have complained the investigation has dragged on too
long.
	   Police believe a group of Sikh separatists living in British
Columbia planned to blow up two Air India jets as part of a
terrorist campaign against the Indian government. The separatists
were working to establish an independent Sikh homeland.
	   In June 1985, two bomb-laden suitcases were checked in for
flights destined to connect with two Air India flights.
	   The first bomb exploded at Tokyo's Narita airport, killing two
baggage handlers who were unloading a Canadian Pacific flight from
Vancouver. Less than an hour later, Flight 182 _ which also
originated in Vancouver _ exploded.
	   Inderjit Singh Reyat, an electrician from Vancouver Island, is
serving 10 years for manslaughter in connection with the Narita
deaths. He has been identified as a suspect in the Flight 182
bombing.

Dominican winter baseball season aims to bring hope after storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Most years, Dominican
winter baseball season is a time when future Major League stars are
born and heroes like Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa return to
crack home runs on home turf.
	   This year, officials say they will simply try to bring some hope
to a devastated nation.
	   Three weeks after Hurricane Georges killed at least 280 people
and left hundreds of thousands homeless in this Caribbean country,
organizers say the season will start Oct. 23 despite destroyed
stadiums and the withdrawal of two of its six teams because of the
tragedy.
	   ``The league wanted to undertake the championship because it
understands that, even having ventured through this difficult
times, professional baseball is the chief pastime of Dominicans,''
said Jorge Torres, spokesman for the Dominican Professional
Baseball League.
	   Around Santo Domingo's Quisqueya Stadium, where President Leonel
Fernandez is expected to throw out the first pitch, torn electric
lines still dangle over street gutters clogged with downed tree
branches. Broken apartment windows stare out at the field.
	   The Estrellas Orientales (Eastern Stars) of San Pedro de Macoris
_ Sosa's home town _ and the Azucareros (Sugar Growers) of La
Romana won't be competing because this year because the storm
ripped the roofs from their stadiums and turned their lighting
towers to crumpled masses of metal.
	   That leaves four teams _ the Santiago Aguilas (Eagles), the
Escogido Leones, the Gigantes of San Francisco de Macoris and the
Licey Tigres, who upset Puerto Rico last year to claim the
Caribbean Series championship.
	   It is unlikely that Sosa, to whom the league is dedicating the
season because of his run this season at the U.S. major league home
run record, will be there to play during the beginning of the
season. He is expected to play in an exhibition series in Japan.
	   To help the 60 roster players and 120 reserve players left
jobless by the storm, the league's players' association has
organized a temporary draft on Thursday. Most Dominican players
live on small salaries while hoping for minor-league contracts in
the United States.
	   Of the 180 team members, 17 top players will be reassigned to
the other teams. The Giants will have to absorb five because they
finished last in the 1997-1998 season; the others will take four
each into their 30-man active roster and try to include some of the
others in their reserves. The 60-game winter season only lasts
until January, so it's unlikely many of the reserve players will
even play.
	   The plan has caused some grumbling in the dugouts.
	   ``We are going to have to develop four guys from the other
clubs, and stop the development of our guys,'' said Rafael
Landestoy, general manager of the Licey Tigres. ``That's going to
be trouble for our guys.''
	   Players who aren't placed on the draft are hoping for jobs in
Venezuela, Puerto Rico and Mexico. The Venezuelan league has
already said it might be interested in some of them.
	   Still, most of the players know they will be jobless when the
first pitch is thrown.
	   Miguel Abreu, a San Pedro de Macoris player who is on the
Florida Marlins minor league team during the summer, said he might
go to New York to look for other work.
	   ``Hurricane Georges killed everything here,'' he said.

Williams reaches quarterfinals after four-day wait
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Schnyder/Schett match, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ American Venus Williams began play
after a four-day waiting period with a lackluster win over
compatriot Corina Morariu on Thursday at the dlrs 1 million
European Championships.
	   A qualifier last year, Williams arrived as second seed at the
European tournament _ which officially changed names to Swisscom
Challenge on Thursday _ and consequently received a bye into the
second round.
	   The powerfully-built 18-year-old, who also played a doubles
match later the same evening, took an hour and a half to defeat
Morariu 7-5, 6-3.
	   ``There's always the possibility it can hurt your game and you
become ``off'' if you start late in the tournament,'' said
Williams, who won her third career title two weeks ago at the Grand
Slam Cup in Munich. ``I never had to start this late before but I
worked hard and got some practice in, and I think I played well.''
	   Morariu played three qualifying matches to reach the main draw,
before posting a first round win over France's Sandrine Testud, who
defeated Lindsay Davenport in the final in Filderstadt last week.
	   The lanky American broke in the third game to go up 2-1, but a
gritty Morariu broke back immediately to regain her serve.
	   Williams had another break opportunity at 3-3, but squandered
five break points, permitting Morariu to remain on serve.
	   At 4-4 Williams again blew a chance to take the lead, pushing
Morariu to deuce eight times but wasting four break points.
	   Morariu continued to labor on her service game, again going to
deuce four times before allowing Williams to break and jump to a
6-5 lead.
	   The second set began similarly with the two players trading
serves before Williams broke twice more to lock up the match.
	   ``I have to get better when it comes to capitalizing on my
opportunities,'' said Williams, who reached the quarterfinals as a
qualifier last year before falling to eventual champion Davenport.
``I also made a lot of unforced errors which I need to improve
on.''
	   The world number five will meet seventh-seed Mary Pierce in the
quarterfinals.
	   For Swiss spectators, interest in the round of eight was dimmed
when Barbara Schett toppled home favorite Patty Schnyder, seeded
fifth.
	   In a tense, nail-biting encounter, the Austrian bested her
long-time doubles partner 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4), eliminating the only
Swiss of the tournament.
	   Schett got off to a strong start in the first set, but lost her
concentration in the second, allowing Schnyder to re-ignite the
crowd's hopes.
	   But in a tight third set, it was the Austrian who displayed the
greater nerve, prevailing in a total of 93 minutes.
	   Swiss star Martina Hingis, who was knocked out in the
quarterfinals last year, withdrew shortly before the start of the
tournament due to a strained ankle.
	   Fourth-seed Nathalie Tauziat, who like William's saw her first
action of the week, showed no signs of rust in her 6-2, 6-3 defeat
over American Lisa Raymond.
	   ``I was a bit angry when I saw the schedule and I wasn't playing
until Thursday,'' said Tauziat, a finalist here last year. ``You
see everyone play, you see everyone win and defend their points and
it's very frustrating.''
	   Eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost had no difficulty getting past
Amelie Mauresmo to reach the round of eight, defeating the French
player 6-3, 6-4.
	   Van Roost, who brought to and end Hingis's reign atop the world
rankings when she defeated the Swiss star in the quarterfinals at
Filderstadt last week, will take on Irina Spirlea in the round of
eight.
	   New world No. 1 Davenport will play sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer
for a berth in the semifinals.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Henman defeating Enqvist. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Australia's second-seed Patrick Rafter
moved into the quarterfinals of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy ATP
tournament Thursday by ousting Magnus Norman of Sweden 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``I match up well with someone like Magnus,'' Rafter said after
his victory.
	   Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, has a chance of replacing Pete
Sampras as the top-ranked player in the world in the coming weeks.
	   One step in this direction could be Friday's quarterfinal
encounter with Britain's Greg Rusedski, whose powerful serve
stunned local darling Thomas Muster, who is a far cry from his
onetime prowess.
	   Rafter, who has a 5-1 head-to-head record against Rusedski,
said, ``I never played Greg on this surface, and I do not know how
I will react to his serve.
	   ``But I am confident there will be a couple of breaks here and
there,'' he added.
	   Rusedski, last year's finalist at the Vienna tournament, took 64
minutes to defeat Muster in straight sets 6-4, 6-3.
	   ``It's always difficult to play Thomas in Austria,'' said the
Briton afterward. ``But I am very pleased that they did not let the
crowd getting into it.''
	   Asked what his chance was to qualify for the World Championship
in Hanover, Germany, Rusedski said, ``I think I still have a slight
chance, but the other guys in the top eight have solidified their
position.''
	   Earlier in the day, Todd Martin of the United States downed
fourth-seed Petr Korda of the Czech Republic.
	   Opening a day of second-round matches, the unseeded American
beat favored Korda 6-3, 7-6 (7-2).
	   Fifth-seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia then defeated Germany's
Tommy Haas 7-5, 6-4.

Thoughts focus on Chi Chi before senior event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EL DORADO HILLS, California (AP) _ Interest turned away from the
golf course on the eve of the Raley's Gold Rush Classic seniors
event at Serrano Country Club.
	   Amid preparation for the dlrs 1 million tournament, the players
were concerned about Senior PGA Tour player Chi Chi Rodriguez.
	   The charismatic Rodriguez underwent a successful angioplasty
procedure Tuesday night. He has been resting comfortably since the
heart surgery at Sutter Memorial Hospital in Sacramento.
	   ``I was shocked when I heard about it, you don't expect to hear
that kind of news about someone like Chi Chi,'' Gary Player said.
	   Lee Trevino believes the crowd-pleasing Rodriguez _ known for
his entertaining sword dance with his putter after sinking putts _
will recover and be back on the tour next year.
	   ``Chi Chi has a big heart, he'll be back,'' Trevino said. ``He
wouldn't be where he was today if he didn't have one.''
	   The surgery prevents Rodriguez from making a 12th straight
appearance in the Gold Rush.
	   Though Rodriguez won't be there, another Gold Rush favorite will
begin play Friday in the 54-hole tournament. And he's hoping for a
repeat performance.
	   Last year, a teary-eyed Bob Eastwood tried to keep his emotions
under control as he strolled up the 18th fairway. Leading the
tournament on the final day, an emotional Eastwood was trying to
stay focused and maintain his lead before a crowd that included
many friends and relatives.
	   If he was experiencing problems, it never showed. Eastwood, a
former Sacramento City Amateur champion who grew up in nearby Lodi,
birdied two of the final four holes to win the title at Serrano's
course.
	   ``I got very emotional,'' Eastwood said. ``I was saying, `Don't
lose it now.' It was something special, a wonderful feeling winning
here. Leading in your hometown is tough. I was glad it was over.''
	   The tour's top two money leaders, Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan,
aren't in the field. Larry Nelson, third on the money list, will
play, as will Jim Colbert, winner of last week's Transamerica
tournament. Colbert won the Gold Rush in 1996.
	   Other 1998 winners playing this week are Jay Sigel, Jim Albus,
Brian Barnes, Bruce Summerhays, Larry Ziegler and Bob Dickson.

U.N. honors pope for his work with hungry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations honored Pope John Paul
II for his work to end hunger and malnutrition around the world
Thursday, the eve of World Food Day.
	   The U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization awarded the
``Agricola'' medal to the pontiff for his ``continuous struggle
against hunger and malnutrition and his demonstrated concern for
the plight of mankind's poor and for peace in the world.''
	   FAO chief Jacques Diouf presented the medal, which bears the
words ``Daily Bread _ Condition of World Peace,'' at the Vatican on
Thursday. World Food Day marks the 53rd anniversary of the founding
of the Food and Agriculture Organization.
	   Also marking the anniversary was the World Food Program, which
noted that it provided emergency supplies to 53 million people in
1997, 8 million more than the year before, said WFP spokeswoman
Abby Spring.
	   ``This year's crises are an indication that people can be thrown
into a hunger trap in a moment's notice,'' WFP chief Catherine
Bertini said in a statement.
	   Floods and droughts caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon,
wars in Africa and Kosovo and the economic crisis in Southeast Asia
were responsible for the increased need.
	   The WFP is feeding 19 million flood victims in Bangladesh _ the
largest emergency operation in its history. The agency is helping
more than 5 million people in Indonesia who are suffering from
drought and economic collapse.
	   In Rome, Diouf stressed that long-term food security will depend
on better access for women to productive resources. Women play a
key role raising crops and livestock in many developing countries,
yet they often are denied schooling and adequate food within their
own families.
	   ``Most of the their back-breaking work is unpaid, or grossly
underpaid,'' Diouf said.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Second-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia
reached the quarterfinals of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy tournament,
beating Magnus Norman of Sweden 6-3, 6-2 Thursday.
	   Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, is ranked No. 2 in the world,
behind Pete Sampras.
	   On Friday, Rafter will play Britain's Greg Rusedski.
	   Rusedski beat local favorite Thomas Muster 6-4, 6-3.
	   Rafter, who has a 5-1 record against Rusedski, said, ``I never
played Greg on this surface, and I do not know how I will react to
his serve. But I am confident there will be a couple of breaks here
and there.''
	   ``It's always difficult to play Thomas in Austria,'' Rusedski
said after beating Muster. ``But I am very pleased that they did
not let the crowd get into it.''
	   In other matches, unseeded Todd Martin upset fourth-seeded Petr
Korda of the Czech Republic 6-3, 7-6 (7-2); No. 5 Karol Kucera of
Slovakia defeated Germany's Tommy Haas 7-5, 6-4; Jonas Bjorkman of

Smurfit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Fallen Spanish financier Javier de la Rosa
returned to jail Thursday as part of an investigation into his
alleged embezzlement of millions of dollars in the sale of a paper
company to the Irish multinational Smurfit.
	   De la Rosa, former chief executive of the Kuwait Investment
Office's Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras, is accused of
pocketing 8 billion pesetas (dlrs 55 million) in the sale by Grupo
Torras of the Icsa paper company to Smurfit in 1988.
	   He was not allowed by bail by National Court Judge Teresa
Palacios, who issued the prison order.
	   One of Spain's best known financiers during its 1980s economic
boom, De La Rosa is already under investigation for alleged
financial irregularities in his management of Grupo Torras, which
went into receivership in 1992 and of another leisure company he
later ran, Grand Tibidabo, which was found to have a shortfall of 4
billion pesetas in its funds in 1994.
	   He was jailed preventively between 1994-95 as part of the
Tibidabo investigation and released after paying nearly dlrs 3
million in bail.
	   The London-based KIO claims to have lost more than dlrs 1
billion in Spain.

<TEXT>
	   LATRUN, Israel (AP) _ Ariel Sharon, in charge of negotiating a
peace settlement with the Palestinians, said Thursday on his second
day as Israel's new foreign minister that he will not shake the
hand of Yasser Arafat, even at a crucial Mideast summit.
	   Sharon is scheduled to join the summit _ which began Thursday at
a retreat in eastern Maryland _ on Saturday, after most of the work
on a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal is to be wrapped up.
	   Sharon, a hawkish former general, leads the far-right camp in
Netanyahu's government which is opposed to the U.S. plan for a
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank. Israel TV said Sharon
chose to attend the summit late in order to review any agreements
reached before deciding whether to give his approval, something
which is essential for a plan to pass through Netanyahu's hardline
government.
	   Asked by a reporter Thursday whether he would shake Arafat's
hand at the summit, Sharon replied ``no.'' A similar statement in a
newspaper interview was made before Sharon was appointed foreign
minister in charge of leading negotiations with Arafat's
Palestinian Authority government.
	   Sharon did say however that he was committed to the peace
process.
	   ``I want to promise you that I'll make every effort, together
with my colleagues, to achieve peace with the Palestinians and with
all the rest of the Arab countries,'' he told reporters after
attending a memorial service for fallen Israeli soldiers.
	   In a telephone poll conducted by Israel's Channel 2 TV, a
majority of Israelis surveyed, 60 percent, said they believed the
Mideast summit would fail in finding agreement for an Israeli
withdrawal. Israel has made any deal contingent on Palestinian
compliance with a set of security demands. The margin of error and
number of people interviewed were not included in the report.
	   There were several incidents of violence throughout the day.
	   The Israeli army imposed a curfew on the West Bank Palestinian
village of Beit Fajar, after shots were fired towards the
watchtower of a nearby Israeli settlement. And Israel's army radio
reported that three fire-bombs were thrown at Palestinian homes in
the West Bank town of Beit Sahur. Nobody was hurt but one of the
houses was badly damaged and residents said they saw a car with
Israeli license plates speed away from the area.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO signed a Kosovo air
surveillance deal with Slobodan Milosevic's army Thursday and the
Western military alliance's chief delivered another warning:
Withdraw your troops so villagers can return, or face the
consequences.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said that
despite some progress the Yugoslav president was far from meeting
the Saturday deadline for compliance.
	   Solana said he delivered ``a simple, but very strong message''
to Milosevic: ``he must comply, he must comply fully and
immediately with the requirements.''
	   ``According to our information, and our information is good,
many army and special police units remain in Kosovo,'' Solana said
after he met Milosevic.
	   ``These units must be withdrawn immediately,'' Solana told
reporters. ``Let there be no doubt, we will keep the situation in
Kosovo under closest scrutiny. NATO will maintain pressure until we
have evidence that compliance will be achieved.''
	   The air surveillance deal, signed in Belgrade between NATO's
Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, and
Yugoslav Army Chief-of-Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic, calls for
unarmed spy planes to watch over Milosevic's compliance to withdraw
his troops from Kosovo and allow safe return of tens of thousands
Kosovo Albanian refugees.
	   ``Any attack or hostile intent against our NATO verification
aircraft will have the gravest consequences,'' Solana warned.
	   International officials also huddled in Paris and Vienna on
Thursday to push ahead the assessment process aimed at making sure
Milosevic adheres to the breakthrough agreement reached this week
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   In Vienna, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe agreed formally Thursday to oversee the 2,000-member
``ground verification mission'' -- unarmed monitors who will roam
through Kosovo to make sure terms of the agreement with Holbrooke
are being honored.
	   The OSCE said in a statement that its current chairman, Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, will sign the ground
verification agreement Friday in Belgrade with Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic.
	   Poland's ambassador to the OSCE, Adam Kobieracki, told the
Austria Press Agency that the verification mission could cost about
dlrs 200 million, with the United States, Britain, France, Russia,
Italy and Germany assuming most of the burden.
	   In Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency delivered more aid to those
displaced by the seven-month crackdown in the secessionist Serbian
province, which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   In the village of Kisna Reka, refugees living in a makeshift
camp of 3,000 people in a nearby gully carted off 50-kilogram
(110-pound) sacks of flour, bags of clothing, cooking oil and other
supplies delivered by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Asked how long they could stay in the woods, a man who gave his
name only as Rexhep said: ``Until we die. We don't know how much we
can take. We are afraid to go back.''
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia, meeting in Paris, fully endorsed the agreement on Kosovo
but maintained its support for airstrikes if Milosevic fails to
comply when a four-day grace period expires Saturday.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement. But with many
reluctant to return home, Solana said troops are not being
withdrawn fast enough for refugees to feel confident enough to go
back.
	   ``It is very important for (refugees) to return to their
villages,'' he said earlier in Brussels. ``For that, compliance
with the withdrawal of troops is very, very important.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's crackdown. But the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has also killed over 200 Serb
policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal to Milosevic's
government.
	   At Kisna Reka, the refugees complained that Serbian security
forces fired machine guns, mortars and other weapons throughout the
night, apparently to intimidate them from planning a return to
their villages.
	   ``There's nobody there'' in the villages, said Fatmir Nuhaj, 27,
his arms wrapped around his young son's shoulders. ``It's only to
keep us from our homes.''
	   They said unarmed monitors will do them no good.
	   The Serbs, for their part, complain that the KLA is continuing
attacks on police.
	   Serb police said three of their officers were wounded Wednesday
and another one Thursday when they were ambushed on a major Kosovo
road, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital Pristina.
	   A KLA representative warned Thursday that the rebel force won't
adhere to its cease-fire indefinitely.
	   ``If the international community tries to create the illusion
that Serbia is conforming with demands ... we won't be able to
tolerate it for long,'' said Swiss-based representative Bardhyl
Mahmuti in Geneva.

Study: Killer whales feeding on sea otters along Aleutians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Killer whales that normally hunt seals and sea
lions are now feeding on sea otters and creating an ecological
crisis along the entire Aleutian island chain of western Alaska.
	   Researchers say that the sudden loss of thousands of sea otters
is allowing a boom in the population of sea urchins and these
animals, in turn, are stripping the undersea kelp forest, laying
bare vast areas that once were lush with the marine plant.
	   The whole coastal ecosystem in western Alaska is now affected,
says James Estes, a marine ecologist with the U.S. Geological
Survey and the University of California, Santa Cruz.
	   Estes said the research demonstrates how disrupting just one
link in a food chain can threaten an entire ecological system.
	   ``A wide array of species will be affected,'' he said. ``Coastal
fish, mussels, marine birds and other predators in the system could
all be impacted.''
	   Estes is co-author of a study appearing Friday in the journal
Science.
	   Normally, there is a delicate balance of life in the western
Alaskan waters, with sea lions and seals feeding on fish and the
killer whales preying on the sea lions and seals. Independent of
that, sea urchins graze on the kelp beds while sea otters feed on
the urchins. This keeps the urchin population in check and allows
the kelp beds to thrive, providing a home to hundreds of species.
	   But Estes said that starting in the late 1980s, the sea lion and
seal population crashed and is now about a 10th of normal.
	   Deprived of their normal food, killer whales turned to the sea
otter.
	   The otter is much smaller than the sea lions and seals so the
killer whales must eat more to get the same nourishment.
	   Estes said he and his colleagues estimate that a single killer
whale will have to eat 1,825 otters a year to get its required
nourishment. At that rate, said Estes, it would take just four
killer whales feeding only on sea otters to cause a crash of the
sea otter population throughout most of the Aleutian Island chain.
	   The researchers said the killer whale predation is the only
explanation for the sudden drop in sea otter population.
	   If the otters were being affected by disease, said Estes, there
would be many bodies washed ashore. This has not happened.
	   Also, he said that sea otter populations protected from killer
whales continue to thrive.
	   Estes said there is no clear explanation for the decline in sea
lions and seals, but some researchers believe those animals
experienced a population crash because they could not get enough
high-nutrition fish, their normal food. Overfishing has severely
reduced the population of some fish species, he said, although
other fish, such as pollock, are thriving.
	   Pollock, however, lack the high oil content that sea lions and
seals require to survive the winter, Estes said.

Iraq to decides to maintain contacts with U.N. on inspections

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraq to got ahead with more consultations with
Annan on weapons inspections. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will keep up its contacts with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to solve the issue of the stalled
United Nations weapons inspections, the official Iraqi News Agency
reported Thursday.
	   The decision to go ahead with the talks was made at a joint
meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council and the regional
command of the ruling Baath Party chaired by President Saddam
Hussein, the agency said.
	   It quoted a statement issued after the meeting, but did not make
clear whether specific talks were scheduled with the
secretary-general.
	   Annan's personal envoy, Prakash Shah, arrived in Baghdad earlier
Thursday in a further bid to persuade the Iraqi government to allow
U.N. arms inspectors to resume their work.
	   U.N. officials in Baghdad declined to say whether Shah was
carrying any new ideas to defuse the standoff over arms
inspections.
	   Thursday's meeting was the third held by the Iraqi leadership
this week to assess talks Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz had
earlier this month with Annan in New York to work out a formula to
resume the inspections. Shah sat in on those talks.
	   Iraq, on Aug. 5, placed a freeze on spot searches by U.N.
weapons inspectors for the country's illegal weapons, effectively
paralyzing U.N. inspections as mandated under the ceasefire terms
that ended the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.
	   Aziz's talks apparently failed to persuade Annan to back Iraq's
demand for sweeping changes in the inspections program.
	   The inspectors are charged with verifying that Iraq has
eliminated its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction,
a process that Baghdad must complete before the lifting of trade
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq has long maintained it has destroyed its lethal weapons
systems, but the U.N. arms inspectors claim it has failed to show
that it is not still making or capable of making destructive
weapons.

 &UR; Sharon said he will not shake Arafat's hand; Hamas planned new
attacks &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LATRUN, Israel (AP) _ Ariel Sharon, in charge of negotiating a
peace settlement with the Palestinians, said Thursday on his second
day as Israel's new foreign minister that he will not shake the
hand of Yasser Arafat, even at a crucial Mideast summit.
	   Sharon is scheduled to join the summit _ which began Thursday at
a retreat in eastern Maryland _ on Saturday, after most of the work
on a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal is to be wrapped up.
	   Sharon, a hawkish former general, leads the far-right camp in
Netanyahu's government which is opposed to the U.S. plan for a
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank. Israel TV said Sharon
chose to attend the summit late in order to review any agreements
reached before deciding whether to give his approval, something
which is essential for a plan to pass through Netanyahu's hardline
government.
	   Asked by a reporter Thursday whether he would shake Arafat's
hand at the summit, Sharon replied ``no.'' A similar statement in a
newspaper interview was made before Sharon was appointed foreign
minister in charge of leading negotiations with Arafat's
Palestinian Authority government.
	   Sharon did say however that he was committed to the peace
process.
	   ``I want to promise you that I'll make every effort, together
with my colleagues, to achieve peace with the Palestinians and with
all the rest of the Arab countries,'' he told reporters after
attending a memorial service for fallen Israeli soldiers.
	   In a telephone poll conducted by Israel's Channel 2 TV, a
majority of Israelis surveyed, 60 percent, said they believed the
Mideast summit would fail in finding agreement for an Israeli
withdrawal. Israel has made any deal contingent on Palestinian
compliance with a set of security demands. The margin of error and
number of people interviewed were not included in the report.
	   Also Thursday, Israel announced that two Palestinian militants
had been arrested by Palestinian police on their way to carrying
out a suicide bombing in Israel. A third Palestinian who holds
Israeli citizenship is being held by Israel as an accomplice.
Israel says the Israeli-Arab planned to drive the two Hamas members
to a crowded location where they were to blow themselves up,
according to court documents on the case made public Thursday.
	   The arrests were made 17 days ago at the Erez crossing point
between Israel and the Palestinian-run Gaza Strip.
	   Israel has said it received intelligence warnings that the
Islamic group, which opposes peace with Israel and has carried out
many deadly attacks in the past, was planning an attack in the
hopes of wrecking chances for success at the summit talks.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO signed a Kosovo air
surveillance deal with Slobodan Milosevic's army Thursday and the
Western military alliance's chief delivered another warning:
Withdraw your troops so villagers can return, or face the
consequences.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said that
despite some progress the Yugoslav president was far from meeting
the Saturday deadline for compliance.
	   Solana said he delivered ``a simple, but very strong message''
to Milosevic: ``he must comply, he must comply fully and
immediately with the requirements.''
	   ``According to our information, and our information is good,
many army and special police units remain in Kosovo,'' Solana said
after he met Milosevic.
	   ``These units must be withdrawn immediately,'' Solana told
reporters. ``Let there be no doubt, we will keep the situation in
Kosovo under closest scrutiny. NATO will maintain pressure until we
have evidence that compliance will be achieved.''
	   The air surveillance deal, signed in Belgrade between NATO's
Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, and
Yugoslav Army Chief-of-Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic, calls for
unarmed spy planes to watch over Milosevic's compliance to withdraw
his troops from Kosovo and allow safe return of tens of thousands
Kosovo Albanian refugees.
	   ``Any attack or hostile intent against our NATO verification
aircraft will have the gravest consequences,'' Solana warned.
	   International officials also huddled in Paris and Vienna on
Thursday to push ahead the assessment process aimed at making sure
Milosevic adheres to the breakthrough agreement reached this week
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   In Vienna, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe agreed formally Thursday to oversee the 2,000-member
``ground verification mission'' -- unarmed monitors who will roam
through Kosovo to make sure terms of the agreement with Holbrooke
are being honored.
	   The OSCE said in a statement that its current chairman, Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, will sign the ground
verification agreement Friday in Belgrade with Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic.
	   Poland's ambassador to the OSCE, Adam Kobieracki, told the
Austria Press Agency that the verification mission could cost about
dlrs 200 million, with the United States, Britain, France, Russia,
Italy and Germany assuming most of the burden.
	   In Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency delivered more aid to those
displaced by the seven-month crackdown in the secessionist Serbian
province, which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   In the village of Kisna Reka, refugees living in a makeshift
camp of 3,000 people in a nearby gully carted off 50-kilogram
(110-pound) sacks of flour, bags of clothing, cooking oil and other
supplies delivered by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Asked how long they could stay in the woods, a man who gave his
name only as Rexhep said: ``Until we die. We don't know how much we
can take. We are afraid to go back.''
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia, meeting in Paris, fully endorsed the agreement on Kosovo
but maintained its support for airstrikes if Milosevic fails to
comply when a four-day grace period expires Saturday.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement. But with many
reluctant to return home, Solana said troops are not being
withdrawn fast enough for refugees to feel confident enough to go
back.
	   ``It is very important for (refugees) to return to their
villages,'' he said earlier in Brussels. ``For that, compliance
with the withdrawal of troops is very, very important.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's crackdown. But the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has also killed over 200 Serb
policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal to Milosevic's
government.
	   At Kisna Reka, the refugees complained that Serbian security
forces fired machine guns, mortars and other weapons throughout the
night, apparently to intimidate them from planning a return to
their villages.
	   ``There's nobody there'' in the villages, said Fatmir Nuhaj, 27,
his arms wrapped around his young son's shoulders. ``It's only to
keep us from our homes.''
	   They said unarmed monitors will do them no good.
	   The Serbs, for their part, complain that the KLA is continuing
attacks on police.
	   Serb police said three of their officers were wounded Wednesday
and another one Thursday when they were ambushed on a major Kosovo
road, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital Pristina.
	   A KLA representative warned Thursday that the rebel force won't
adhere to its cease-fire indefinitely.
	   ``If the international community tries to create the illusion
that Serbia is conforming with demands ... we won't be able to
tolerate it for long,'' said Swiss-based representative Bardhyl
Mahmuti in Geneva.

	   KISNA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Camped in a gully with Kosovo's
harsh winter fast approaching, ethnic Albanian refugees said
Thursday they don't know how much more hardship they can endure.
	   For the 3,000 refugees living outside this village, home is a
makeshift settlement of huts made of wood and plastic sheeting,
with branches for frames and crude chimneys poking through holes in
the roofs.
	   One small hut sleeps 14 people. Food supplies are running out.
	   Thursday was a good day for the refugees, who live 15 miles (25
kilometers) northwest of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, and a world
away from civilized conditions. A shining sun provided warmth, and
new supplies of food and clothing arrived.
	   But no one expected the good times to last long.
	   The refugees claim that most nights, Serb security forces fire
machine guns, mortars and other weapons, apparently to block them
from returning to their villages.
	   As a result, they're likely to remain in the woods a while
longer, regardless of the deal Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic struck with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to defuse the
crisis.
	   Meanwhile, however, the refugees know that the sparkling autumn
weather could quickly change.
	   ``What are we going to do tomorrow?'' complained Enver Nuhaj,
34, as he waited to collect relief goods for his wife, nine
children, mother and two cousins.
	   The refugees outside Kisna Reka are among the 300,000 people,
mostly ethnic Albanians, displaced by Milosevic's seven-month
assault against separatists in the poor province in southern
Serbia.
	   Tens of thousands like them are still camped in the open, their
worsening plight a prime reason behind this fall's big
international push for an end to the conflict.
	   Nuhaj's family lacks proper shoes _ one of the rubber boots he
wears is larger than the other _ and has no money. But although his
house in Kisna Reka still stands, he won't go back until the
Serbian police leave.
	   Many ethnic Albanians are afraid to trust in the agreement
reached this week intended to prevent NATO airstrikes, in part by
allowing 2,000 unarmed international monitors into Kosovo.
	   ``Milosevic lies a lot,'' Nuhaj said. ``We cannot believe him,
even with the observers.''
	   Children shrieked and played in the mud around the huts as small
tractors hauled in carts laden with the relief supplies provided by
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   For most, the 110-pound (50-kilogram) sacks of flour, margarine,
cooking oil and other goods came just as the last shipment,
received three weeks ago, was running out.
	   ``We only had enough food for two more days,'' said a
middle-aged man who would give only his first name, Rexhep. The
flour he carried to his family's hut would last 13 people for 12
days, he said.
	   Asked how long they could stay in the woods, he said: ``Until we
die. We don't know how much we can take. We are afraid to go
back.''
	   The refugees said the gun and mortar fire at night was intended
to deter them from planning a return to their villages.
	   ``There's nobody there (in the villages),'' said Fatmir Nuhaj,
27, his arms wrapped around his young son's shoulders. ``It's only
to keep us from our homes.''

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Dozens of Bahamians cheered when two
death notices from the gallows were solemnly posted Thursday,
underscoring growing support in the Caribbean for the death penalty
to fight crime.
	   Defying international opposition, the Bahamas hanged two
convicted killers in its first state executions since 1996. Other
Caribbean nations say they will resume executions after years-long
delays.
	   Outside the gates of Her Majesty's Prison at Fox Hill, the
number of bystanders swelled to about 100 in the hour between the
morning executions of Trevor Fisher, 28, and Richard Woods, 51.
	   Fisher was convicted in 1994 of murder in a 1990 robbery
attempt. Woods was convicted in 1995 of killing his niece and
lover, Pauline Johnson, two years earlier. She was in her early
20s.
	   ``We pray that others will take note that the Bahamian society
is fed up with these heinous types of crime,'' said the Rev. Simeon
Hall, president of the Bahamas Christian Council.
	   Fisher and Woods had appealed their death sentences in 1996 to
the Organization of American States' Inter-American Human Rights
Commission. The Washington, D.C.-based commission didn't act on the
appeals but urged the Bahamas on Wednesday to spare the men's
lives.
	   The Bahamas didn't respond to the commission, which advises
member states on rights issues but has no enforcement powers.
	   Some Caribbean countries accuse the commission of deliberately
delaying its decisions to prevent hangings. Jamaica withdrew from
the commission this year and Trinidad says it will leave next year.
	   Bahamian officials wanted to carry out the executions ahead of a
deadline set by Britain's Privy Council, which ruled in 1993 that
it was inhumane to keep prisoners on death row for more than five
years.
	   As a result, hundreds of Caribbean convicts have had death
sentences commuted to life imprisonment. In the Bahamas, 17 death
sentences were commuted this year, while 30 people remain on death
row.
	   The Privy Council is the highest court for several current and
former British colonies. Last week, it emphasized the ``requirement
on humanitarian grounds that in countries which retain the death
penalty, lawful death penalties should be carried out as swiftly''
as practical.
	   Britain has tried to persuade Caribbean countries to stop using
the death penalty. In response, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and
Trinidad plan to cut ties to the Privy Council and form their own
Caribbean Court of Justice.
	   Fed up with crime, Bahamians were incensed by the killings in
August of three foreigners _ a British tourist, a U.S. tourist and
an Indonesian cruise ship worker.
	   ``I'm estimating that about 90 per cent of Bahamians are for
capital punishment,'' the Rev. Hall said amid the cheers outside
the prison.
	   Hall said he personally opposed the death penalty but was
expressing the views of most churches belonging to the Christian
Council. Dozens of people had protested the last Bahamian
executions in 1996.
	   A lone dissenter at the prison Thursday was attorney Glenys
Hanna Martin, who questioned why a government panel last Friday
allowed the executions of Woods and Fisher to proceed but commuted
three other death penalty cases to life imprisonment.
	   Deputy Premier Frank Watson, chairman of the Committee for the
Prerogative of Mercy, was out of the country Thursday and could not
be reached for comment.

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ A team of Chinese mountaineers determined
to climb the world's 14 highest peaks have scaled Mt. Lhotse in the
Nepalese Himalayas, the Nepalese tourism ministry said Thursday.
	   Dachong, 35, Banba Trashi, 33, Tsering Dorji, 38, Ren Na, 31,
and Lho Tse, 35, reached the 8,516 meters (28,100 feet) high peak
on Tuesday after a trek of nearly four and half hours from their
camp at 7,900 meters (26,070 feet), officials said. Dachong uses
only one name.
	   Mt. Lhotse, a peak close to Mt. Everest, was the ninth of the 14
peaks over 8,000 meters (26,400 feet) in height the group hopes to
climb.
	   The ministry gave few other details.
	   The present mountaineering season that began on Sept. 1 ends
Nov. 15.

Taliban to free Iranian captives in next two days: Ambassador
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ At the conclusion of talks with the
United Nations envoy Thursday, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan
said the religious militia will free its Iranian captives within
the next two days.
	   Calling the talks ``very useful'', Saeed-ur-rehman Haqqani said
the Taliban also wants Iran to free its soldiers -- a promise given
Wednesday to the Taliban's reclusive leader by U.N. special envoy
Lakhdar Brahimi.
	   Brahimi held more than three hours of meetings with Mullah
Mohammed Omar at the Taliban headquarters in southern Afghanistan
to try to defuse border tensions between Iran and the Taliban army.
	   In a statement Wednesday following his return to Pakistan,
Brahimi said he was optimistic of an early resolution to the
dangerous stand off between Iran and the Taliban army.
	   Iran has deployed more than 270,000 Iranian soldiers along its
border with Afghanistan along with hundreds of tanks and scores of
fighter jets.
	   The deployment followed the killing in August of eight Iranian
diplomats and an Iranian journalist by renegade Taliban troops in
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Brahimi was exempted from a U.N. ban on travel to Afghanistan
specifically to try to find an end to the stand off. As well the
U.N. secretary general's envoy set out to determine what security
guarantees the Taliban army was ready to offer to allow the U.N. to
return to Afghanistan.
	   The U.N. pulled its international staff out of Afghanistan on
Aug. 21 after an Italian U.N. worker was shot and killed and a
French worker wounded, apparently in retaliation for the U.S.
missile attack on suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   Brahimi said the U.N. wanted security guarantees, as well as a
promise from the Taliban to address human rights complaints that
have dogged the U.N.'s attempts to provide humanitarian assistance
to the war-devastated country.
	   Haqqani said a three-member Taliban delegation will arrive in
Pakistan on Friday to meet U.N. officials to try to hammer out an
agreement that will allow the U.N. to return to Afghanistan.
	   ``We hope that the efforts . . .would pave the way for the
resolution of the problems of the people of Afghanistan,'' said
Haqqani. ``We are hopeful that all problems in Afghanistan will be
settled shortly.''
	   The Taliban, which rules roughly 90 percent of the country, also
is demanding international recognition. Its opponents rule the
remaining 10 percent and still hold the Afghan seat in the United
Nations.
	   In areas under Taliban rule a strict form of Islamic law has
been imposed that has prevented women from attending school or
working outside the house. It also has forced men to grow beards,
publicly beating anyone who shaves. In addition, music, other than
religious songs, has been banned.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ A jury ruled in favor of U.S. basketball star
Michael Jordan on Thursday in a breach-of-contract lawsuit that
accused him of breaking a deal to star in a 1991 movie that ended
up flopping without him.
	   The Cook County jury, also ruling on a counterclaim Jordan
filed, found the producers of ``Heaven is a Playground,'' falsely
informed the Bulls superstar that they had obtained sufficient
financing for the film.
	   The jury awarded Jordan dlrs 50,000 in compensatory damages for
the fee Jordan was paid _ and then gave back _ to Heaven Corp. He
was awarded no punitive damages.
	   The jury deliberated about seven hours.
	   Jordan, who sat in the courtroom nearly every day, testified
that he didn't refuse to appear in the movie and that both sides
had agreed to postpone filming, which was to have started in 1989.
	   Filmmakers Randy Fried and Keith Bank alleged that Jordan,
swayed by agent David Falk, was holding out for a better
opportunity than the dlrs 350,000 he was to have received.
	   The movie received no national distribution and went almost
straight to video after earning just dlrs 3 million.
	   The plaintiffs argued that Jordan could have made the film a
blockbuster, status it didn't achieve with his role going to former
Loyola Marymount basketball star Bo Kimble.
	   ``Doesn't have the same ring, does it?'' plaintiffs' lawyer Dean
Dickie said during the trial.
	   Falk, Jordan's longtime agent, initially was listed as a
defendant but Judge Richard Neville ordered him removed from the
case because he was acting under Jordan's authorization.
	   Dickie, who acknowledged that putting Jordan on trial in Chicago
was akin to ``trying God in Heaven,'' instead tried to shift the
focus to Falk, portraying him as a greedy wheeler-dealer who had no
qualms about backing out of the deal when it became clear Jordan
could do better.
	   Jordan ended up making his feature-film debut in 1996 in ``Space
Jam,'' which was indeed a box-office blockbuster.

Mexico prosecutors ask maximum penalty for ex-president's brother
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with attorney general's office now saying
prosecutors to present summation Friday, sted Thursday and denial
that former president will be questioned. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Prosecutors in the murder trial of a former
president's brother have decided to ask the judge to sentence him
to the maximum term of 50 years in prison, The Associated Press has
learned.
	   Raul Salinas de Gortari is charged with masterminding the
assassination of ruling party Secretary-General Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu in 1994, when Salinas' younger brother Carlos was
president.
	   The case is being heard by Judge Ricardo Ojeda Borges of the
Third District Court of Mexico state in Toluca, 35 miles (55
kilometers) west of Mexico City.
	   Testimony concluded more than a month ago and Ojeda set Friday
as the deadline for prosecutors to present their final arguments,
after which it will be the defense's turn.
	   An official with the federal attorney general's office said it
would present its summation on Friday and recommend the maximum
50-year term. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Raul Salinas also is on trial for illicit enrichment, a case
being heard at the 11th District Court in Mexico City. Prosecutors
say they are considering charging him with money laundering and
drug smuggling as well.
	   And Swiss authorities are investigating him for depositing
millions of dollars under false names while his younger brother was
president. Swiss court documents cite U.S. officials alleging the
accounts contain dlrs 132 million in drug-trafficking bribes.
Salinas says the money was legitimate.
	   Carlos Salinas, who served as president from 1988 to 1994, has
been living in Ireland and does not face any charges.
	   In the summation to be handed over Friday, prosecutors claim
that Raul Salinas' motives included the divorce of Ruiz Massieu and
the Salinas' sister, Adriana, as well as power struggles over the
food distribution agency that Raul Salinas headed, Mexico City
newspapers reported.
	   Salinas was arrested in 1995, four months after his brother left
office. He has been held ever since at the maximum-security
Almoloya de Juarez prison 35 miles (55 kilometers) west of Mexico
City, and has maintained his innocence.
	   Attorneys for both Carlos and Raul Salinas did not return
messages left Thursday.

U.N. grants observer status to Caribbean states, OECD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly granted observer
status Thursday to the Association of Caribbean States and to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
	   The Association of Caribbean States seeks to boost trade and
cultural and scientific cooperation among its 25 members. The OECD
acts as a sort of think tank for its 29 industrialized member
countries.
	   The two organization will be able to participate in General
Assembly discussions but neither will have voting rights. The
assembly approved resolutions seeking observer status for the
groups without a vote.
	   Guyana's U.N. ambassador, Samuel Insanally, said observer status
for the Caribbean group would benefit both it and the United
Nations. Luis Raul Estevez-Lopez, a minister in Guatemala's U.N.
mission, introduced the resolution for the Association of Caribbean
States.
	   Maciej Kozlowski, an under-secretary of state for Poland,
introduced the resolution for the OECD. He said the goals of the
group _ encouraging free trade and economic growth _ were
compatible with U.N. principles.

World Series could be Williams finale in Bronx
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ His location was impossible to overlook. When
Bernie Williams talked about what might be his final games with the
New York Yankees, he was right in front of the clubhouse door.
	   Williams, always shy, has quickly showered and bolted the
clubhouse after postseason games. The Yankees say he has a personal
situation, but won't elaborate.
	   ``I take a lot of pride in keeping my private life private,'' he
said after Thursday's workout. ``I see no reason it shouldn't stay
that way.''
	   Williams, who is eligible for free agency following the World
Series, was 0-for-11 against Texas in the first round of the
playoffs, then went 8-for-21 with five RBIs against Cleveland.
	   This after winning his first AL batting title.
	   ``Bernie's a different guy _ a deep person, a sensitive guy, yet
there's fire in his belly,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
``There's a lot going on in his life. These could be the last games
he plays as a Yankee.''
	   Williams' agent, Scott Boras, has fought with Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner each winter over contracts and the sides didn't
get anywhere last year when they exchanged thoughts on a multiyear
deal.
	   It's unclear if Williams will give the Yankees preference in
talks once he is free to deal with any team.
	   ``I'm not really thinking about that yet because there's so much
going on,'' he said.
	   Williams seemed more upbeat Thursday and said he looked forward
to playing the San Diego Padres in the Series. which starts
Saturday night.
	   Two years ago, he was the MVP of the AL championship series win
over Baltimore but was just 4-for-24 (.167) against Atlanta in the
World Series with one homer and four RBIs.

Golden Bear stockholders file lawsuit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus' Golden Bear Golf
Inc. is facing more legal trouble.
	   United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co., based in Baltimore,
sued Golden Bear and its subsidiary, Paragon Construction
International, claiming the companies defaulted on millions of
dollars of bonds on projects, including Donald Trump's golf resort
in West Palm Beach.
	   North Palm Beach-based Golden Bear has failed to live up to its
bond agreement and is withholding financial documents, according to
the lawsuit filed Wednesday in Palm Beach County Circuit Court.
	   Contractors already have tried to collect more than dlrs 960,000
from USF and G which Paragon says it cannot pay for unfinished work
at the Trump International Golf Club, the lawsuit claimed.
	   Bruce King, a lawyer for USF and G, and Steve Winslett of Golden
Bear did not immediately return calls for comment Thursday.
	   Shareholders of Golden Bear sued the company in July, accusing
former employees of falsifying Paragon's records to hide nearly
dlrs 22 million in losses.
	   Golden Bear was forced to restate its losses. Originally, it had
reported a net loss of dlrs 2.9 million, or 53 cents a share, on
revenue of dlrs 67.7 million. The restated loss will be dlrs 24.7
million, or dlrs 4.49 a share.
	   Paragon lost several big deals due to disagreements and delays,
including the Trump golf club in July. Paragon president John Boyd
and three other executives left the company in April before the
review began.
	   Golden Bear's stock, JACK, was delisted by the Nasdaq stock
market in August after the company failed to meet capital
requirements.

Pope defends church's central truths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs with U.S. scholar's reaction. &QL; 
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Sounding a battle cry for his 20th
anniversary as pope, John Paul II rallied his church Thursday
against assaults on its fundamental beliefs, saying such attacks
have sowed confusion and even despair among Roman Catholics.
	   He spoke out in an encyclical, one of the most important
documents a pope can issue, warning against the temptations posed
by some modern schools of philosophy and theology.
	   It did not go into specifics of church teaching for which John
Paul has repeatedly demanded fidelity. But it summed up one of the
central themes of his long papacy _ that there are unshakable
truths and that positions that ``question the certitudes of faith''
must be rejected.
	   The 154-page document, the 13th encyclical of John Paul's
papacy, was timed for the 20th anniversary Friday of his election
as pope. Thousands of pilgrims from his Polish homeland were
converging on Rome for celebrations, when John Paul becomes one of
only a dozen popes to have served at least two decades.
	   The encyclical is titled ``Fides et Ratio,'' Latin for ``Faith
and Reason,'' and grapples with the issue of religion in the modern
world, when expectations have been raised by scientific and
technological progress. It stresses that faith and reason are not
incompatible.
	   He said mankind has always asked such questions as ``Who am I?
Where have I come from and where am I going? Why is there evil?
What is there after this life? ''
	   But today some Catholics risk ``losing their way in the shifting
sands of widespread skepticism'' while ``many people stumble
through life to the very edge of the abyss without knowing where
they are going,'' John Paul said.
	   ``At times, this happens because those whose vocation is to give
cultural expression to their thinking no longer look to the truth,
preferring quick success to the toil of patient inquiry into what
makes life worth living.''
	   It was addressed to his bishops, in effect a call to action for
the proper education of Catholics.
	   The Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a Catholic scholar in New York and
editor of the weekly magazine America, published by the Jesuits,
called the encyclical optimistic because it assumes people can
reason their way to truth, and that by combining faith and reason,
they will know how to live their lives.
	   The encyclical, he said, takes aim at the philosophical `isms'
like relativism and deconstructionism, or whatever is ``the flavor
of the month'' being taught in universities.
	   ``Most secular philosophers would have trouble with it, but they
have trouble with each other, too,'' Reese said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks surged late Thursday, adding to broad
gains and sending the Dow industrials soaring to its third-best
point gain ever, after the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest
rates for the second time in less than a month. The Dow Jones
industrial average, down as much as 48.66 in the early going, was
up about 100 points when the Fed surprised traders with its move
late in the trading day. The Dow finished up 330.58, or by 4.1
percent, at 8,299.36. Trading was brisk. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Federal Reserve cut short-term interest
rates by a quarter percentage point Thursday, citing ``growing
caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets.''
In recent years, it has been extremely rare for the Federal Reserve
to change interest rates in between its eight regularly scheduled
policy-setting meetings. The last such move came in 1994. The fact
that it did again is a clear sign of growing concern about the
economy. ``This means that Alan Greenspan is legitimately
worried,'' said economist Larry Chimerine of Economic Strategy
Institute. (US-FED-INTEREST RATES)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Trade Organization has scaled back its
predictions of trade growth for this year because of the sharp
economic slowdown in Asia, officials said Thursday. WTO experts
have trimmed their predictions to a 4 percent growth in world trade
volume this year, down from the 7 percent they were projecting last
spring, said Patrick Low, the organization's chief economist. WTO
spokesman Keith Rockwell said the main reason for the revised
estimate has been the persistence of ``the economic doldrums in
Japan'' and the wider effects in Asia. ``Clearly the impact of the
global financial crisis is being felt in the trade arena,''
Rockwell told The Associated Press. (TRADE-WORLD GROWTH)
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's corporate
behemoth, Anglo American Corp., on Thursday unveiled a huge
restructuring and announced it was moving its headquarters to
London. The new company, Anglo American PLC, would become one of
the world's largest mining and natural resources conglomerates,
with major holdings in precious and base metals, diamonds,
industrial minerals and other industrial and financial activities.
It would have a market capitalization of 6.1 billion pounds (dlrs
10.37 billion), and by moving its headquarters to London it will
effectively transfer ownership of South Africa's most prized assets
abroad. The South African Reserve Bank has approved the plan, the
company said. (SOUTH AFRICA-ANGLO AMERICAN)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The advisory board of Thyssen on
Thursday unanimously approved a merger with its longtime competitor
Krupp, in a deal that will create one of Europe's largest
companies. Krupp approved the deal earlier this week. The merger
has been approved by European Union officials but also requires a
vote by stockholders and is expected to take effect next March. The
combined company would be Germany's fifth-largest industrial
concern, behind electronics giant Siemens and carmaker Volkswagen,
employing 180,000 people with 70 billion marks (dlrs 38 billion) in
annual sales. (GERMANY-THYSSEN-KRUPP)
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of the International Monetary Fund said
Thursday that China is going in the right direction to reform its
banking and public sectors, and was right to have resisted the
temptation to devalue its currency. Speaking at a conference
organized by the French Banking Association, IMF Managing Director
Michel Camdessus also reaffirmed that the Fund is ready to pump
more money into Russia, on condition the Russian government
develops a credible recovery program. The Chinese has made a ``wise
choice'' in keeping their currency steady despite political and
economic pressures they came under as a result of the Asian
financial crisis, he told French bankers. (FRANCE-IMF-CAMDESSUS)
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The Coca-Cola Co. confirmed its own gloomy
predictions for the third quarter Thursday, reporting a 12 percent
drop in net income. The world's biggest soft drink concern earned
dlrs 888 million, or 36 cents per diluted share, in the three
months ended Sept. 30, down from dlrs 1.01 billion, or 40 cents a
share, in the same quarter of 1997. Revenue for the quarter fell 4
percent to dlrs 4.75 billion from dlrs 4.95 billion a year ago.
Leaders of the Atlanta-based company, which has been buffeted by
the economic downturn hitting Asia, Russia and Latin America,
warned analysts last month to expect a decline in third quarter
results. (US-EARNS-COCA-COLA)

Woods vs. Woosnam: A mismatch on paper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Tiger Woods vs. Ian Woosnam. What
a mismatch. They've each won the Masters, but that's about all they
have in common.
	   The 22-year-old Woods is a lanky, natural athlete who takes care
of himself and crushes 300-yard (273-meter) drives. Woosnam is 40,
5-feet-4 (1.64 meters) with a small paunch, and can be as short as
220 off the tee and never more than 270.
	   Woosnam has won this World Match Play Championship twice, but
this year he shouldn't even be here. He was called at the last
minute this week to replace injured Bernhard Langer _ and Langer
was a fill-in, himself, for American Stewart Cink.
	   ``I'm very fortunate to be here, I've got nothing to lose,''
Woosnam said. ``I should have been watching it at home, with a pint
in my hand _ most probably.''
	   They were to face each other in one of four quarterfinals Friday
with every advantage going to Woods on the wet, long-playing West
Course at Wentworth.
	   In other quarterfinals, three-time champion and No. 3 seed Ernie
Els faced Lee Westwood, Colin Montgomerie played No. 4 seed Mark
O'Meara, and Patrik Sjoland was up against top seed and defending
champion Vijay Singh.
	   Woods _ playing this event for the first time _ is nursing the
flu, and Woosnam said that might be his only chance.
	   ``If he's not feeling well and wants to pull out, he can if he
wants to,'' Woosnam said.
	   ``I must admit the course is playing very long for me, it's a
struggle,'' he said. ``I could use an extra 15, 20 yards it's so
wet out there.''
	   In Thursday's first-round matches, Westwood defeated Stuart
Appleby 8 and 7, Sjoland got through beating Steve Stricker 1-up,
Montgomerie won over Thomas Bjorn 4 and 3, and Woosnam beat Darren
Clarke 4 and 3.
	   Westwood was 12 under for 29 holes after shooting an 8-under 64
for the first 18 _ two off matching the tournament record.
	   ``All parts of my game are on song,'' Westwood said.
	   ``When you shoot 12 under for 29 holes, it can't help but boost
your confidence.'' he said. ``I am definitely in the confidence
zone.''
	   The 25-year-old Westwood, No. 2 on this year's European money
list with a chance to dethrone five-time defending champion
Montgomerie, broke his match open on the first 18 with birdies of
between 10 and 15 feet (3 and 5 meters) on eight, nine, 10 and 11.
	   Appleby shot 67 on the first 18 and was playing well enough to
win any of the other opening round matches.
	   Sweden's Sjoland, in a match never separated by more than two
holes, won on the 36th when he hit a 9-iron to 18 inches (half
meter) and was conceded birdie. Stricker, just off the edge of the
green, chipped to only 12 feet (4 meters) and then missed his
birdie.
	   ``I hit a great shot to be in front of the green and I should
have gotten down in two from there,'' said Stricker, who lost here
to Els in the second round in '96. ``I hit the putt right in the
middle of the hole but not long enough.''
	   Montgomerie, leading by one hole after 18 but all-square after
23, broke his match open with three straight birdies on the 24th,
25th and 26th _ all in the eight-foot range (3 meters) _ to take a
decisive three-hole lead.
	   Montgomerie picked up an unusual penalty during his first 18
when, on the seventh hole, he and Bjorn drove nearly side by side.
Playing preferred lies because of the wet fairways, the Scot picked
up a ball to mark it _ only to learn it was Bjorn's.
	   The error came when spotters _ who let the crowd know which ball
is which _ got it wrong, but the penalty proved of no importance.
	   ``He (O'Meara) is as confident as anybody in world golf right
now and I'll need to putt very well _ maybe better than today _ to
compete with him,'' Montgomerie said.

U.N. grants observer status to Caribbean states, OECD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly granted observer
status Thursday to the Association of Caribbean States and to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
	   The Association of Caribbean States seeks to boost trade and
cultural and scientific cooperation among its 25 members. The OECD
acts as a sort of think tank for its 29 industrialized member
countries.
	   The two organization will be able to participate in General
Assembly discussions but neither will have voting rights. The
assembly approved resolutions seeking observer status for the
groups without a vote.
	   Guyana's U.N. ambassador, Samuel Insanally, said observer status
for the Caribbean group would benefit both it and the United
Nations. Luis Raul Estevez-Lopez, a minister in Guatemala's U.N.
mission, introduced the resolution for the Association of Caribbean
States.
	   Maciej Kozlowski, an under-secretary of state for Poland,
introduced the resolution for the OECD. He said the goals of the
group _ encouraging free trade and economic growth _ were
compatible with U.N. principles.

Elusive Iraqi document resurrected as an issue at UN
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A handwritten document of the Iraqi air
force that surfaced during a July inspection has become another
source of friction between Baghdad and the Security Council as the
United Nations works to break the impasse over stalled arms
searches.
	   The council president, Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, summoned
Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, for a meeting Thursday to remind
him that Baghdad had an obligation to turn the document over to
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Hamdoon told reporters afterwards the document had nothing to do
with Iraq's disarmament and said it wouldn't be turned over until a
``comprehensive review'' of sanctions got under way.
	   The document, discovered during a July 18 inspection, detailed
types of bombs and rockets that Iraq has said were used to deliver
chemical and biological agents, the chief U.N. weapons inspector,
Richard Butler, has told the council.
	   Inspectors were allowed to read the document and take notes on
it but weren't allowed to make a copy of it in violation of their
mandate, Butler has said.
	   The matter resurfaced earlier this week after it was learned
that Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, had brought a copy
of the document with him to New York, where he held 10 days of
talks with the U.N. chief and council members.
	   The trip was intended to try to work out a deal in which Iraq
would reverse its Aug. 5 decision to freeze spot weapons searches,
and in return get a ``comprehensive review'' of its efforts to
disarm itself.
	   The review could highlight Iraq's progress to disarm itself of
weapons of mass destruction while building momentum for easing
sanctions that have crippled Iraq's economy.
	   Hamdoon said Thursday that he expected the Iraqi leadership
would respond to the proposal for a comprehensive review in a
matter of days.
	   During the 10 days of talks, none of the council members asked
for a copy of the document, and Aziz didn't volunteer it to any of
them. Aziz showed the document to the U.N. special representative,
Prakash Shah, but didn't give him a copy, Hamdoon said.
	   Aziz brought the document in the event that the ``comprehensive
review'' get under way while the Baghdad delegation was in town,
Hamdoon said.
	   But he also downplayed the significance of the document, saying
it was handwritten and wasn't even an official memo. ``This is
irrelevant to the work of disarmament,'' he told reporters after
the meeting with Greenstock.
	   Greenstock said Iraq should have handed the document over months
ago, and said its failure to do so was ``a mark of the reluctance
of Iraq to cooperate with the council'' and inspectors.
	   Since the July discovery, Iraq has kept the document under seal.
Butler was supposed to have reviewed it during a trip to Baghdad in
August but was refused. His trip ended with Iraq freezing
cooperation with his staff.
	   U.N. inspectors must verify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions.
	   Baghdad claims it has destroyed its banned weapons and has given
U.N. inspectors all the documents and evidence it has concerning
the programs.
	   But U.N. officials regard the discovery of the document as proof
that Iraq is withholding vital data.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items about Nicole Kidman, Benjamin Netanyahu's son,
Kate Winslet, Bruce Springsteen, a statue of Ramses II; Some items
have already moved separately &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Nicole Kidman is coming to Broadway in ``The
Blue Room,'' a sizzling adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's
daisy-chain drama of sex and seduction.
	   Kidman has helped make the production the hottest ticket in
London, where one critic called her ``pure theatrical Viagra.''
	   She plays several characters, including a drug-addled model, an
amorous maid and a politician's wife. The London production closes
Oct. 31 and it opens a three-month Broadway run on Dec. 13 at the
Cort Theater.
	   Meanwhile, Kidman said in the November issue of Ladies' Home
Journal that recent tabloid reports of a cell-phone screaming match
with husband Tom Cruise were true, but the papers spliced several
parts together in published transcripts.
	   ``We were fighting about how many people to invite to (son)
Connor's birthday party, and then we started fighting about which
one of us was more tired and who was working harder. Quite boring,
actually,'' she said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ When Avner, the son of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said he wanted to leave kindergarten, he meant it.
	   But no one took the 4-year-old seriously until well after he had
picked up his backpack and quietly left the building without anyone
noticing, the Israeli daily Maariv reported Thursday.
	   For nearly half an hour, Avner wandered around the street and
parking lot near his kindergarten Tuesday, occasionally calling,
``Yaakov, Yaakov,'' the name of the driver who takes him to and
from kindergarten. Yaakov didn't answer, but three teen-agers heard
his calls and asked him what his father's name was.
	   ``Bibi,'' said little Avner, using his father's nickname.
	   Netanyahu was notified of Avner's disappearance and took a break
from a tense Cabinet dealing with Israel's negotiating positions in
this week's Mideast summit.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Kate Winslet says she's not ungrateful about being
voted Body of the Year in a women's poll, but still finds the
designation ``a little bit irritating.''
	   ``Why do we keep talking about women's bodies all the time,
particularly actresses?'' the ``Titanic'' star said in a taping of
Clive Anderson's ``All Talk'' television show airing Thursday
night.
	   ``I'm a normal human being, and we all go up and down,'' said
Ms. Winslet, 23, who has acknowledged suffering from an eating
disorder in her teens.
	   ``The weight stuff that goes on in the papers just makes me ill
because there are so many young girls out there whose minds are
being so messed up by this, and I just think it is upsetting and it
should just stop,'' she said.
	   The poll, conducted by the makers of Nivea products, showed
1,000 women put Ms. Winslet ahead of other celebrities such as
members of the Spice Girls as the woman with the shape they most
envied.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ A High Court judge said Thursday that he expects
to decide in three weeks whether Bruce Springsteen can block the
release of a collection of his 1972 songs.
	   The 49-year-old rocker wants an injunction barring a British
company called Masquerade Music from issuing a CD of unreleased
songs called ``Before Fame.''
	   During an eight-day hearing, which ended Thursday, Springsteen
attorney Nigel Davis said the release of the songs would damage the
singer's reputation. Davis contended the songs were not used on
Springsteen's records because they did not meet his standards.
	   Masquerade Music argued that it was given rights to the songs by
a member of Springsteen's former management team, Jim Cretecos.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A lawyer has filed suit to block a planned
move of a statue of Pharaoh Ramses II, claiming the long-dead
monarch spoke to him in a dream and opposed the move, a court
official said Thursday.
	   Moustafa Raslan filed suit against Culture Minister Farouk
Hosni, who has agreed to move the 10-meter (33-foot) granite statue
out of Cairo's traffic-clogged Ramses Square after complaints that
it was being damaged by pollution.
	   Ramses ruled Egypt from 1304 to 1237 B.C. His statue is to be
moved to a quieter location but no date for the move has been set.
	   The court official, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity, quoted Raslan's suit as saying that during the lawyer's
dream, Ramses stated he wanted to ``look on his nation'' from the
square named for him.
	   Raslan has a history of filing odd suits, including one
dismissed earlier this year that blamed Britain's Queen Elizabeth
II for the death of Princess Diana.

Typhoon Zeb heads for Japan after hitting the Philippines hard

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A weakened typhoon Zeb approached islands in
southern Japan on Friday, after killing at least 28 people in the
Philippines and Taiwan, and leaving a trail of destruction.
	   Packing maximum sustained winds of 125 kilometers (80 miles),
Zeb was located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest of the
island of Ishigaki in Okinawa prefecture, or state, Japan's
Meteorological Agency said.
	   It was moving north-northeast at about 30 kilometers (20 miles)
an hour, the agency said. Morning weather reports forecast rain for
most of western and central Japan over the weekend due to the
effects of the typhoon.
	   Two domestic flights from Tokyo's Haneda airport to Okinawan
islands in the south were canceled Friday morning because of the
typhoon, airport authorities said.
	   Besides 24 deaths in the Philippines, Zeb claimed four lives in
nearby Taiwan, where the storm's outer fringes flooded streets and
triggered landslides that blocked traffic on many highways.
	   In Taiwan, Zeb caused floods and landslides and widespread power
blackouts throughout the island. Schools and offices were closed in
most parts of the island Friday, and the stock exchange also
suspended trading in the capital of Taipei.
	   Police said of the four killed, one was smashed by a fallen
billboard and another by a fallen tree.
	   Two others were listed as missing when their car fell into a
drainage ditch in eastern Hualien, police said.
	   Many international flights were canceled, and others arriving in
Taipei were rerouted to Hong Kong, airport officials said.
	   The death toll in the Philippines, where the storm was at its
worst Wednesday, was expected to rise as authorities checked many
reports of flooding and damage from devastating winds and waves.
	   Most deaths were blamed on landslides; other people were
electrocuted or killed by power lines, debris or or falling trees.
	   At its peak, the storm's sustained winds of 240 kilometers per
hour (150 mph) and gusts were clocked at 295 kilometers an hour
(184 mph). Winds weakened to 165 kilometers per hour (103 mph) as
it moved inland.
	   Although the storm was expected to pick up force over the
Pacific, forecasters said it would not equal its earlier strength.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines because of flooding. Most have since returned home, but
more than 10,000 people remained in 28 government shelters.
	   Among the dead were two young brothers _ ages 2 and 4 _ killed
when a hill unleashed tons of mud and debris on the town of
Antipolo, just outside Manila. Their 6-year-old sister survived.
	   In Benguet province, at least 10 people were killed and an
undetermined number were missing after boulders, mud and debris
crashed down a mountain and buried workers' quarters of the Luzon
Hydroelectric Cooperative.
	   In nearby Baguio City, five people died in separate landslides,
and a 30-year-old South Korean student was killed when a section of
road collapsed, plunging his car into a ravine, said Chief
Inspector Ricardo Villena.
	   ``There are so many reports of landslides that will keep us busy
for a while,'' Villena said.
	   Last month, Tropical Storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers drowned and
80 missing and presumed dead.

Ben Johnson beaten by two horses in charity race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTETOWN, Prince Edward Island (AP) _ Banned for life from
running against humans, disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson took on two
horses and a race car in a charity event _ beating the car but
losing to the horses.
	   The winner in Thursday's race was a 17-year-old saddle horse
that splashed down a muddy harness-racing track in about seven
seconds. A harness-racing horse finished second, while Johnson was
third.
	   Johnson, 36, had to cover 80 meters. The thoroughbred ran 120
meters, the harness-racing horse 100 meters and the stock car 140
meters.
	   About 5,000 people packed Charlottetown Driving Park despite
heavy rain to watch the race, dubbed locally as the ``first
interspecies Olympics.''
	   Before the race, Johnson's agent brushed aside suggestions that
the event was a freak show.
	   ``This is not a circus and Ben is not a circus,'' said Morris
Chrobotek. ``We did this strictly to raise money for children with
life-threatening illnesses.''
	   In addition to raising money for charity, the event was intended
to help Johnson improve an image that has been tarnished since he
tested positive for steroids after placing first in the 100 meters
at the Seoul Olympics in 1988.
	   He was suspended for that infraction, made a comeback, then was
suspended for life after a second positive drug test in 1993. Last
month, he lost an appeal of that lifetime ban.

Tokyo stocks jump following Fed rate cut, dollar down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices jumped early Friday after the
Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates to prevent the U.S.
economy from slipping into a recession. The U.S. dollar was sharply
lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 181.71
points, or 1.40 percent, to 13,177.08 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Thursday, the Nikkei index closed down 75.36
points, or 0.58 percent _ the third consecutive day of declines.
	   Citing concerns over a potential credit crunch, the Fed cut the
overnight rate on loans between banks, the federal funds rate, to 5
percent. It cut the discount rate on its own loans to banks, also
by a quarter point, to 4.75 percent.
	   The surprise move led to a rally on Wall Street, where the Dow
Jones industrial average closed up 330.58 points, or 4.1 percent,
at 8,299.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section also rose, moving up 16.71 points, or 1.70 percent,
to 996.82 points. The TOPIX closed down 4.07 points, or 0.41
percent, the day before.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 116.04 yen in
early trading, down 2.69 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also
below its late New York level of 116.75 yen overnight.
	   Lower interest rates tend to weaken a nation's currency and
assets, as investors seek higher returns elsewhere.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.810 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.850 percent,
driving its price up to 108.87 yen from 108.48 yen.

Three share lead after second round of Las Vegas Invitational
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ David Ogrin is trying to keep his tour card.
Bob Tway's goal is getting in the Tour Championship.
	   Robert Damron simply wants to have some fun.
	   Three golfers with differing perspectives _ but some low scores
in common _ shared the lead Thursday at 11-under after two rounds
of the Las Vegas Invitational.
	   Tway shot 65, Ogrin 66 and Damron 68 to share a one-shot lead
over five other players _ including Paul Azinger and local invitee
Bob May _ with three rounds left in the 90-hole event.
	   ``That's the kind of round I like to play,'' Ogrin said after
posting the first 11-under score, only to see Damron and Tway tie
him with late afternoon rounds.
	   Ogrin, fighting to keep his tour card for next year despite
having made 20 cuts this year, started and finished with birdies on
the TPC Summerlin course that proved friendly once again to the
touring pros.
	   It put him in position to make yet another cut on Friday, then
hope he can improve on weekend performances that have left him in
132nd on the money list with dlrs 199,637 this year. The top 125
players automatically get tour cards for next year.
	   ``On one level I've played great golf, really smooth and
consistent this year,'' Ogrin said. ``But my Sunday scoring average
is pretty lousy.''
	   Like Ogrin, Tway is trying to use the dlrs 2 million tournament
to get somewhere _ but in his case it's the season-ending Tour
Championship.
	   The top 30 money winners qualify for the final tournament _ and
that's exactly where Tway is, at No. 30 with dlrs 850,824 on the
season.
	   ``My first goal will be trying to win the golf tournament, but
second will be playing well enough to get into that tournament,
that's for sure,'' Tway said.
	   Tway shot his score at the Las Vegas Country Club, while Damron
played at the Desert Inn Country Club. Three courses are used for
the first three days of the tournament, then the amateurs are cut
and the final two rounds are played at TPC Summerlin.
	   Damron, 93rd on the money list in his sophomore year on the
tour, didn't touch a club until Wednesday morning after pulling out
of last week's Michelob Championship following the third round.
	   ``I just felt exhausted,'' Damron said. ``I just kind of told
myself I'm tired and I really don't want to be here.''
	   Damron went home to Kentucky where he relaxed with his
girlfriend, then flew here Tuesday night to see if he could get his
game back. It seemed to have worked when he followed an
opening-round 65 with a 68.
	   ``I just wasn't having any fun and that's part of the reason we
play this game in the first place. We should have some fun,'' he
said.
	   Chip Beck, who missed the cut in 46 tournaments before finally
making one last month, put himself in position for only his second
payday of the year with a 68 that left him in a group of four
players two shots off the lead at 9-under.
	   John Daly, meanwhile, followed his most consistent round of the
year with a roller coaster round that started with a double bogey,
included an eagle, and finished with two consecutive bogeys. Still,
he managed a 70 that put him five shots off the lead.

	   LILONGWE, Malawi (AP) _ The patients lie two to a bed and on the
floor, waiting to be sent home to die. Tattered blankets brought by
relatives drape their shrunken bodies, because Lilongwe Central
Hospital doesn't have any linen.
	   The sounds of sawing and hammering in the streets testify to the
booming business done by the capital's coffin-makers. Public
offices grind to a halt because so many workers are away at
funerals. Businesses are crippled when key employees die.
	   After coursing through other parts of Africa, AIDS is rampaging
in southern Africa, turning the region into the epidemic's super
nova and changing the nature of existence.
	   Extraordinarily high death and infection rates are devastating
families, threatening economies, creating a generation of orphans
and lowering life expectancy in Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa,
Malawi, Swaziland, Botswana and Namibia.
	   ``It's worse than anything else southern Africa has seen,'' said
Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of the U.N. AIDS program in
Geneva. ``What other catastrophe is going to kill 20 to 30 percent
of the adults?''
	   All told, Africa south of the Sahara has two-thirds of the
world's people infected with the AIDS virus, or 21 million. Four of
every five women with the virus live there, and as do virtually all
the 8.2 million children orphaned by AIDS.
	   Already overwhelmed with poverty and basic health issues like
clean water, African governments have responded feebly to the
epidemic, AIDS experts say, leaving much of the task to foreign
donors and aid agencies.
	   But now the sheer numbers of deaths in upper government and
ruling party echelons, middle management, the military and
bureaucracy and even their families are moving national leaders to
confront the disaster.
	   It's hard to ignore the numbers.
	   _In Botswana and Zimbabwe, one of every four adults is infected
with the AIDS virus, the U.N. AIDS program estimates.
	   _In Zimbabwe, where bodies are filling morgue corridors, 1.2
million adults will die from the disease by 2005, the government
says.
	   _AIDS has cut average life expectancy in Malawi to 37, from 51.
	   _Zambia has 360,000 children orphaned by AIDS.
	   The continent's biggest economic and military power, South
Africa, is reaching its own state of crisis.
	   From 1994, when free elections ended apartheid, to last year,
the infection rate rose from 7.6 percent to 17 percent. In the
worst hit province, KwaZulu-Natal, nearly one-third of pregnant
women are infected with the AIDS virus.
	   ``In South Africa you talked about the loss of a generation of
kids due to apartheid. Now you're talking about a lost generation
due to AIDS,'' said Alan W. Whiteside, who runs an AIDS-economics
research division at the University of Natal in Durban, South
Africa.
	   Statistics on the extent of the AIDS epidemic are spotty.
Experts rely on figures from prenatal testing clinics and
extrapolate from there. Many believe the numbers of AIDS cases are
underestimated.
	   The infection is mainly transmitted through heterosexual sex in
Africa. The large-scale movement of people _ either refugees or
job-seekers forced by poverty _ help spread the disease, along with
the practice of having multiple sex partners in some cultures. Lack
of education and the high rate of sexually transmitted disease also
are factors.
	   Countries in southern Africa are slowly moving into action,
partly inspired by Uganda _ the continent's only success story in
fighting AIDS, where the infection rate is declining because of a
public information campaign and broad consensus on tackling the
problem.
	   South Africa introduced a 80 million-rand (dlrs 13 million)
initiative in September designed to push government ministries and
private businesses to come up with their own ways to deal with
AIDS.
	   Zimbabwe has a female condom program. Zambia has introduced the
subject of AIDS in school curriculums.
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development is helping
Malawi's government develop an AIDS strategy. With little money in
the coffers, one of the government's main initiatives in rural
areas is to set up volunteer village committees to help orphans,
teach families to care for ill members and educate young people on
the dangers of AIDS.
	   Malawi suffers all the AIDS-related problems typical of the
region, and a devastation rendered more obvious because of its
extreme poverty.
	   Malawi is so poor there is no television and the highways have
more barefoot pedestrians on the roadside than cars. Half the
people live on less than a dollar a day.
	   The epidemic is ``killing off a lot of young people, leaving
behind orphans, destroying small businesses, taking its toll on
most (institutions) and leaving a lot of grief behind,'' said Owen
Kalua, planning director for Malawi's National AIDS Control
Program.
	   ``We are already so overwhelmed. And now this. There's a sense
of giving up.''
	   Malawi's population of 10 million is roughly that of Belgium,
but it has 100 times the number of people infected with the AIDS
virus or sick with full-blown AIDS _ 710,000.
	   By 2000, 1.2 million Malawian children, more than a quarter of
the total, will have lost a parent to AIDS and other causes, USAID
says.
	   The epidemic is straining the extended family structures that
are central to African life.
	   Grandparents traditionally take in orphans. But the burden can
be crushing when the main source of support for the elderly _ their
own offspring _ are dead.

	   The cost of basic care alone for an AIDS patient, or even a
funeral, can drive a family over the brink. Or the costs force
families to cut corners such as removing girls from school to save
money, undoing basic steps forward in development.
	   Forget the ``drug cocktails'' that are prolonging lives in the
West. The dlrs 10,000 to dlrs 20,000 yearly expense for such
treatment is more than many poor Africans make in a lifetime.
	   The dark heart of Malawi's crisis can be found at Lilongwe
hospital.
	   Four-fifths of the patients are infected with the AIDS virus,
half have full-blown AIDS, said Dr. Hamish Dobbie, a Briton who
runs the medical wards.
	   ``We're running an HIV unit, with a little bit of this and
that,'' he said, laying charts on top of the listless bodies he
examines.
	   A foul smell of urine and sweat fills the admitting ward. Many
patients are gaunt from tuberculosis, which spreads quickly through
bodies weakened by the AIDS virus. A teen-ager stares without focus
from meningitis, another HIV opportunist.
	   Like most public hospitals in the region, Lilongwe Central sends
its terminal patients home, unable to cope with the sheer numbers.
That compounds the tragedy for many, whose families reject them
because of the strong stigma AIDS carries in Africa.
	   In Durban, South Africa, many of those unfortunates end up in
the Ark Christian Ministry shelter _ a red brick barracks built 65
years ago to house rail workers in the port district. It is one of
the few refuges for homeless AIDS sufferers in the city, site of
the next World Aids Congress in 2000.
	   Ivan Tennunson, 28, diagnosed in 1994, moved to the shelter when
his father and then brother refused to take him in.
	   ``Sometimes you want to scream about it; sometimes you want to
cry about it,'' said Tennunson, a cigarette in his trembling hand.
	   ``But one thing I can tell you, it's not going to go away. In
the end you just want to be alone. You just want to sit on a beach
and think, when is this going to come to an end?''

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ An 18-year-old diligently learning to
tailor a shirt in a cheerful church is one small part of an
extraordinary campaign to prevent her and other Ugandans from dying
as her parents did _ from AIDS.
	   The immune-stripping disease first killed Annet Namuyomba's
father, then her mother. In many African countries, she and her
brothers and sisters would have been shunned by relatives.
	   But in Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni _ from the time he took
power in 1986 _ made his country the first on the continent to
respond with candor and activism to AIDS, encouraging prevention as
well as care for the stricken and their children.
	   Museveni recently called on African leaders to be more
aggressive in fighting the disease, which has infected 21 million
people on the continent, two-thirds of the worldwide total.
	   ``African governments must be open and accept the challenge in
order to be able to fight the epidemic,'' said Museveni, who went
on to blame the inroads of AIDS on Africans imitating the
promiscuity of Westerners.
	   ``This sexual laxity existing today is a colonial phenomenon,''
he said at an AIDS conference Sept. 21. ``We have lost the
traditional values, and yet we do not have a sophisticated health
network of the modern world.''
	   Uganda, which had the highest AIDS rate in the world in 1982, is
the only African country south of the Sahara to achieve a decline
in new infections.
	   The overall rate dropped from a peak of 14 percent in 1990 to
9.5 percent last year, according to the U.N. AIDS program.
	   ``Uganda has proved that intense response to the AIDS epidemic
can achieve measurable results,'' said Elizabeth Marum, an adviser
from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
	   Still, ``slim disease,'' as Ugandans commonly call AIDS, has
taken a huge toll in this East African country, where some
researchers think the epidemic may have begun in the late 1970s.
	   More than 2 million Ugandans _ more than 10 percent of the
population _ are now infected. More than 1.8 million already have
died.
	   Realizing the disease threatened the social, political and
economic fabric of his country, Museveni engaged religious and
traditional leaders and other sectors of society in an urgent
debate that forged consensus around the need to attack AIDS.
	   AIDS education messages have been common in the mass media,
including radio, which is widely listened to in Uganda. Roadside
billboards encourage abstinence, fidelity _ and, when willpower
fails, the use of condoms.
	   Condom sales have soared from near nil when the epidemic broke
out to 40 million last year.
	   Setting aside a half-finished, blue-striped shirt, Namuyomba
said she has learned the value of safe sex through the Kamowokya
Caring School, which is run by a Christian community in a Kampala
slum.
	   The tailoring skills she is learning are intended to give her an
income so she will not be forced to turn to prostitution. Others
are studying bricklaying, baking, carpentry and cobbling.
	   In 1995, the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey found that
nearly all Ugandan adults had heard of AIDS.
	   Today, Ugandans report fewer casual sexual partners, and young
people are delaying sexual activity.
	   The courage of people with AIDS in counseling other sufferers
and their families has made a dramatic and emotionally compelling
contribution, said Mary Grace Alwano Edyegu, executive director of
the AIDS Information Center.
	   The center opened in 1990, Africa's first offering anonymous
AIDS counseling and testing.
	   ``People think, if it could be this one who's infected, it could
be me,'' she said.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Simon Ngcobo lives under a
death sentence in a house called the Place of Hope.
	   One foot sticking out of a hole in his blue-and-white sleeper,
he smiles at a visitor from between the rails of his crib.
	   Simon is barely 13 months old. Within three years he will
probably be dead.
	   In sub-Saharan Africa's AIDS epidemic, perhaps the cruelest
statistic is that nearly 1 million children are infected. Many are
among the nearly 8 million young Africans orphaned by AIDS.
	   But another alarming phenomenon is developing _ more and more
AIDS-infected babies are being abandoned.
	   After Simon was born on Sept. 19, 1997, in a Johannesburg
hospital, his AIDS-infected mother walked away and never came back.
She had given a false address. Her surname, which Simon inherited,
was also probably made up.
	   Nationwide statistics are not kept. But in Johannesburg alone,
120 abandoned babies were discovered in the first half of 1998.
Two-thirds of them were infected with the AIDS virus, social
welfare officials say.
	   ``We've found them in dustbins, in bags, in toilets, left on
buses, in the bushes,'' said Capt. Edward Hutcheons of the police
department's Child Protection Unit. ``One Saturday I had five
babies in my car, all found in one day.''
	   The government and private groups are trying to cope.
	   In November 1995, the Salvation Army converted an old folks home
to a 60-bed shelter for abandoned and abused babies. But after a
year, the shelter began taking in only abandoned babies with the
AIDS virus because there were so many.
	   Ethembeni house _ ``Place of Hope'' in the Zulu language _
quickly filled to capacity.
	   Other shelters have been created. The government also is
subsidizing the training of foster parents.
	   Social workers say some mothers suffering from AIDS or infected
with the virus are driven to abandon their babies because they're
often single, very sick and lack the money and the will to raise a
child.
	   ``Their circumstances are so horrendous that a baby is not
something they can deal with,'' said Beverly Krill, a social worker
at Johannesburg General Hospital.
	   At Ethembeni, the babies get food, a bed and a dose of love.
	   An AIDS quilt with the names of some of the 36 resident babies
who have died adorns the entrance. A crocheted smiling clown
decorates the patch with Lerato Lefosa's name. The 4-year old died
on Oct. 24, 1997.
	   ``She contracted chicken pox and two days later she was dead,''
said Ethembeni's director, Tersia Finn, looking at a picture of the
smiling youngster. ``It was very hard. She would always tug my
skirt and dance around me when she saw me.''
	   Finn undergoes counseling to deal with the stresses of her job.
	   ``It's difficult. You care for them for so long and they pass
on,'' she said. ``But sometimes they are in such bad shape that
it's a relief when they pass on.''
	   But hope does lie within Ethembeni's white stucco walls.
Two-thirds of babies who test positive for the AIDS virus at birth
later test negative.
	   Babies who are negative in the second test _ given after four
months _ often are adopted or find foster homes.
	   Those who remain positive _ like Simon _ are rarely adopted and
usually die by age 4, said Gail Schultz, an Ethembeni social
worker.
	   ``People don't want to bond with a baby they know has a terminal
disease,'' she said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A weakened typhoon Zeb approached islands in
southern Japan on Friday, after killing at least 28 people in the
Philippines and Taiwan, and leaving a trail of destruction.
	   Packing maximum sustained winds of 125 kph (80 mph), Zeb was
located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest of the island of
Ishigaki in Okinawa prefecture, or state, Japan's Meteorological
Agency said.
	   It was moving north-northeast at about 30 kph (20 mph), the
agency said. Morning weather reports forecast rain for most of
western and central Japan over the weekend due to the effects of
the typhoon.
	   Two domestic flights from Tokyo's Haneda airport to Okinawan
islands in the south were canceled Friday morning because of the
typhoon, airport authorities said.
	   Besides 24 deaths in the Philippines, Zeb claimed four lives in
nearby Taiwan, where the storm's outer fringes flooded streets and
triggered landslides that blocked traffic on many highways.
	   Zeb caused floods and landslides and widespread power blackouts
throughout the island. Schools and offices were closed in most
parts of the island Friday, and the stock exchange also suspended
trading in the capital of Taipei.
	   Police said of the four people killed, one was smashed by a
fallen billboard and one by a fallen tree. One person was swept out
to sea by two-story high waves while fishing, while another died
after being trapped overnight in heavy rain.
	   In addition, two others were listed as missing when their car
fell into a drainage ditch in eastern Hualien, police said.
	   Many international flights were canceled, and others arriving in
Taipei were rerouted to Hong Kong, airport officials said.
	   The death toll in the Philippines, where the storm was at its
worst Wednesday, was expected to rise as authorities checked many
reports of flooding and damage from devastating winds and waves.
	   Most deaths were blamed on landslides; other people were
electrocuted or killed by power lines, debris or or falling trees.
	   At its peak, the storm's sustained winds of 240 kph (150 mph)
and gusts were clocked at 295 kph (184 mph). Winds weakened to 165
kph (103 mph) as it moved inland.
	   Although the storm was expected to pick up force over the
Pacific, forecasters said it would not equal its earlier strength.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines because of flooding. Most have since returned home, but
more than 10,000 people remained in 28 government shelters.
	   Among the dead were two young brothers _ ages 2 and 4 _ killed
when a hill unleashed tons of mud and debris on the town of
Antipolo, just outside Manila. Their 6-year-old sister survived.
	   In Benguet province, at least 10 people were killed and an
undetermined number were missing after boulders, mud and debris
crashed down a mountain and buried workers' quarters of the Luzon
Hydroelectric Cooperative.
	   In nearby Baguio City, five people died in separate landslides,
and a 30-year-old South Korean student was killed when a section of
road collapsed, plunging his car into a ravine, said Chief
Inspector Ricardo Villena.
	   ``There are so many reports of landslides that will keep us busy
for a while,'' Villena said.
	   Last month, Tropical Storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers drowned and
80 missing and presumed dead.

	   CHIPHWANYA, Malawi (AP) _ The cemetery is nearly full in this
village of several thousand people on the parched savannah of
central Malawi. Just about every day there is a funeral.
	   Villagers know that AIDS is feeding the burial ground, but they
can do little. There is no testing, not much government aid, and
the nearest clinic is 20 kilometers (12 miles) away over rutted
dirt roads.
	   This south-central African country is so poor, and the AIDS
epidemic so bad, the government can't do much more than ask
villages to help themselves.
	   A network of village committees was set up several years ago,
but quickly fell moribund for lack of direction.
	   In stepped Save the Children with financing from the U.S. Agency
for International Development. The organization set up a program to
train villagers in caring for the sick at home, tending to the many
children orphaned by AIDS and educating young people to avoid
infection.
	   About 150 such committees have been formed in Malawi's thousands
of villages. It is the kind of local, volunteer-based effort that
typifies the attempt to grapple with the AIDS epidemic ravaging
southern Africa.
	   In other countries, activists are training traditional healers
about the fundamentals of AIDS; members of associations of people
infected with the AIDS virus act out dramas in the countryside to
preach sexual abstinence or safe sex.
	   The newly formed committee in Chiphwanya has about a dozen men _
school teachers and farmers, mainly.
	   They've been registering orphans and guide the Edzi Toto (No to
AIDS) club for youngsters. They brought a bit of money to the
family of Donata Luka, a 39-year-old woman who lives with her eight
children and four grandchildren in her mother-in-law's house.
	   Mrs. Luka's husband died in late August. She suspects it was
AIDS, though no test was done. They rarely are available in such
rural areas.
	   ``I'm worried about my own health, but especially the little
one,'' she said of 1-year-old Fatima, suckling at her breast. ``She
falls sick a lot.'' The other children, dirt-streaked and dressed
in tatters, sit quietly in front of the thatched-roof house.
	   The family gets by with what they can eat, and occasionally
sell, from their garden.
	   Mrs. Luka is lucky to have a place to stay. Under Malawian
tradition, not unusual in the region, the family of a dead man
often divides up his property, leaving the wife destitute.

	   Factors contributing to spread of AIDS in southern Africa:
	   ___
	   HISTORY: Non-democratic governments often played down AIDS.
South Africa's apartheid-era leaders ignored the disease in the
majority black population, housing black male workers in hostels
and creating conditions for multiple sexual partners and the spread
of AIDS back home. In Malawi, 30-year dictator Kamuzu Banda banned
short skirts on women, long hair on men and most discussion of
AIDS.
	   ___
	   MIGRATION: South Africa's powerful economy lures migrant
laborers from all over region, particularly miners for its gold
lodes. Traveling back and forth between work and home villages can
spread AIDS, as do truckers who frequent prostitutes on the
region's highways.
	   ___
	   VIOLENCE: Warfare or political violence displace people and
cause instability, leading to less caution in sexual relations.
Presence of paramilitaries and troops raise risk of rape. The
KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa, where factional clashes
killed thousands over past decade, has the country's highest
infection rate.
	   ___
	   CULTURE: Zulus, who dominate KwaZulu-Natal, do not practice
circumcision, and studies show uncircumcised men transmit AIDS more
easily, said Debbie Mathew, official of provincial AIDS foundation.
	   Multiple sex partners for men also are socially acceptable in
some African societies. In some traditional cultures, the brother
of a dead husband assumes responsibility for the widow and has sex
with her to cleanse her of her dead husband's spirit.
	   Some traditional healers in Zimbabwe reportedly have advised
AIDS-infected men to cure themselves by having sex with younger
women, said Rudo Kwaramba, director of Musasa, a group that
campaigns against violence against women.
	   ___
	   IGNORANCE: AIDS is often considered shameful disease, an
affliction of promiscuous. Many people don't want to know about it.
Studies show that nine out of 10 Africans infected with AIDS don't
know it.

NATO and Yugoslavs sign air surveillance accord.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO and the Yugoslav military have
signed an air surveillance deal to see if the Yugoslav president
withdraws his troops and police from the strife-torn province.
	   In Paris earlier this week, Slobodan Milosevic agreed to end his
seven-month crackdown on Kosovo Albanians. If he does not comply by
Saturday, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana has said he will be
``ready and willing to act'' with airstrikes.
	   Air surveillance will be matched by some 2,000 ground
``verifiers'' to be provided in coming weeks by the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   The air surveillance deal was signed in Belgrade on Thursday
between NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley
Clark, and Yugoslav Army Chief-of-Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic, calls
for unarmed spy planes to watch over Milosevic's compliance to
withdraw the military from the province.
	   It is the first in a series of measures designed to force
Milosevic to fulfill all the points of the agreement or face
airstrikes by planes of the powerful Atlantic alliance.
	   They include a pullout of remaining Serb forces on the ground in
Kosovo, allowing the return of up to 300,000 refugees to their
homes and negotiations toward Albanian self-rule in the southern
Serbian province.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said that,
despite some progress, the Yugoslav president is still far from
meeting NATO's deadline on Saturday for compliance.
	   After he met the Yugoslav leader, Solana said he delivered ``a
simple, but very strong message'' to Milosevic: ``he must comply,
he must comply fully and immediately with the requirements.''
	   ``According to our information, and our information is good,
many army and special police units remain in Kosovo,'' Solana said.
	   ``These units must be withdrawn immediately,'' Solana told
reporters.
	   International officials also gathered in Paris and Vienna on
Thursday to advance the assessment process aimed at making sure
Milosevic adheres to the breakthrough agreement reached this week
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   In Vienna, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe agreed formally Thursday to oversee the 2,000-member
``ground verification mission'' -- unarmed monitors who will roam
through Kosovo to make sure terms of the agreement with Holbrooke
are being honored.
	   The OSCE said in a statement that its current chairman, Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, will sign the ground
verification agreement Friday in Belgrade with Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic.
	   Poland's ambassador to the OSCE, Adam Kobieracki, told the
Austria Press Agency that the verification mission could cost about
dlrs 200 million, with the United States, Britain, France, Russia,
Italy and Germany assuming most of the burden.
	   In Kosovo, the U.N. refugee agency delivered more aid to those
displaced by the seven-month crackdown in the secessionist Serbian
province, which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   In the village of Kisna Reka, refugees living in a makeshift
camp of 3,000 people in a nearby gully carted off 50-kilogram
(110-pound) sacks of flour, bags of clothing, cooking oil and other
supplies delivered by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   Asked how long they could stay in the woods, a man who gave his
name only as Rexhep said: ``Until we die. We don't know how much we
can take. We are afraid to go back.''
	   The Balkans Contact Group of five leading Western nations plus
Russia, meeting in Paris, fully endorsed the agreement on Kosovo
but maintained its support for airstrikes if Milosevic fails to
comply when a four-day grace period expires Saturday.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster have been
stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement. But with many
reluctant to return home, Solana said troops are not being
withdrawn fast enough for refugees to feel confident enough to go
back.
	   ``It is very important for (refugees) to return to their
villages,'' he said earlier in Brussels. ``For that, compliance
with the withdrawal of troops is very, very important.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
displaced from their homes by Milosevic's crackdown. But the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has also killed over 200 Serb
policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal to Milosevic's
government.
	   At Kisna Reka, the refugees complained that Serbian security
forces fired machine guns, mortars and other weapons throughout the
night, apparently to intimidate them from planning a return to
their villages.
	   ``There's nobody there'' in the villages, said Fatmir Nuhaj, 27,
his arms wrapped around his young son's shoulders. ``It's only to
keep us from our homes.''
	   They said unarmed monitors will do them no good.
	   The Serbs, for their part, complain that the KLA is continuing
attacks on police.
	   Serb police said three of their officers were wounded Wednesday
and another one Thursday when they were ambushed on a major Kosovo
road, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital Pristina.
	   A KLA representative warned Thursday that the rebel force won't
adhere to its cease-fire indefinitely.
	   ``If the international community tries to create the illusion
that Serbia is conforming with demands ... we won't be able to
tolerate it for long,'' said Swiss-based representative Bardhyl
Mahmuti in Geneva.

Incoming German government still negotiating on energy and taxes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Talks resume at 1300 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Pushing to finish talks on forming a new
center-left government, Germany's Social Democrats and Greens
revisit the divisive issue of energy taxes Friday.
	   Party leaders, who had hoped to wrap up the negotiations this
weekend, said late Thursday they would stretch till at least
Monday.
	   Social policies, which were on the agenda for Friday, were
pushed back a day so that more time could be devoted to energy
questions, including ending the use of atomic power and raising
taxes on gasoline and other forms of energy.
	   On Thursday the two sides said that they had agreed to pass a
law within the first 100 days in office to abandon nuclear energy,
a move strongly pushed by the environmentalist Greens, who wanted
immediate closure of some plants.
	   But in what party leaders called a compromise, the future
governing partners agreed to start talks with the nuclear industry
next year on the fate of Germany's 19 atomic power plants.
	   If no consensus with industry can be reached by November 1999,
Greens party leader Juergen Trittin said legislation will be
enacted setting a timetable for plant closures. That timetable was
left undefined.
	   While Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has spoken of pulling
the plug on nuclear power plants over the next 30 years, Trittin
insisted ``a series of atomic power plants will go off line in this
legislative period,'' meaning the next four years.
	   One-third of Germany's electricity is produced by nuclear
energy. Power companies argue shutting them prematurely would
result in higher prices and force them to rely more on burning oil
and coal, creating more pollution.
	   ``We have always said that we wouldn't turn our back on
consensual talks,'' said Hermann Venghaus, spokesman for industry
giant RWE. ``But we have always held the standpoint that nuclear
energy ... should continue to play an important role in the energy
mix.''
	   Meanwhile, incumbent Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
Christian Democrats, who lost to the Social Democrats in Sept. 27
elections, criticized the incoming government's plan to liberalize
Germany's citizenship law, saying it could be unconstitutional.
	   CDU legal expert Rupert Scholz said allowing dual-citizenship on
a broad basis would give those who receive it ``massive
advantages'' over Germans with just one passport.
	   The changes would scrap the principle of a 1913 law that bases
automatic citizenship on German blood ties, not place of birth.
	   The changes are seen by the incoming government as an important
gesture to 7 million foreign residents in Germany, nearly 10
percent of the population.
	   Easing citizenship rules was of special concern to Germany's 2
million Turks, many of whom were invited to take jobs in Germany
during a labor shortage in the boom years of the 1960s and whose
children were born and raised virtually as Germans.
	   ``This is a signal that we foreigners have been waiting decades
for,'' said Murat Cakir, the Turkish chairman of the national
sub-committee on foreigners in Wiesbaden.
	   It will allow those who take advantage of it better access to
employment in Germany, freer travel around the European Union, and
the right to vote in Germany.
	   But some conservatives complained dual-citizenship could lead to
divided loyalties, especially as they entered the German army to
fulfill compulsory military service.
	   Christoph Hillenbrandt, spokesman for the state Interior
Ministry in the conservative-stronghold of Bavaria, questioned how
Germany would react if it had to send German-Turkish soldiers
against Kurds in Iraq, or German-Serb soldiers as peacekeepers to
Kosovo.

German parliament to vote on NATO deployment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Session starts at 0800 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's participation in any NATO
military action against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was
in the balance Friday with the outgoing government convening a
special session to debate the issue.
	   With Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's agreement, the
outgoing Cabinet on Monday approved sending 14 German jet fighters
for any NATO attack aimed at forcing Milosevic to withdraw weapons
from Kosovo province.
	   That decision also requires parliamentary approval, but the
newly elected body is not to convene until Oct. 26. So a special
session of the outgoing parliament was called.
	   In committee meetings Thursday, lawmakers from both Schroeder's
Social Democrats and outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
coalition supported the decision.
	   Several Greens lawmakers abstained, arguing that NATO action
without an explicit U.N. mandate would violate international law.
But others said they would support Greens party leader Joschka
Fischer in backing NATO action.
	   Schroeder is expected to name Fischer as his foreign minister.
	   Despite an agreement this week easing the threat of air strikes
against Yugoslavia, Kohl's defense minister, Volker Ruehe, said the
vote was still needed. ``The sword must remain visible,'' he said.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Legislators in Peru and Ecuador debated a
proposal to give four neutral countries, including the United
States, the power to impose a solution to their long-running border
dispute.
	   The proposal Thursday was made by Ecuador's President Jamil
Mahuad and Peru's President Alberto Fujimori after years of
fruitless talks to resolve a border dispute that led to wars in
1941, 1981 and 1995.
	   If approved by both congresses, the South American neighbors
would be obliged to accept any peace plan drawn up by the United
States, Brazil, Chile and Argentina.
	   The four nations are guarantors of a 1942 peace treaty setting
the border between Peru and Ecuador. But the treaty does not
clearly demarcate 49 miles of border in the jungle-covered
Cordillera del Condor mountains.
	   The countries have squabbled over the remote area ever since in
what has become a matter of national pride on both sides of the
border.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana said aerial
fumigation of illegal drug crops, long the linchpin of U.S.
anti-narcotics policy in Colombia, is not working.
	   The president, who begins peace talks Nov. 7 with leftist
rebels, said Thursday he hopes to work with them to implement
projects that will gradually coax poor farmers to grow legal crops.
	   For crop substitution to succeed, Pastrana said there must be
enormous spending in war-torn areas and close cooperation from the
rebel groups who tax drug production to fund their guerrilla war.
	   The president's comments were likely to rankle Washington, where
Pastrana plans to visit on Oct. 27, and where the fumigation effort
has strong support.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemalan police seized a 2.4-ton
shipment of cocaine worth dlrs 30 million, the largest seizure this
year, a National Police spokesman said Thursday.
	   Gerson Lopez said the cocaine was being shipped by railroad when
it was seized Wednesday in the western city of Tecun Uman, near the
Mexican border. Police arrested a security guard and the owner of
the yard where the freight car was seized.
	   Guatemalan authorities have seized 6.6 tons of illegal drugs
this year, worth an estimated dlrs 92 million.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen
was scheduled to leave Friday on an official visit to Europe, a
presidential spokesman said.
	   Arzu was to attend the Eighth Ibero-American summit being held
Saturday and Sunday in Portugal. He also was to visit Norway and
Sweden, which helped negotiate a 1996 peace agreement between the
Guatemalan government and guerrillas, the spokesman said.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Former President Daniel Ortega led an
anti-government rally Thursday to protest high water and
electricity prices.
	   Ortega, secretary-general of the opposition Sandinista National
Liberation Front, led hundreds of protesters who rallied in front
of Congress to call on President Arnoldo Aleman to keep his promise
to lower the cost of living.
	   Ortega said the ruling party would be responsible for ``what may
happen'' if the government does not keep its promises.
	   ``We will take up arms as many times as necessary,'' said
Ortega, whose Sandinista rebels overthrew the government of
Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
	   There was no comment from the Nicaraguan government.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ For the fifth time since 1994,
soldiers have begun patrolling the streets in Honduras in an
attempt to curb rising crime.
	   Soldiers started patrolling Tegucigalpa, the capital, on
Wednesday along with San Pedro Sula, 100 miles (160 kilometers) to
the north. The military was planning to gradually place 10,000
soldiers throughout the country.
	   The deployment was sought by legislators and businesses
concerned that crime would scare away investors. Since 1994, 22,000
people have been the victims of violent crime in the country of 5
million.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Volunteers plan to clean up Lake Titicaca, the
world's highest navigable lake, to remove a bright green carpet of
pollution-fed algae covering much of the Puno bay area.
	   Some 500 volunteers in boats will try to remove the 6-mile long
(9 kilometer-long) swath of algae by hand on Saturday, said Gilmar
Goyzueta, director of Lake Titicaca National Park.
	   The bay was last stripped of its surface algae in 1995, but the
algae has returned and spread rapidly in 1998 because of warm
temperatures brought by the El Nino weather phenomenon, Goyzueta
said.
	   The algae spoils the view of one of Peru's top tourist
destinations, creates a foul odor, clogs boat motors and threatens
aquatic plant and fish life in the shallow bay by blocking
sunlight, he said.

Zanardi tunes up for seventh victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SURFERS PARADISE, Australia (AP) _ Italian Alex Zanardi set his
sights on a seventh CART FedEx series victory this year by breaking
the track record in a Friday morning practice session for Sunday's
Australian IndyCarnival.
	   Zanardi, who has already clinched the season points
championship, sped around the 4.5-kilometer (2.795-mile) Surfers
Paradise temporary street circuit in 1 minute, 34.639 seconds and
an average speed of 106.320 miles per hour (171.105 kph).
	   That improved by .238 seconds the 134.877 mark set by Nigel
Mansell of Britain in 1994.
	   ``The car is going really well and I love these chicanes,''
Zanardi said following the session. ``Last year I could have won
this race and I've always liked racing in Australia.''
	   Last year's IndyCarnival winner Scott Pruett was also under
Mansell's record in the morning session in 1:34.791 while Canadian
Greg Moore was third-fastest and Gil de Ferran fourth.
	   The first qualifying session was scheduled for Friday afternoon.
	   Zanardi, who is moving to the Williams Formula One team next
season, has won previous races this season at Long Beach, Madison,
Ill., Detroit, Portland, Cleveland and Toronto and was second at
Houston two weeks ago. (djp)

Northern Ireland, human rights top Nobel Peace speculation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led with announcement of winner at 0900 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Northern Ireland peace process and the
50th anniversary of the U.N. Human Rights Charter were being touted
as strong contenders for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, according
to patterns of past awards and speculation in the Swedish media.
	   But, just like every year, the winner's identity remains secret
until awards committee chairman Francis Sejersted enters the
lecture hall at the Norwegian Nobel Institute at 11:00 a.m. (0900
GMT) on Friday.
	   The five-member committee refuses to disclose even the names of
candidates, much less hint who might win the 7.6 million kronor
(dlrs 963,000) award. A record 139 nominations were tallied this
year.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke has repeatedly been nominated for
his Balkan peace efforts, but his apparent Yugoslavia breakthrough
on the Kosovo ethnic conflict last week may have been too late to
boost his candidacy.
	   In recent years, the committee has used the prestige of the
prize to encourage an ongoing process. The fragile peace for
Northern Ireland is just such a process, with a peace accord signed
last April.
	   However, in putting Northern Ireland at the top of their guess
list, Norway's news media _ which closely watches the Nobels _ said
it was unclear which of many players might be honored.
	   Some guessed the prize might go to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams,
Ulster Unionist David Trimble and Social Democrat John Hume.
	   Others speculated British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern. Their predecessors _ John Major of
Britain and Albert Reynolds of Ireland _ also played key roles, as
did U.S. mediator George Mitchell.
	   The committee also uses the prize to mark important
anniversaries, and the United Nations Human Rights Charter was
signed 50 years ago.
	   That raised the possibility of a prize to the U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights, the agency's War Crimes Tribunal, a
noted human rights activist or a humanitarian group such as Doctors
Without Borders.
	   By coincidence, the national news agency NTB said, the charter's
50th anniversary is Dec. 10, the date on which the Nobel Prizes are
always presented because it was the day the prize's benefactor,
Alfred Nobel of Sweden, died.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel also figured heavily in early
speculation, as a human rights activist and to mark the 30th
anniversary of Prague Spring, the democracy movement crushed by
Soviet tanks.
	   Others mentioned include the children's peace movement in
Colombia, Kurdish activist Leyla Zana, who is jailed in Turkey;
Chinese dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng; the Salvation Army,
Pope John Paul II, Sister Helen Prejean, the author of ``Dead Man
Walking,'' for her campaign against the death penalty; and Mexico's
bishop of San Cristobel de las Casas, Samuel Ruiz Garcia, for his
campaign on behalf of the country's Indians.
	   The peace prize, which is the only Nobel awarded in Oslo, caps
the annual, week-long Nobel prize announcements.
	   In Stockholm, Sweden, where the rest of the Nobel prizes are
awarded, the literature prize went to Jose Saramago of Portugal;
the medicine prize was shared by Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J.
Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United States; the physics prize
went to Americans Robert C. Laughlin and Daniel C. Tsui, and German
Horst L. Stoermer; and the award for economics went to Amartya Sen
of India.

Olympic gold medalist negotiating agreement with Utah resort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUN VALLEY, Idaho (AP) _ Picabo Street, long associated with
Idaho's most famous ski area, is negotiating an agreement to
represent Utah's Park City Mountain Resort.
	   After promoting Sun Valley for a number of years, the Olympic
super-G gold medalist's contract with the resort ended on April 30,
1996. Her management company repeatedly tried to reach a new
agreement, but to no avail.
	   ``We don't seem to get any response,'' said Brad Hunt, president
of Gold Medal Management, the Boulder, Colo.-based company that
represents Street. ``So one can only interpret the lack of response
as a general lack of interest.''
	   Street told The Wood River Journal on Wednesday that continuing
with the Idaho resort would have been her first choice.
	   ``I love Sun Valley,'' she said. ``I was hoping to get my cake
and eat it, too.''
	   Sun Valley Co. general manager Wally Huffman was unavailable for
comment late Thursday. But Carol Waller, executive director of the
Sun Valley-Ketchum Chamber of Commerce, said Sun Valley officials
had indicated they would not be pursuing a new contract with
Street.
	   Park City spokeswoman Melissa O'Brien said the Utah resort would
like Street to maintain a regular presence at the ski area and be
its ambassador.
	   ``Hopefully, it would be the first step to a long
relationship,'' she said.
	   Regardless of business ties to Park City, Street said Sun Valley
will always have a place in her heart.
	   ``I own a home there. My driver's license is from Idaho,'' said
Street, who grew up in the Sun Valley area but now lives in
Portland, Oregon ``It's a great environment. It's a piece of
heaven. And the surrounding area, the Sawtooths and everything _ it
speaks for itself.''
	   Street, a two-time World Cup downhill champion and the 1996
World Championships downhill gold medalist, won the Olympic super-G
title in Nagano, Japan in February by one-hundredth of a second,
the closest margin in Olympic history.
	   A month later, she tore a ligament in her right knee and broke
her left leg when she crashed during the downhill in the World Cup
finals at Crans Montana, Switzerland.
	   Street said during a visit to Park City last month that she
hoped to be back on skis in November but would not be racing for
another year.

Australian prison brawl prompts investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ An investigation was under way
Friday into a videotaped prison brawl in which officials repeatedly
beat inmates with clubs.
	   Video footage of the riot at the Melbourne Custody Center on
March 6 was released to news outlets this week by Magistrate
Catherine Lamble, who said making it public was in the public
interest.
	   The footage shows a fight breaking out between a number of
inmates and prison guards. The inmates are seen throwing punches at
the guards, who respond with clubs. The film shows some of the
guards continuing to hit some inmates after they have been beaten
to the floor.
	   A spokesman for Victoria state police said an investigation had
begun to ascertain whether the level of restraint used to bring the
riot under control was appropriate in all the circumstances.
	   ``(The brawl) involved a number of prisoners, some with a
history of violent behavior, who provoked the confrontation,'' the
spokesman said, on condition of anonymity.
	   Five prisoners were charged with rioting after the brawl, which
broke out when prisoners refused to hand in towels to prison
guards.
	   But the charges were dropped when lawyers for the prisoners said
they may seek charges against police stemming from the brawl.
	   Felicity Hampel of the civil liberties organization Liberty
Victoria welcomed the police investigation.
	   ``While obviously it was a volatile situation, it appears that
after the prisoners were subdued, the police were still using
force,'' Hampel said.

Japan stocks jump following Fed rate cut, dollar sinks in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stocks, late morning bond and currency
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stock prices in Tokyo jumped early Friday on hope
the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cut short-term interest
rates will prevent a worldwide recession and keep demand strong for
Japanese goods in America. The U.S. dollar fell sharply against the
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 284.92
points, or 2.19 percent, to 13,280.29 as of midday. On Thursday,
the Nikkei closed down 75.36 points, or 0.58 percent for a third
straight day of declines.
	   The dollar bought 116.45 yen in late morning trading, down 2.28
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 116.75 yen overnight.
	   Citing concerns over a potential credit crunch, the Fed cut the
overnight rate on loans between banks, the U.S. federal funds rate,
to 5 percent on Thursday. It also lowered the discount rate on its
own loans to banks by a quarter point to 4.75 percent.
	   The surprise move triggered a rally on Wall Street, where the
Dow Jones industrial average closed up 330.58 points, or 4.1
percent, at 8,299.
	   In Japan, the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on
the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange climbed 22.89 points,
or 2.34 percent, to 1,003.00 points. The TOPIX closed down 4.07
points, or 0.41 percent, the day before.
	   Many bank shares rose on optimism the Fed's action would ease a
global tightening of credit, but shares of the troubled Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. plunged 50 percent to 4 yen (dlrs 0.03)
as of midday after having dipped to a record low 3 yen (dlrs 0.02)
in earlier trading.
	   The drop came a day after LTCB issued a statement denying recent
media reports that its debts far exceed assets, which would make
the bank effectively insolvent.
	   Shares of major electronics exporters such as Sony Corp. and TDK
Corp. were among the biggest gainers. Sony rose 3.25 percent to
8,250 yen (dlrs 70.85) as of midday and TDK picked up 3.34 percent
to 8,040 yen (dlrs 69.04).
	   But traders warned the surge in exporter-led shares was tempered
by concern over a weaker dollar, which erodes the yen value of
profits made overseas.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar declined in reaction
to the U.S. interest rate cut, traders said.
	   Lower rates make a country's fixed-income securities such as
bonds less attractive to overseas investors, reducing demand for
the currency.
	   In Tokyo, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.855 percent from Thursday's finish of
0.850 percent, driving its price down to 108.43 yen from 108.48
yen.

Five Japan chemical companies seek antidumping tariff on imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A group of Japanese chemical companies will file a
complaint against three foreign rivals for allegedly selling
products in Japan at prices lower than in their home markets, one
of the companies said Friday.
	   The five Japanese companies were making final preparations to
lodge the complaint with the Japanese government seeking
antidumping tariffs on acrylonitrile imports, said Morio Sako, a
spokesman at Asahi Chemical Industry Co.
	   ``We think the three foreign makers are exporting to Japan at
unfairly lower prices, and that it hurts Japanese manufacturers,''
Sako said.
	   Joining Asahi Chemical in the complaint are Mitsubishi Chemical
Corp., Mitsui Chemicals Inc., Sumitomo Chemical Co. and Showa Denko
K.K., Sako said.
	   The Japanese companies will complain that BP Chemicals of the
United States, Tae-Kwang Industrial Co. of South Korea and a South
African company were selling acrylonitrile in Japan at prices about
30 percent lower than at home.
	   Such a move would mark the first time a U.S. company would face
an antidumping complaint in Japan, Sako said.
	   Acrylonitrile is the main material for a kind of resin used in
acrylic fibers and the interiors of vehicles.
	   Sako said BP Chemicals has exported the product at dlrs 450 per
ton to Japan, while selling at dlrs 740 a ton in the United States.
	   The other two foreign companies have sold acrylonitrile in Japan
at almost the same price as BP Chemicals over the past year, he
added. The name of the South African company was not immediately
available.
	   Japan's market for acrylonitrile is estimated at 460,000 tons a
year, with imports accounting for 36 percent of the total, Sako
said.
	   Sako also said Japan's tariff on imported acrylonitrile is 4.6
percent, while the United States levies a 9.6 percent tariff on
acrylonitrile imports.
	   The Japanese government must rule on whether to impose
antidumping charges within one year after a complaint is filed.

Doctors begin Japan's first authorized sex-change operation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Doctors in Japan began the country's first legal
sex change operation Friday on a 30-year-old woman who says she
will finally get a body she can feel is her own.
	   The procedure began at Saitama Medical College, north of Tokyo,
with an operation to remove the woman's breasts, uterus and
ovaries, said Toshiya Fukuda, a spokesman for the medical center.
	   The woman, from northeastern Japan, has asked to be identified
as K. Nakahara.
	   Nakahara was quoted as saying by a Tokyo television station that
she had felt uncomfortable with her gender since her youth and that
the operation would give her a body that was truly hers.
	   The operation was expected to take six to eight hours. In a
second operation, to be conducted in six months, doctors will
construct male genitals.
	   In May, the ethics committee at the college approved carrying
out the sex change.
	   The Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology said last year
that sex-change operations should be permitted on the condition
that patients undergo psychoanalysis and hormone therapy afterward.

China plans law to save vanishing Yellow River
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The mighty Yellow River, cradle of Chinese
civilization, is shrinking and the government plans a law to help
save what's left of it, the state-run newspaper China Daily
reported Friday.
	   The river, which snakes 5,462 kilometers (3,414 miles) across
arid northern China, remains a perilous flood threat at times. For
about one-third of the year, however, it dries up before it reaches
its natural outlet in the Bohai Sea, leaving cities and farms short
of water.
	   Experts say excessive diversion for irrigation and massive
wastage are mainly to blame. To counter the problem, the government
is formulating a law that will enable it to control the amount of
water that is diverted from the river, the newspaper said.
	   The new law, the first of its kind for China, also would
coordinate and reinforce efforts to control the discharge of
pollutants into the river, it said.
	   In a separate report, the newspaper noted that the river's flow
into the sea had diminished from a normal 20 billion cubic meters
(700 billion cubic feet) of water to only 1.8 billion cubic meters
(63 billion cubic feet).

Mahathir arrives in Japan on first foreign trip since political
</HEADLINE>
crisis

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister arrived in Japan Friday
for private meetings with business executives and politicians on
his first trip abroad since he set off an explosive political
battle by firing a rival leader.
	   Mahathir Mohamad arrived early Friday morning in Tokyo for the
five-day trip, said a spokesman for the prime minister's
secretariat.
	   Malaysian officials refused to provide details on Mahathir's
visit, saying only that he had a full schedule of private meetings
with bankers, businessmen and politicians.
	   Mahathir was also scheduled to attend a reception on Monday
given by Emperor Akihito for African leaders attending the second
Tokyo International Conference on African Development, a Japanese
government initiative to encourage development of poor African
countries.
	   Mahathir was scheduled to address the conference on Monday.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was scheduled to hold a
reception for Mahathir on Monday, the Malaysian spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Japan's Foreign Ministry refused to comment because the
reception was private, and not an official state affair.
	   The visit marked the first time Mahathir had left Malaysia since
setting off a political furor by firing his former protege, deputy
prime minister and finance minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar went on a campaign for political reform after being fired
Sept. 2, but was arrested and is now facing trial on 10 counts of
corruption and illegal homosexual acts.
	   Mahathir said on Wednesday that junior Cabinet ministers will
head the government while he is in Japan.
	   Mahathir's meetings in Tokyo are expected to include discussions
on loans from Japan to help Malaysia deal with its deepening
economic problems.
	   Despite a deep recession of its own, Japan has provided billions
of dollars in financial support to Asian countries since the
region's financial crisis began more than a year ago.
	   Of the dlrs 30 billion aid package for Southeast Asia and South
Korea that Tokyo recently announced, dlrs 2 billion has been
allotted for Malaysia.
	   Mahathir was scheduled to give a press conference Tuesday before
returning to Malaysia.
