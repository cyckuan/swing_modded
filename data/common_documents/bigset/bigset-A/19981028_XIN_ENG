<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat met Saudi Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz in Riyadh Tuesday to
brief him on the Palestinian-Israeli peace deal signed in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian diplomats told the Kuwait News Agency that Arafat
briefed Sultan, who is also second deputy prime minister and
defense and aviation minister, on the details of the nine-day
negotiations in Washington and the efforts made by U.S. President
Bill Clinton in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two leaders discussed the outcome of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and the Mideast peace process as a
whole, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by Clinton, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu last Friday signed a land-for-peace deal to break the
19-month Mideast peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel will withdraw from another 13.1 percent
of the West Bank, in exchange for Palestinian revocation of the
call for Israel's destruction in its National Charter and
intensified crackdown on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said that during the talks, the Saudi prince
voiced his country's relief over the accord and hoped it will
enable the Palestinians to get their rights and establish their
state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived in Riyadh Monday, has already been to
Egypt, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to update their leaders on the
latest Palestinian-Israeli deal.

JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security forces
announced Tuesday that they have arrested two Palestinians
suspected of killing a Jewish settler in the divided West Bank
town of Hebron Monday, local television reported.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the two had confessed to the murder and also
the killing of another Israeli man in a communal farm outside
Jerusalem about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops enforced a curfew in the Israeli-controlled
part of Hebron Tuesday, barring about 30,000 Palestinians from
leaving their homes. Palestinians are even not allowed to go to
work or school.
</P>
<P>
The curfew, imposed Monday night after the slaying of Danny
Vargas, a 29-year-old security guard from the nearby Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba, was the third time since August that
the Palestinians in the Israeli-run sector of the city are not
allowed to go out. (Palestinians-Arrest)

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Parties in Dead Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Republicans have a 49 to 47
percent advantage over Democrats among likely voters in next
week's congressional elections, according to a USA
Today/CNN/Gallup Poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the edge is within the poll's 4 percentage point
margin of error.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four percent of all those surveyed said the country
would be better off with Republicans controlling Congress compared
to 22 percent favoring Democrats and 48 percent who said it makes
no difference.
</P>
<P>
Among those identifying themselves as Republican or leaning
Republican, 44 percent said they are more enthusiastic about
voting than usual to 39 percent who are less enthusiastic.
However, among Democrats or those leaning Democratic, only 32
percent said they are more enthusiastic than usual to 51 percent
who described themselves as less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
Among likely voters, 24 percent said their vote will send a
message of support for President Bill Clinton in the "Monica
Lewinsky matter" and 22 percent a message of opposition. But 52
percent said their vote in the congressional elections will not be
intended to send a message on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
About one third of all adults surveyed want their House member
to vote in favor of impeaching Clinton, to 61 percent against a
vote to impeach. Among likely voters, 39 percent want their
representative to vote to impeach to 56 percent against.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of all adults would want their Senators to vote
for conviction in a Senate trial to 63 percent against conviction.
Among likely voters, 36 favor Senate conviction to 57 percent
opposed.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five percent approve of the way Clinton is handling his
job as president.
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey of 1,013 adults taken Friday through
Sunday has an overall margin of error of 3 percentage points, but
four percentage points for answers only from likely voters.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More Attention to African Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday called
on the international community to give more attention to African
development as the world is moving towards globalization.
</P>
<P>
"We should not forget Africa," Shen Guofang, China's deputy
permanent representative to the United Nations, told a plenary
meeting of the 53rd General Assembly session, which on Tuesday
began to consider "the implementation of the United Nations New
Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s."
</P>
<P>
"The economic situation in Africa has shown some improvements
over the past several years, thanks to the untiring efforts of
the vast number of African countries," he said, "But the overall
economic picture on the continent still looks grim."
</P>
<P>
The gap between the level of development in Africa and that of
the world is still widening, he said, adding that even if the
current growth rate is maintained, it will still take more than 10
years before Africa's per capita GDP can recover its 1980 level.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is still ubiquitous" in Africa, he said, adding that
people living below poverty lines make up as much as more than
50 percent of the overall population in some African countries,
and indexes like the proportion of the population without access
to basic health and medical care, and the infant mortality rate,
are much higher in Africa than the world average.
</P>
<P>
"The debt burden remains heavy," he said. The overall volume
of external debt for African countries in 1996 amount to 320
billion U.S. dollars, equivalent to 70 percent of their GDP for
the same year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Their precious resources have to be used for debt services
instead of being invested in national development," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a severe shortage of development funds" in
Africa, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Official development assistance to Africa dropped from 14.2
billion U.S. dollars in 1992 to 12.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1996,
he said, adding that the already limited inflows of private
capital are also declining.
</P>
<P>
Primary commodity prices on international market continues to
fall, he said, adding that the prices for quite a number of
primary products dropped by over 10 percent in the past year,
bringing heavy losses to many African countries.
</P>
<P>
These "have shown that the major goals set in the New Agenda
are still far from being realized," Shen said, "The accelerated
economic globalization process has not brought a fair share of
benefits to African countries."
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, its negative impacts have proved costly to
them, he added.

<HEADLINE> Soros To Shut Down Hedge Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 27 (Xinhua) -- George Soros, one of the
world's most famous investors, plans to shut down his 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars emerging market hedge fund and make some changes at
his Quantum Group of mutual funds after poor investment returns in
the recent months of global financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Some of Soros' funds have showed declines of more than 15
percent so far this year and the Quantum Emerging Growth Fund
Soros is proposing to close has dropped in value by 31 percent for
the year through last Thursday, according to a spokesman for New
York-based Soros Fund Management.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to investors on Friday, Soros attributed the
decision to close the Quantum Emerging Growth Fund to "corporate
restructuring."

<HEADLINE> 100 Million Africans to Face Mental Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 27 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 100 million people
in 46 African countries will suffer some mental illness mainly
because of poverty.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed at a meeting opened here Tuesday on the
strategy for mental health for African people.
</P>
<P>
Custodia Mandlhate, regional advisor of the World Health
Organization (WHO), said at the meeting the problems associated
with mental health were serious in Africa because they were not
given the priority they deserved by governments.
</P>
<P>
The two-day consultative meeting, attended by about 20
delegates from 12 African countries, seeks to contribute to the
change of the negative perceptions of mental disorders, combat
stigma and create appropriate services to resolve mental
problems.
</P>
<P>
A draft document on mental health and abuse of drugs will be
finalized at the meeting before it is delivered to the WHO
regional committee next year.
</P>
<P>
The document cites alcohol, tobacco and drug abuse as some of
the major problems being experienced in Africa because of
poverty, civil strife and displacement of families.
</P>
<P>
Mandlhate said the negative attitude of the media on issues
that dealt with mental health was another setback which left the
problems unaddressed, particularly among the poor.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting are health professionals from
Guinea Bissau, Benin, Mali, Togo, Botswana, Rwanda, Mauritius,
Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Concrete Steps to Aid African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The call came as Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations, was addressing a plenary
meeting of the 53rd General Assembly session, which on Tuesday
began to consider "the implementation of the United Nations New
Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s."
</P>
<P>
"Economic globalization means that the interdependence between
the countries in the world has reached greater depths," he said,
"Sustained and healthy economic development in Africa is an
important condition for the continued stability and prosperity of
the world economy, and thus conforms to the long-term interests of
the international community as a whole."
</P>
<P>
The international community should dedicate itself to
establishing "a Partnership for Development for 21st Century" with
Africa, providing strong support to Africa and helping African
countries out of the vicious circle of economic under-development,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"African countries have emphasized on numerous occasions that
what Africa needs is neither preaching, nor new programs or plans
of action," he said, "What Africa needs is real action."
</P>
<P>
Concrete steps should be taken to help African countries
solve the key problems that are holding back their development
efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen put forward several proposals on international assistance
to African development:
</P>
<P>
-- To increase official development assistance to Africa and
loosens the conditions placed on such assistance, so that
African countries can use the resources more effectively in
accordance with the need and priorities of their own economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
-- To step up implementation of measures like the "Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries" initiative, and relieve, in real terms,
the debt burden of African countries.
</P>
<P>
-- To remove trade barriers targeted at the developing
countries, to ensure greater market access for African products.
</P>
<P>
-- To encourage more productive investments and technology
transfers, with a view to helping African countries improve
their economic structures and enhance their competitiveness in
the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations should continue to play a pivotal role in
promoting development in Africa and in the effective
implementation of the New Agenda," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Relevant institutions within the U.N. system should contribute
to the development of Africa by devoting sufficient resources,
and by formulating and implementing practical assistant programs
in the light of the specific characteristics of African
countries and their priorities for national economic
development, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Yugoslavia Complies With NATO Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Tuesday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was in
"substantial compliance" with terms of the deal he accepted to end
the crisis over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"From watching the news reports, you can see there's been very
positive news there overnight and this morning," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that thanks to NATO pressure and determination,
very substantial steps have been taken toward compliance," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had threatened
airstrikes unless Milosevic stops the fighting in Kosovo and pull
out all its forces out of the region. NATO sets the deadline at
19:00 GMT on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that "Well over 90 percent of the security force
reinforcements" have been withdrawn, major road blocks have been
dismantled and heavy weapons have been returned to garrison.
</P>
<P>
"As we see this substantial compliance," Lockhart said, "we
also need to make sure that coming into compliance isn't the only
issue. We need to send the message that he needs to stay in
compliance."
</P>
<P>
He said that if the compliance is sustained, refugees will feel
secure to return home.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke also said
Tuesday that Yugoslavia is withdrawing substantial troops from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Serb security forces are pulling out. The international
verification regime is pouring in and the Serbs have suffered a
tremendous setback," he said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke and Milosevic reached a deal on October 13 in
Belgrade after marathon talks. Milosevic agreed to comply fully
with the U.N. demands, to move troops out of Kosovo and start
negotiations with the ethnic Albanians.

<HEADLINE> CBI Says Business Confidence in UK Plunging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) said Tuesday that business confidence in Britain is
plunging at its fastest rate for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly industrial trends survey, CBI painted a
gloomy picture of the state of the UK's manufacturing industry,
with business confidence falling to its lowest level since 1980.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that Britain's output is falling at its
fastest rate for seven years.
</P>
<P>
Adair Turner, Director-General of the CBI, said: "Combined with
the weaker growth now evident in other sectors of the economy,
this survey suggests a sharp downturn for the UK in the short
term, with an increased risk of outright recession."
</P>
<P>
So, Turner called on the Bank of England to cut interest rates
by 0.5 percent at its next meeting "to ensure the downturn is not
unnecessarily prolonger".
</P>
<P>
Neil Parker of the Royal Bank of Scotland said that the survey
was worse than the markets were expecting.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Israeli allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed during a Lebanese guerrillas'
attack on Tuesday, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The militiaman was killed when several shells fired by
guerrillas hit the SLA's post on the Hmayyed hill in the western
sector of the Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack which raised to 28 the number of SLA
members killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from

<HEADLINE> Irish Government Urged to Budget More for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government came under
renewed pressure to aid the poor in its budget as the country's
most influential economic think-tank called on Tuesday for a boost
to welfare spending.
</P>
<P>
The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has joined
Ireland's largest union SIPTU and action group Combat Poverty in
calling for help for the country's poor.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent study of the United Nations, an estimated
one third of Irish people were living in relative poverty in 1995.
The ESRI said poverty would worsen if policies remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Whiel Ireland's economic boom has created busy industries in
the south, it has failed to bring significant wealth to the west.
</P>
<P>
"Recent budgets have favored high income earners... Social
welfare rates must rise in line with growth in other incomes if
the benefits of economic growth are to be spread more widely
across the community," ESRI said in its pre-budget submission.
</P>
<P>
Social welfare rates had risen by around 16 percent in the last
four years, lagging a 20 percent increase in average household
incomes as the Celtic Tiger's economy accelerated, Reuters quoted
ESRI as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ireland is the fastest growing economy in the European Union
but its wealth is spread unevenly and unemployment remaims high.
There is rising concern that large parts of the population are
failing to benefit, and are even suffering, from the boom.
</P>
<P>
The budget submission from ESRI adds to a growing consensus
among business, research and social groups in Ireland that the
country should tackle poverty and infrastrutual problems while its
finances are in an unusually buoyant state.
</P>
<P>
The government is forecasting a budget surplus of around 800
million punts (1.15 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of this year
but has warned against complacency in public spending, a point
echoed by ESRI which said the surplus should be maintained for
1999. The budget is expected to be announced on December 2.

<HEADLINE> IPE Welcomes Government's Consultation Paper On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Petroleum
Exchange (IPE) Tuesday welcomed the government's consultation
paper on the UK Climate Change program released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The document clearly outlines the UK's international
responsibilities in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and
confirms the government's commitment to playing an active role in
addressing the problems of climate change.
</P>
<P>
The paper states that there may be benefits in establishing a
domestic emissions trading scheme prior to the start up of an
international market.
</P>
<P>
The advantages listed include the more efficient and cost
effective achievement of emissions reductions in the UK and the
establishment of the City of London as a center for trading.
</P>
<P>
The IPE, Europe's leading energy futures and options exchange,
agrees that the UK should take the lead in setting up a market in
emissions.
</P>
<P>
Lynto Jones, chief executive of the IPE said: "the UK has a
great opportunity to set the agenda for the development of a
successful market in greenhouse gas emissions."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the government's commitment to achieving major
reductions in emissions, and look forward to working closely with
them and with the business community to put these aims into
practice," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Three Cypriot people are given
a new chance to live with the donation of organs after the tragic
death of a little girl, who was fatally injured in a riding
accident.
</P>
<P>
The three-year-old Vergina Nicolaides was critically injured on
Saturday when the pony she was riding on, during U.N. Open Day
celebrations at the U.N.-controlled Ledra Palace, bolted,
throwing her to the ground and trampled on her.
</P>
<P>
She was immediately taken to hospital in critical condition
and put on life support. But the girl was pronounced Monday night
brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
After her parents decided to donate their child's organs,
Vergina was taken to the Nicosia Paraskevaidion Transplant center
where her kidneys and liver were removed.
</P>
<P>
Doctor George Kyriakides, director of the center, said Tuesday
that the liver was already sent to London's Kings College
Hospital to be transplanted possibly to a Cypriot patient.
</P>
<P>
The kidneys are being transplanted to a seven-year-old boy,
Nicos Socratous and 49-year-old Christakis Efstathiou, both from
southern coastal town of Limassol.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides on Tuesday praised
the child's parents for their courageous act to donate their

<HEADLINE> Britain Warns Citizens against Travelling to Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Tuesday advised its
citizens not to travel to Chile unless absolutely necessary,
because anti-British feelings were running high after the arrest
of former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet in London.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted a Foreign Office spokesman as saying that
British citizens and commercial targets could become "targets for
mob violence", although no such attacks had taken place so far.
</P>
<P>
"We are advising against all non-essential travel to Chile
following the detention of General Pinochet. Feeling against
Britain and British nationals is running high in Chile," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is volatile and could change without warning
with British nationals and British commercial targets becoming
targets for mob violence," he said, adding Britons in Chile should
keep a low profile and avoid demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been isolated reports of abuse and physical
assault on people mistakenly identified as Britons, although no
British citizens or targets had been attacked.
</P>
<P>
Britain's High Court is due to decide on Wednesday whether a
Spanish request for Pinochet's extradition on murder and human
rights charges is lawful. The 82-year-old Pinochet has been under
guard in a London hospital since October 16.

<HEADLINE> World Spends $1.5 Billion Yearly on Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A medical epidemiologist
from the World Health Organization (WHO) said here Tuesday if
polio were eradicated altogether from the world, an annual 1.5
billion U.S. Dollars would have gone into endeavors for social
development.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, O. Babaniyi, the
epidemiologist, made the remarks at a conference on polio
immunization campaign in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He said although some countries in Latin America, North
America and Asia have succeeded in wiping out the disease, they
are forced to continue to spend large amount of money on the
production of polio vaccine because the ailment still surfaces
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The United States alone spends an annual 17 million Dollars on
the production of drugs and vaccination programs, said Babaniyi.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has announced to eradicate polio by
2000. And the Ministry of Health plans to inoculate about 10
million children under five years of age in the last two months
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some 7.3 million children received vaccinations in Ethiopia
last year.

<HEADLINE> PNA Urges Palestinians to Boycott Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Tuesday urged Palestinians to boycott the
elections for Jerusalem mayor, which will be hold by the Israeli
authorities next month.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel Radio, Faisal Husseini, PNA
leading official in Jerusalem, told a news conference here that
the Palestinians' participation in the elections would signal
their acceptance of Israeli rule over the whole city.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinian residents of the city should
stay at home during the elections, stressing that "We hope
they will not participate."
</P>
<P>
About 420,000 Jews and 180,000 Palestinians are living in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace agreement between Israel and PNA, the
Jerusalem issue will be determined in the final status talks
which have yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
Israel is insisting that it will never give up sovereignty
over the whole city, while the Palestinians want the east
Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East War, to be the capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
The municipal elections of Jerusalem is due to begin on
November 10th and some 124,000 Palestinian residents of the city
are eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a hardliner in the ruling
Likud Party, is expected to be re-elected.

<HEADLINE> Demaci Says KLA to Show Restraint as Serb Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) will show self-restraint as long as the Serb
side does not provoke the KLA, KLA's political representative Adem
Demaci said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a regular press conference in Pristina, Demaci said Serb
troops did withdraw from Kosovo as demanded by the U.N.
resolution, but he was not sure whether the forces would return to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the KLA will take over the villages and towns
after the Serb forces leave, Demaci said "the Albanian civilians
are KLA and the KLA are civilians."
</P>
<P>
"The KLA can't go to the sky. They are returning to their own
homes and houses as the Albanian civilians. This is not
take-over."
</P>
<P>
But he said the General Staff of the KLA has assured him "the
KLA will continue to show self-restraint as long as the Serb side
does not provoke the KLA and as long as it respects the agreements
between the KLA and the international verifiers on their positions
and emplacements."
</P>
<P>
The KLA, an outlaw military organization of the radical ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, declared a unilateral ceasefire on October
12, one day before an agreement was struck by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Demaci stressed that no agreement on Kosovo would be accepted
by the KLA unless there was a clear provision in it, specifying
the date when the ethnic Albanians will exercise their right to
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian side demanded that Kosovo remain in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia with higher autonomy for just three years
and a referendum be held on the future of the Serbian province.
Most of the ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of
Kosovo's 2 million population, want to have independence.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Stage Largest Maneuver on Eastern Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Tuesday its
army would start the largest military maneuver since the end of
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, on the eastern border on October 31.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the army's ground force Brigadier General
Abdulali Pourshasb said the three armed services would take part
in the war games, codenamed "Zulfaqar 2," the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The maneuver had been scheduled for September amid tensions
between Iran and Afghanistan triggered by the killing of nine
Iranian diplomats and reporter by the Afghan Taliban militia in
northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The army had earlier announced that 200,000 troops, which have
been deployed along the country eastern border with Afghanistan,
would be involved in the war games to show their combat
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
However, the maneuver was postponed after the United Nations
dispatched special envoy on Afghan affairs Lakhdar Brahimi to the
region to defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi succeeded in persuading the Taliban, which now control
most of Afghanistan, to repatriate the remains of the killed
Iranians and release 51 Iranians captured in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During the past month, the Iranian troops deployed in the
border areas carried out a series of military exercises in order
to be prepared for the main phase of the maneuver.
</P>
<P>
Pourshasb said that the army units stationed on eastern border
are on full alert, and the successful conduct of the war games is
indicative of the army's readiness to defend the entirety of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Calls for Calm After Killings in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu urged the Israelis Tuesday to keep "cool
heads", saying it is also a criminal act to murder people for
revenge, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were made one day after a Jewish settler and a
Palestinian man were killed in two murders in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The body of the 68-year-old Palestinian, Mohammed Zalmout, was
found outside a Jewish settlement near Nablus Monday afternoon,
several hours after Danny Vargas, a 29-year-old Jewish settler in
Hebron was shot dead.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous phone call to the Israeli army said the death of
Zalmout was a revenge killing.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security forces announced Tuesday afternoon that
they have arrested two Palestinians suspected of killing Vargas. A
spokesman for the Palestinian General Intelligence Service in Gaza
said the two men were arrested in the morning in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the two had confessed to the murder and also
the killing of another Israeli man in a communal farm outside
Jerusalem two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have described "very good" the
cooperation provided by Palestinian police since the shooting in
Hebron. They said they will also try to arrest an Israeli man
suspected of killing Zalmout as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Jewish settlers in the settlement where Zalmout's
body was found have given the Israeli army the name of the
suspected Israeli youth, who they said was not a resident in their
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, adviser to Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat, told Israel Radio that the two Palestinians
arrested by police have denied connection to any organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has expressed fear of a rapid escalation of
violence in the West Bank after the two killings. They said the
atmosphere in the areas was "extremely tense."
</P>
<P>
In the village where Zalmout had lived, Palestinian youth threw
stones at Israeli soldiers and the soldiers fired tear gas and
rubber bullets Tuesday. Several Palestinians were injured in the
clashes.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, Israeli troops enforced a curfew in the
Israeli-controlled part of the town Tuesday, barring about 30,000
Palestinians from leaving their homes. Palestinians were even not
allowed to go to work or school.
</P>
<P>
The curfew, imposed Monday night after the slaying of Vargas,
was the third time since August that the Palestinians in the
Israeli-run sector are not allowed to go out.
</P>
<P>
The terror attacks have put the land-for-peace deal signed
by Netanyahu and Arafat at the White House last week to its
first test. They have also provoked concerns that extremist
actions might derail the peace process again.

<HEADLINE> UK to Launch Bid to Promote 'Buy British' Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- British Government officials are
to meet retailers as part of an attempt to promote the sale of
home-grown food in British shops, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries representatives
will discuss sourcing and pricing practices, with the aim to help
relieve the pressure on British farmers whose livelihood have been
hit by the "beef on the bone ban" and the downturn in global
economic markets.
</P>
<P>
Food Safety Minister Jeff Rooker said an announcement would be
made as quickly as possible on an aid package for farmers, according
to BBC.
</P>
<P>
Rooker said they were going through "an extremely difficult
period", with prospects not looking good for the immediate future.
The biggest market for British lambskins had been Russia, which had
now disappeared.
</P>
<P>
"However, we cannot order people to buy British," he said, in
response to calls for British food to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
The government have encouraged farmers to work together as
producers and not be isolated and picked off by those who control
the food markets.
</P>
<P>
But Conservative Agriculture Spokesman Tim Yeo said the
government was making matters worse for farmers, calling for the
lifting the ban on beef on the bone.
</P>
<P>
If the government did not lift it, there was a risk the European
Union would make it permanent, he said.

there would be a repetition of the incitement waged against former
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by a right-wing
extremist in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Knesset (parliament) Speaker Dan Tichon opened the afternoon
plenum by a call for halting "all incitements."
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, Meretz leader Yossi Sarid and
Yitzhak Levy, leader of the right-wing National Religious Party
which vehemently opposed the interim agreement, respectively
condemned the right-wing incitement campaign.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers and other right wingers have staged several
days of demonstrations in the West Bank and outside the prime
minister's residence in Jerusalem, protesting the
Israeli-Palestine agreement signed in Washington last Friday.
</P>
<P>
They accused Netanyahu of "betraying" his promises that he
would not give up any land to the Palestinians. Some called him "a
traitor," an accusation waged by right-wing extremists against
Rabin before he was murdered.
</P>
<P>
Security measures have been strengthened to protect Netanyahu,
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai since they returned from the U.S. talks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the state attorney's office and police
met Tuesday to discuss the danger posed by political-motived
violence.
</P>
<P>
While continuing his effort to win approval for the agreement
by meeting with cabinet ministers, Netanyahu said Tuesday he
believes the opposition's move to hold early elections will not
succeed.
</P>
<P>
His remarks was boosted by a decision announced by six Arab
legislators of the opposition camp Tuesday afternoon that they
will not vote for the two bills calling for the dissolution of the
Knesset and holding early elections.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset Law Committee decided Monday to present the bills
to the plenum within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The bills passed in the preliminary reading in late July and
need to pass three more readings before becoming law. But their
chances for winning approval have become slimmer since the Arab
legislators announced their decision.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Spend 3M Drs on Food Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government will
spend 3.6 billion shillings (3 million U.S. Dollars) equipping
Uganda Industrial Research Institute and other food pilot plants
with processing facilities and a central packaging unit.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Nyanzi, state minister for industry and technology,
made the announcement while opening a regional training course on
development and promotion of value added meat products project in
the institute Tuesday, Radio Uganda reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
After touring the institute, the minister said the project is
aimed at development and promotion of low-cost value added meat
products, thus improving the dietary conditions of the
population.
</P>
<P>
The participation of foreign experts from Nigeria, Tanzania,
Zimbabwe and Namibia will further enhance the regional
cooperation policy of Uganda, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mafa Chipeta, resident representative of Food
and Agriculture Organization commended the idea of cooperation as
a major route to develop this region, adding that the issue of
nutrition is critical in Africa because some countries are
failing to feed their people.
</P>
<P>
This kind of projects will be of great use to these countries,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Denies PM's Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Labor Party Tuesday
dismissed as "a terrible lie" Prime Minister's charges that the
previous Labor government was prepared to give the Palestinians
most of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Labor Knesset (Parliament) member Haim Ramon said that former
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was ready to hand over only 50
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians after the completion
of the Israeli redeployments, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Ramon, who had worked closely with Rabin, said the Palestinians
had asked for 75 percent in the peace talks, but Rabin said "no
way."
</P>
<P>
Labor Knesset member Yossi Beilin has also warned that the
party might "reconsider" the decision to provide Netanyahu a
"safety net" in the Knesset when the agreement is presented.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference upon his return from the U.S., Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Palestinians told him in the
talks that the previous Labor government had promised to transfer
92 percent of the West Bank to them after the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
He also said he had succeeded in lowering the expectation of
the Palestinians by agreeing to withdraw from only another 13
percent of the West Bank at the second stage of troop
redeployments.
</P>
<P>
After the second withdrawal, the Palestinians will fully or
partially control 40 percent of the West Bank. Netanyahu has said
that the scope of the third or the last stage, will be small.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chip Industrials Spearhead Kenya Stocks Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan stocks fell 1.22
percent Tuesday as a result of the declines in blue chip
industrials, the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) sources said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Breweries (KBRW.NR) dropped to 46.50 Shillings from 49
on Monday but closed a little higher at 47.75 on 503 shares.
Kenya Power &AMP; Lighting Co. (KPLA.NR) lost three Shillings to 192
on 2,600 shares, according to the NSE data.
</P>
<P>
The NSE 20-share index (NSEK) lost 33.97 points to close at
2742.85 points.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the day was posted at 9.9 million Shillings from
264,000 shares on 261 deals compared to 9.7 million Shillings
from 216,000 shares on 226 deals Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya put the Shilling at a mean
commercial rate of 59.7889 against one U.S. Dollar, unchanged
from Monday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said investors had put a wary eye on Kenya Breweries
ahead of annual financial results that analysts say will show a
decline in profits due to measures by the beer company to
rationalize its staff costs.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Breweries has also radically increased its advertizing
costs to better compete with South African Breweries, whose entry
into the eastern Africa market with its Castle brands has been
well received, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over-all profits of the Kenya Power &AMP; Lighting Co,
are in decline because of revenue collection problems. The firm
is owed millions of Shillings by government departments and
agencies despite a rise in the turnover.

<HEADLINE> UK Says Lockerbie Bombers Must Be Jailed in Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Tuesday that Britain would insist that two suspects in
the Lockerbie bombing must serve their sentences in Scotland if
they were found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in British parliament Tuesday, Cook said: "We have
been able to respond positively to all the issues raised by the
Libyan legal team, with the exception of their demand that if
convicted the two accused should not serve their sentence in a
Scottish prison."
</P>
<P>
"If they are found guilty we see no reason why the two accused
should not serve sentence under the jurisdiction of Scotland,
where the mass murder took place," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that Libya had not previously raised any concerns
about where the two men would serve their terms if found guilty
and "that concern only surfaced after we had met their demand for
a trial under Scottish law in a third country."
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States announced in early August that
the trial of the two Libyan suspects could be held in the
Netherlands and the U.N. sanctions against Libya could be lifted
if Libya hands over the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
In December 1988, a Pan Am flight 103 blew up in mid-air over
the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1998, killing 270
people, most of them Americans.

<HEADLINE> Greeks Urged to Carry Forward Patriotism to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Tuesday urged Greeks to carry forward the spirit of
patriotism to meet the new challenges Greece will face in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
In a message issued on the eve of "Ohi (No) Day" on Wednesday
when Athens refused an Italian ultimatum to surrender and was
dragged into World War II, Simitis said that Greeks were required
to show the same decisiveness as the generation of the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The message of decisiveness of the generation of the 1940s
would inspire and teach all Greeks, who wanted to feel proud of
their country at the threshold of the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that in the world today, whatever makes
Greece strong was patriotic.
</P>
<P>
He added that Greece must be strong so as to participate
equally in all the levels and procedures of the new European
entity, to be active and have a dynamic presence in the Balkans,
to deal with organized crime, drug trafficking, racism and
xenophobia, to proclaim from all international podiums the need
for respect and maintenance of international law and to avert any
threat thanks to the worthiness of the Greek armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos also said in a message
that "Ohi Day" served to remind Greeks that with unity, they could
achieve miracles.
</P>
<P>
National consensus was particularly imperative today, in light
of the challenges Greece was called on to meet as a member of the
European Union (EU) and in the light of the uncertainty and
instability noted in the Balkan region, the president said.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Erupts in War-Torn E. Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A volcano near the strategic
town of Goma in eastern Congo (K) has gushed lava from its cone
and through a fissure in its side since October 17, causing great
concern for rebels.
</P>
<P>
A media report reaching here Tuesday said that lava flowing
from the Nyamuragira volcano is lighting up the night skies of
Goma, the eastern headquarters of rebels who launched a war
against President Laurent Kabila since early August.
</P>
<P>
"It is very active, but for the moment the lava flows are
diminishing," a senior official at the National Scientific
Research Center (CNRS) in Goma was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time lava has flowed from Nyamuragira since
December 1996, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Residents said light from the 3,056-meter high volcano had
reduced in recent days, but on Monday night a red glow was
visible north of the town.
</P>
<P>
The Nyamuragira is one of the two active volcanos in the
region. The other active volcano is Nyiragongo, which sits 3,470
meters high on the northern outskirts of Goma.
</P>
<P>
The chain of volcanic mountains which borders neighboring
Rwanda and Uganda also serves as a rear base of Rwandan Hutu
militiamen allegedly involved in the Rwandan genocide in 1994
when over 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Assemble Volvo Car for Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Motor Company of
Botswana (MCB) Tuesday signed an agreement with a Swedish
Corporation in Gaborone to export its assembled Volvo car, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing of the agreement, MCB Director (MCB)
Billy Rautenbach said his car plant would assemble 3,600 Volvo
S40 and V40 cars a year. The MCB entered into the pact with
Swedish Volvo Car Corporation in Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
No precise date was given for the start of assembly, but the
first Volvo car would roll off the line in early 1999, Rautenbach
said.
</P>
<P>
The deal is believed to be a significant boost for Botswana's
non-mineral export and diversification of the economy away from
its almost total reliance on diamonds, which is the backbone of
the country's current development policy.
</P>
<P>
For now, the MCB also assembles Hyundai cars of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Since the first exports of motor vehicles in 1993, the
Botswana car industry has grown to represent 60 percent of
Botwana's non-diamond export. In 1997, vehicles to the value of
1.058 billion Pula (about 263 million U.S. Dollars) were
exported.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of present vehicles exports are to South
Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Telecoms Limited (UTL)
is still strong and has an edge over its competitors, the
company's top official said here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Robert Kabonero, the chairperson of the board of directors of
UTL, made the remarks while briefing the parliamentary sectoral
committee on the privatization of UTL, Radio Uganda reported
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Charles Katabuliro, the committee chairperson, demanded to
know if UTL will collapse following the fierce competition from
mobile phone operators.
</P>
<P>
Kabonero said that his company is strong because the total
number of its clients grows at a rate of 15 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, the company is purchasing new and
advanced equipment to improve on its performance. In order to
cope with the rapidly changing technology, UTL needs a strategic
investor, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The Celtel company, a British mobile company, came to Uganda
in 1993 and is the first national mobile operator in the country.
Last week, Mobile Telephone Network, a strong competitor from
South Africa, began operations here, bringing big challenges to
both the Celtel and UTL.
</P>
<P>
To confront the competition from the newcomer, the Celtel
decided to cut its monthly charges by more than a half, ushering
in a wave of price war.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Postpones Cabinet Voting on Latest Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu decided Tuesday to postpone indefinitely a
cabinet voting on the latest deal he signed with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat last week, local television reported.
</P>
<P>
Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for the prime minister, said that
the cabinet voting would not be held before the Palestinian
National Authority presents its plans to fight terrorism. The
voting was originally scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest land-for-peace deal inked in the White House should
be endorsed by the cabinet before going to the Knesset
(parliament) for approval. It also needs the blessing of the
Palestinian Council on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the decision apparently in response to the
killing of a 29-year-old Jewish settler by Palestinian militants
Monday afternoon in the divided West Bank city of Hebron. The
settler was shot three times when driving home.
</P>
<P>
Several hours after the shooting, the body of a 68-year-old
Palestinian man was found outside a Jewish settlement near the
West Bank town of Nablus. An anonymous phone call called the death
of the Palestinian man a revenge killing.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called on Israelis earlier Tuesday to keep "cool
heads," saying it was also a criminal act to murder people for
revenge.
</P>
<P>
The latest land-for-peace accord inked in the White House calls
on Israel to withdraw from 13 percent more of the West Bank in
exchange for specific Palestinian measures to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that only after the Palestinians fulfill
their security commitments would Israel carry out the phased
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have described "very good" the
cooperation provided by Palestinian police since the shooting in
Hebron. Palestinian security forces announced Tuesday afternoon
that they have arrested two Palestinian suspects.
</P>
<P>
The terror attacks in the West Bank have put the new peace deal
to its first test and prompted concerns that extremist actions
might derail the peace process again.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Homicide Rate Down to Lowest Since 1969 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The homicide rate in Canada
declined 9 percent in 1997 to its lowest level point since 1969,
Statistics Canada said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The homicide rate has generally been decreasing since the
mid-1970s, following rapid growth during the late 1960s and early
1970s. There were 581 homicides in 1997, 54 fewer than in 1996,"
the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's 1997 homicide rate of 1.92 per 100,000 population was
less than one-third that of the United States, but higher than
most European countries.
</P>
<P>
The statistics shows that the number of spousal homicides has
gradually declined from more than 100 each year in the early 1990s
to 75 last year.
</P>
<P>
And homicides continue to be committed primarily by someone
known to the victim. In 1997, only 13 percent of all victims were
killed by a stranger.
</P>
<P>
The surveys also show that the elderly have the highest levels
of fear of being a crime victim. However, in terms of homicides,
individuals aged 60 and older are actually at low risk.
</P>
<P>
In fact, people aged 18 to 29 had the highest homicide rate,
which was 3.39 for every 100,000 people. The lowest rate was for
children and young people aged 18 and under, the agency said.

KUWAIT CITY, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn

Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat on the latest Palestinian-Israeli
peace agreement, Saudi Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed the king on the details of the accord he signed
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington last
Friday, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador to Riyadh Mustafa Deeb said that Arafat
updated the Saudi leader on the tactics used by Israelis to delay
the agreement and the efforts made by the United States President
Bill Clinton to help strike the deal.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that the Palestinian people will continue their
struggle until the declaration of a Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd assured Arafat that Saudi Arabia will be firmly
behind the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
The king expressed the hope that the deal between Israel and
the Palestinians would contribute to the moving forward of the
Syrian-Israeli and the Lebanese-Israeli peace process, Deeb said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Saudi Crown Prince and First Deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, who was just back from a
seven-nation global tour, and Defense and Aviation Minister Prince

NEW YORK, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China's flag carrier Air China
(CA) and U.S. Northwest Airlines (NW) began reciprocal code-share
service on Tuesday to increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
CA will publish its code on NW's four-times-weekly flight New
York-Detroit-Beijing service, it was announced at a joint press
conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CA will also code-share on U.S. domestic routes serving 17

</P>
<P>
All of the above-mentioned flights operate four times weekly.
</P>
<P>
"This alliance offers NW the unique ability to offer convenient
flights via one-stop and two-stop itineraries between North
America and China," said Michael Levine, NW Executive Vice
President.

aircraft flying primarily in the Asia/Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The two carriers signed a code-share agreement on May 12, the
fist of kind between China and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
With the new partnership, CA, NW and its U.S. partners cover
close to 100 percent of all cities in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and
South America, and provide the greatest non-stop and one-stop
service between China and the U.S..

<P>
LUSAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- African ministers Tuesday
adopted a draft cease-fire agreement here on the Congo (K) war
and a mechanism for implementing and monitoring the accord.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in a press statement read at the closure of
the two-day closed-door meeting by Kaire Mbuende, Executive
Secretary of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Uganda acknowledged their
military presence in the former Zaire, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe have sent thousands of their
troops to the largest central African country to assist Congolese
President Laurent Kabila in fighting against the rebels who now
hold large tracts of land in the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
While Uganda and Rwanda have been accused by Kinshasa of
invading to back the rebels to topple President Kabila, Rwanda
again denied direct involvement at the meeting, according to
informed sources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was described as "very important" and
"successful" by Mbuende, also established a mechanism for the
involvement of the rebels in working out the modalities for the
implementation of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the past months that the rebels have
been offered an opportunity to participate in the peace efforts
over the Congolese crisis.
</P>
<P>
Bizima Karaha, former foreign minister and now one of the
rebel leaders, told reporters outside the meeting venue Tuesday
afternoon that "the Congolese problem can only be resolved by the
Congolese people themselves."
</P>
<P>
He added that if the rebels were denied the opportunity of
getting involved in working out a mechanism to end the Congo (K)
crisis, all the efforts made in this field would be meaningless.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also resolved, through a mechanism involving
military experts to be established in the future, to address
those security concerns of Congo (K) and its neighbors, such as
Angola, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda which explained in detail
their security concerns during consultations.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest gathering ever held to end the Congo (K)
war starting in early August. The meeting held in Zambian capital
Lusaka was chaired by Zambian Presidential Affairs Minister Eric
Silwamba and attended by defense and foreign ministers from 14
African countries including all the key players in the war such
as Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola, Congo (K), Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also attracted Ibrahima Fall, U.N. Assistant
General for Political Affairs, Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity and the
senior officials from the SADC.
</P>
<P>
It focused on issues relating to the cessation of hostilities
in Congo (K), the establishment of a cease-fire and the
mechanisms for implementing it and the withdrawal of foreign
forces etc.

<HEADLINE> Govt Blamed for Detaining Suspects Too Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of
Parliamentary Affairs Martin Aliker has said the government
accepts responsibility for detaining suspects for over 48 hours
without taking them to court.
</P>
<P>
He said this in response to a query by an MP as to why some of
his constituents were arrested and detained without appearing in
court, according to a Radio Uganda report Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The minister told Parliament Tuesday that this was an
oversight that will not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
When asked if detaining people in safe houses is provided for
in the Constitution, he explained that suspects are sometimes
kept in safe houses within police stations to protect them from
being molested by other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
According to Uganda's Constitution adopted in 1995, a suspect
must be led before judge within two days after his arrest. If no
official charges can be established against him, he should be
freed.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Hails Peru-Ecuador Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Tuesday
spoke highly of the peace accord signed by President Jamil Mahuad
of Ecuador and his Peruvian counterpart Alberto Fujimori in
Brasilia Monday.
</P>
<P>
The South African Department of Foreign Affairs said in a
statement that the accord would bring an end to over a century of
differences between the two countries over their common border.
</P>
<P>
"It also comes as a result of the willingness of these states
to earnestly pursue peace, as well as the tireless efforts of the
four states guaranteeing the accord, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and
the United States."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that South Africa commended the vision
displayed by Peru and Ecuador and welcomed the prospects inherent
in the accord of boosting bilateral trade between the two states
and attracting foreign investment to the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Southern Africa was moving closer to the Andean region of
Latin America, particularly in terms of economic cooperation, as
witnessed in the recent opening of South African embassies in
Lima and Caracas, the department said.

<HEADLINE> Detainees on Rwandan Genocide on Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- As many as 25 detainees held
by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) have
been on a hunger strike since Monday, the ICTR confirmed in a
statement reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR Registrar said he received a letter Tuesday signed by
25 hunger strikers out of the 32 detainees charging that the
Registrar denies their human rights in the assignment of defense
counsel to them.
</P>
<P>
All the strikers are on trial or awaiting trial for genocide
and other serious violations to international law committed in
Rwanda in 1994 when over 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were
killed, said the statement from the ICTR headquarters in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The first hunger striker, genocide convict Jean Paul Akayesu,
has not eaten since Thursday but his health was "quite
satisfactory," said tribunal spokesman Kingsley Moghalu.
</P>
<P>
Akayesu, sentenced last month to life imprisonment, is seeking
for a new defense counsel to lead his appeal. He was convicted of
genocide and anti-humanity crimes committed in the central
Rwandan commune of Taba, where around 2,000 ethnic Tutsis were
slaughtered in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Moghalu said the tribunal would not be brow-beaten by the
strike.
</P>
<P>
"We only hope that good sense will prevail. We will not be
intimidated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the tribunal has assigned 41 lawyers from all over
the world as defense counsel and co-counsel to the 32 detainees
in the Tribunal's custody in Arusha. Nearly all of these lawyers
have been chosen by the detainees themselves out of a list of
lawyers maintained by the Registry.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal's projected expenditure for the payment of
defense lawyers in 1999 is over five million U.S. Dollars,
according to its statement.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal was established by the United Nations in November
1994 to bring to justice the main architects of the Rwandan
genocide. The only other convicted, Rwanda's former Prime
Minister Jean Kambanda, was also sentenced to life imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Mandela, Nujoma to Meet over Congo (K) Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela and his Namibian counterpart Sam Nujoma are due to
meet in Windhoek Wednesday, focusing on the crisis in Democratic
Congo (DRC), South African Press Association reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was expected to appeal to Nujoma to rescind decisions
to deploy Namibian troops in the strife-torn Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Unidentified South African officials were quoted as saying
that Mandela was not pleased with the recent decision by the
heads of state of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe to take the war to
the areas controlled by Tutsi-led rebels in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
They said Mandela wanted the Congo crisis to be resolved by
negotiations rather than force.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Nujoma, Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos and
Preside Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe announced in Harare that they
had decided to fight rebels in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
Mandela reportedly was to meet the leader of the Congolese
rebel group, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba in Pretoria, capital of South
Africa, later this week.
</P>
<P>
According to Namibian officials, the Nujoma government was
also expected to discuss ways of strengthening trade and economic
ties with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, bordering with South Africa, has been dependent on
South Africa in terms of exports, earnings and imports.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Nujoma was also expected to raise the issue
of the South African-European Union Free Trade Area Agreement at
Wednesday's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Saudi Crown Prince 7-Nation Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz returned home late Tuesday from a seven-nation tour
which is widely thought to be a diplomatic success, especially in
promoting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, also Deputy Prime Minister and Commander of the Saudi
National Guard, began his seven-nation tour on September 13, with
Britain as his first leg, which was followed by France and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
After a two-week private vacation in Hawaii, the U.S.,
Abdullah flied on October 14 to China, the first stop of his
four-nation Asian tour which includes Japan, South Korea and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During his 44-day visit, he discussed with leaders of these
states a broad range of bilateral, regional and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
While progress has reportedly been made in seeking common
grounds on policies toward those issues such as the deadlocked
Mideast peace process, the latest U.N.-Iraqi standoff, the
Afghan-Iranian crisis and terrorism, political observers here,
however, tend to credit the Saudi leader for his achievements in
developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and French President Jacques Chirac have agreed to
strengthen their "strategic partnership," a proposal first
outlined in July 1996 when Chirac visited Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued at the end of his three-day visit,
both sides reaffirmed their countries' resolve to realize the
"partnership by boosting cooperation, especially in political,
economic and security fields."
</P>
<P>
They announced that a "detailed timetable" will be set for
talks on the strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
As he was the highest-ranking Saudi official to visit China
since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1990,
the week-long visit was attached special importance by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Both countries described the visit as "historic."
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum of understanding signed during the visit,
the two countries agreed to rapidly increase their trade and
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, the Saudi Arabia promised to take in
more Chinese workers and technicians, especially in construction
industry and medical services.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, a major trade partner of Saudi Arabia in Asia,
Abdullah signed with Japanese Prime Minister Keizu Obuchi a
"landmark joint declaration to expand bilateral relations in the
21st century."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders underscored during their talks the healthy
bilateral ties and expressed desire to boost them by promoting
political dialogue and establishing extensive economic links.
</P>
<P>
In his last leg in Pakistan, Abdullah and Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif agreed to give new impetus to bilateral relations by
enhancing cooperation in various fields, including trade,
investment and joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
In addition to achievements in boosting bilateral ties, broad
consensus was also reached on regional and international matters
of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also reach consensus with the leaders of the host
countries that the Iraqi government should resume cooperation
with the U.N. weapons inspectors and fully comply with the
Security Council resolutions related to its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, at the same time, expressed sympathy with the Iraqi
people suffering from the U.N. economic sanctions imposed after
its invasion.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, together with the leaders of the host states,
denounced all kinds of terrorism and stressed that the issue be
tackled under leadership of the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also reportedly gained support from some his Asian
hosts on efforts to limit and finally remove weapons of mass
destruction in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
While immediate effect is hard to predict, foreign diplomats
here believe that the visit by Abdullah, both Gulf and Arab
heavyweight, is in general very positive to security and
stability in the region.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Expected to Strengthen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Shilling changed
little against the U.S. Dollar Tuesday but expected to strengthen
slightly on inflows from the tea and coffee sectors, traders
said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) posted the Shilling at a mean
commercial rate of 59.7889, unchanged from Monday.
</P>
<P>
But traders expected that Dollars will flow into the foreign
exchange market from the tea and coffee export auctions Mondays
and Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
Signs of the Shilling strength also came from the central
bank, which said it was buying Dollar notes at 57.96 Shillings
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank posted the Pound at a mean commercial rate of
99.6898 compared to 100.5458 on Monday. CBK said it was buying
pound notes at 96.63 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior dealer said that there is still limited
activity in the market.
</P>
<P>
"We have not drastically moved from the position on Monday.
Sentiment is still for a stronger shilling," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Commercial dealers said margins had declined to between five
and 10 cents.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Postpones Cabinet Voting on Latest Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu decided Tuesday to postpone indefinitely a
cabinet voting on the latest deal he signed with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat last week, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly decided that the vote would not be held
until the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) submits to the
United States its plans to fight terrorism. The vote had been
originally scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest land-for-peace deal inked in the White House should
be endorsed by the cabinet before going to the Knesset
(parliament) for approval. It also needs the blessing of the
Palestinian Council on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that according to the understanding reached
between Israel and the Palestinians, the PNA should present a
concrete plan for fighting terrorism to Washington within a week
after the signing of the accord.
</P>
<P>
The deal was signed last Friday at the White House. It calls on
Israel to hand over a further 13 percent of the West Bank in
exchange for intensified and specific Palestinian measures to
fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Netanyahu also met with members of his "inner
cabinet" - Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky
- to discuss a statement made by senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat on the Palestinian National Charter, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and his ministers expressed concern over Erekat's
statement that the Palestinian National Council (PNC) would not
revise the charter calling for the destruction of Israel, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest land-for-peace deal, the PNC would
convene to revoke the anti-Israel provisions in the charter. But
the radio did not say when Erekat made the statement or what he
exactly said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's decision also came a day after a Jewish settler
was killed by suspected Palestinian militants Monday afternoon in
the divided West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian man was murdered several hours later outside a
Jewish settlement near Nablus in what was called a "revenge
killing."
</P>
<P>
The terror attacks have put the new peace deal to its first
test and prompted concerns that extremist actions might derail the
peace process again.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges Support for Baku-Ceyhan Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. will continue to
support the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline project aimed at transporting the
Caspian oil to the European markets.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Mark Parris made the remarks Tuesday
at a seminar held in Istanbul on U.S. investment in the Caspian
region, the Anatolia News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. administration will back the building of the
pipeline that links Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, to Ceyhan,
Turkey's Mediterranean port.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study for the pipeline that can carry 50
million tonnes (7.1 million barrels) of oil a year has been
completed in August and it is planned to be put into operation in
2003.
</P>
<P>
"The east-west energy corridor should be the Baku-Ceyhan
pipeline," Parris said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as "premature, untimely and misleading" press
reports that U.S. oil companies involved in the region have found
the pipeline unfeasible.
</P>
<P>
All scenarios need to be taken into consideration, Parris
said, but he warned that shipment of the region's oil through the
Bosphrous Straits will strain the Turkish waterway.
</P>
<P>
"The capacity of the Bosphrous (to handle oil shipments) is
limited," the U.S. ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The Baku-Ceyhan pipeline is vying with other plans to carry
the region's abundant oil and natural gas to the European
markets.
</P>
<P>
Russia has proposed the usage of an existing small pipeline
between Baku and Russian Black Sea port of Novorossisk and Georgia
backs construction of a pipeline to its Black Sea port of Soupsa.
</P>
<P>
Turkey firmly supports the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline because the
project will provide oil and natural gas to the energy-starving
country and it will earn a considerable transportation fee every
year.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan's oil reserves in the Caspian Sea are considered to
be the world's second richest after the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijan's oil started flowing through the Russian
pipeline in 1997 to Novorossisk and beyond.

<HEADLINE> NATO Not to Bomb Yugoslavia But to Maintain Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- NATO decided Tuesday not to
carry out air raids threatened after a 1900 GMT deadline but to
maintain the threat for an unlimited period of time.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told the press after the
day's North Atlantic Council meeting that NATO decided to maintain
the activation order for both the limited air strike and phased
air campaign and will keep the Kosovo situation under constant
review of the council, the highest decision-making body within the
Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision was made after over 4,000 members of
the special police had been withdrawn from Kosovo in the last 24
hours and police and military units that are normally based in
Kosovo were now back to their barracks together with their heavy
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The security forces are returning to the level they were at
before the present crisis began in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that there are now 10,000 troops and policemen in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But NATO's objective remains to achieve full compliance with
United Nations Security Council resolutions 1199 and 1203 despite
the substantial steps taken by the Belgrade authorities.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ruling Party Angry Over Truth Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) is angry over the final report of
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which is set to
implicate it in human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
The ANC accused the commission of criminalizing the liberation
movement in the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the efforts to besmirch our struggle by denouncing
it as gross violation of human rights, the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe
(military wing of the ANC meaning Spear of the Nation) and the
millions of people who were part of this struggle will always be
proud of what they did to ensure that, in the process of the
destruction of a vile system, they do not themselves resort to
vile methods of struggle on the basis that the means justified
the end."
</P>
<P>
The ANC said the TRC findings against it were "capricious and
arbitrary" and contrary to fundamental principles of
international law.
</P>
<P>
The ANC was responding to a section 30 notice outlining the
commission's anticipated findings that the ANC was morally and
politically responsible for gross human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-page report will be handed over to South African
President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The TRC sent about 200 notices to various parties and
individuals, informing them that they were likely to be
implicated to their detriment, and asking for responses.
</P>
<P>
Former President F. W. de Klerk has asked the high court in
Cape Town for an interdict to withhold sections of the report,
which would implicate him in illegal actions by the apartheid
government.
The case has been set down Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Welcomes NATO Decision on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The British government Tuesday
expressed its endorsement to a NATO decision to maintain its
threat of using force in Kosovo, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
NATO announced early Tuesday that it would not launch air
strikes against Serbian targets for now but would maintain the
threat of military intervention against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement: "I
welcome NATO's decision to maintain its readiness to act. NATO has
not and will not lower its guard: the planes will stay on the
runway."
</P>
<P>
"(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic is at last making
serious progress toward compliance with UN Security Council
Resolutions. But this is only because of the continuing threat of
NATO action," Cook said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"He (Milosevic) still has some way to go and there must be no
backsliding. So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on
him," he added.

<HEADLINE> NATO Not to Bomb Yugoslavia But to Maintain Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NATO decided on October 13 to issue activation orders for a
limited air strike and a phased air campaign against Yugoslavia in
order to back up diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Western military alliance extended on October 16 the
ultimatum by 10 more days until this Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that the activation orders had kept Belgrade under
pressure and it was the pressure and NATO's threat to use force
that had changed the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to reduce the level of violence
significantly and to achieve a cease-fire which has held, despite
some sporadic incidents," said Solana.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief described the improvement in the security
situation in Kosovo as having allowed an immediate improvement in
the humanitarian situation.
</P>
<P>
NATO's aerial surveillance and the Kosovo diplomatic observer
mission verified the withdrawal by the Belgrade side.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that NATO's next focus would be on ensuring the
effectiveness of the verification process.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
announced that the verification mission would last for a year in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The North Atlantic Council will keep the situation in Kosovo
under constant review. If we see evidence of substantial
non-compliance in the future with UNSCR 1199 then we will be ready
to use force," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
"We know that (Yugoslav) President (Slobodan) Milosevic only
moves when he is presented with the credible threat of force," he
said.
</P>
<P>
NATO forces are instructed to maintain at appropriate readiness
levels for the operations under both activation orders.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that the council requested the NATO military
authorities to remain prepared to carry out the air operations
should they become necessary.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief also urged Kosovar ethnic Albanians to equally
comply with the UNSCRs and cooperate with the international
community.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kosovo crisis was far from over and a lot of
work remained to be done.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time that the Serbs and the Kosovar Albanians
understand that the international community will not tolerate a
continuation of the status quo," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been too much human suffering," he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO observers believed that the last-ditch mission by two NATO
senior officers to Belgrade Saturday and Sunday contributed to the
de-activation and an open-ended extension of the strike orders.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook described Monday the
agreement reached between NATO Military Committee Chairman Klaus
Naumann and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley Clark and
Belgrade as a significant advance, though no detail of their
mission was disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Addresses Elderly Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Hu Jintao, on
the Double Ninth Festival, a traditional Chinese holiday for
showing respect to the elderly, used a China Central Television
address today to praise the elderly and mark the 1999
International Year of Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
China has 120 million people above the age of 60, and that
number is expected to reach 130 million by the year 2000, and to
be around 400 million by the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Family structure and social changes resulting from the growing
number of elderly are having a great impact on the economy and
social development. All of society needs to be more aware of the
problem and to concentrate on ways to deal with it, said Hu, who
is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
China's elderly have made a great contribution to the country's
development, Hu said, and they deserve the respect of all of
society and society should take care of its senior citizens, and
see that they get a fair share of the fruits of the reforms and
opening up.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, united around the CPC Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core, are pushing the great cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics forward, holding high the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, Hu said, and he hopes that
the elderly will be able to contribute even more to the
drive.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Premier Expected to Call Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard
is expected to call a general election in Canada's French-speaking
province of Quebec later this month.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard is set to meet his cabinet Wednesday and have it adopt
a decree that is required to dissolve Quebec's National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, he is expected to complete the process
of calling the vote, which will be held on November 30.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard said his career was on the line as he prepared to call
the election, which would determine the futures of Quebec and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
"I know very well, it is certain, that my career is at stake,
my political career. It's obvious. This is a moment of truth for
me," he was quoted as saying by the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old Bouchard, who has been leader of Parti
Quebecois (PQ) and premier of the province since early 1995, said
that if re-elected, he would work towards holding another
referendum on Quebec's secession from Canada.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming campaign would be "nasty" and "no-holds-barred",
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The two major parties, the independence-oriented PQ and the
pro-Canadian Liberal Party, are neck and neck in popular support.
</P>
<P>
The latest opinion poll released Tuesday showed that 45 percent
of Quebec respondents plan to vote for the Liberals, and 44
percent for the PQ.
</P>
<P>
Liberal leader Jean Charest also said there were high stakes on
his side. "I'm heading into the biggest political fight of my
life.
</P>
<P>
"The battle will be close, the campaign will be tough, and I
expect it to be very intense," said 40-year-old Charest, who
entered Quebec provincial politics early this year when there was
a call for him to fill the Liberal leadership void.
</P>
<P>
Support for the Liberals surged to 52 percent in April after
Charest's move, but has dwindled steadily over the summer, which
was worrying for people who once viewed Charest as a savior of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the campaign, which is expected to focus on
the referendum, economy and health-care, will be closely followed
by people of not only Quebec but the rest of Canada.

<HEADLINE> Village Autonomy Vs. Party And Government Control (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many lawmakers said they were delighted to see that the recent
draft mentioned the sensitive and delicate relations between the
Chinese Communist Party village branches and autonomous villagers'
committees.
</P>
<P>
It says that Party branches are to play a leading role in rural
work in accordance with the CPC Constitution and regulations, but
they must strictly abide by the country's Constitution and
national laws to protect the democratic rights of villagers and
self-government.
</P>
<P>
Some legislators said that this relationship needs to be
clarified and that a phrase like "related regulations" that the
draft uses is too ambiguous, because all Party committees may
produce "related regulations".
</P>
<P>
Sui Yongju questioned the "leadership role" of the Party
branches in the rural work and asked whether it meant that Party
branches lead villagers committees, and if so, then it should be
clearly stated, and if not, then removed.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to the 10-year-old Organic Law has been published
to guage public opinion.
</P>
<P>
A revision is expected to change election and impeachment
procedures of village heads, daily operation rules of villagers
committees, and expand the rights of villagers.

<HEADLINE> Arena Aims to Restore Confidence to U.S. National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- D.C. United coach Bruce
Arena was named the U.S. national men's soccer team coach and
claimed he will restore confidence and bring new faces into the
national team.
</P>
<P>
"Bruce is in a four-year agreement and I have always been a
long-term person. We are building toward 2010 and believe Bruce
will take us to the next level," said U.S. Soccer President
Robert Contiguglia.
</P>
<P>
Arena won five NCAA titles at Virginia and two Major League
Soccer titles with D.C., and he earned favorable reviews for his
work with the 1996 U.S. Olympic team. Arena's contract is
estimated at 500,000 U.S. dollars a year for four years.
</P>
<P>
Arena also announced that his former assistant, Bob Bradley,
40, coach of the MLS champion Chicago Fire, will serve as his
assistant.
</P>
<P>
"We need to rebuild with youth," Arena said. "I will not rule
out any players, but we want to be in a position to qualify in
the year 2000. I want to work closely with MLS coaches and
players to improve the vertical integration from top to bottom.
The pinnacle has to be the men's senior national team."
</P>
<P>
The USA team finished last among the 36 qualified teams in the
finals of the World Cup this summer. Arena acknowledges U.S.
soccer has work to do in restoring confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I think you will see a number of new faces that are young and
exciting," he said. "We're going to work with the media every
day, and I think we're going to try and give a little bit of
hope."
</P>
<P>
Sampson, Arena's predecessor, praised the selection: "A good
choice. For Bruce the most important thing is that he got a
four-year contract and he can work on getting those players
international experience."

<HEADLINE> Revised Draft Of Chinese Highway Law Proves Controversial (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A revised draft of the Highway
Law submitted to the 5th meeting of the Standing Committee of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) caused quite an argument
today.
</P>
<P>
The draft says that highway maintenance and other levies can be
replaced by revenues from gasoline sales and an automobile sales
tax to help stop illicit fees.
</P>
<P>
But, members of the NPC Standing Committee said that this would
affect the local government finances even if a crackdown on
illicit fees is necessary.
</P>
<P>
They said that it could also put an unreasonable burden on
enterprises and farmers and result in gasoline smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Ruan Chongwu said that the purpose of the new measure is to
change local fees into central financial revenues and that central
government departments could allocate revenues. But this in fact
strengthens the power of central departments, he said, and local
governments would have to lobby the capital to get financial aid
and that this is not helpful to building an honest and clean
government.

<HEADLINE> Solana: Political Settlement of Kosovo Crisis Still Far Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, October 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said Wednesday that there is still a long way to go before
a political settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a Spanish radio, Solana said that NATO must seek a
political settlement of the Kosovo conflict in a most urgent way,
after giving up immediate air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Reaching an agreement on the "establishment of a self-rule
government in the Kosovo region" should be the goal of the
political settlement sought by NATO, he said.
</P>
<P>
What NATO has done so far was only to end the most violent part
of the conflict in the province, but the final goal is to
implement all relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
NATO announced Tuesday there would be no immediate air strikes
against Yugoslavia after confirming that the number of Yugoslav
security forces in Kosovo had returned to the pre-conflict level,
a key demand of NATO for abandoning military strikes.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 24 hours, over 4,000 members of the (Serb)
special police have been withdrawn from Kosovo. Police and
military units based in Kosovo are moving back to their barracks
with their heavy weapons," Solana said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But Solana also threatened Tuesday that NATO might consider the
military option again if Belgrade failed to fully comply with
international demands for an end to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 international monitors will enter Kosovo soon with
Serbian approval to verify demilitarization, help refugees
resettle safely and foster a climate for talks on self-government
for Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Launches Six-month Campaign Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has launched a six-month
campaign against the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
in compliance with the United Nations 1998 World AIDS Campaign.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing in Nigerian capital Abuja, Alhaji Tukur
Mani, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health, said Tuesday
his ministry would adopt an Expanded National Response Strategy
to combat the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
"This new initiative is informed by the realization that
HIV/AIDS problem goes beyond what the Ministry of Health can
handle alone," he was quoted by Wednesday's The Punch newspaper
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new strategy will involve six ministries, namely,
ministries for health, information and culture, education,
federal capital territory, women affairs and youth and sports.
</P>
<P>
The health official noted that the Health Ministry had
budgeted 30 million Naira (about 330,000 U.S. Dollars) for the
publicity of the campaign while the Petroleum Trust Fund had made
a provision of 800 million Naira (about 8.9 million Dollars) for
HIV/AIDS control in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that in 1998 more than 360,000 new HIV infections
would be recorded among Nigerians and an average of 1,000
Nigerians are infected daily.
</P>
<P>
So far, Mani said, three million Nigerians or 4.5 percent of
its sexually-active population had already contacted the disease
by the end of 1997 with 530,000 killed by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
AIDS control drugs are available at the local market, he said,
adding that the drugs cost AIDS victims between 30,000 Naira and
50,000 Naira (about 450 Dollars) which is far beyond the reach of
majority of those infected with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria.

<P>
In addition, Ruan said, many highways are built by local
revenues or even by private enterprises and overseas investors
and if the central government collects gasoline taxes, the local
government, private enterprises, and overseas investors will have a
problem getting their fair share back.
</P>
<P>
The new measure was drawn up by the ministries of
communications and finance after studying the practice on Hainan
Island, which has replaced tolls with taxes.
</P>
<P>
Li Yining, a professor at Beijing University, says that a
change would certainly put a burden on farmers and
enterprises. Most agricultural machinery used by farmers, for
example, can not use the highways, so it is unreasonable to tax it
for highway maintenance, he said, and factories that need gasoline
but don't use highways will face the same problem.
</P>
<P>
Gu Jinchi, said that China's oil is priced higher than that on
the international market, and the new measure may lead to gasoline
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Ruan Chongwu also said that the local government is now
involved in a fight against gasoline smuggling because it affects
their economy and if revenues from gasoline go to the central
revenues, local governments will have no enthusiasm for continuing
the fight against gasoline smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft of the Highway Law will be submitted to the
5th meeting of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee, so that it is
expected to go into effect on January 1, 1999.

BUCHAREST, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Romania welcomes the interim
Israeli-Palestinian Peace Agreement signed in Washington on
October 23, a Romanian Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the accord as a success, spokeswoman Carmen
Podgoreanu said it was a result of the efforts of the two directly
involved parties as well as the international community. She
highlighted the role the United States played to restart peace
negotiations in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Romania is satisfied with the considerable progress achieved
and hopes that the two countries will implement and observe the
new accord's provisions," Podgoreanu said.
</P>
<P>
She added, "Romania will further back any actions aimed at
settling a just and lasting peace in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel is to pull its forces out of 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security
measures against violent extremists.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal would also pave the way to "final status" talks
which will involve the even more contentious issues of fixing
borders, and the status of Jerusalem and of the Palestinian
self-rule area.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The NBA players union is
gearing up for another show of solidarity Wednesday during a
collective bargaining session with the league.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 of the union's 411 members attended a general
meeting last week in Las Vegas. Union executive director Billy
Hunter expects 200-300 players to attend Wednesday's session,
which will be held following the league's board of governors
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Those players who failed to appear in Las Vegas feel they
missed out on a great moment, when all the players came
together," Hunter said. " As a result, they're all flying in. The
numbers could easily exceed what we had in Las Vegas."
</P>
<P>
Hunter said Michael Jordan, David Robinson and Karl Malone
again would be at the meeting as well as Grant Hill and Tim
Duncan, who were no-shows in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
"The intent is to meet with the owners," Hunter said. "In Las
Vegas the players were of the mind if they were present they
could bring some impetus and demonstrated that we're together,
we're unified and we're not going to accept a bad deal. If they
have to hear that from 200-some ballplayers to get the message,
that's what we intend to bring."
</P>
<P>
The players voted unanimously last week never to accept the
hard salary cap owners proposed and said they would be willing to
sit out the season.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner David Stern has canceled the first two weeks of
the season, 99 games, and could cancel more Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We need a session to let them know where we are and to let
them know what we have done," union vice president Dikembe
Mutombo said.

<HEADLINE> EU Takes Measures to Curb "Mad Cow Disease" in Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
announced Wednesday a series of urgent measures to address the
risk of "mad cow disease" for humans and animals both inside and
outside Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The measures include an action program to enforce all European
Union (EU) and Portuguese national measures against the disease, in
particular the removal of specified risk material, as well as a
total ban on the feeding of meat and bone meal.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, a ban on exports of meat and
meat products which expires in nine months will be proposed. So
will be another ban on exports of live animals which will be
reviewed within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, the EU's executive body, said it will provide
financial support for measures taken by Portugal in fighting
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), known as "mad cow disease."
</P>
<P>
So far this year, a total of 67 cases of BSE have been notified
in Portugal, including two cases in animals born after the
implementation of the ban on the feeding of mammalian derived
proteins to ruminants.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient implementation of the measures to control BSE risk
factors, together the increased cases of mad cow disease since
June, raised serious concerns regarding to the development of the
disease, the Commission said.

SINGAPORE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output in September 1998 fell by 1.7 per cent compared to the same
month last year with output of electronic and engineering clusters
shrinking and that of chemical cluster increasing gaining, the
country's Economic Development Board (EDB) said in a press release

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Timely Implementation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States is urging
Israel and the Palestinians to implement their new peace agreement
on time, Israel radio reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Larry Schwartz, spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, said
that "all sides must begin implementation next Monday night," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Schwartz said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon earlier this week to push forward
the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomats met on Wednesday with Palestinian officials to
prevent delays in the fulfillment of the agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that
a cabinet meeting scheduled for Thursday to approve the agreement
was postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu noted on Wednesday that the peace agreement would be
implemented only after his cabinet approved it.
</P>
<P>
"It happens to be that the prime minister cannot put forward
and cannot implement international treaties on his own," Netanyahu
said, adding "It has to be approved by the Cabinet."
</P>
<P>
Political sources told local daily Haaretz that Netanyahu
seems lacking a ministerial majority for approving the second
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank, as what was
agreed in the accord.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Arafat said on Wednesday that he was not
concerned about the postponing of the Israeli cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There are American guarantees, international guarantees and
Arab guarantees, " Arafat noted after returning to the Gaza Strip
from his Arab tour.
</P>
<P>
He stressed "I think that what has been signed will be
implemented accurately."
</P>
<P>
After nine-day talks, Arafat and Netanyahu signed last Friday
in Washington a land-for-peace agreement, under which Israel would
hand over 13 percent of the West Bank in the second redeployment
in return for the Palestinian's commitment to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the two sides should start the
implementation of the deal next Monday.

<HEADLINE> FIVB to Use New Scoring System from 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The world volleyball's governing
body FIVB approved unanimously on Wednesday a proposal to use a
new scoring system from January 1999 in all FIVB competitions.
</P>
<P>
The main change will be that teams score points at each rally
in the style of current tie-breaks, not only when a team has
served, the FIVB said.
</P>
<P>
Matches will be played in the best of five sets format with 25
points for the first four sets and 15 points for the fifth set,
each of them with a minimum lead of two points.
</P>
<P>
The new system will be used in the men's World League, the
women's Grand Prix, the junior and youth world championships and
the World Cup as well as in the continental championships in 1999.
</P>
<P>
National federations are free to introduce it in 1999, but it
will become compulsory at all levels from January 2000, including
the Sydney Olympic Games, the FIVB said.

restore the ecological balance in those areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a meeting on protection of nautral reserves in
northeast, north and northwest China, which was closed here today,
the action was intrigued by the serious flooding this year, which
was caused partly by soil erosion.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Merapi Volcano's Hot Cloud May Come up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The activities of Indonesia's
Mount Merapi at the Central Java have been given "Alert Merapi"
status, meaning that alertness upon the threats of hot cloud and
volcanic mudflow should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Center for Research and Development of Vulcanology
Technology in Yogyakarta Mas Atje Purbawinata said on Wednesday
that the spurt of hot cloud and the flow of lava from the top of
Mount Merapi may happen at any time.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, this most active volcano mountain in Indonesia
has spurted hot cloud for a number of times, directed at the Kali
Lamat river's upstream with a maximum distance of 1.2 kilometers,
Mas Atje was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Visual monitoring shows that the solfatara (sulphur) smoke
coming out of Mount Merapi has a white thin to thick hue, low
pressure and a maximum height of 50 meters from the top of the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
The drop of red-hot lava has continued with a maximum flow of
0.9 kilometer.
</P>
<P>
The seismic activities of Mount Merapi this week have been
dominated by surface earthquakes, namely multi-phase earthquakes
indicating the vibrations of the growth of lava dome and the drop
of red-hot lava, Mas Atje added.
</P>
<P>
The 2,968-meter high Mount Merapi last erupted on July 11,
spilling out hot fumes and ashes.
</P>
<P>
Three major eruptions have been recorded in the past, the most
of which occurred in 1930 when 1,300 people were killed. The other
two eruptions were in 1994 and 1977, when a total of 88 people
died.

<HEADLINE> NATO-Led Air Surveillance to Start Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO is expected to give the
go-ahead to the air surveillance in Kosovo as soon as the end of
this week, a NATO official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
NATO's decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council, would
meet on Friday to approve the air-borne surveillance mission.
</P>
<P>
"The air surveillance is expected to be approved as rapidly as
possible, but sufficient measures have to be in place to protect
the NATO surveillance planes that are unarmed," said the official.
</P>
<P>
NATO on Tuesday suspended its air strike operation against
Yugoslavia after the country met the troop withdrawal deadline by
pulling out another 4,000 soldiers and policemen from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said that the allies would
rely on air and ground verification of the compliance with United
Nations Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
NATO decision makers will also discuss and decide on the
deployment of extraction forces in a nearby location as the backup
for the 2,000-member verification mission to be led by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The same official said that the agreement reached between
Belgrade and OSCE put the responsibility for ensuring the safety
of the verification monitors on the shoulders of Yugoslav
authorities.
</P>
<P>
But OSCE Chairman Bronislaw Geremek reportedly said on
Wednesday that the task of guarding the safety of monitors also
lies in the hands of NATO.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Council is scheduled to discuss the
deployment of extraction forces on Friday and the mission of the
NATO-led forces.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to comment on the size and location of
the extraction force. Some press reports suggested that the force
would be deployed in Macedonia, next to the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, admitted that there was a direct link
between the deployment of extraction forces and the deployment of
the unarmed monitors in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He quoted a United Nations Security Council resolution as
saying that the OSCE and NATO could take appropriate action to
ensure the safety of the monitors.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE announced on Sunday that the verification mission
would last for a year.
</P>
<P>
The NATO official urged ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to make the
most of the ceasefire to further the political process, but he did
not think that the November 4 deadline for starting the political
process would be met.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Disaster Averted, Says USAID Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian
disaster that has loomed for months in Yugoslav province of Kosovo
has been averted, a United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Based on my revisit to Malishevo, Dragobila, and the Pagarusha
area (in Kosovo), plus conversations with NGOs (non-governmental
organizations), international organizations, and our own disaster
assistance relief team, I believe we can say that the humanitarian
disaster we all feared has been averted," Hugh Parmer, assistant
administrator for USAID, said.
</P>
<P>
He said he saw a constant stream of people returning to their
villages in the area surrounding Pagarusha on Tuesday, and hoped
that the current level of security on the ground would be
maintained so that more displaced persons could return home.
</P>
<P>
However, Parmer said this was no time to declare a humanitarian
victory. The coming weeks and months would still be difficult for
the displaced people, he stressed, but "if efforts are maintained
and access provided, there will be no disaster."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said more than 200,000 people in Kosovo were displaced due
to the seven-month conflict and feared that thousands of people
living in the open would possibly die of cold as winter approached.
</P>
<P>
Parmer said the resolve of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) to keep pressure on Yugoslav leaders had
helped improve the situation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
NATO on Tuesday extended its deadline of military threat on
Yugoslavia, which expired Tuesday afternoon, indefinitely after
international observers confirmed that most Serb forces had pulled
out of Kosovo on Monday or returned to their barracks.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo to Remain in Serbia, Says Kosovo Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo province is
part of Serbia and any kind of secession is unacceptable, Kosovo's
top official Zoran Andelkovic said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking exclusively to Xinhua in his office in Pristina,
President Andelkovic of the Temporary Executive Council of Kosovo,
said the Serbian government was "ready to grant highest autonomy"
to Kosovo on the principle that all nationalities were equal
without discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Kosovo's status could be equal to that of Serbia and
Montenegro, as demanded by ethnic Albanians, Andelkovic said
firmly that the secession of Kosovo from Serbia was the "de facto
splitting of the state of Yugoslavia," which was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ethnic Albanian leaders proposed to solve the Kosovo
crisis within Yugoslavia, but not within Serbia, a demand for the
province to be given equal status to Serbia and Montenegro, the
two republics that make up the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
However, Andelkovic said he was confident the Serbs and
Albanians in Kosovo could still live together peacefully after
resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"They have lived here for centuries and have never had problems
before," the de facto provincial governor said, "If the Albanians
here proclaim they can't live with Serbs and want to create their
own state, then thousands of states can be created in the world."
</P>
<P>
Andelkovic said huge efforts had been made to diminish the
plight of refugees with the establishment of 16 humanitarian
centers with 92 aid distribution centers to provide relief.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to find any refugees living in the open or
temporary shelter, talk to them and settle them in houses wherever
they wish to settle. We don't have problems with these
civilians. We only have problems with terrorists," he said,
referring to ethnic Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said
more than 250,000 people have fled their homes to escape the
conflict in the past seven months and a humanitarian catastrophe
was looming as winter approached.
</P>
<P>
But the top official in Kosovo designated by the Serbian
government said Western countries were only interested in
humanitarian issues as an excuse to interfere into Yugoslavia's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 700,000 Serbs were expelled from their own territories
in Krajina in the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia in 1995 and
they never have opportunities to go back, but nobody ever claimed
a humanitarian catastrophe," he complained.
</P>
<P>
He also said there were 36 minorities in Serbia and the Serbs
have never expelled a non-Serb person from Serbia. But the
Albanians in Kosovo wanted a state of their own regardless of the
rights of other minorities, which was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
He said the major task and determination of the executive
council, the temporary government in Kosovo, was to see that
"everything is undertaken on the principles of equality and
non-discrimination of all nationalities."
</P>
<P>
"After successfully defeating the terrorists last month, we are
now getting down to reestablishing confidence and trust among the
population in Kosovo, and are very much ready to cooperate with
the ethnic Albanians in exercising their self-governance on
condition that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the
country are not jeopardized," he said.
</P>
<P>
The de facto governor also criticized some countries which were
meddling in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are not a threat to peace. The real threat to peace are
those who trained and armed terrorists in Kosovo. We are attacked
and threatened by those terrorists," he said, referring to the
outlawed Albanian armed group, the so-called "Kosovo Liberation
Army" (KLA).
</P>
<P>
The KLA took up arms in March to fight for independence for
Kosovo, igniting the conflict which has forced thousands of people
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
"It is strange that Serbian police are prohibited from keeping
peace and order in their own state. It is strange that some
Western countries and NATO are keeping peace and order in another
country with missiles and air strikes. Can that really mean
peace?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
NATO ambassadors in Brussels agreed on Tuesday to suspend the
immediate threat of air strikes against Yugoslavia as Serbian
forces in Kosovo pulled out of the province in compliance with the
U.N. demands. But the alliance can still use force at any time if
necessary by extending the deadline indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> India, France Begins Two-day Strategic Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- India and France began their
first round of strategic dialogue here on Wednesday, covering the
entire gamut of bilateral relations including the nuclear issue.
</P>
<P>
Principal Secretary to Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee Brajesh Mishra, who leads the Indian delegation, told the
press Wednesday following the first day meeting that he held
wide-ranging discussions with French President Jacques Chirac's
special envoy Gerard Errera, a diplomat in the French Embassy in
New Delhi, on areas including the issue of French cooperation in
the civilian nuclear energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue between the two countries is expected to subscribe
to the view point that the international order in the post-cold
war era should be a multipolar and not a unipolar one.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue comes at the time when talks between New Delhi and
Washington have bogged down and the Indian government undoubtedly
hoped that the Indo-French dialogue would push the United States
to be somewhat more accommodating.
</P>
<P>
Decision to initiate the dialogue was made during the Indian
Prime Minister's visit to Paris last month.
</P>
<P>
India has been following more or less French path on issues
such as nuclear disarmament, Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization suspended its
immediate threat to attack Yugoslavia, concluding that President
Slobodan Milosevic was in "substantial compliance" with demands to
end his attacks on ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed
ratification of the new Israeli-Palestinian accord by the cabinet

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The global AIDS epidemic is forcing demographers to
dramatically scale back predictions for population growth over the
next century, as some African nations brace for losses as high as
a quarter of all adults, according to a United Nations study to be
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. and Turkish governments are stepping up pressure on
Western oil companies to support construction of a strategic but
controversial oil pipeline that would bring Caspian Sea crude to
Turkey's Mediterranean coast via a route avoiding both Russia and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Brazil's president Fernando Henrique Cardoso addressed the
nation to warn of tough times ahead. Details of his austerity
package, which will include budget reductions and tax increases

dollars Brazil bailout as it tries to contain a global
emerging-market crisis.
</P>
<P>
-- A draft Russian economic plan was published in a Moscow
business paper, outlining vague steps the government is
considering to battle a financial crisis. Foreign investors
aren't likely to be reassured. Western banks resume
debt-restructuring talks Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Lightning Kills 11 Soccer Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRAZZAVILLE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Eleven members of a
Congolese soccer team were killed by a burst of lightning and
dozens more people were injuried during a weekend match,
according to the Congolese news agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency reported Tuesday that the lightning strike wiped
out all the players fielded by the home team in the village of
Bena Tshadi, in the south-central Congolese province of Eastern
Kasai.
</P>
<P>
Local investigators are blaming the lightning bolt on
witchcraft because none of the players on the opposing team from
nearby Basangana village were injured, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The report added that sorcery is often used in the region in
an attempt to influence soccer games.
</P>
<P>
The two teams were tied 1-1 when the lightning struck.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people, most standing along the sidelines, were
injured by the lightning, but none of the injuries are believed
to be life-threatening, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Witchcraft is often blamed throughout west and central Africa
to explain natural phenomenon and illness.

<HEADLINE> Canada Suspends Aid Program in Jamaica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada has suspended its
foreign-aid program in Jamaica, because the Jamaican government
has refused to explain the disappearance of nearly 18 million
Canadian dollars (11.7 million U.S. dollars) of development
assistance, Canada's National Post newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dispute arose when Canadian auditors began looking into a
program in which Ottawa shipped commodities, such as fertilizers,
to Jamaica and the local government sold them to help
finance-aided projects.
</P>
<P>
Auditors at the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) said when they visited Jamaica to try to track the money,
the government agency in charge of the program refused to hand
over relevant files and began shredding documents.
</P>
<P>
In a report to Ottawa in February, the auditors said they could
not determine how the money was spent.
</P>
<P>
Canada has asked Jamaica to investigate the implementation of
the program, which was set up to help finance infrastructure
programs, such as bridge-building.
</P>
<P>
But CIDA spokesman Robin Walsh said the Jamaican government had
not responded, and the Canadian government reacted by suspending
the program.

<HEADLINE> Debate On Village Autonomy Vs. Party And Government Control (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A proposed amendment to the
Organic Law for Villagers' Committee submitted sparked an intense
debate today among Chinese lawmakers about villagers' autonomy and
Party and government control.
</P>
<P>
Most said that democratically-elected villagers' committees
should be independent of township governments and can be seen as
assistants but never subordinates, as amendment suggested.
</P>
<P>
Other members contended that without the power to control
villagers' committees, the local government could not accomplish
its many tasks like birth control and military conscription.
</P>
<P>
Shu Huaide, a member of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, said the existing rules are appropriate and
effective in guarding villagers' autonomy. If the committees were
subordinate, then township governments could appoint village heads
without acknowledging that they have to be elected by villagers
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The democratic election, decision-making, self-management and
supervision, which are the goal of this piece of legislation,
would then be impossible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Jiang Shusheng countered by saying that if democracy
is overdone, there will be too many difficulties, and with no
leadership for villagers committees, local governments might not
have enough to fulfill birth control and military quotas.
</P>
<P>
Huang Changxi, Sui Yongju and Li Meng said that villagers
committees, as assistants of the local government, must actively
support the government in these tasks.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Inflow of direct foreign
investment into Pakistan has shrunk by 79 million U.S. dollars in
July and August this year, according to figures released Wednesday
by the Board of Investment (BOI).
</P>
<P>
Pakistan attracted a total of 74.4 million foreign direct
investment in July and August, the first two months of the current
fiscal year, while in the similar period last fiscal year, the
foreign direct investment stood at 153.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The foreign direct investment drifted away from the power
sector in July to August this fiscal year by ending at 30.6
million dollars in comparison with 74 million in the same period
last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures by BOI, cement, tourism and
petro-chemical and refining sectors did not receive foreign direct
investment in July and August.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. investment in Pakistan during the two months was 37
million dollars, while investment from the U.K. was 11 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investors are closely watching the quarrel between
the government and Independent Power producers on tariff and once
it is settled they will be able to take fresh positions on
investment in Pakistan, the BOI said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian Architecture
Awards for 1997 was launched here Wednesday with Nepal, Bhutan and
Bangladesh as the focus countries.
</P>
<P>
Initially an award for excellence in architecture, the
Architect of the Year Awards extended its scope from India to the
entire South Asian region in 1997 with a view to giving an impetus
to architecture in the region, the most populous area in the
world, for improvement of the surroundings and the quality of
life, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Every year one or more member countries of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) comprising
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka are invited to contest the awards as the focus countries.

"Application forms and the code of procedure for South Asian

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Congo (K) Crisis Talks Make No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The just concluded ministerial
meeting held in Zambian capital Lusaka has made no breakthrough
on the three-month long crisis in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) despite a draft ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka meeting is no doubt the largest high-level
gathering of its kind called by African countries in an effort to
bring a speedy and peaceful solution to the complicated situation
in the vast central African country since the crisis broke out in
early August.
</P>
<P>
It attracted more than 130 delegates including foreign and
defense ministers from at least 14 African countries as well as
senior officials from the United Nations, the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
What is noticeable is that all the key players directly or
indirectly involved in the Congo (K) crisis such as Zimbabwe,
Namibia, Angola, Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and the DRC were present
at the meeting, a case which has never happened in the
mini-summit meetings in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe or in Pretoria
and Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting which focused on issues relating to
the cessation of hostilities in the DRC, the implementation of a
ceasefire and withdrawal of foreign forces, adopted a draft
ceasefire agreement and a mechanism for its implementation and
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The participants also agreed at the talks to establish a
mechanism for the involvement of the rebels, who came to Lusaka
but was denied access to the meeting, in working out the
modalities for the implementation of the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting, which was described as "very important"
and "successful" by SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbende, has
not made any breakthrough on the DRC crisis since the proposed
ceasefire is far from being a "practical" accord to implement due
to lack of concrete measures.
</P>
<P>
Some key players still hold their own previous stands and
their major differences on the withdrawal of foreign forces and
cessation of hostilities remain to be ironed out.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing Tuesday afternoon during the intervals of
the meeting, Congolese Foreign Minister Jean Charles Okoto
stressed his government only deals with Rwanda and Uganda instead
of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He strongly urged the two countries which have been accused by
Kinshasa of invasion and of backing the rebels to withdraw their
troops from Congo (K) immediately, saying the troops from Rwanda
and Uganda should be treated differently from those of Kinshasa's
allies, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Congo (K) Crisis Talks Make No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But Bizima Karaha, President Laurent Kabila's former foreign
minister who led the rebel delegation, later told reporters that
unless the Congolese government sits down and talks with the
rebels there will be no solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Karaha also noted that "the Congolese problem can only be
resolved by the Congolese people themselves".
</P>
<P>
While Rwanda again firmly denied sending troops to the former
Zaire, Uganda acknowl its deployment of troops in the
DRC and tried to justify its military presence there.
</P>
<P>
A statement released at the end of the ministerial meeting by
Ugandan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Amama Mbabazi
declared Uganda has security interests in eastern Congo (K) and
it sent troops to fight against those Ugandan Hutu-rebels who
established bases there to topple Kampala's current government.
It also insisted that all the foreign forces should leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that all foreign troops should leave the DRC. The
withdrawal should be done after a ceasefire and when neutral
multi-national forces have taken up positions in the DRC to
supervise strict observance of the ceasefire and ensure security
of the neighboring countries," Mbabazi said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day closed-door meeting, the atmosphere was tense
from the very beginning to the end. Those countries involved in
the crisis were obviously divided into two camps and the meeting
almost came to an failure before Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba, who was earlier mandated by African leaders to mediate
the Congo (K) crisis, managed to persuade Rwandan and Ugandan
delegations which had backed out during consultations Monday
evening to return to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here observed that the Lusaka meeting made
no more progress than the pervious talks of such nature. They
said no "meaningful" solutions could be found until the rebels
who control most part of the eastern Congo (K) were directly
involved in working out a "practical" and "concrete" ceasefire
and all the key players reached a consensus on the withdrawal of
foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
They also believed that the crisis, which has drawn in more
and more African countries, tended to escalate and peace and
stability of the African continent, particularly in the Great
Lakes region, would be threatened and a "disaster" for the
African people, as a result, is "unavoidable".
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they said the way for the African leaders to find a
practical solution to the Congo (K) crisis is still long and more
concerted efforts should be made in order to narrow the existing
major differences of the key players as soon as possible and pave
the way for restoring peace in the country in an "African way."

<HEADLINE> Georgian Songs, Dances Thrill HK Audience in Asian Arts Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The audience in the Hong Kong
Cultural Center's Grand Theater were thrilled by the graceful
dances of Georgian woman and courage of their male counterparts as
Georgian artists began for the first time in Hong Kong a two-day
performance program on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With sparks flash amidst dagger and sword strikes, the warrior
dancers displayed a unique culture of the former Soviet Union
republic in the Caucasus. "It is part of the country's tradition
featuring involvement in numerous wars in the history," explained
soloist Givi Shanidze, who is the founder and artist director of
the visiting Kolkheti Ensemble.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 years since its founding, the prize-winning song
and dance troupe has visited more than 30 countries and regions in
Asia, Europe and Americas.
</P>
<P>
The performance given by Kolkheti is part of the program for
the on-going 17th Festival of Asian Arts here, which goes through
mid-November.
</P>
<P>
"Although we'd just arrived here Monday afternoon, Hong Kong
has given us a very good and positive impression," said Teimuraz
Kobakhidze, the choreographer of the Kolkheti Song and Dance
Company.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very strong aspiration to visit China sometime in
the future, as we all know China is famed for its long history and
cultural heritage," said English-speaking Nino Lazishvili, the
troupe's leading female dancer. She was brought into a dancing
career five years ago by her mother, a famed dancer in a national
troupe.
</P>
<P>
"Dancing is very important in our country. It's part of our
life," she added.
</P>
<P>
Among the limelights of the opening-day program on Wednesday
were folk songs, Song of Labor, Song of the Riders, Dance with
Flute Music and Danced Poem of Love.
</P>
<P>
With an ancient history, Georgia is well-known for its original
and unique culture. The Georgians have created through past
centuries unique arts including music, choreography, architecture,
folklore and decoration.
</P>
<P>
The Georgians have maintained their own spoken and written
language, and architecture, religion and musical culture. The
Georgian music features a unique polyphony, which follows rules
very different from those of European polyphonic choral music,
according to Shanidze.
</P>
<P>
In modern Georgia, however, many of the original folk songs are
sung only as performance, instead of usually being part of the
daily life. The Kolkheti is among various local organizations and
individual artists devoted in preserving Georgian folk music, he
added.

<HEADLINE>   Myanmar Leader Meets U.N. Special Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- First Secretary of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt
met with visiting Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the
United Nations Alvaro de Soto here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Alvaro, Assistant Secretary-General of the U.N., arrived in
Yangon on Tuesday on his second four-day trip to Myanmar in this
year to look into the current political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw
separately as well as General Secretary of the opposition National
League for Democracy (NLD) Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
The visit came over a month after the NLD formed on September
16 a 10-member Committee Representing the Parliament Elected in
the 1990 Multi-Party General Election and unilaterally set up a
People's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government ignored a deadline set by the NLD for the
convening of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In August, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed to
Myanmar leader Senior-General Than Shwe that a special emissary be
sent then to Yangon for the discussions, but was rejected by the
latter, according to an earlier official report.
</P>
<P>
In January, Alvaro visited Yangon and met with Than Shwe and
Khin Nyunt.
</P>
<P>
He then had discussions with Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn
Gyaw on matters of mutual interest and also met with Aung San Suu
Kyi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a latest government statement warned that no
pressure from foreign countries and organizations including the
U.N. will deter Myanmar from its chosen path.

<HEADLINE> International Demining Forum Closed in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Three-day International
Forum on Demining and Victim Assistance is closed here Wednesday,
promoting the exchanges on experiences and information in
demining.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 participants from about 50 countries attended the
forum, most of them are the most mine-affected countries.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Mouly, chairman of the Cambodian Mine Action Center
(CMAC), said at the closing meeting that the forum was fruitful.
</P>
<P>
"This forum is to open the opportunity for donor countries to
see the facts in mine-affected countries like Cambodia, and a
chance for mine-affected countries coming from all of the world to
share experiences," Ieng Mouly said.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the forum is "Toward Zero Victims Based on
Ownership and Partnership".
</P>
<P>
Cambodia remains one of the most heavily mined countries in the
world. It is estimated there are still 4 to 6 million landmines in
Cambodia soil. Today Cambodia continues to pay a heavy price. In
1998, the country suffers between 150 and 200 casualties a month
from mines and unexploded ordnance.
</P>
<P>
With the help of donor countries and international
organizations, Cambodia has made a great efforts to demine and
assist the victims.
</P>
<P>
To date, CMAC has cleared 152 minefields, destroyed about
40,000 anti-personnel mines, more than 900 anti-tank mines and
nearly 50,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance.
</P>
<P>
Sam Sitha, director general of CMAC, told the reporters: "We
guarantee that within 30 years, landmines will be removed from
Cambodia if such activities are continued."

<HEADLINE> Israel Lifts Closure, Curfew on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops Wednesday
lifted the closure and curfew imposed on the West Bank city of
Hebron earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The general closure and curfew were imposed after a
29-year-old Jewish settler was shot dead in Hebron on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that on Wednesday morning, the soldiers
removed the roadblocks they had set up around Hebron, allowing
Palestinians to enter or leave the city.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled
sector of the city were also allowed to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
Israel made the decision to lift the closure and curfew after
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) announced on Tuesday that
its security forces have arrested two Palestinians suspected of
murdering the settler.
</P>
<P>
The arrest was a sign of new security cooperation between
Israel and the PNA after a land-for-peace agreement was signed
last Friday in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians in the second troop redeployment, in
return for the fulfillment of the Palestinian commitments to
fight terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Four Detainees at U.N. Tribunal End Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Four suspects detained
at the United Nations tribunal for 1994 Rwanda genocide have
ended their hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
Kingsley Moghalu, spokesman for the U. N. International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Tanzania's northern town
of Arusha, said that the four detainees resumed eating and
drinking Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"They asked for their meal, normal food, and were supplied,"
Moghalu said in a telephone interview with Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the ICTR spokesman declined to brief the latest
development in the detention facilities on the outskirts of
Arusha where 33 detainees are held awaiting for their trial or
appeal for their roles in the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The 25 detainees embarked on the hunger strike Monday in
collaboration with former Rwandan mayor Jean-Paul Akayesu who had
been on hunger strike since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Arusha said that some other detainees were seen
secretly taking biscuits and juices in their facilities.
</P>
<P>
Akayesu has been convicted of genocide and sentenced to a life
imprisonment by the ICTR earlier this month for his role in
Rwanda's 1994 massacre.
</P>
<P>
In a signed letter to the Tribunal, the detainees protested
alleged denial of their human rights in the assignment of the
lawyers by the ICTR Registry.
</P>
<P>
However, Registrar Agwu Okali fired back Tuesday by saying in
a news release that the assignment of counsel is his
responsibility under the tribunal's rules.
</P>
<P>
"Defense lawyers are assigned to detainees who can not afford
the costs of hiring their own lawyer in order to ensure respect
for the right of the accused to a fair trial," Okali said. "This
responsibility is acknowledged by the detainees in their letter."

<HEADLINE> Clan Leaders Urged to Stop Hostilities in Niger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Delta State
administrator has appealed to leaders of the warring Ijaw and
Itsekiri communities in Niger Delta region to order their youths
to stop all hostilities, This Day newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Administrator Walter Faghebo as saying
Tuesday that the state government vowed to deal with anyone who
threatens peace and order in oil town of Warri and its environs
as 500 soldiers police the town to forestall renewed fighting.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued Monday night at the end of a peace meeting
to solve Warri crisis in Asaba, capital of Delta State, called
for immediate halt to current hostilities between Ijaws and
Itsekiris.
</P>
<P>
The ten-point communique said that the Itsekiris had agreed to
the creation of a separate local government for the Ijaws and a
powerful delegation led by the Delta State administrator would be
sent to Nigerian capital Abuja to seek lasting solution to the
Warri crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two ethnic groups have been engaged in violent conflicts
since 1996 over the relocation of Warri South Local Government
from Ogbe-Ijoh, an Ijaw settlement, to Ogidegben, an Itsekiri
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The latest conflict started 11 days ago as some Ijaw youths
were alleged to have attacked an Itsekiri funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
The communique noted that unemployment is a major secondary
cause of the crisis, therefore, calling on the Nigerian federal
government, oil companies operating in Niger Delta area and the
private sector to provide employment opportunities for the
youths.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the peace meeting agreed that all oil
transmission stations occupied by the rampaging Ijaw youths
should be vacated while all waterways blocked should be cleared
and made safe for a free and uninterrupted passage.
</P>
<P>
Although Ijaws and Itsekiris agreed to immediate halt to
hostilities, both communities insisted on certain conditions
being met before a lasting peace could be achieved in Warri and
its environs, according to Wednesday's The Guardian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Fregene, spokesman of the Itsekiri, said that "this
meeting did not achieve more than appealing to the two sides to
lay down their arms."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "we cannot talk of peace when the Itsekiris are
still rendered homeless, when the Itsekiri communities are still
being burnt down, when the Ijaws are still armed."

<HEADLINE> Agronomists Suggest Measures for Increasing Incomes of Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Agronomists attending a
seminar which ended here today said that China should make efforts
to increase the incomes of farmers.
</P>
<P>
To do this, China should develop high-quality, high-efficiency
and high-yielding agriculture, increase investment in agriculture,
and speed up the transfer of farm workers to other industries,
said Duan Yingbi, deputy director of the Financial and Economic
Leading Group Office of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts noted that the slow increase of income for
farmers has become one of the most challenging problems facing
the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
In the past nine months, the per capita income for farmers
increased by only one percent over the same period last year in
real term.
</P>
<P>
Ye Ying, a Ministry of Agriculture official, also said that
efforts should be made to set up coordinated relations between
industry and agriculture, and between rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that the household contract responsibility
system does not conflict with collective operations and local
governments should do their best to stabilize such a system.
</P>
<P>
Other topics include the development of township enterprises
and small towns, and rural tax and fee-charging reforms. More than
80 agronomists attended the two-day seminar to commemorate the
20th anniversary of the rural reform, sponsored by the Ministry of
Agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges U.N. to Improve Performance in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has urged U.N. agencies to
improve their performance in implementing the part of the
oil-for-food program relevant to the northern Kurdish autonomous
region, the Iraqi News Agency INA reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said INA,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf complained that
despite U.N. promises to improve the performance of its agencies
in northern Iraqi provinces, Iraq had noted "neither a change at
the performance level nor any increase in the implementation ratio."
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of U.N. Humanitarian Program for Iraq Benon
Sevan held meetings with the executive chairmen of the
U.N. agencies in northern Iraq on June 22 till July of 1998 and
promised to take measures to improve the humanitarian situation
there.
</P>
<P>
The letter calls on the U.N. secretary-general to take all
needed measures to urge the U.N. agencies to act "in a way that
would ensure a right, efficient and quick implementation" of the
program.
</P>
<P>
An article carried by the local newspaper Al-Iraq Daily on
Tuesday said "the Kurdish people in the autonomous region have
not received the full ratio of the items contracted for food,
health, electricity, education, drinking water and sanitation
sectors."
</P>
<P>
It added "this fact was confirmed by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan in his last June report to the U.N. Security
Council."
</P>
<P>
In order to make the oil-for-food deal a success in the
northern autonomous region, the legitimate authority should
exercise its normal role in directly administrating those
provinces as they are indivisible part of unified Iraq, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi central government has lost its actual control
over the northern Kurdish autonomous region since the end of
1991 Gulf War caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program came into force in December
1996 with declared goals of alleviating the sufferings of the
Iraqi people. The U.N. agencies have been assigned to carrying out
the program in the Kurdish autonomous region instead of the Iraqi
central government.

BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Huaxia Bank announced
today that it has a new development strategy to improve itself in
5 years.
</P>
<P>
At the bank's 6th anniversary ceremony today, its president,
Duan Xiaoxing, said that from 1999 to 2003, Huaxia will continue
reforms as part of the plan, improve the share system in the
commercial bank, and improve its ability to avoid risks.
</P>
<P>
It will also develop new markets and open new businesses and
improve financial services.
</P>

By 2003, it will have 140 billion yuan in RMB and foreign
exchange deposits and total assets of 200 billion yuan. It will
also have 350 branches.
</P>
<P>
Huaxia was founded in October 1992. In February 1995, it became
China's first commercial bank to issue shares. The bank's 33
shareholders, who are mainly state-owned enterprises, meant a
capital increase to 2.5 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Gets Tough on Gangs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The South African
parliament has intensified the campaign against gang bosses by
stiffening punishment and modifying laws concerning gang crimes.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's justice committee Tuesday put forward a
revised bill which raises the maximum fine and jail term for
racketeering from 10 million Rand (1.75 million U.S. Dollars) to
one billion Rand (175 million Dollars) and from 30 years to life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
"Now we can really nail these buggers," committee chairman
Johnny de Lange said in a debate on the Prevention of Organized
Crime Bill, which is expected to set in place the necessary legal
steps "to deal with the tyranny of organized crime," Business
Paper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the reason for increasing the fine -- at one
billion Rand, the highest in South Africa's legal history -- was
the huge sums of money involved in organized crime.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the maximum sentence to life was because gang
bosses could often be convicted only on racketeering charges
while their gangs were responsible for extremely serious
offenses, such as murder.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for civil and criminal forfeiture of assets.
In the case of civil forfeiture, any asset involved in a crime or
proceeds of a crime can be confiscated by the state, even though
there has been no conviction.
</P>
<P>
To make it easier for the state to convict a gangster, the
definition of racketeering offenses was strengthened through the
de-linking and broadening of certain clauses.
</P>
<P>
The committee is scheduled to conclude its work this week, in
time for the bill to be put to the National Assembly for adoption
at the end of next week.

<HEADLINE> China to Stop Foreign Exchange Swapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to stop the
business of foreign exchange swapping among overseas-funded
enterprises as of December 1.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange settlementments by related enterprises
will be conducted through banks, according to a circular jointly
issued today by the People's Bank of China and the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange.
</P>
<P>
This move aims to unify the Chinese foreign exchange markets,
says the circular, and it is expected to cut down procedures for
foreign-funded enterprises to sell or purchase foreign currency
and accelerate capital turnover.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange swapping business started in 1980 and
has played an important role in helping Chinese and overseas-funded
enterprises exchange their surplus and deficiency in
foreign currency. Yet since 1996, when buying and selling foreign
currency through banks became available to overseas-funded
businesses, foreign exchange trade in the country has been handled
mostly through the banking system.
</P>
<P>
The banks' foreign exchange settlement system is basically
mature and can now meet the business demands of institutions and
enterprises, the circular says.
</P>
<P>
The circular also detailed measures for transforming or closing
foreign exchange swapping centers throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Slightly Lower Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah closed at
7,550/7,675 rupiah to the U.S. dollar in the Jakarta inter-bank
spot market Wednesday, declining by 275 points compared with
Tuesday's close of 7,275/7,375 rupiah per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Trading was relatively quiet as players eventually adopted a
wait-and-see attitude, a dealer working for a private bank said.
</P>
<P>
The absence of a driving factor was expected to make trading
become more quiet in the coming days with market players tending
to become more cautious, he added.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which hit an eight-month high of 7,150 last
Wednesday, slid back to 7,800 on Thursday and to 7,850 on Friday.
The Indonesian currency strengthened to 7,500/7,700 on Monday.

BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China voiced its hearty
congratulations today to the signing of the Comprehensive and
Ultimate Peace Agreement by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
and his Ecuadorian counterpart Jamil Mahuad in Brasilia on October
26.

<HEADLINE> Special Courts Protect Women From Domestic Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
has established 87 courts to deal with cases involving the
violation of women's rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
"The largest number of cases these courts receive concern
domestic violence," said Wang Shirong, vice president of the
Shanxi Higher People's Court. Wang is one of the founders of the
first court of this kind in China, established in Shanxi in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence occurs most frequently in underdeveloped
provinces such as Shanxi, Wang pointed out, and women victims
could find little legal protection because many cases were not
considered serious enough for regular courts.
</P>
<P>
"With these special courts, women are able to go through legal
procedures to settle cases of domestic violence," she said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the special courts are playing a very important
role in protecting women's rights and interests and helping them
learn to protect themselves with legal means.
</P>
<P>
Following Shanxi's example, Hebei, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Henan and
Shaanxi provinces have also established such courts for women.
</P>
<P>
About 8 percent of Chinese women have suffered at least once
from domestic violence, and nearly 1 percent have been victims of
frequent violence from family members, according to a recent
survey by the All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence against women has to be controlled with
comprehensive social efforts, said Li Hui, a member of the Chinese
Women Judges Association. She said that the concept of domestic
violence has to been defined more clearly in relevant laws, and
that judges should be trained to deal with such cases.

<HEADLINE> HK Holds Official Event to Commemorate War Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- An official ceremony was held
here Wednesday to commemorate those who died in the defense of
Hong Kong against the Japanese between 1941 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony held at the City Hall Memorial Garden,
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China, conveyed salute to all those
who died in the defense of Hong Kong on behalf of the Hong Kong
people.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, the first official event organized by the
HKSAR government to mark the war dead after its establishment on
July 1, 1997, a list containing the names of 115 members of the
Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column who died
in the defense of Hong Kong between 1941 and 1945 was added to the
Roll of Honor kept in the Memorial Shrine.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the adding of these names to the Roll of Honor
demonstrates an official commendation of the contribution made by
and the brave acts of members of the battalion.
</P>
<P>
A plaque of the Hong Kong Independent Battalion in both Chinese
and English is also displayed in the Memorial Shrine.
</P>
<P>
The battalion was a guerrilla unit which operated in Hong Kong
during the Sino-Japanese War. Most of its members were local
residents, mainly from the "New Territories".
</P>
<P>
The battalion was set up immediately after Hong Kong was
occupied by the Japanese on December 25, 1941.
</P>
<P>
It contributed a lot to the defense of Hong Kong by wiping out
bandits, escorting hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and
well-known figures to the mainland, helping hundreds of officers
and soldiers of the allied forces and foreign friends to escape
from the control of the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
In fact, after the surrender of the British forces in Hong Kong
to the Japanese, the battalion was the only force to fight against
the Japanese during that period. It withdrew from Hong Kong after
the victory in the war.
</P>
<P>
There were some 1,000 members in the battalion and some 400 of
them are still alive with half of them living in the mainland and
another half residing in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, the chief executive laid a wreath at the
shrine.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials, representatives of the Judiciary
of the SAR, representatives of the Legislative Council of the SAR,
Hong Kong members of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, Hong Kong deputies to
the National People's Conference were present at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Among others who attended the ceremony were representatives of
Central People's Government organizations in Hong Kong,
representatives of foreign consuls in Hong Kong, relevant members
of the Consular Corps, community leaders and representatives of
war veteran groups and related community organizations.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho military bases
occupied by foreign troops during an army revolt in the kingdom
would be handed back to the Lesotho military later this week.
</P>
<P>
South African national newspaper Business Day quoted the
office of Botswanan President Festus Mogae as saying Tuesday that
the South African and Botswanan troops, deployed in Lesotho last
month under the auspices of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), would hand over the bases Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the office did not say when the troops would leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Lesotho government and the opposition
parties agreed to fresh elections in 18 months to resolve a
bloody dispute over national polls in May.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties claimed that the May elections were rigged
in favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy, which won
79 of the 80 seats in the parliament of the tiny landlocked
country.

<HEADLINE> Boycott of States Moving Embassies to Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Council of
Mosques under the Muslim World League has called for Arab and
Islamic boycott of states which move their embassies in Israel
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of its 18th session held in Mecca, Saudi
Arabia Tuesday night, the council asserted that "Jerusalem was an
Arab and Islamic capital which cannot be abandoned and should be
reserved along with the Aqsa Mosque," the Kuwait News Agency
(Kuna) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which captured the eastern sector of Jerusalem from
Jordan in 1967, claims all of city as its eternal capital, while
Palestinians demand control of the Arab section and want to make
it the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. resolution in 1947, Jerusalem, the seat for
Islamic, Jewish and Christian religions, is under international
mandate.
</P>
<P>
But in 1950, Israel removed its capital to Jerusalem and in
1980 declared it as its united and eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral moves have been opposed by the international
community and the Islamic world. Almost all countries that have
diplomatic relations with Israel have refused to move their
embassies from Tel aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The council also reiterated its keenness and commitment to
legislative rights of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
It recommended to closely follow up Israeli activities and
attempts against Islamic religious symbols in Palestine and
elsewhere in the world, Kuna said.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Dhaka Embankment to Start Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a
38-kilometer-long Dhaka Flood Control-cum-Eastern Bypass
Multipurpose Project involving an estimated cost of 30 billion
taka (619 million U.S. dollars) is expected to start next month, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Japanese government had shown interest
in providing the necessary fund for the implementation of the
project, a competent source from the Ministry of Water Resources
was quoted by The Bangladesh Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Japan International Cooperative Agency completed
the feasibility study of the embankment with the financial
assistance from the Japanese government, while the World Bank
completed the feasibility study of the roads, sluice gates,
culverts and bridges of the project, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government will spend 10 billion taka (206
million dollars) from its own resources for the acquisition of
lands and earth work of the embankment.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the highest-level Steering Committee headed by the
prime minister will finalize the date for launching the project,
and three committees have been formed to implement the project, he
added.
</P>
<P>
After the necessary scrutiny, the Planning Commission will send
the project concept paper to the Steering Committee to start the
work in November.
</P>
<P>
This is the second phase of the whole project, and the first
phase of the Dhaka City Flood Protection Embankment is yet to be
completed.
</P>
<P>
The work of the first phase began in November 1992 with an
estimated cost of 5.37 billion taka (111 million dollars) provided
by the Asian Development Bank, and 4 billion taka (83 million
dollars) has already been spent on the first phase.

<HEADLINE> More Than 4,000 Ugandan Soldiers Deployed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has deployed a total of
more than 4,000 troops in the eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), Wednesday's Monitor paper reported.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 200,000 armed men on the ground facing off on
both sides, it said.
</P>
<P>
The figure is reported to have been got from independent and
diplomatic sources because many governments continue to deny that
their troops are involved in the three-month-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
When contacted for confirmation, the information office of the
defense ministry told Xinhua Wednesday morning that they are not
in a position to comment on that.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni told a press conference last week
that Uganda has more than two battalions of soldiers in eastern
DRC and promised not to send reinforcements there unless the
situation worsens.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Zimbabwe has 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers
in the DRC while Angola and Namibia deploy 4,000 and 300 soldiers
there respectively.
</P>
<P>
There are 60,000 Tutsi rebels fighting against some 60,000
Kabila ground forces, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
Growing concerns are not gripping more and more countries in
the region and even in the continent with rapid widening of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for an immediate
withdrawal of foreign troops from the DRC and the U.S. government
sent a special envoy to the Great Lakes Region to persuade the
key players in the conflict to stop hostilities.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Sign on SADC Trade Pacts: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has pledged
to the signing of Southern African Development Community (SADC)
trade protocols, according to the South African trade minister.
</P>
<P>
The South African government is possibly to sign the protocols
next year, thus paving the way for a free trade area in the
region, Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said Tuesday at a
press briefing during a regional business conference with the
participation of representatives from SADC members.
</P>
<P>
The Sowetan daily Wednesday quoted Erwin as saying that
regional integration was not an option but an imperative.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa cannot adapt to globalization on its own," he
said. "We have to move in unison with SADC members over time."
</P>
<P>
The South African minister noted that a number of trade and
joint initiatives with other SADC members were in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
SADC Deputy Secretary-General Prega Ramsamy, who attended the
conference, said there were currently 472 projects under way in
the region which are valued at 60 million Rand (about 10 million
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
So far, there were four countries of 14 SADC member states,
Botswana, Mauritius, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, who signed SADC trade
protocols, which provide for the creation of a SADC free trade
area within eight years.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramsamy, at present more than 70 percent of SADC
trade is taking place at tariffs below 10 percent, and by the end
of 1999 the SADC can achieve a partial free trade area covering
some 70 to 80 percent of internal SADC trade.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Aluminum Workers Abandon Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Workers of the Mozambican
Aluminum Company (MOZAL) have decided to abandon strikes because
they are aware of the the importance of the on-going MOZAL
project.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's Noticias newspaper quoted the company's trade
union leader Jeremisa Timana as saying that the workers have done
so because they are aware of the importance of the MOZAL project
and the significance of its completion in time.
</P>
<P>
The workers went on a three-day strike in late September for
pay increment. Just a few days ago, they threatened to strike
again.
</P>
<P>
MOZAL lost some one million U.S. Dollars each day during their
strikes.
</P>
<P>
Though abandoning strikes, MOZAL workers also asked the
national trade union of civil construction, timber industry and
mines to negotiate with the management of the project on a
mechanism of sustainably raising pays for the workers, said
Timana.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican Labor Ministry decided to give a 10 percent pay
raise to the MOZAL workers last week, thus avoiding another
strike.
</P>
<P>
Timana said the management had acknowledged that there were
mistakes at the early phase of the project.
</P>
<P>
Now, it is different, he said, adding that the labor and the
management no longer push responsibilities upon the other.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2-billion-U.S. Dollar project started in mid this year
is the biggest one in recent years in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
The funds came from various companies of Mozambique, South
Africa, the United Kingdom and Japan. The ores will come from
Australia and MOZAL products will go to Asian and European
markets.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Allows More NLD Members to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Authorities have
allowed 49 members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) to
go home during these three days starting Monday after "view
exchanges" with them, according to an official information sheet
issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of the NLD members who were allowed to return home
after "housing" them for several weeks at the state guest houses
went to 73 since September 14.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the NLD Monday, a total of
987 of its party members including 200 parliament
representatives-elect and 787 party organizers have been detained
by the authorities since May 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
The NLD has denied that the authorities had exchanged views
with its detained members, saying that they were, in fact,
"interrogated."
</P>
<P>
On September 16, the NLD formed a 10-member committee
representing the parliament elected in the 1990 multi-party
general election and set up a People's Parliament after its
deadline for the parliament to be convened was ignored by the
government.
</P>
<P>
After the NLD's formation of the People's Parliament, the
government has organized a series of mass rallies in different
states and divisions, denouncing the NLD's move.
</P>
<P>
The NLD said in a letter to the chairman of the Myanmar State
Peace and Development Council (SPDC) on October 13 that the
authorities are "illegally" using people from all walks of life
who are under "pressure" for the expression of "the people's
desire," creating further political confusion.
</P>
<P>
The NLD also stressed that it reserves the right to organize
similar mass rallies to present facts on the current situation in
Myanmar as it is a legal political party.
</P>
<P>
Assistant United Nations (U.N.) Secretary General Alvaro de
Soto, special envoy of the U.N. secretary general, arrived here
Tuesday on his second four-day trip to Myanmar this year to look
into the current political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Alvaro is expected to meet Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, first
secretary of the SPDC, as well as Aung San Suu Kyi, general
secretary of the opposition NLD, during his trip.
</P>
<P>
The authorities' recent allowance of a large number of the NLD
members to return home coincides with Alvaro's visit, observers
here believed.

MANILA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday ordered Armed Forces Chief of Staff Joselin
Nazareno to check the existence of a combat group allegedly using
the name of "Malacanang" (presidential palace) in terrorizing
Muslims in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican told reporters here

any way is "simply ridiculous and malicious."

The alleged "Malacanang Native Combat Force" (MNCF) was
reportedly organized to kill Muslims in Sultan Kudarat and
Maguindanao provinces in Mindanao, the Southern Philippines.
</P>

"President Estrada today ordered Gen. Nazareno to verify and
investigate the existence of the alleged combat group that is
illegally using Malacanang's name -- the Malacanang Native Combat
Force," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
"If this group is really in existence, the president directed
Gen. (Joselin) Nazareno to neutralize it, disarm and arrest the
members, and file the appropriate charges in court," Barican said.

<HEADLINE> Davies Resigns as Welsh Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Welsh Secretary Ron
Davies resigned Tuesday for befriending a male stranger on Clapham
Common who robbed him at knife-point.
</P>
<P>
In a resignation to Prime Minister Tony Blair, Davies said he
had been guilty of a "serious lapse of judgement."
</P>
<P>
Pressure is mounting for him to abandon his position as the
Labor party leader in Welsh.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to hold meetings with party officials over the
next few days and travel back to his constituency later this week
to discuss his political future with local party members.
</P>
<P>
Government ministers are attempting to play down the
embarrassment and mystery over why he resigned as Welsh Secretary
so suddenly.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's official spokesman said that Davies had
been interviewed by the police as a "victim" of a crime.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here believe that the incident was bound to
cause embarrassment as areas of Clapham Common are well known as a
meeting place for homosexuals.

<HEADLINE> More Than 4,000 Ugandan Soldiers Deployed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has deployed a total of
more than 4,000 troops in the eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), Wednesday's Monitor paper reported.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 200,000 armed men on the ground facing off on
both sides, it said.
</P>
<P>
The figure is reported to have been got from independent and
diplomatic sources because many governments continue to deny that
their troops are involved in the three-month-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
When contacted for confirmation, the information office of the
defense ministry told Xinhua Wednesday morning that they are not
in a position to comment on that.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni told a press conference last week
that Uganda has more than two battalions of soldiers in eastern
DRC and promised not to send reinforcements there unless the
situation worsens.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Zimbabwe has 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers
in the DRC while Angola and Namibia deploy 4,000 and 300 soldiers
there respectively.
</P>
<P>
There are 60,000 Tutsi rebels fighting against some 60,000
Kabila ground forces, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
Growing concerns are not gripping more and more countries in
the region and even in the continent with rapid widening of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for an immediate
withdrawal of foreign troops from the DRC and the U.S. government
sent a special envoy to the Great Lakes Region to persuade the
key players in the conflict to stop hostilities.

<HEADLINE> 15 Nigerians Burnt to Death in Oil Tanker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen people have been burnt
to death and more than 30 injured in a petrol tanker incident in
Ibadan, capital of Oyo State in southwest Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Punch newspaper quoted eyewitnesses as saying that a
fully-loaded petrol tanker lost control at the Ojoo round-about
and somersaulted as it was maneuvering the sharp junction around
4.00 p.m. (local time) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in instant spillage of fuel all over the road
and along nearby buildings and shops.
</P>
<P>
Instead of scampering for safety, people in the area rushed to
the scene to collect the petroleum.
</P>
<P>
As they were scooping the petrol, the spillage caught fire and
the ensuing explosion engulfed the area where more than 20 houses
including three buildings were razed to the ground.
</P>
<P>
Only a year ago, the same Ojoo road junction witnessed a
similar disaster in which about 22 people were killed when a fuel
tanker lost control and somersaulted.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Court Rejects Anwar's Habeas Corpus Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's High Court
Wednesday rejected an application for habeas corpus for the
release of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim who is now
at remand in a prison near here.
</P>
<P>
Justice Abdul Wahab Patail ruled there was no merit in pursuing
the application as Anwar is no longer under the Internal Security
Act (ISA) detention.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was detained under the ISA on September 20 following
street protests by his supporters, was released unconditionally on
October 14 and transferred immediately to the Sungai Buloh prison
for remand.
</P>
<P>
The judge made the decision after hearing submissions from
counsel Sulaiman Abdullah, one of Anwar's eight lawyers, and
Senior Federal Counsel Kamaludin Mohamed Said.
</P>
<P>
He said that since Anwar was currently held under remand at the
Sungai Buloh prison by an order of the High Court pending his
trial, it would be wholly wrong, in law and principle, for him to
contest that order.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's trial on four corruption charges is due to start
Monday. He is also facing another corruption charge and five
counts of unnatural sex acts.
</P>
<P>
the judge said whatever grievance Anwar might have, political
or otherwise, is clearly not the subject of a habeas corpus
application. The applicant's proper avenue of redress is by way of
an appeal, and not by this collateral application.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance minister
on September 2.

CANBERRA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
stronger Wednesday as quarterly inflation figures reinforced
market opinion that a Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interest
rate cut was imminent.
</P>
<P>
In another quiet trading day, the local currency ended at 61.70
U.S. cents, up from its close in local trade Tuesday of 61.50 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
The currency traded between 61.55 U.S. cents and 61.85 U.S.
cents during the session.
</P>
<P>
Australian Bureau of Statistics data, released here Wednesday,
showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2 percent for the
September quarter for a rise of 1.3 percent in the year.
</P>
<P>
The annual figure came in below the RBA's targeted range of two
to three percent.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Tuckey, foreign exchange dealer with Macquarie Bank, said
the inflation figures did not stand in the way of a rate cut,
which could come at any time.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have been talking about possible rate cuts by RBA,
Australia's central bank, ever since the United State's Federal
Reserve lowered its interest rates earlier this month in a bid to

"Certainly the CPI figures today emphasized that we can expect
it (a rate cut) anytime from now onwards," Tuckey said.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Commodity Fair Welcomes Private Businesses, Says Trade Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China will encourage more
private enterprises to participate in the biannual Guangzhou
Commodity Fair held in this capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, a senior foreign trade official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Chinese private enterprises will fully use
this 'window' to expand their influence and march toward the
world," said Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of foreign trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation announced that private enterprises will be granted the
right of direct import and export as of January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that with the increased status of private firms in
the national economy, it is inevitable that more room be made for
their development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese private enterprises, beginning with the service sector,
has rapidly expanded into almost every part of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
According to state statistics, China has nearly 30 million
private and individual businesses employing some 70 million people.
</P>
<P>
However, private enterprises still must go through state-owned
foreign trade entities to conduct import and export business, and
most of their products are displayed at the commodity fair under
the names of their agent companies.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Shuakang Co Ltd. is the only private enterprise in the
home electric appliance hall of the ongoing 84th commodity fair.
</P>
<P>
A manager of the company said that exporting through agents,
his company was unable to use its own brand and get feed back,
which is detrimental to upgrading products.
</P>
<P>
Without the right of export, private enterprises must combat
each other in the domestic market, he said, adding that they will
go far in the world market if the restriction is lifted.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wei, a manager with a private company in east China's
Shandong Province, said that better treatment has been given to
private enterprises at this fair, and his company was able to get
three booths this time, in contrast to the half-booth at previous
fairs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Sun Weihua, general manager of the Ningbo Fuda IMP &AMP;
EXP Co., Ltd. said that easing control of import and export may
intensify competition among enterprises, therefore the control
should be lifted, step by step.
</P>
<P>
But such competition is, at the same time, a good thing, as it
will help increase the reputation of Chinese enterprises and their
products on the international market, Sun added.

<HEADLINE> Senior IMF Official Optimistic About Asian Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) told a press conference here
Wednesday that the downturn in a number of crisis economies in
Asia will bottom out in the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
Flemming Larsen, who has been serving as deputy director of
research at the IMF since 1992 and holding senior responsibility
for the IMF's flagship publication of the World Economic Outlook,
said when answering questions that he expects the economic
downturn in Thailand and South Korea will bottom out in the second
quarter of next year and the recovery to be on the way by the
second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong and Singapore, Larsen said given their dependence
on what happens in the region, it is impossible to make assumption
on what will happen, citing what happens in China is very
important for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
But Larsen underlined there is chance that the economy in Hong
Kong will turn around early next year.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director noted a number of favorable developments
have been seen since the beginning of October and these are the
kind of developments and positive actions that are helping to
reduce the risk that the crisis is going to get even worse.
</P>
<P>
"In Asia we have seen very welcome improvement in market
confidence, stabilization in financial market and significant
easing of monetary (situation) in the countries most affected by
the crisis," he said
</P>
<P>
Citing Japan's commitment to addressing the problem of bank
system he billed it as "encouraging news", saying it is not only
crucial for Japan's recovery but also crucial to the recovery of
the entire region.
</P>
<P>
Larsen underlined that the industrialized countries have made
"helpful decisions" to begin "to ease monetary conditions in order
to contract what many have termed global critical crunch."
</P>
<P>
Larsen stressed that people need to be prepared to receive
further bad news in some cases in terms of the performance of weak
economies.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is too soon to conclude that the downturn in the
Asian crisis economies have bottomed out," he noted
</P>
<P>
The picture on the world economy drawn by Larsen now is
brighter than in the advance copy of the World Economic Outlook
completed in September.
</P>
<P>
The assumptions and analysis in the book's preface are
"international economic and financial conditions have been
deteriorated considerably in recent months as recessions have
deepened in many Asian emerging market economies and Japan, and as
Russia' financial crisis has raised the specter of default.
Negative spillovers have been felt in world stock markets,
emerging market interest spreads, acute pressures on several
currencies and further drops in already weak commodity prices."

<HEADLINE> Separate Schools for Rebel Child Members in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
provide separate schools with hostel facilities for the Tamil
rebel child members who surrendered to government troops,
according to a report of the official evening news paper the
Observer Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by President Chandrika Kumaratunga at a
discussion with the Presidential Task Force Committee and
ambassador of several countries here at the Presidential
Secretariat recently, the Observer said.
</P>
<P>
This decision was taken because sending the children to normal
schools could pose a threat to their lives.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has allowed the parents of those who
surrendered to visit them, they are reluctant to do so because of
the threat from the Tamil rebels, the paper quoted Kumaratunga as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a 15-year war for a
separate state in the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Review: Correct Policies Enable Bottoming Out of Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- By the end of the third
quarter, China's gross domestic product (GDP) had registered a
growth of 7.2 percent, a considerable recovery from the 7 percent
mid-year growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Official sources predict that the GDP will realize a further
rise in the last quarter, and that China's 8 percent GDP growth
target for the whole year is still attainable.
</P>
<P>
Many noted economists in Beijing hold the view that, while
neighboring countries are suffering from negative growth due to
the serious consequences of the Asian financial crisis, China's
economy remains stable, and has shown signs of bottoming out in
the second half of this year. This has been attributed mainly to
the correct macroeconomic policies implemented by China this year.
</P>
<P>
In line with the economic growth target and current economic
conditions, the Chinese government formulated a series of policies
for expanding investment and domestic demand and encouraging
export, which have been earnestly carried out throughout the
country since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
In January, the central bank lifted the ceiling on commercial
bank loans, enabling the banks to increase loans. By the end of
September, the outstanding amount of loans by financial
institutions exceeded 8.26 trillion yuan, up 16 percent from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The fact that a large part of the increased loans are medium-
and long-term loans indicates that the country's macroeconomic
policies of increasing infrastructure investment and expanding
domestic demand through credit are becoming apparent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank lowered interest rates for deposit and loans
twice earlier this year, and appropriately increased the money
supply. By the end of September the outstanding amount of money
in circulation and broad money rose 11.7 percent and 16 percent,
respectively, from the same 1997 period. Adjusting for price
factors, the actual growth of the money supply is 3 percentage
points higher.
</P>
<P>
In September, the Ministry of Finance announced the issuance of
100 billion yuan (12 billion US dollars) in special treasury
bonds, revenues from which will be used for infrastructure
construction. This step was taken to stimulate individual
consumption and enterprise investment and indirectly increase
demand in society at large.

<P>
Commercial banks have also allocated more than 100 billion yuan
to facilitate this move. Economists believe that this 200 billion
yuan total will contribute 2 percentage points to GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese government has been rectifying various
charges to ease the burden on enterprises so that can retain more
working capital. At the same time, new policies have been issued
to increase export tax rebates for some industries and accelerate
the proceeding of tax rebates for export goods in an effort to
support export growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, after a slow period, these financial and
fiscal policies have gradually become effective. Industrial
production has had faster growth, with industrial added value up
8.6 percent in the third quarter from the same period last year,
in September this figure reaching 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Accelerated investment in fixed assets became a major
economic-growth factor. In the first nine months the amount of
investment in fixed assets reached 1.09 trillion yuan, up 20
percent from the same period last year, with most of the money put
into basic industries and new, high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Domestic market sales have been gradually recovering. In the
third quarter the sales volume of consumer goods rose seven
percent from the same quarter last year, one percentage point
higher than the growth in the first half of this year; foreign
trade continued to grow, with a trade surplus of 35.3 billion
U.S. dollars in the first nine months; while foreign direct
investment reached 31.4 billion U.S. dollars, equaling that of the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Financial Institute under the State Council's
Development and Research Center, Wei Jia'ning , said, "Facing
complicated international and domestic economic conditions,
China's economy still maintained a steady and fast growth, this in
itself is a great success."
</P>
<P>
When analyzing general economic situation, a group of noted
economists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences regarded
the third quarter of this year as a turning point for China's
economy, with the GDP beginning to bottom out and a new growth
period approaching.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wei, vice-president of the Institute of Economics at
Beijing University, said China's economy will go on improving next
year, and the GDP growth is expected to exceed this year's 8
percent goal.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Can Pay Off Foreign Debts in Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, the first of China's
five special economic zones, will pay off 6.25 billion
U.S. dollars of its foreign debt, dispelling doubts about its
debt-paying ability.
</P>
<P>
Of the 6.25 billion dollars, 5.3 billion was borrowed by
overseas-funded businesses, and of the city's total debt, only
25.6 percent is short-term debt, said Li Zibin, the mayor of
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that Shenzhen will pay off over 1.9 billion
dollars of debt due this year and has already paid 1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
"Shenzhen can definitely pay off its debt," said Li, "we won't
delay by even one day."
</P>
<P>
He also said Shenzhen will not only pay off its debts in time,
but will not need to borrow much from foreigners in the
foreseeable future because Shenzhen has ample funds.
</P>
<P>
To show how strong Shenzhen's economy is, the mayor said that
despite the harm done by the southeast Asian financial crisis, the
Shenzhen economy has been growing at a fast, continuous and
healthy pace.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of this year, Shenzhen completed a
GDP of 29.46 billion yuan, representing a rise of 14.3 percent
over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The mayor stressed that in China's ongoing reform and opening
up process, Shenzhen's status and function will not weaken, but
grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
"It will continue to function as the experimental ground in
China's transition to the socialist market economy from the
planned economy, and it shoulders a heavier task," said the mayor.

<HEADLINE> Angola Repeals UNITA Leader's Special Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The National Assembly of the
Republic of Angola has repealed the law granting special legal
and ritual status for the opposition UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The assembly adopted a resolution on the law Tuesday after it
resumed a sitting.
</P>
<P>
The law had offered a special legal status to President
Savimbi of the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
According to the law, Savimbi was guaranteed the rights to
engage in the state political activities across the country and
the immunity and other rights as enjoyed by the elected state
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the law had been repealed because
Savimbi's behavior "has done harm to the state security, the
integrity of the national territory and the principle and values
of democracy."
</P>
<P>
"The UNITA leader has taken a stance going against the spirit
and content of the (1994) Lusaka Peace Accord, continuously causing
numerous casualties and material losses," it added.
</P>
<P>
Majority leader of the ruling People's Movement for the
Liberation of Angola (MPLA) in the national congress, Joao
Luorenco, pointed out that the repeal does not "violate the
Lusaka Peace Accord because we did not announce UNITA as
illegal."
</P>
<P>
Luorenco stressed that the Angolan government led by President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos will continue working with the UNITA
Renovation Committee which is committed to peace to implement all
stipulated in the peace protocol.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government regarded the committee as the sole
dialogist in the Angolan peace process. The breakaway group was
established in early September by the dissident UNITA members
against Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on repealing Savimbi's special status was
passed with 115 votes for, non against and 61 abstentions. Seven
UNITA members voted for the repeal. Most of the UNITA MPs and
MPs from the Angolan National Liberation Front (ANLF) had
abstained. After the vote counting, ANLF said in a statement
that the party had abstained to show "the spirit of unity and
consensus."
</P>
<P>
After the national congress of the UNITA Renovation Committee,
17 of the 70 UNITA MPs, who had been close to Savimbi, were
suspended and two were augmented.
</P>
<P>
There are 223 seats in the Angolan national assembly and the
ruling MPLA holds 129.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lusaka accord signed by the two warring sides
in 1994, the president of the UNITA enjoys a special status in
the Angolan politics. Therefore, the Angolan parliament passed a
law on April 8, 1997, establishing the status of Savimbi as the
leader of the largest opposition party in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the UNITA leader could freely engage in political
activities nationwide and had the rights to exchange with the
Angolan president information and views on the state politics.
</P>
<P>
In ceremonious functions, Savimbi was ranked as the second
among the party leaders holding seats in the national assembly.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Youth Find Spouses In More Open Ways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Many Chinese youth are now
utilizing television and the Internet to find their spouses.
</P>
<P>
Several cities including Zhengzhou, capital of central China's
Henan Province, Shanghai, and Beijing have TV programs on love and
invite young people to participate. These shows are becoming more
popular all the time.
</P>
<P>
This may appear strange and hard to accept for older Chinese
for whom the choice of a spouse was considered a private matter,
and most of them found their partners through matchmakers when
they were young.
</P>
<P>
Now, things have changed completely. Young people can choose
their life-long partner on their own and don't feel shy or uneasy
when expressing their views on love and marriage and their
requirements for a future spouse. They appear on TV and talk about
love in a natural manner in front of millions in the TV audience.
</P>
<P>
"To express love openly may be better and make it more likely
you'll find the person you love," said Ma Jianfeng, an
advertisement planner who once participated on such a TV program.
</P>
<P>
On the Beijing TV show "We Meet Here Tonight" the participants
bring video tapes about their daily lives as a kind of
advertisement to help them find a mate.
</P>
<P>
Young people also make use of the Internet in their search.
</P>
<P>
One survey revealed that more than 60 percent of the young
people in Shanghai think they lack the opportunity to meet people
in other fields, and over 80 percent are confused about marriage
and love. Some experts point out that these new variety of ways to
find a spouse is the solution to such problems.

<HEADLINE> Egyptians' Entrance into Jordan to be Curbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Jordan signed an
agreement here late Tuesday to curb the entrance of Egyptians
into the kingdom at a time when the government strictly regulates
the foreign labor market.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by Secretary General of the
Jordanian Ministry of Labor Saleh Tarawneh and Undersecretary of
the Egyptian Ministry of Labor Ahmad Khalaf, Egypt will not allow
any Egyptian worker to enter Jordan without a contract
authenticated by Jordanian and Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also stipulates that any Egyptian who wishes to
visit a relative in Jordan must carry a round-trip ticket together
with at least 150 U.S. dollars in cash.
</P>
<P>
Any Egyptian traveler coming to Jordan en route another Gulf
country must have a visa for the destination country or hold valid
residency in the destination country, according to the accord.
</P>
<P>
Young professional Egyptians are not allowed to travel to
Jordan for tourism.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 to 500,000 foreign workers now live in Jordan, of
whom some 90 percent are Egyptians. Many Egyptians entered
Jordan on excuses of visiting relatives or traveling. The majority
of them do not have valid work permits.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government ordered the illegal Egyptian
workers either to leave the kingdom or to apply for work
permits. The deadline was extended three times, but most of them
refused to cooperate and the problem has still remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this month, the government imposed new
measures to regulate the foreign labor market. Foreign workers,
including Egyptians, without valid work permits were given one
month to rectify their status. Otherwise, they will be fined
heavily and deported.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Police Arrest More Suspected Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine police scored anew
against kidnap-for-ransom gangs with the arrest of nine more
suspected kidnappers and the rescue of six kidnapped victims in
two separate operations in Metro Manila Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Chief Superintendent Panfilo M. Lacson, head of the
Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF), presented
Wednesday before the media the arrested suspects in Camp Crame,
Manila.
</P>
<P>
He immediately telephoned President Joseph Estrada to report on
the arrest of the nine suspected kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada congratulated Lacson and members of the task
force for a job well done, according to the official Philippine
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Their arrest brought to 19 the number of suspected members of
kidnap-for-ransom syndicates captured in the past five days.
</P>
<P>
Rescued by the task force were four kids from one family, their
housemaid and their driver.
</P>
<P>
They were kidnapped last Monday in the vicinity of Villalobos
Hospital in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Last week the task force smashed the so-called "50 Million
Gang" which was responsible for at least 15 kidnapping incidents
in Manila, including the kidnap-slaying of businessman Willyson
Lim Ong.
</P>
<P>
Ten members of the syndicates were arrested by the task force
in one of the most successful operations against kidnap-for-ransom
gangs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The gang had raked in more than 126 million pesos (3 million
U.S. dollars) in ransom payoff.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Growth Rate Estimated at 6 Percent: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai said Wednesday that the national economy continues to
make comprehensive development with an estimated growth rate of
six percent and essentially remains stable on the macro level.
</P>
<P>
Khai made this announcement in a government report delivered to
the National Assembly which opened Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister admitted that Vietnam faced serious
consequences in 1998 due to prolonged natural calamities
nationwide and the regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said, in spite of serious losses caused by natural
calamities, agricultural production increased by about two
percent. food production reached 31.3 million tons, bringing per
capita food average to more than 400 kg a year, fulfilling the
target set for year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production, despite being effected by the regional
crisis, still maintained a growth rate of about 11 percent.
Services, despite reduction in some sections, climbed six percent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the drop in world prices of many important
export items of Vietnam including crude oil, coal, rubber, tea,
peanuts, garments and footwear, their export value this year is
equal to last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that budget deficit has been kept at
4.2 percent of GDP in 1997 and 3.6 percent this year, the level
permitted by the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister concluded that in general, in 1998 the
national economy continued to grow, people's lives were stable,
culture and social welfare continued to develop, and political
and social stability was maintained and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Khai pointed out weaknesses and unfavorable
involvement which is obstructing or even threatening the country's
socio-economic stability and development.
</P>
<P>
These included a drop of more than 30 percent of the economic
growth rate as compared to the average growth rate of the two
previous years, the narrowing of investment for development and
production in the fields of export, foreign investment and
services for foreigners, difficulties in maintaining balance of
macro-economy, particularly balance of state budget, and
increasing unemployment, the prime minister said.

TOKYO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell for the fourth
consecutive trading day in Tokyo Wednesday on worries over poor
midterm corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 304.61 points, or 2.20
percent, from Tuesday's close at 13,516.07.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 14.37 points or 1.38 percent to

</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section remained low at about 306 million

<P>
Ishikawa Seisakusho, a textile machine maker, was the day's
most heavily traded issue.

<P>
The Nikkei index surged at the start, gaining 100 points on
what traders said was due to a huge one-time purchase of various

major firms unveiling dismal financial figures for the
April-September fiscal half-year, traders said.

outnumbered gainers by 740 to 337, with 187 issues unchanged.

MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor

environment for resolution of the country's domestic problems and
the defense of Russia's international status as the priorities in
its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Moscow-based daily Izvestia, Ivanov

want to fuel international conflicts or strive for local interests
out of those conflicts.
</P>
<P>
However, Ivanov added, Moscow would not allow it to be excluded
from settling problems involving Russian strategic interests.

"The Balkans have always been a zone of special strategic
interests for Russia," Ivanov said. "It is stability and a
peaceful solution to the problem that meet our interests."

He said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had no
right to use force in Kosovo without U.N. consent.

<HEADLINE> 4 Palestinians Convicted of Raiding Fatah Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Four Palestinians in the
military intelligence have been convicted by a Palestinian court
of raiding the Fatah's headquarters, which sparked clashes in
Palestinian areas claiming one life.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Wednesday that one person was sentenced
to four years in jail and the others were given three years each
by a military court in the West Bank town of Jericho.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the Fatah, the movement led by Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, were raided
early Sunday. Reports said the military intelligence forces were
searching for illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Fatah supporters demonstrated in the West Bank city
of Ramallah Sunday to protest the raid and clashed with
Palestinian security forces, who opened fire and killed an
18-year-old protester.
</P>
<P>
The shooting has triggered three days of demonstrations in many
Palestinian-controlled areas in the West Bank and a general
strike in Ramallah. Arafat has ordered an investigation.
</P>
<P>
Top officials in the Palestinian military intelligence have
denied that their forces were responsible for the killing, radio
reports said. Senior Palestinian prosecutors said they were
conducting an investigation into who fired the shots and
expected to bring the case into trial within the next two days.
</P>
<P>
Under the land-for-peace deal Arafat signed with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last week, the PNA
will take concrete measures to fight terrorism, including the
confiscation of illegal weapons.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Santer Visit Will Promote China-EU Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming visit by Jacques
Santer, president of the European Commission, is expected to
inject new vitality into the growth momentum in China-EU relation.
</P>
<P>
Santer, set to visit China between October 29 and November 3 at
the invitation of the Chinese Government, will lead a delegation
which will include Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European
Commission (EC) and executives from major European companies.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted that the first visit by an EU president
in 12 years will undoubtedly be of great significance and promote
friendly China-EU relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Extensive efforts on the part of both sides have yielded major
progress in China-EU relations over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The highly successful China-EU Summit, the first of its kind
was in London in April, ended with a joint statement calling for
setting up a long-term stable and constructive China-EU
partnership geared to the 21st century. The move represented the
common aspiration of the people in China and the 15 nations in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, relations have remained stable in spite of
a few minor hitches since China and the EC forged diplomatic ties
some 23 years ago. Frequent high-level exchanges and increasing
political dialog on different levels have significantly improved
and strengthened bilateral relations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also expanded exchanges and cooperation in
the economic and trade arena, as well as science and technology,
culture and education.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Chinese Customs show that the bilateral
trade volume for 1997 topped 43 billion US dollars, up 8.35
percent on the previous year and some 17 times the level when the
two sides established diplomatic relations in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade volume between January and September this
year stood at 33.89 billion US dollars, up 16.6 percent on the
same 1997 period. The EU is currently China's fourth largest trade
partner.
</P>
<P>
China had imported 6,864 technological items from the EU by the
end of last year, with the contract value for related items
standing at 38 billion US dollars. Related items accounted for
44.9 percent of China's total technology imports.

<P>
The EU and financial institutions in its member nations have
granted China loans of approximately 12.8 billions US dollars, or
41.9 percent of total government loans.
</P>
<P>
The EU has adopted a set of positive measures this year to
improve and strengthen its ties with China. For example, the
Council of EU Foreign Ministers met in February and decided that
the the EU president and member nations will refrain from
cosponsoring human rights resolutions against China.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to China last February, Brittan said the
European Union will "pursue sensitive and highly important (human
rights) issues through dialog" and is fully prepared to avoid
unnecessary confrontations.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the EU decided to adjust its anti-dumping
policy against China and removed the nation from the list of
nonmarket economy nations.
</P>
<P>
The June ministers council endorsed the new document calling
for the establishment of a full-fledged partnership with
China. The move was designed to improve China-EU relations and
promote political dialog, economic and trade cooperation and
increase investment, as well as to accelerate China's entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
On October 5, the EU announced a decision not to levy
anti-dumping duties on unbleached cotton imported from five
countries, including China.
</P>
<P>
China welcomed and appreciated the EU decisions and continues
to follow a foreign policy based on developing stable and mutually
beneficial cooperative relations with the EU and member nations.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening the cooperation between China and the EU, two
major forces in the increasingly multipolarized world and
globalized economy, will not only be in the fundamental interest
of both parties, but will also promote cooperation between Asia
and Europe, and contribute to the peace, stability and prosperity
of the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
People have every reason to believe that President Santer's
visit will turn a new page in the growth of China-EU relations.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Jointly Organize International Symposium on IPR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Intellectual property rights
will become the most important and essential production factor
and will play a more decisive role in the development of the world
economy, China's top IPR official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The practice of many countries has repeatedly proved, and will
continue to prove, that the patent system and the intellectual
property system in general are a most important mechanism," said
Jiang Ying, Commissioner of the State Intellectual Property Office
(SIPO).
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at the opening of an international IPR
symposium on "The Protection of Intellectual Property for the 21st
Century" jointly organized by the China Intellectual Property
Society (CIPS) and the American Intellectual Property Law
Association (AIPLA).
</P>
<P>
"The mechanism not only promotes the creation, spread and use
of knowledge, but also effectively protects the newest
intellectual achievements of mankind," she said.
</P>
<P>
"For the purpose of keeping pace with the trend of IPR
protection in the 21st century, and in order to conform to the
development of the intellectual-property economy, we must keep
learning and monitoring the newest trend of international IPR
protection, and earnestly researching new issues arising in new
technical fields," she said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kirk, AIPLA's executive director, said the patent
system has been developing for more than 200 years in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Although China adopted such a system only two decades ago, it
has established a set of fairly good laws and regulations, said
Kirk, a former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and
former Deputy Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks.
</P>
<P>
All countries throughout the world should learn from each other
and reach mutual understanding and confidence for the common goal,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last ten years, China has formulated and put into
effect trademark laws, patent and copyright laws and fair
competition laws. In addition, a set of intellectual property
regulations has also been enacted including Regulations on the
Protection of Computer Software and Regulations on New Plant
Varieties.
</P>
<P>
China joined the World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO) in 1980 and subsequently acceded to international
conventions on IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
Some 180 delegates from around the world are attending the
three-day symposium.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Companies in Malaysia are
expected to have better performance with their gross revenue
increasing by 3.8 percent in the second half of 1998, according to
a business expectations survey.
</P>
<P>
Some 270 limited companies covered in the survey estimated a
total gross revenue of 125.8737 billion ringgit (33.124 billion
U.S. dollars) for the second half of 1998, representing an
increase of 3.8 percent from the 121.2087 billion ringgit (31.897
billion U.S. dollars) achieved in the first half, the Department
of Statistics said in its monthly report released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said 120 companies, accounting for 51 percent of the total
gross revenue in the first half of 1998, expect to operate at a
higher level in the second half, 103 companies, accounting for
29.8 percent of the revenue in first half, will operate below the
past level while the remaining 47 companies will continue to
operate at the same level as before.
</P>
<P>
Of the 13 sectors covered, 10 sectors are optimistic of better
days ahead, projecting increases in their gross revenue, while the

<HEADLINE> China Works to Increase Building Materials Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China is working diligently to
set up foreign markets for ceramics and plate glass in order to
reverse the decline in building materials exports sparked by the
financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
A official with the State Administration of Building Materials
said that related exports, mainly cement, to southeast Asian
nations have dropped sharply during 1998. He called on departments
and enterprises to explore world markets and focus quality control.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that building materials firms should
extend great effort to protect their market share in southeast
Asia, and should at the same time develop new markets in the
Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
China's ceramics industry, which has a longstanding history,
has experienced rapid growth and currently produces some 10
billion units annually, or about 60 percent of the world's total
production for related products.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ceramics are exported to some 150 countries and
regions, with annual earning from exports hitting 1.9 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, major producers should accelerate technological
renovations to reduce pollution, cut energy consumption and both
processing and quality in order to increase the export potential
for ceramics, the official said.

<HEADLINE> FUNCINPEC, CPP Should Join Hands Without Delay, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The FUNCINPEC and the
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) should join hands without further
delay to sit down to resolve the basic problems of sharing power
for the sake of the country and the people, Chea Sim, president of
the ruling CPP, appealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by his cabinet Wednesday, Chea Sim
said, "The two parties are the key holders to the current
political deadlock and the nucleus of national reconciliation,
political stability and national development."
</P>
<P>
"So we must sit down at the negotiation table and resolve the
basic problems of sharing power, of operating the National
Assembly and of distributing responsibilities in the new royal
coalition government," he added.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in response to the recent criticisms by
certain politicians, political parties, local and international
news media and certain rights organizations, who accused the CPP's
refusal to make concession to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim asserted the election was conducted within the
framework of the constitution, the electoral law, the party law
and other laws in force in the nation, and also the election had
the Constitutional Council and local and international observer
teams as arbitrator, so the results of the election reflected the
will of the people.
</P>
<P>
"The CPP obviously cannot make any legal concession in order to
alter the results," he reiterated. "The July 26 election gave the
CPP 64 seats, the FUNCINPEC 43 seats, and the Sam Rainsy Party
(SRP) 15 seats. This was the final result. Even if more demands
were filed, or any kind of concession was made by the CPP, still
there would have no influence to exert any change."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chea Sim said the CPP is prepared to make
appropriate concession to the FUNCINPEC, a partner in the royal
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the CPP nurses no ambition for exclusive power,
but wants to see the establishment of a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the dark shadow of the past must be erased. This
shadow must be replaced by the new page of cooperation and
understanding based on the constitution and other laws and the
advancement of the national interests.
</P>
<P>
The FUNCINPEC and the CPP should face realities by responding
in concrete action to the trust and confidence of the people who
have elected them to public offices and lead the nation into the
21st century, Chea Sim said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the two opposition political parties, the FUNCINPEC and
the SRP, and their leaders Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy still
rejected to join the government, insisting the CPP won the
election through fraud and intimidation.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Has Potentials to Emerge as Major Ceramic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has the potentials to
become one of the major ceramic exporting countries, provided
integrated institutional and individual efforts are made to
rejuvenate the sector.
</P>
<P>
This view was expressed by speakers at a day-long seminar on
"Design and Attractive Packaging of Ceramic Goods for Japanese
Market" jointly organized by the Japan External Trade Organization
(JETRO) and The Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) of Bangladesh here
Tuesday, The Daily Star newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has a vast potential market, but most of its ceramic
industries are still far from the international standard in
producing quality goods, speakers pointed out, suggesting adoption
of sophisticated techniques like quality control, timely shipment,
excellent design and attractive packaging.
</P>
<P>
"Availability of the main basic ingredients for ceramic
products like moist clay and cheap labor force add to the
competitive advantages of the country over other countries," they
observed.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the biggest donor for Bangladesh, can be one of the
latter's largest importers by raising the quality of ceramic
products through transferring technology as well as knowledge to
Bangladeshi entrepreneurs, EPB Vice Chairman Anwarul Bar Chowdhury
said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Japan would help arrange a single country fair in
Tokyo in March next year to promote Bangladeshi products to the
Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
JETRO's representative in Bangladesh Yichi Bamba said that his
organization has taken a long-term program for the development of
the sector since Bangladesh's ceramic products have a bright
prospect for the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
He assured that his organization which runs under the Japanese
Ministry of International Trade and Industry would continue its
endeavors for the development of various sectors in Bangladesh,
especially garments and ceramics to increase export from
Bangladesh to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh earned over 492.5 million taka (10.2 million U.S.
dollars) during the last fiscal year (July 1997-June 1998) by
exporting ceramic goods to about 30 European countries and the
United States of America. At present, six ceramic industries are
exporting their products according to the official statistics.

<HEADLINE> India's Nuclear Submarine Project Yet to Take Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Despite investments of 20
billion rupees (500 million U.S. dollars) over the past 15 years,
India's nuclear submarine program is yet to take off, a national
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The design of the submarine, called as advanced technology
vehicle, has not been frozen and the submarine's keel has not been
laid, according to the Hindustan Times.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted highly-placed sources as saying that the Naval
Headquarters, concerned at the slow pace of the vehicle, has
proposed a "technical audit" of the project to assess whether the
progress thus far justified the phenomenal expenditure on it.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money for the project is believed to have been
spent on obtaining design drawings from abroad, civilian
construction work, establishing test beds, procuring related
equipment and overseas visits of key personnel.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that a substantial amount of the money has been
spent on translation of design from Russian to English and a large
number of trips made by Defense Ministry and service officials to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The design and development of the nuclear submarine, a joint
project of the Department of Atomic Energy, Defense Research and
Development Organization and the Indian Navy, was started some 15
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Defense analysts here said the availability of a nuclear
submarine has a significant bearing on India's decision to acquire
a minimum nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
The project, which received focused attention in the early
1980s by the late prime minister Indira Gandhi, revolved around
the construction of a titanium hull and a nuclear reactor to
propel it.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of the Chakre, a Soviet origin Charlie-I class
nuclear submarine, by India on a three-year lease in January 1988,
is understood to have provided useful inputs both to the project
design and training of personnel.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Pudong New Area Exports More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area of
Shanghai reported a total export of commodities worth 3.413
billion U.S. dollars from January to September, up 19 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Sources at a recent meeting on Pudong's foreign trade said that
the New Area's exports in the first three quarter of this year
made up 28 percent of Shanghai's total, compared with 19.8 percent
in 1994 and 26 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Pudong's exports are expected to continue to climb in the
coming months despite the adverse impact of the Asian financial
crisis, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade specialists attribute Pudong's growing exports to
a strong contingent of foreign trade teams, the strategy of
expanding diversified export markets, and efforts to improve the
technological content of export commodities and promote
technological and service trades in addition to trade in kind.
</P>
<P>
Pudong is now home to over 300 professional foreign trade
companies, more than 100 manufacturing enterprises with autonomy
to import and export independently, and more than 5,000
overseas-financed businesses. It also has three overseas-backed
foreign trade companies and 100 foreign-trade subsidiaries opened
by other Chinese foreign-trade companies outside Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Since the Asian financial crisis began in July last year,
Pudong has redoubled efforts to export to Japan and maintain its
export share to Europe and the United States while making
painstaking efforts to explore new markets in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Pudong now exports more than 20 categories of commodities with
30,000 specifications to 130 countries and regions, and has an
in-place worldwide export network.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Bohai Sea Oil Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shengli Oil Field, China's
second largest oil reserve, has recorded a major breakthrough in
oil exploration with development of the Chengdao deposit in the
Bohai Sea off the nation's east coast.
</P>
<P>
The new oil field has an annual output capacity of 1.05 million
tons and is the largest offshore oil deposit in the Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
An official from the China National Petrochemical Corp
(Sinopec) said the geological structure in the area complicated
the exploration process. Shengli used a vast array of advanced
onshore oil development to tap the Chengdao field, including 3-D
seismic surveys and oil reserve tracking technology.
</P>
<P>
The oil field said that it can produce 2.12 million tons of oil
and 367 million cubic meters of gas a year in the Bohai area.
</P>
<P>
Industry officials expect even greater progress in oil and gas
exploration in the Bohai area, with reserves to be proven
estimated at 60 million tons of and over 10 billion cubic meters
of gas this year.

<HEADLINE> Terracotta Warriors in Red, Green 2,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Most of the terracotta warriors
and horses inspected by U.S. President Bill Clinton in Shaanxi
Province when he was visiting China months ago were grey, the
color of clay. But archaeologists say they were mainly red and
green more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The terracotta figurines of the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC) were
decorated in red, green, blue, yellow, purple and brown, Liu
Zhancheng, an archaeologist at the Museum of Terracotta Warriors
and Horses in Shaanxi Province, northwest China, said today.
</P>
<P>
"The clothes of the terracotta warriors were mainly red and
green, but the colors have peeled off," he said.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists studied the little color remaining on the
figurines when they were unearthed, and 43 percent of the clay
warriors were in green robes, 32 percent were in red robes; about
52 percent were wearing green trousers and 18 percent red trousers.
</P>
<P>
Liu explained that red, the color of blood and fire, represents
strength, status and firmness, while green symbolizes vigor and
fertility.
</P>
<P>
"The artists of the Qin Dynasty gave life to the clay warriors
with color," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The terracotta warriors and horses were discovered in Lintong
County of Shaanxi Province in 1974. Since then, more than 100
chariots, 600 clay horses, 8,000 clay warriors and a large number
of ancient weapons have been unearthed in three huge pits.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A house to house campaign
was launched Wednesday to advise householders in Wellington,
Capital of New Zealand, how to avoid being the target of an
arsonist and minimize danger to property.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, a spate of suspicious fires were found in
central Wellington. Although the fires, which were deliberately
lit outside occupied houses and churches, caused minor damage, the
local police fear a serial arsonist, or arsonists, is targeting
inner city buildings.
</P>
<P>
Detective Senior Sergeant Ron Chatt of Wellington was quoted as
 saying Wednesday that up to now no firm suspects have been
identified as connected to the fire.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at past arsonists," he said. The fires were
definitely suspicious and deliberately lit, and though one person
could be responsible, he was not ruling out the possibility there
was more than one person.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, most of the latest suspicious
fires were lit between midnight and 2 a.m., when occupants were
sleeping inside.
</P>
<P>
Through the media, local police and fire service urged
households to fit smoke alarms, plan escape routes, lock garages,
basements and sheds and leave no rubbish laying outside. Kits
would be also delivered in the areas of potential risk.
</P>
<P>

The NZPA quoted local investigators as saying that the fires
were deliberately lit and there were at least two arsonists.

</P>
<P>
Primakov said that Russia is trying to establish a market
economy and, "We don't want a monetarism which is not supported by
the people."
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the European Reconstruction and Development
Bank would provide Russia with assistance.
</P>
<P>
Primakov was in Austria for the Russian-EU summit on behalf of
ailing Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who cancelled his plan on
Monday to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Klima, whose country holds the current rotating EU presidency,
hopes that Russia will speed up its economic reform and pay
foreign loans, saying an immediate implementation of the reform
program is a prerequisite for re-building investor confidence in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Klima, the Russian-EU Coordination Commission will
meet in Moscow in December to discuss bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Primakov, Austrian President Thomas
Klestil said that as a partner, Russia plays a pivotal role in
maintaining the stability and security in Europe.
</P>

here by Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel and his
Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov, to replace the one signed in

<HEADLINE> Central Bank: S.Korean Economy to Recover Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's economy will begin
a slow recovery next year with improvement in consumption and
investment, the Bank of Korea said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the global economic growth will slow down due to the
Asian economic crisis, sluggish economic growth in the United
States and the gradual weakening of Japan's yen against the
greenback in 1999, South Korea's economy will recover slowly from
next year, said the bank in a report to the National Assembly, or
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said once the government-sponsored economic
reforms come to an end next year, consumption and investment will
pick up, credit crunch will be eased gradually and the whole
economy will improve.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank said, South Korea will maintain a surplus
in its current account balance for a while but the black figures
will decline as exports will continue slow-paced in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the central bank also said the inflation rate of
this year will be near eight percent while consumer prices will
rise eight percent by the end of this year, close to the initial
forecast of nine percent because of stabilized foreign exchange
rate and prices.
</P>
<P>
Since being gripped by the financial crisis caused by corporate
bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions late last
year, South Korea's economy has plunged into a deep recession as
the gross domestic product and domestic consumption contracted
sharply in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy slumped 6.4 percent in the first half of
this year while the GNP contracted five percent and 7.6 percent in
the first and second quarters respectively, the worst setback
after the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that the economy will deteriorate in the
second half of this year as there is no sign of improvement.

<TEXT>
<P>
After she ran away from home for one week and sued her
parents, Moceanu's parents agreed to let her to be a legal adult
to handle her own financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
David Gray, an attorney with the law office representing
Moceanu, said her parents have dropped their resistance to having
her declared a legal adult and that an agreement would be
presented Wednesday to a family court judge.
</P>
<P>
"Her legal disabilities as a minor will be removed," Gray said.
</P>
<P>
Moceanu and her parents made a statement, saying: "The parties
have met amongst themselves and as a family unit have resolved
their differences. It is anticipate that an agreement will be
submitted to Judge John Montgomery for approval."
</P>
<P>
The announcement achieved after the both sides met Tuesday in
their first meetings since she left home and filed a lawsuit
demanding to be declared a legal adult so she could get answers
about how her earnings are being spent.
</P>
<P>
Moceanu believed her father, Dumitru Moceanu, had squandered
much of the money to build a gymnasium in the Houston suburb.
</P>
<P>
According to Yarrell, the trust is structured so that Moceanu
won't gain control over the assets until she turns 35. But if the
Moceanus' parental rights are severed, she might be able to gain
access to the funds early, Yarell said.

<HEADLINE> 31 Injured in Student Soccer Fans Brawl in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rampaging crowd also vandalized the Mandala Krida Stadium,
the venue of the match pitting teams from the Indonesian Islamic
University and Janabadra University.
</P>
<P>
They burned a section reserved for the press, broke glass
doors leading to the VIP room and destroyed a mini studio
belonging to the state radio station RRI, the Jakarta Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted witnesses as saying that the animosity was
noticeable before the semifinal match of the tournament held by
Janabadra University was about to begin. Students of the two
local private universities started to throw objects at each
other, but calmed down after representatives of the two sides met
and agreed to hold a peaceful game.
</P>
<P>
But the truce lasted only 90 minutes. Shortly after referee
Hendro Kardiono blew the final whistle, Janabadra University
supporters rushed over to where the opposition supporters were
celebrating after the game was decided 1-0 by a controversial
penalty.
</P>
<P>
The penalty decision prompted protests from the Janabadra
players, but Hendro stood his ground.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening, tension still gripped the main campuses of
the two university. Dozens of students from each university were
on alert, with some arming themselves with iron bars.
</P>
<P>
Fearing revenge by the Indonesian Islamic University students,
dozens of police blockade the Janabadra University compound
throughout the day on Tuesday. But no fresh clashes were
reported.

MEXICO CITY, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Experts said on Tuesday
more than one billion people worldwide have suffered from stomach
infections, while five million children die each year due to
non-potable water.
</P>
<P>
On the second day of a meeting on rainwater collection in
Mexico, Manuel Anaya said that 30,000 people died of diarrhea
every day.
</P>
<P>
Anaya said the total fresh water reserves all over the earth
amounted to 35 million cubic kilometers, accounting only for three
percent of the total 1.3 billion cubic kilometers of water.
</P>
<P>
However, the fresh water demand worldwide will reach 7,000
cubic kilometers in 2000 so that a new technology will have to be
used to meet the requirement, Anaya said.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 countries are suffering from droughts and over one
billion people have insufficient access to water and food, he said.

<HEADLINE> Fiat's Chief Expects Lower Profits for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Warnings from Italy's biggest
car-maker Fiat that its end-of-year profits could be lower than
the previous year were confirmed Tuesday by the company honorary
chairman Gianni Agnelli.
</P>
<P>
"Fiat's second half will be worse than the first half,"
Agnelli told reporters. The Fiat group's accounts were "good but
not excellent" and a board meeting would be held at the end
of 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
In September, Fiat reported first-half sales up 8 percent but
warned that profits were expected to drop for the whole year of
1998, partly due to a fall-off in sales in crisis-stricken Brazil,
where Fiat sells 20 percent of its cars.
</P>
<P>
After four years of steady annual growth of four to five
percent, the Brazilian auto market is now in dire straits, with
sales down 45 percent so far this year over the same period of
1997.
</P>
<P>
This week, Fiat was forced to suspend production in its
Brazilian factories in order to limit the inventory of unsellable
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In Italy, the end of government sales-promoting incentives in
July has also knocked a significant dent in Fiat profits.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1998, Fiat's pre-tax profits plunged
11.6 percent, from 2.26 trillion Italy lire (some 1.378 billion
U. S. dollars) to 2 trillion lire (about 1.2 billion dollars),
which was coupled with a fall in the operating profits.
</P>
<P>
Another sign of problems ahead was the fact that productivity
in industrial activities dipped from 4.4 percent in the first half
of 1997 to 3.3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Revenues for the year are now expected to reach 90-92 trillion
lire (54.9-56.1 billion dollars) instead of 94 trillion lire (57.3
billion dollars) and profits are expected to fall below the 2.46
trillion lire (1.5 billion dollars) recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the managing director of Deutsche Bank Fondi, Mario
Noera, said Tuesday that, sooner or later, Fiat would have to give
in to the growing trend towards consolidation in the automobile
industry.
</P>
<P>
The mega-merger between Germany's Daimler Benz and the American
giant Chrysler had paved the way and the survival of car companies
in the future would depend on their ability to form global
alliances.
</P>
<P>
Fiat's new chairman, Paolo Fresco, stuck to the company line of
no international alliances when unveiling the firm's 1998-2002
industrial plan last week.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for Cooperation Between State, Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant
General Tin Oo has called for endeavors and cooperation between
the state and private sectors to bring about long-term and firm
economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a coordination meeting with private entrepreneurs here
Tuesday, Tin Oo, second secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, said only when there is increase in
production, especially agricultural production, will the social
sector and politics of the state develop proportionately.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the nation is to rely on external assistance
and copy ways and means of developed nations including those of
the West Bloc, the nation will lose its own national stand and
fall into a state of vassal which has no political and economic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that although Myanmar was once famous as a
granary of the Southeast Asia region, there were economic
uncertainties about paddy cultivation as priority was given to
local consumption, bringing about a marked decrease in the export
of rice.
</P>
<P>
He cited the average tonnage of annual rice export which was
just at six figures then.
</P>
<P>
After the market-oriented economic system was introduced in
late 1988, he said, the cultivation and production of paddy
increased and over 16 million tons of paddy can be produced
annually, while controlling the export of rice for the sake of
local consumption.
</P>
<P>
Continued efforts are being made to meet the target of
producing 20 million tons of paddy annually with 2 tons per acre
(4.93 tons per hectare) yield, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's paddy production in
the 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March, was registered at
17.3 million tons, of which only 28,300 tons of rice were
exported. The rice export figures for the first six months of this
year were 17,600 tons.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Bank in Phnom Penh to Close US Dollar Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bangkok Bank is
downsizing its Phnom Penh Branch by closing all of its U.S. dollar
accounts by the end of this month, it was learned here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to close the U.S. dollar accounts, which total
more than 1,000, was made in September due to economic crisis in
the region and the political risk in Cambodia, according to branch
manager Thewakun Chanakun.
</P>
<P>
The Thai-owned Bangkok Bank branch, established in June 1992,
also plans to cut its staff by 40 percent, laying off 10 local
employees and sending back to Thailand three expatriate staff
members.
</P>
<P>
The manager said the bank has a very high cost to manage the
U.S. dollar cash in Cambodia since the bank has to pay interest
rate, take risk from unstable currency exchange and rampage of
fake banknotes in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to manage cash during hard times,
politically and economically," he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Brazilian President Justifies Austerity Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso appeared on TV Tuesday night to justify an
austerity program approved by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
In his first TV appearance since his re-election on October 4,
Cardoso said that the spending cuts and tax increase were
necessary to slash the country's 65 billion U.S. dollar deficit.
</P>
<P>
He said the 1999 budget would be reduced by 7.9 billion
dollars, pledging the cut would not affect farmers, exporters and
the capital goods sector.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said that he would also ask the congress to reduce the
federal government's anti-poverty programs which he described as
"unjust".
</P>
<P>
The programs at a staggering cost of 16 billion dollars a year
benefited only about 900,000 people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso also announced tax hikes and interest rates cut of
between 19 and 49.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Cardoso's economic team and the IMF have tried
to work out ways to slash the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is a victim of the financial crisis that began last year
in Asia and later shifted to Russia before moving here. In the
past two months, investors have withdrawn about 25 billion dollars
from the country.

<HEADLINE> Dentist Team Offers Health Care in Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen years ago, a team of
10 dentists went to poverty-stricken villages in the mountains of
Wuyi County in east China's Zhejiang Province to perform medical
examinations as well as necessary interventions.
</P>
<P>
They also spread knowledge on oral health among children and
the young people.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese, especially those from remote areas, rarely know know
to protect their teeth," said He Dewen, a dentist and leader of
the team, quoted by the China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
He is also director of the Center of Oral Health in the county.
</P>
<P>
The activity gave inspiration to a one-year national campaign
to improve oral health in remote areas throughout China.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, named after the famous Long March, was initiated
jointly by the Ministry of Health, and the National Committee for
Oral Health in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
From September last year to this October, the campaign
organized six groups of experts to help the poorest regions in 12
provinces across China. The campaign has benefited millions of
people living in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 130 pieces of dental care equipment has been
delivered to these counties for free, said Bian Jinyou,
vice-director of the National Committee for Oral Health.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey shows that over 85 percent of the population
in the targeted counties is now aware of the importance and basic
methods of dental care.

<HEADLINE> No Food Supply Problem in Myanmar: Says Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant
General Khin Nyunt said Tuesday that there will be no food supply
problem in the country as plans are being laid down on the
national scale to ensure significant growth in agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with members of local authorities at the Central
Command Headquarters in Mandalay, Khin Nyunt, first secretary of
the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, said such efforts
are also being made to provide humanitarian assistance to some
Southeast Asian nations which are facing food problems.
</P>
<P>
Most of the states and divisions in Myanmar can now produce
sufficient rice as the government has transformed vacant and
virgin lands into cultivated areas and extended farming with added
momentum, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the 1997-98 fiscal year
which ended in March, fallow land in Myanmar came to 1.1 million
hectares and cultivable wasteland 7.89 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
The country expanded cultivated land with sown area under crops
reaching 12.51 million hectares in the year, 189,540 hectares more
than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's paddy production in the 1997-98 was registered at
17.3 million tons, of which 28,300 tons of rice were exported. The
rice export figures for the first six months of this year were
17,600 tons.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture, accounting for 36 percent of the gross
domestic product and 35 percent of the export in value, grew by
2.9 percent in output value in the fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Two Feared Dead in Furniture Store Blaze in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Two people were feared dead
Tuesday evening in a major fire in one of Beijing's largest
furniture and decorating materials markets, reports today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Two men entered the furniture hall when the fire began to
burn, but we must fear the worst since they have not yet
reemerged," said an official with Juran Zhijia (Comfortable Home)
Furniture City, located on the Fourth Ring Road in Chaoyang
District, quoted by the paper.
</P>
<P>
A policeman confirmed that at least one person had died.
</P>
<P>
The devastating blaze in the furniture market, the second
largest after the fire that gutted Yuquanying Furniture City in
May this year, started at 7:20 pm and was eventually put out at
10:30 pm, according to a fireman.
</P>
<P>
Half of the first and second floors were destroyed by the fire.
</P>
<P>
Policemen gave no indication of the cause of the fire, saying
it was under investigation. But, Sheng Wenlian, a vendor in the
hall, said the probable cause was electric welding.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said her store inside the hall was destroyed in the
blaze, resulting in losses of nearly 100,000 yuan (12,048 US
dollars).

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Prices Continue to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The average price of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' seven crudes
plunged to 11.72 U.S. dollars per barrel last week, 24 U.S. cents
lower than the previous week, the Vienna-based OPEC Secretariat
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed the average oil price in September dropped to
12.91 dollars per barrel, while that of last year was 18.68
dollars per barrel. The organization has set the benchmark price
of oil per barrel at 21 dollars.
</P>
<P>
OPEC had expected an obvious price rise in the world crude
market in October, but no miracle had taken place ever since.
</P>
<P>
This year a number of countries have witnessed economic
depression or financial crisis, which resulted in a cut in their
domestic demand of crudes.
</P>
<P>
Some oil exporting countries have attempted to increase oil
exports to offset the loss in revenues.
</P>
<P>
Although OPEC had twice made decisions on limiting oil output
of its member states this year, the efforts failed to stablize the
oil market and pop up the prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has approved a funding of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars for a
national conservation program to protect wild life in Sri Lanka,
according to Wildlife Department sources here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seven year program to be launched by the Wildlife
Department aims at promoting conservation activities through the
involvement of communities living in the vicinity of the country's
wild life parks and sanctuaries, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A special feature of the program is the introduction of
projects to uplift the living standards of people in these
vicinities and the launching of various programs to increase their
incomes, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
This would eliminate their dependence on resources within the
parks and reduce threats posed to the wild life in these parks and
 sanctuaries, said the sources, adding that projects will also be
identified depending on the various need of these communities.

<HEADLINE> Crime Jump Spurs New Police Plan in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing vehicle owners can rest
a bit easier, say police who are stepping up efforts against
property crimes, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The city's branch of the Public Security Bureau is increasing
its centralized co-ordination and keeping its eyes when the sun
goes down, a senior police official said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"We will not only enforce our night patrolling and set up
all-year-long check points, but also carry on joint actions among
districts and counties, instead of separate ones," said Ruan
Zengyi, deputy-director of Beijing Public Security Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He went on to explain that because most crimes occurred at
night, check-points were efficient in holding back criminals on
the run, and separate actions of any district or county only
chased criminals from one part of the capital to another.
</P>
<P>
Ruan made this remark in a report to the Beijing Municipal
People's Political Consultative Conference as a part of the
bureau's campaign starting this year to solicit people's
supervision of their work.
</P>
<P>
The capital has seen more than 6,000 break-ins, robberies and
burglaries this year, most of which happened at intersections, on
overpasses, below underpasses, or among the residential buildings
where the city's urban area joins its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
A new trend in the city is vehicle theft.
</P>
<P>
Admitting the bureau has not filed all these cases for
investigation and prosecution, Ruan said these types of cases
increased from 2,300 in 1996 to this year's 3,700, a record high.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Lake Facing Serious Environment Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Dianchi, a famous freshwater
lake in southwest China's Yunnan Province, has shrunk by 14 square
kilometers over the past ten years and is under the threat of
serious pollution, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Villagers of Long Men village in the Xishan district of the
provincial capital Kunming have reclaimed about 3.2 hectares of
land around the lake in the past several years, the paper said,
quoting an official of the Dianchi Protection Office.
</P>
<P>
On October 19, two reporters from Yunnan Television Station,
who were working on a story about illegal land reclamation, were
beaten by the villagers in Long Men.
</P>
<P>
The protection office said the city government promulgated the
Dianchi Protection Rules in 1988. But many residents around the
lake ignore the rules and have reclaimed the shores and sold them
to business people who have set up various restaurants and hotels.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 hotels, holiday resorts and other entertainment places
have been set up on the shore of the lake, dumping polluted water
and rubbish into the lake.
</P>
<P>
People from Jinning County near the lake are blowing up rocks
on the lake shore. A lot of broken stones and silt are being
dumped into the lake, disrupting its natural flow of water.
</P>
<P>
A lot of garbage was piled in Hewei village on the eastern bank
of the lake, then thrown into the lake.
</P>
<P>
Some departments governing shipping management at Dianchi
issued sailing licenses without restraint, and now over 300
motor-driven ships carry visitors around the lake. Oil in the fuel
tanks of these ships often leaks into the water, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan provincial government and Kunming city government
have invested over 600 million U.S. dollars to tackle the problems
at Dianchi.

In recently years, the two have increased high-level exchanges
and a series of documents signed by their leaders are now yielding
fruits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Malofeyev, speaker of the National Assembly of
Belarussian House of Representatives (Lower House), said the two
countries share identical views in major international issues and
have always supported each other in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Since China is certain to play an important role in the 21st
century, it is of great importance for Belarus to develop
relations with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the current level of business transaction
between the two countries stays low, amounting to only three
percent of Belarus' total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Saying the two countries are in good position to cooperate and
have huge potential to tap, Malofeyev hopes both sides can further
enhance cooperation in machinery making, science and technology
and military production. He welcomed Chinese entrepreneurs to
invest in Belarus.

<HEADLINE> Romania Again Voices Wish to Join EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu reiterated here Tuesday his country's wish to join
the European Union (EU) and expressed his hope that Romania would
have Finland's support in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Tuesday evening, the Romanian
president stressed that his country has greatly improved its ties
with neighboring countries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that Ukraine and Russia do not oppose
Romania's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) as much as they used to do demonstrated Bucharest's
improved relations with its neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
Romania is seeking to join NATO because it wants to have a
greater guarantee of security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu arrived here earlier on Tuesday on a two-day
official visit at the invitation of Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari. This is the first ever visit to Finland by a Romanian
president in 71 years.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that during their talks, the two
presidents exchanged views on bilateral relations, the enlargement
of the EU, which now has 15 member nations, the security of
Europe, the situation in the Balkan region, and other wide-ranging
issues.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to make further efforts to promote bilateral trade
and economic cooperation, the sources said. In 1997, trade between
the two countries reached a record high of 190 million Finnish
markkas (about 38 million U.S. dollars)
</P>
<P>
The sources said Finland has promised to support Romania's bid
to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen had
talks with her Romanian counterpart Andrei Plesu on issues of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two countries signed an agreement on avoidance
of double taxation.

<P>
WUHAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Qingjiang River, one of the
tributaries of the Yangtze River in the middle reaches, was dammed
on Monday to facilitate second stage construction of the Gaobazhou
Hydropower Station.
</P>
<P>
Gaobazhou, the last power station along the main channel of the

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Urged to Continue Exporting Tea to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Commerce Minister
Kingsley T. Wickremaratne has urged the country's tea industry to
continue tea exports to Russia, according to the official Daily
News Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Russia accounts for 25 percent of Sri Lanka's tea exports but
due to the financial crisis in Russia and its inability to settle
accounts, Sri Lanka's tea exports were temporarily suspended
recently.
</P>
<P>
Wickremaratne told the paper that if Sri Lanka halted tea
exports to Russia, she will be losing that market for ever as
other tea exporting countries like Kenya, India and Indonesia are
waiting to break into the market.
</P>
<P>
He said it augurs well for Sri Lanka that Russia, which has
banned a large number of imports into that country in the wake of
its financial crisis, has not banned the import of Sri Lanka's
teas.
</P>
<P>
The minister believes that the Russian monetary crisis was a
temporary one and would blow over soon. Even the Russian
ambassador had assured him that the importers of his country would
honor their financial commitments, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Russia bought 27.6 million kilograms of tea from Sri Lanka for
the first quarter of this year. The Russian crisis commenced in
around August from which month Sri Lanka's tea exports to that
country had slowed down.

<HEADLINE> Experts View Central America Major Route for Drug Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Experts and officials from
23 North and South American countries warned on Tuesday that
Central America has become a major route for rings smuggling tons
of cocaine to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
As U.S. anti-drug leader Barry McCaffrey visited Mexico to
prepare a high-level anti-narcotics meeting, a report released
here by the Inter-American Drug Control Commission said Colombian
cocaine was the main product being smuggled north.
</P>
<P>
Commission members said that Central America had changed from a
mere transit zone for cocaine sold in the U.S. to a drug users'
region, due to the traffickers' practice of paying go-betweens
with drugs instead of money.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said Monday in Mexico City that the U.S. government
had spent three billion dollars this year to try to reduce drug
use in the world's largest market.
</P>
<P>
He said drug lords were changing their routes, abandoning cargo
flights and shipping cocaine by sea instead.
</P>
<P>
The experts, who are meeting behind closed doors here, said the
smugglers were using international waters to ship drugs to
U.S. territories in the Caribbean, especially Puerto Rico, to
evade anti-drug police.
</P>
<P>
They said smugglers are now increasingly using yachts, cargo
ships, fishing boats and even cruise ships to smuggle cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the attorney general's office in Mexico announced
Tuesday that it had seized more than 20 tons of drugs this
year.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Certificate Rate Expected to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril
Sabirin Tuesday said the SBI (Bank Indonesia Certificate) rate is
expected to fall further next week, national newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The SBI rate has been falling gradually from 70 percent to 58
percent, and it is seen falling again next week," Sabirin told
reporters following a meeting with President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed optimism that the rupiah rate against the
U.S. dollar will remain to stay at least at the current level in
the coming weeks, although the nation is nearing a crucial week
before the special session of the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR).
</P>
<P>
The country is scheduled to hold a special session of the MPR,
the country's top policy-making body, from November 10 to 13 to
set the date for next year's general election and adopt other
measures to accelerate the democratization process.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin explained that various factors, including politics,
would continue to cause fluctuations in the exchange rate against
the U.S. dollar, but the increasing credibility of the
government's economic reform program and signs of improvement in
the economy would offset any negative factors.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has appreciated by about 40 percent since late last
month. The currency remained flat at 7,400 rupiah to the U.S.
dollar Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin said last week that the rupiah could strengthen to
between 6,000 and 6,500 rupiah by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The government had earlier targeted the currency to be at
10,000 rupiah by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin stressed that Bank Indonesia has no intention of
applying the intervention band, as the current system is working
effectively and the rupiah continues to strengthen against the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
He however added that the central bank was studying various
alternatives to the current free float system.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the central bank announced Tuesday that Indonesia's
net international reserves increased by 64.9 million U.S. dollars
to 13.9 billion U.S. dollars in the week ending October 23 from
13.8 billion U.S. dollars in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The increase resulted from foreign loan disbursements and
foreign exchange revenue from the export of oil and natural gas,
the central bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that the reserve level was above the 11.67 billion
U.S. dollars minimum level set by the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Cuts Key Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of the Czech
Republic will lower key interest rates in the financial market
starting Tuesday, central banker Josef Tosovsky said.
</P>
<P>
The discount rate for commercial banks will be lowered from
11.5 percent to 10 percent, Tosovsky said.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates for bi-weekly, short-term loans will be cut from
13.5 percent to 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A one-point cut will also be made on the lombard, or
fixed-termed advance rate, from 16 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cut, the fifth this year, will be made to further ease the
country's stringent monetary policies, which have resulted in a
short supply of credit and funds for businesses, as well as
sagging production and exports.
</P>
<P>
The four previous cuts have brought down interest rates by a
total of 2.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The interest-cut measures have been deemed effective in
controlling the country's inflation, which was 8.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that in order to spur effective economic
growth, the country will consider relaxing the money market and
further lowering interest rates at the appropriate time.

<HEADLINE> Spain Launches Environmental Debt Program in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Spain is promoting in
Panama and other Latin American countries a sustainable
development project funded on a debt for environment swap program.
</P>
<P>
The director of Spain's Latin American cooperation office,
Jesus de Gracia, said on Tuesday that under the project, dubbed
"Araucaria", debtor countries would only have to repay part of
their debt to Spain in hard currency, using the rest to fund
environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
"The whole debt cannot be swapped, due to the fact that when
the government and Spanish (bankers) make a loan they expect it to
be repaid, so 'Araucaria' is limited," Jesus de Gracia said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the debt for environment swap program could be
studied on a case-by-case basis for special projects, but that it
could not cover the total debts of Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
De Gracia said that the Spanish government had created a
70-million-dollar-fund with a five-year grace period for the
program managed by its international cooperation offices.
</P>
<P>
He said the program will allow debtor countries to create their
own fund in local currency for environmental development projects
to raise living standards for their populations.
</P>
<P>
Panama is using the program for an ecological tourism
development program on the Pacific island of Coiba - previously a
prison center. Other regions benefiting from the program include
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.

TEGUCIGALPA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Mitch sent heavy

<HEADLINE> NBA Players, Owners Studying Hybrid Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So far, the situation started to turn hopeful, at least
heading to a compromise.
</P>
<P>
Each side made a case for its position in the labor dispute
and presented models and projections for what could happen 3-5
years down the road.
</P>
<P>
The owners backed off their insistence on having a hard salary
cap. "We need a system that eventually gets to where there's a
set percentage for the players and a set percentage for the
owners," deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. "I don't think it
has to be a hard cap, and in fact some of the things we're
talking about now are not hard cap."
</P>
<P>
The owners' shift in position was downplayed by the union, but
some agents still think it is a good sign.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing is we have some sort of an agreement on basic
principles," said Danny Schayes, a member of the union's
negotiating team. "Right now, we're talking about a hybrid
system. The first couple of years it would work one way, for
another couple of years it would work another way if the first
way didn't work. At least we're finding some common ground."
</P>
<P>
The sides agreed to meet through the week.
</P>
<P>
The league was asking to operate under a luxury tax system for
the next three seasons, with a fallback system of a harder salary
cap for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The union was asking for a tax system lasting two years, with
the fallback system lasting another two years, Schayes said.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of absolute cost certainty, there would be mechanisms
that give the owners a very good shot at costs within a certain
range. So it's a good compromise in that area," Schayes said.
</P>
<P>
The league's full board is expected to meet on Wednesday.
Union executive director Billy Hunter hopes to have the entire
membership meet with owners.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Commercial television operators have demanded tax breaks
worth up to 40 million Australian dollars (24.9 million U.S.
dollars) only six months after being delivered the boon of digital
broadcasting. Their demands threaten to delay the timetable for
the introduction of digital television due in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Sydney is not only seen as culturally unsophisticated and
technologically backward but the air is heavily polluted and the
transport system is crumbling. Sydneysiders hate public transport
and depend more on their cars which makes the city's air pollution
worse than London and New York.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government has given its new tax consultative
committee a deadline of just over two weeks to review and report
on its proposed goods and services tax, a deadline denounced by
the opposition as "a disgrace".
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The banking sector's push for a 30 percent corporate tax
rate has been given fresh impetus with the appointment Tuesday of
Westpac Banking Group's chief executive Bob Joss to the Howard
government's high-level review of business taxation.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Beef Up Bank Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government may
draw 2 billion U.S. dollars from the 30 billion dollar Miyazawa
plan to beef up bank capital.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Bulletin newspaper reported Wednesday that the
government will use the loan to infuse additional capital in the
state-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB), Land Bank of the
Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced in
Washington early this month the 30 billion dollar allocation to
the economies severely hit by the Asian financial crisis to help
them recover fast.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to use some of the proceeds of the loan as capital
enhancement for Land Bank, DBP and PNB," Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the amount of capital infusion to the three
government financial institutions is still under study.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: NATO's Next Move From Ultimatum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- NATO faces as tough a test as
does Belgrade when the clock ticks toward the final hours of the
ultimatum, already extended for a 10-more-day grace period,
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO decision makers, due to meet later Tuesday, are faced with
the option of whether or not delivering on the air strike first
a*
 two
officers reached an agreement with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Momcilo Perisic.
</P>
<P>
Cook said, "If he (the Yugoslav president) keeps to this
agreement, then that will certainly be a significant advance."
</P>
<P>
Reports of massive withdrawal of troops and police units came
in the last two days while member countries of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe were busy grouping the
2,000-member verification mission, of which the advance team
already reached Kosovo, and international humanitarian
organizations were hurrying relief materials to the home-returning
refugees and those still remaining in makeshift shelters in the
open with winter fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
Less likely it is therefore for NATO now to punctuate the
compliance that is now developing or the humanitarian relief work
so essential to the refugees, both the foundations for NATO's
activation order without a mandate via United Nations Security
Council Resolutions (UNSCRs).
</P>
<P>
NATO pronounced that it was resorting to military intervention
to force Belgrade to comply fully with UNSCRs in a verifiable
manner, so it should not be completely out-of-expectation that
NATO chooses to allow still more time for compliance to develop
the way it explains fit.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary stressed Monday that possible
option of further extension of the ultimatum should not be seen as
a concession to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
But problem then arises as to when the next grace period comes
to its end.
</P>
<P>
NATO, therefore, is likely to alter its timed ultimatum to an
open-ended menace and the unlimited ultimatum gives the allies
more leeway to move both forward and back.
</P>
<P>
It is also less likely for NATO now to lift the activation
order, for that will tarnish its image in the increasingly
face-saving tussle and influence otherwise on its crisis
management strategy still in the make.
</P>
<P>
What NATO is reluctant to do is to take back the words it has
uttered without their having taken any measurable effect and what
it likes has got to be a move that maneuvers the Western military
alliance to a foot-hold that offers both comfort and confidence.

<HEADLINE> Country Parks in Eastern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Dawn or dusk, people in the
village of Yangjialou can be seen chatting, playing chess, or
strolling through a local park with tiny bridges, pavilions,
lawns, and pools.
</P>
<P>
These scenes have become common in the Chinese province of
Zhejiang, one of the most developed eastern coastal areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Villagers who are better-off now see the park as the place to
spend their leisure time.
</P>
<P>
"I used to think that strolling in a park was only the
privilege of urbanites," said Jin Atu, a local man who is in his
60s and who now spends much of his time in a nearby park.
</P>
<P>
For farmers, parks are as important as roads and bridges, says
a local government official, because they are a way to improve
villagers' standard of living and change their lifestyle, and many
places in the province have built or are planning to build parks.
</P>
<P>
"With a park, my village is more like a city now." said Hu
Yinjuan, who was walking in a 6.7-hectare park in the town of
Qixian.
</P>
<P>
One of the advantages of having a park, according to Lou
Baozhong in the village of Yangjialou, is to have a place for
farmers to go when they are freed from the day's farm work.
</P>
<P>
A village is different from city, he explains, because normally
a village has no commercial or other colorful street to walk
along, so, in the past, they used to have nothing to do but work
in the fields or kill time by chatting with neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Parks also help introduce a healthier life and may also do
something more - bring in tourists.
</P>
<P>
One park in the village of Minzhu has 300,000 tourists this
year, 80 percent of them from neighboring villages.
</P>
<P>
"We have spent 3.5 million yuan on the park and now we are
going to spend five million yuan next year to improve it," said
the park manager.

<HEADLINE> Research Details Software Industry's Economic Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A report released Tuesday
said that the software industry has generated more 619,000 jobs
and 7.2 billion U.S. dollars in tax revenues in the United States
over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the industry racked up total sales of 135.4 billion
dollars last year, said the report released by the Business
Software Alliance (BSA), the voice of the world's leading software
developers.
</P>
<P>
The report, Contributions of the Packaged Software Industry to
the Global Economy, was conducted by the U.S. market analysis firm
Pricewaterhouse Coopers. It provides further evidence that the
industry is one of the rapidly growing sectors of the world
economy and is driving job creation across the globe, the BSA
said.
</P>
<P>
"This new report confirms the fact that the software industry
has emerged as a powerful engine of economic growth both in the
United States and abroad," BSA president and CEO Robert Holleyman
said in a statement. "In addition, the industry is creating high
wage jobs all over the world. In the United States, software
industry workers enjoy more than twice the average level of wages
earned by other workers in the economy."
</P>
<P>
Software industry revenues outside the United States alone will
reach 116.9 billion dollars by 2001. Industry growth will yield an
additional more than 320,000 jobs by 2001, providing employment
for 1.06 million people outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
For the U.S. economy, direct employment in the software
industry will reach 1.03 million jobs by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that software piracy results in lost
government revenues. A key finding points out that successful
efforts to eliminate software piracy by 2005 could allow the
software industry to raise nearly 25 billion dollars in additional
government revenues worldwide. Between 1996 and 1997, the software
industry and supporting industries contributed over 28 billion
dollars in tax revenues to world governments. Of that, 7.2 billion
dollars was paid to U.S. federal, state and local governments.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Keep Out-Raising Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Republicans have
out-raised Democrats by roughly 92 million dollars, but both
parties are bringing in more money than they did for the last
mid-term election in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The record-setting figures were released Tuesday by the Federal
Election Commission (FEC) even though as an independent review of
campaign finances suggested that relatively few races are
competitive this election season.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that you don't really need it doesn't seem to reduce
the fervor with which they're trying to raise the money," said
Larry Mackinson, director of the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
Mackinson called it further evidence that big-money donors were
less concerned with helping to elect or defeat candidates than
they were about influencing policy in the new Congress that will
be sworn into office in January.
</P>
<P>
Democratic National Committee (DNC) co-chair Governor Roy Romer
said that President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and
Hillary Rodham Clinton attended nearly 200 fund-raisers for
individual candidates, 37 events for coordinated campaigns or
state parties, 60 more for the national committees, and 12 for
Unity '98. Clinton was attending two Unity '98 events expected to
raise 1.1 million dollars Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the FEC study, the most dramatic increase in
campaign money has come in unregulated "soft money" donations.
</P>
<P>
Republican committees had raised nearly 94 million dollars in
soft dollars as of October 14, a 144 percent increase over the
1994 elections. The Democrats had raised nearly 79 million
dollars, or 84 percent more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A DNC report Tuesday tied the Republicans' "Operation Breakout"
issues advocacy campaign, which would be largely funded with soft
money, to action by the Republican-controlled Congress to kill
tobacco legislation, health care, campaign finance reform, and a
minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
"It ought to have been called `Operation Sellout' because they
raised the campaign funds by killing four specific pieces of
legislation that were important to the American people," Romer
said.
</P>
<P>
But Tim Fitzpatrick, spokesman for the Republican National
Committee, said that the Democrats have relied on soft dollars for
a greater percentage of their overall contributions.
</P>
<P>
"They are much more reliant on large donations from special
interests like unions and liberal advocacy groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Democrats' reported receipts of nearly 186 million
dollars trailed the Republicans' 278 million dollars, but not for
want of trying. In addition to the rise in soft money, Democrats
raised 40 percent more "hard dollars" that can be spent directly
on candidates than they did in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Russia Asks for U.S. Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia has asked the United
States for significant quantities of food aid due to sharp drop in
its grain harvest and increased cost of imported food after the
rouble's devaluation, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is in our interest as a country to do our best to
accommodate their needs," Glickman told reporters. "But there are
still some things to be worked out relating to accountability to
make sure that whatever food we provide gets to people."
</P>
<P>
A U.S. team including Chris Goldthwait, the Department of
Agriculture's general sales manager, and two State Department
officials will leave Wednesday for Moscow to work out the details.
</P>
<P>
But it was not clear how much Russia asked for. Glickman said
it would be premature to talk about the size of a food package
before the team's report.
</P>
<P>
He refused to comment on a rumor in U.S. grain markets that a
U.S. aid package might include as much as 2 to 3 million tons of
wheat and 100,000 tons of pork, poultry and beef.
</P>
<P>
Goldthwait and other agriculture department officials met
Russian government representatives earlier this month to discuss
U.S. food assistance. But until Monday, the department had not
received a formal request for aid.
</P>
<P>
Russia expressed "the need for significant quantities of
grains, meat products, rice" in a letter to the USDA, Glickman
said. Russia is also asking other countries for help.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told
reporters the United States plans to work with the European Union
on food aid for Russia.

<HEADLINE> Oil Slips to Greet Cape Town Oil Ministers' Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices ended weak Tuesday as
traders expected the imminent OPEC gathering to offer little
prospect of extra output cuts.
</P>
<P>
International benchmark Brent shed early gains and was last
trading eight cents down at 12.96 U.S. dollars, more than six U.S.
dollars below last year's average.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before this week's Cape Town informal gathering of
ministers from about 50 major oil producing and consuming nations,
Saudi Arabia dampened expectations of further action to boost
prices with a for the export cartel to comply fully with 2.6
million barrels per day (bpd) of supply sacrifices already
promised.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, on arrival
for the meeting at Cape Town, said he did not expect OPEC
ministers to reach any decision on cutting oil production at the
oil conference, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, in a rare public statement, said
other OPEC nations were to blame for the sustained oil price
depression as they had failed to live up to agreements on supply
cuts.
</P>
<P>
"There were decisions by OPEC which would have maintained the
oil prices had everybody kept to them," Reuters quoted the Crown
Prince as saying in an interview with Saudi al-Riyadh newspaper.
"But unfortunately there are some brothers in OPEC who did not
abide by these decisions."

Market analysts said the Saudi warning appeared to all but
extinguish the prospects of any serious discussion in Cape Town of
further output reductions.
</P>
<P>
"If they're saying they haven't met their existing cuts it
doesn't make sense to me that they would cut further," said Mehdi
Varzi at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwait Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah
Tuesday vowed to support further production cuts on top of the
austerity measures pledged so far.
</P>
<P>
"There is too much oil in the market.... If it takes to improve
prices a cut in production, we are for it," Reuters quoted Sheikh
Saud as saying, as he prepared to head for Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Oil Minister Erwin Arrieta was likely to meet in
Cape Town with ministers from Saudi Arabia and Mexico, according
to Reuters. Those three engineered this year's producer cut
package.
</P>
<P>
The early price gains were underpinned by fears that powerful
Hurricane Mitch, currently prowling the coast of central America,
could disrupt oil output. In late September, Hurricane Georges
ravaged through the Caribbean Islands before pummeling oil
facilities in the Gulf of Mexico and the U.S. Gulf Coast.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Stresses Political Solution in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday underlined that the only lasting solution to the
cycle of violence in Sierra Leone was "a political one," the
president of the 15-member council, Jeremy Greenstock of the
United Kingdom, said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press here after the council's
closed-door consultations, Greenstock said the council members
"welcomed the resumption of political dialogue between the two
leaders and urged the governments to maintain that dialogue, and
implement the confidence-building measures that were agreed in
July."
</P>
<P>
The rebel activities near the border areas between Sierra Leone
and Liberia have given rise to increased tension between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council praised the work of the U.N. Observer
Mission in Sierra Leone, the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), the U.N. High Commission for Refugees and other
governments and agencies involved in the west African country,
Greenstock said.
</P>
<P>
The council members encouraged leaders of the two neighboring
African countries to use the opportunity of the ECOWAS summit in
Abuja, capital of Nigeria, this week to build confidence between
the two nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council called on member states in the
donor community to make further contributions to assist the
deployment of the west African peace-keepers, known as the ECOMOG,
in Sierra Leone, to support the government's disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration program, and to address the
humanitarian needs of the country, he added.

WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers from BC
International Corporation and the University of Florida, use
genetically engineered bacteria to make ethanol, a fuel for
vehicles, from agricultural wastes, said a report from the New

They said grape vine waste, corn stalks, rice hulls, waste
paper, tree trimmings and yard waste could be used as row material

BC International Corporation will build a plant in Jennings,
Louisiana, to produce ethanol in a big-scale and commercial way.
The plant will run on bagasse, a part of the sugar cane plant
usually considered useless as well as rice hulls, a currently
useless part of the rice plant.
</P>

The "bio-refinery", the report said, will turn cellulose in
the waste into sugar and then into ethanol by genetically

<HEADLINE> Albright Says NATO Still Could Use Force Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Tuesday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would
move quickly to use force against Yugoslavia if its forces are
back to Kosovo to fight ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made the statements
at a special briefing on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO allies were preparing to assemble a rapid-reaction force
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to be ready to
intervene if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic sent troops
against civilians again, said Albright.
</P>
<P>
It would not take long to persuade the allies to renew their
threat to attack Serb positions since all of them were pretty much
in agreement Milosevic could not be permitted to menace civilians
again, she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright said sending in a rapid-deployment would require
Macedonia's approval. "Its purpose will be to ensure that alliance
forces are on call to respond if needed," she added.
</P>
<P>
The secretary stressed that NATO had not suspended its threat
to use force, but rather did not act on the threat now.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, meanwhile, talked by telephone with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other allied leaders about
the need "to keep Milosevic's feet to the fire as we assess his
compliance and his willingness to stay in compliance," a U.S.
official said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was briefed by Sandy Berger, his assistant for national
security, on Milosevic's actions.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Milosevic's withdrawal of troops and police
"should result in a safer and more secure climate" for refugees to
return to their homes, and that many had already.
</P>
<P>
"The result, if all goes well, will be the prevention of
further humanitarian catastrophe," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright said, a political crisis remained, that alone
could be resolved in negotiations between the Serbs and ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians are seeking independence from Yugoslavia
while the Clinton administration supports more autonomy is given
to the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"Not even NATO military force can resolve the tensions,
rivalries and disagreements that are at the heart of the problems
of Kosovo," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
To help negotiations, she said, the United States had sent "a
clear message" to leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army not to
attempt to take military advantage of the Serb pullback.
</P>
<P>
"Neither side can achieve a military victory in Kosovo,"
Albright said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Bill to Boost Preschool Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Tuesday signed a legislation under which a greater portion of
federal Head Start program spending will be used to boost preschool
quality.
</P>
<P>
The new law allows 60 percent of new money appropriated to Head
Start would go to improving quality in the program that prepares
children from low-income families to start school.
</P>
<P>
Previous rules directed 75 percent of any new Head Start funds
to adding more children while 25 percent was used to improve
quality.
</P>
<P>
About 800,000 children now receive benefits from the preschool
program, which is newly authorized for 35 billion dollars over
five years.
</P>
<P>
The measure also expands Early Head Start, which provides
services for children up to age 3 and their families.
</P>
<P>
The package bill also creates a five-year test program allowing
some 50,000 low-income families to save for a first home, college,
or business start-up.
</P>
<P>
The act also authorizes some two billion dollars a year for the
Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, which provides aid to an
estimated 4.3 million families.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Health Sector Development in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday
approved an interest-free credit of 100 million U.S. dollars to
support the first five-year phase of Ethiopia's 20-year health
sector development program.
</P>
<P>
The major objective of the program is to improve health
services and extend their coverage to a larger number of
Ethiopians. The program is designed to develop a system to deliver
comprehensive and integrated primary health care services to
communities, with a focus on reaching rural and other under-served
groups, especially women.
</P>
<P>
The program includes the construction and rehabilitation of
more than 400 health centers and hospitals, the training of health
care workers and administrators, public information and outreach
as well as decentralization of the health care sector.
</P>
<P>
During fiscal 1998 ending June 30 this year, Ethiopia was the
largest African borrower from the World Bank, and also among the
top 10 borrowers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The bank committed 669 million dollars to the East African
country for projects to meet other basic development priorities,
which include 309 million dollars for roads, 200 million dollars
for the energy sector, 100 million dollars for education and 60
million dollars for agricultural research and training.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Surge on Rate Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A stronger dollar, sharply
firmer shares on Wall Street and hopes of more credit easing after
Italy slashed a full percentage point off its discount rate
overnight bolstered stocks across Europe on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
European markets remained optimistic amid hopes of lower German
and French interest rates. On Monday, the Bank of Italy slashed
its discount rate by a full point to 4 percent as part of the
convergence process of rates in the future euro zone.
</P>
<P>
But there were no signs on Monday to confirm the idea that the
French and German central banks might lower rates and operators
remained cautious.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, bourse rocketed ahead as the Cac 40 index finished up
2.94 percent at 3,550.75 points. The booming performance surprised
many operators, who had expressed pessimism before the market
opening as to whether the Cac 40 index could get back above 3,520
points and stay there.
</P>
<P>
The index opened with a 1.86 percent jump to 3,513.47 points,
and after marking time there for a while, it zipped on up in late
morning through the 3,520-point level.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's Xetra DAX closes more than two percent
up, but couldn't break through resistance at 4,700. Firm dollar,
strong Wall Street open helped index hold on to early gains. The
DAX-30 index closed at 4682.45 points, up 104.71 or 2.29 percent.
In later screen-based trade the Xetra DAX index ended at 4682.7
points, up 103.06 or 2.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 rises 99.7 points or 1.91 percent to
the highest close in seven weeks, as European bourses benefit from
interest rate hopes and Wall Street pushes higher. Dow rose some
40 points at London close. The FTSE 100 closed at 5331.2 points.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: NATO Keeps Vigilant on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday welcomed the withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo but said
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would remain
vigilant to ensure Belgrade fully complied with U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
"This is a chance, not a guarantee," Clinton said at a White
House event in which he warned Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic he must "stay in compliance" with the rules spelled out
by the international community.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. defense official, who tracked the events in
Yugoslavia over the past months, told reporters that Serbia is
withdrawing troops and cooperating with the monitors.
</P>
<P>
"I would be pleased to say today that we see substantial and
significant movement by the army and the police, both from Kosovo
to Serbia proper, where they're required to do so, and back into
garrison, especially for the armored and mechanized units of the
Pristina corps in Kosovo," said the official.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, our attach's and also the Kosovo Diplomatic
Observer Mission report significant cooperation by the Serbs
today, as they've been able to inspect these units, as they
departed their field deployment areas and moved back into
garrisons," added the official.
</P>
<P>
The official, who declined to be named, said the cease-fire in
the region "is generally holding."
</P>
<P>
"We also have indications that the Serbian air defense forces
are beginning to come back into their garrisons, as required by
NATO. That's not complete yet, of course, but there is some
significant movement in that direction," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, State Secretary Madeleine Albright said NATO allies
were preparing to assemble a rapid-reaction force in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to be ready to intervene if
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic sends troops against
civilians again.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes Plan for Breaking W. Sahara Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.
secretary-general, Kofi Annan, on Tuesday proposed a green light
to voter registration of members of three Western Sahara tribal
groups involved in a dispute that has held up a referendum on the
the future of the territory.
</P>
<P>
The referendum is to decide whether Western Sahara should be
incorporated into Morocco, which controls most of the former
Spanish colony, or become independent, as sought by the Polisario
Front, whose base camps are in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The vote was originally set for January 1992, following a
U.N.-monitored ceasefire that went into effect in September 1991.
But the referendum has been repeatedly delayed because of
differences between Morocco and Polisario over who should be
eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
Annan reported in September that voter registration, as part of
a U.N. peace plan, had been completed and more than 147,000
applicants identified. Still unresolved was the eligibility of
some 65,000 members of three disputed tribal groupings.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to consider Annan's
report on Wednesday morning, Jeremy Greenstock, president of the
15-member council, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Morocco maintained that all members of those groups had a right
to be identified to determine their eligibility to vote. However,
Polisario said none had that right except for those listed in a
1974 Spanish census of the territory, and their immediate
families.
</P>
<P>
To break the deadlock, Annan said in his latest report: "I have
decided to present my own arbitration in order to move ahead on
this issue,"
</P>
<P>
"In order to avoid taking any arbitrary decision which might
lead to the exclusion of persons who are eligible to vote
... I see no other alternative than to ask the Identification
Commission to proceed now to consider requests from any applicants
from the tribal groupings in question who wish to present
themselves individually, in order to verify whether they have the
right to vote," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the possibility of holding the referendum in
December 1999 -- a year later than the most recent target date of
December 7 this year.
</P>
<P>
Annan said a U.N. delegation which recently visited the area
submitted documents to Morocco and Polisario regarding the
identification of individuals from the disputed groups and an
outline of the next stage in the U.N. plan.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general, who will visit the region next month,
said final agreement of the two parties would be needed by
mid-November so that the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), Sadako Ogata of Japan, could prepare to receive refugees
wishing to return to Western Sahara. Voter identification of
members of the disputed groups could begin on December 1.
</P>
<P>
Annan recommended extending until April 30, 1999, the mandate
of the 470-member U.N. Mission for the Referendum in Western
Sahara (MINURSO), which has been stationed in the territory for
the past seven years. Its current mandate expires on October 31.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he would make recommendations to the Security
Council in December for strengthening the force, to carry out
additional duties leading up to the planned referendum.

<HEADLINE> Kinshasa Deals With Rwanda, Uganda, Not Rebels: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister of Democratic
Congo Jean Charles Okoto said here Tuesday that his government
only deals with Rwanda and Uganda instead of the rebels fighting
to topple President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by the Congolese minister when he
gave a news briefing Tuesday afternoon during the intervals of a
regional ministerial meeting held here from October 26 to 27,
during which a draft cease-fire was adopted in principle to end
the Congo (K) crisis.
</P>
<P>
When asked by Xinhua whether any cease-fire on the crisis
would be meaningful without direct negotiations with the rebels,
Okoto said if the rebels wanted to come to power they should do
it through elections since President Kabila had set an agenda for
democratization in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said at present the Congolese government only wanted to
negotiate with Rwanda and Uganda, accusing them of invading to
back the rebels and urged the two countries to withdraw their
forces from Congo (K) immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We are negotiating with the aggressors, namely Rwanda and
Uganda. Right now we can not even talk about the rebels because
there is no rebel in Congo," said the minister, adding, "we need
them to leave our country immediately."
</P>
<P>
However, Bizima Karaha, a former Congolese foreign minister,
who led the rebel delegation but was denied access to the
meeting, declared that unless the Congolese government sat down
and talked with the rebels, there would be no solution to the
Congo (K) crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The Congolese problem must be resolved by the Congolese
people themselves," he told reporter outside the meeting venue
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
As regard to the troops sent by Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola,
Okoto said people could not treat them equally with the troops
from Rwanda and Uganda. He explained that those troops fighting
to help Kabila were "invited" by the Congolese government as
their "guests".
</P>
<P>
But at the meeting, Rwanda firmly denied all the Kinshasa
accusations, saying that up till now it has never admitted any
military presence in Congo (K). While Uganda, who claimed to have
security interests in the eastern part of Congo (K), said its
forces were sent sthere to check its rebels aiming to topple the
Kampala government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released at the end of the Lusaka ministerial
meeting, Ugandan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Amama
Mbabazi expressed Ugandan government's position on the Congo (K)
crisis that all foreign forces should leave that country.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that all foreign troops should leave the DRC. The
withdrawal should be done after a cease-fire and when neutral
multi-national forces have taken up positions in the DRC to
supervise strict observance of the cease-fire and ensure security
of the neighboring countries," Mbabazi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the problem in Congo (K) was essentially
"political" and therefore required a political settlement between
Kabila's government and the entire Congolese opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka ministerial meeting attracted more than 130
delegates including foreign and defense ministers from 14 African
countries, in particular, those key players such as Zimbabwe,
Namibia, Angola, Congo (K), Uganda and Rwanda.
